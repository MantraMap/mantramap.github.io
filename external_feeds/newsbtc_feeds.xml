					<description><![CDATA[Data shows that Litecoin whales have deposited a large amount of the asset to exchanges during the past day, a sign that may be bearish for LTC. Litecoin Whales Have Made Significant Exchange Inflows In 24 Hours According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, several large transfers have taken place on the LTC blockchain during the past day. In total, there have been four such transactions, with the largest of them involving the movement of 500,000 LTC (around $46 million at the time the transfer went through). While the other three interestingly all saw the same number of tokens moving on the network: 78,760 LTC (the USD price fluctuated between each of these transactions, but on average, the stacks were worth $7.2 million at the time of movement). As all these transactions are so large, it&#8217;s possible that whale entities were behind them. The whales are generally influential beings in the market, as they hold very large amounts in their wallets. Thus, their movements are usually something to look out for, as they may precede volatility in the price. Naturally, how the price may be influenced by these humongous investors&#8217; transfers depends on what exactly they wanted to achieve with said transactions. Here are some additional details regarding the largest of today&#8217;s transfers, which may help shed some light on the context surrounding it: Looks like this LTC transfer required a negligible fee to go through &#124; Source: Whale Alert As you can see above, the sending address in the case of this Litecoin transfer was an unknown wallet, meaning that it was unattached to any known centralized platform. Such addresses are usually investors&#8217; personal wallets. The receiving address, on the other hand, was connected to a centralized platform: the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Transfers like this where coins move from self-custodial wallets to exchanges are called &#8220;exchange inflows.&#8221; Usually, one of the major reasons why holders may deposit their coins to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, so exchange inflows can have bearish effects on the price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Selling Again, Will Price Crash Again? It&#8217;s possible that the whale here also made this deposit with a similar intention. Naturally, if it&#8217;s truly the case, the price could feel visible negative effects from it, considering the scale of the transaction. As for the other three transactions that were all of the exact same scale, two of these transfers were inflows similar to this one, while the remaining one was an outflow. Two of these transfers (both inflows) shared the same sending and receiving addresses, making it likely that the same whale might have been behind the deposits. The outflow&#8217;s receiving address doesn&#8217;t match any of the transactions from today, so it&#8217;s unknown if it&#8217;s related to them. However, it involves the exact same number of coins as the two inflows, so it raises suspicion that the same whale entity may have been behind it after all.

In any case, one reality continues to stand: there were total net inflows of $53.2 million in the last 24 hours, which can act as a source of significant selling pressure in the market for the cryptocurrency.

					<description><![CDATA[XRP, the native token of the Ripple network, has reportedly surpassed Bitcoin in trading volume on the weekly average. The digital asset, following a significant legal win last week, now claims 21% of all cryptocurrency trade volume over the last week. This achievement is just one of many in Ripple&#8217;s recent journey in the spotlight. Ripple&#8217;s presence in the news lately owes to a landmark court decision in its favor. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had initially taken legal action against the firm, accusing it of selling unregistered securities. However, a federal judge in New York has recently declared that XRP is only security when sold directly to institutional investors under specific written contracts. And when the token was sold to retail investors on crypto exchanges, it is not deemed a security. This verdict led to major cryptocurrency exchanges relisting XRP, causing a subsequent surge in demand and trading volume. Related Reading: XRP Holdings On Bitrue Exchange Surges By 300% Ripple Through The Market Last week&#8217;s court decision catalyzed a rally for XRP, as its price experienced an approximate 65% increase. The relisting on various platforms, following the victory in court, ignited significant interest in the token and pushed trading volumes to new heights. #XRP has surpassed #BTC as the highest volume asset 👀 Since last week&#8217;s court ruling, 21% of all crypto trade volume has been for XRP. pic.twitter.com/OLdTQrk1kO — Kaiko (@KaikoData) July 17, 2023 However, it is worth noting that XRP has experienced a 20% drop in value after reaching its recent peak. Yet, this has not seemed to have put a damper on the market sentiment for XRP. The recent spike in weekly trading volume highlights the increased interest and activity surrounding the token. Over the past 7 days, XRP has seen a surge of 59.4% in both its market cap and price. XRP market capitalization has spiked from a cap low of $25 billion earlier last week to as high as over $39 billion as of today. In addition, the asset&#8217;s price has also moved from as low as $0.47 earlier last week to trade above the $0.74 mark at the time of writing. The token&#8217;s present value translates to an increase of nearly 3% for the digital asset in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin&#8217;s Stumble Bitcoin, on the other hand, appears to have hit a stumbling block. Despite multiple attempts, Bitcoin has struggled to push past the $30,000 mark. Although Bitcoin remains a leading actor in the cryptocurrency market, XRP&#8217;s recent surge in weekly trading volume has momentarily eclipsed Bitcoin&#8217;s longstanding volume dominance.

This price action has shown how the asset has thrived to break above the $30,000 resistance. Meanwhile, in the past few days, BTC&#8217;s market cap has seen a decline of over $30 billion. The asset&#8217;s market cap has plunged from $591 billion seen last Tuesday to a valuation of approximately $579 billion, as of today.

					<description><![CDATA[Despite Bitcoin&#8217;s current struggle to surpass the $30,000 mark, data analytics firm Glassnode earlier today reported that the asset&#8217;s realized capitalization has since been on an upward trajectory, nearing the $400 billion mark. Bitcoin Realized Cap Nears $400 Billion According to Data analytics firm Glassnode, Bitcoin&#8217;s Realized Cap is now inching closer to $400 billion, showing that new capital is continuously entering the market despite the year&#8217;s ups and downs.  Related Reading: Standard Chartered Raises Bitcoin Forecast To $120,000, Citing Miners’ Reduced Selling Bitcoin&#8217;s Realized Cap represents the total value of all BTC at the price they were last moved or transacted, indicating the cost basis of holders. When this metric rises, it reveals that BTC is being traded at progressively higher prices, which suggests an increase in demand. Glassnode reported that the increase in BTC&#8217;s realized cap signals the consistent influx of capital into the asset throughout the year 2023. This steady inflow represents a stable investment climate surrounding Bitcoin, despite its recent price fluctuations. Furthermore, Glassnode&#8217;s assessment of the ascending realized cap is indicative of a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market. The data analytics firms said, &#8220;It signals that coins are changing hands at higher prices on net,&#8221; &#8211; a phenomenon that underlines a rising demand for Bitcoin. It is worth noting that this recorded increasing demand for Bitcoin comes at a time the asset might have flashed a hope of bullish moves following the surge in Spot Bitcoin ETF filings and financial giants such as BlackRock embracing the largest asset by market cap. BTC Struggles To Push Past $30,000 Meanwhile, as Bitcoin realized&#8217;s cap is approaching $400 billion, the asset has struggled to make a significant move above the $30,000 mark. Over the past 24 hours alone, the BTC price has traded both below and above the $30,000 mark, suggesting a level of consolidation at this point. Particularly, the asset currently has a 24-hour high of $30,292 and a 24-hour low of $29,792, at the time of writing. However, regardless of that, BTC is currently down by only a slight dip of 1% in the last 24 hours with a trading price of $29,882.  This latest price action follows Bitcoin&#8217;s quick spike which was seen last week on July 13. This surge brought Bitcoin price to trade even above the $31,000 mark before briefly slipping below $30,000. Over the past few days, however, a total of more than $30 billion has been removed from the BTC market cap.

Additionally, BTC trading volume has also declined in the past week indicating less trading activity. Featured image from iStock, Chart from TradingView]]></description>

<p>Furthermore, Glassnode&#8217;s assessment of the ascending realized cap is indicative of a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market. The data analytics firms said, &#8220;It signals that coins are changing hands at higher prices on net,&#8221; &#8211; a phenomenon that underlines a rising demand for Bitcoin. </p>
<p>It is worth noting that this recorded increasing demand for Bitcoin comes at a time the asset might have flashed a hope of bullish moves following the surge in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/dormant-bitcoin-supply-peaks-as-institutional-investors/?swcfpc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">Spot Bitcoin ETF filings and financial giants</a> such as BlackRock embracing the largest asset by market cap.</p>
<h2>BTC Struggles To Push Past $30,000</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, as Bitcoin realized&#8217;s cap is approaching $400 billion, the asset has struggled to make a significant move above the $30,000 mark. Over the past 24 hours alone, the BTC price has traded both below and above the $30,000 mark, suggesting a level of consolidation at this point.</p>
<p>Particularly, the asset currently has a 24-hour high of $30,292 and a 24-hour low of $29,792, at the time of writing. However, regardless of that, BTC is currently down by only a slight dip of 1% in the last 24 hours with a trading price of $29,882. </p>

<p>This latest price action follows <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/founder-anticipates-btc-price-surge-forecasts-bitcoin-etfs/?swcfpc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">Bitcoin&#8217;s quick spike</a> which was seen last week on July 13. This surge brought Bitcoin price to trade even above the $31,000 mark before briefly slipping below $30,000. Over the past few days, however, a total of more than $30 billion has been removed from the BTC market cap.</p>

<p>The asset&#8217;s market cap has plunged from a high of $614 billion seen on July 13 to $583 billion, as of today. Additionally, BTC trading volume has also declined in the past week indicating less trading activity.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[After the launch of the mainnet on May 3, the SUI token fell into a deep downtrend, which has caused the price to drop by more than 87%. Low user numbers and poor on-chain data have severely clouded the outlook. However, a few days ago, there was a surprise that gave a big boost to the SUI price. The SUI network made waves in the crypto space by surpassing its competitor Solana in daily transactions. However, with a sudden record of 29 million transactions in 24 hours, SUI has left many crypto enthusiasts questioning the validity and sustainability of this sudden surge. Renowned analyst and crypto whale Andrew Kang, known for his insightful commentary, has raised concerns about the authenticity of these transactions, suggesting that SUI may be artificially inflating its numbers. Kang writes today: Sui pumping their numbers up. Chart looks good, market does not seem to be discerning about validity of transactions. Fake it til you make it. Is SUI Still Worth Buying? As Kang argues, the question is: Are the numbers legitimate and can drive a sustainable upward trend, or will the hype quickly die down because of fake numbers? Related Reading: SUI Continues Rally As Sui 8192 Web3 Game Fuels Blockchain Activity To Hit New Peak The recent surge in transactions can be primarily attributed to the introduction of the on-chain game, &#8220;Sui 8192.&#8221; Developed by the team behind the wallet provider, Ethos Wallet, this casual game has captured the attention of users with its gameplay reminiscent of the classic puzzle game &#8220;2048.&#8221; Each move within the game triggers a transaction, resulting in the state of the game being recorded on the blockchain. With the integration of a pre-approval mechanism in Ethos Wallet, players can optimize their gameplay experience by setting a token amount before each game. It&#8217;s Important to know that the SUI Foundation has allocated $5 million to further stimulate activity within the game, offering players the opportunity to earn rewards in the form of SUI tokens by competing against others or completing tasks. However, this could call into question the sustainability of this increase in transaction activity.

Once the marketing budget is exhausted, the hype could quickly be over. SUI traders and investors should therefore be cautious. Prior to this transaction surge, the project had been marred by negative headlines, including allegations of suspicious token movements, concerns about venture capital influence, and opaque tokenomics. These controversies have left some investors wary of the project&#8217;s long-term prospects. Price Analysis However, as stated by Kang, the SUI chart looks promising at the moment. The price has broken out of the downward trend that existed since the mainnet launch. The bulls also managed to defend the 23.6 Fibonacci retracement level in a retest. Currently, the price is contending with the 38.2% retracement level at $0.76. If it manages to break above this resistance, $0.84 and $0.92 could be the next price target.

					<description><![CDATA[The Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), designed for building cross-chain applications and services, has now launched for early access users on the Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon blockchains. On July 20, the Chainlink protocol will become available to developers across the four blockchains’ testnets and also Arbitrum’s Goerli. As a result of this, the price of Chainlink’s native token, LINK, rallied nearly 10% to touch $7.30 following this announcement on Monday. Chainlink&#8217;s CCIP &#8211; The Future Of Interoperability? In a blog post dated July 17, Chainlink announced the launch of the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol to early access users on Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon blockchains. While DeFi lending protocol Aave is set to integrate the protocol, it has already been adopted on the derivatives platform Synthetix. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Needs To Clear $30,500 For Hopes of a Fresh Rally According to the post, CCIP is an interoperability protocol that allows developers to design their own cross-chain solutions. It also offers &#8220;Simplified Token Transfers&#8221;, which allows protocols to swiftly send tokens across chains through audited token pool contracts.   Chainlink claims that CCIP is a blockchain layer designed to foster a connection between enterprises and any public or private blockchain ecosystem. The cross-chain protocol is a collaborative effort with Swift, the renowned global financial messaging network. It leverages Swift&#8217;s messaging infrastructure to facilitate token transfers across various public and private blockchains. According to Chainlink’s co-founder Sergey Nazarov, CCIP is a solution that aims to “connect the fragmented public blockchain landscape and the growing bank ecosystem into a single Internet of Contracts.” He also stated that such technology will be crucial to developing and maintaining a blockchain-powered society. Just like key standards such as TCP/IP remade a fragmented early internet into the single global internet we all know and use today, we are making CCIP to connect the fragmented public blockchain landscape and the growing bank chain ecosystem into a single Internet of Contracts.… https://t.co/BDMFMfknY2 pic.twitter.com/DDscglD2An — Sergey Nazarov (@SergeyNazarov) July 17, 2023 Some of the financial institutions and enterprises also exploring the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol include Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon, Citi, Euroclear, and Lloyds Banking Group. Chainlink (LINK) Up By 35% In One Month &#8211; Price Overview Following the announcement of the CCIP launch, the price of LINK experienced a significant pump, recording an almost 10% increase in the early hours of Tuesday. However, the token’s price appears to be slowing down, losing over 2% since reaching a 24-hour high of $7.29. As of this writing, LINK is valued at $7.12, with a 7.3% increase in the last day. CoinGecko data shows that the cryptocurrency has a daily trading volume of roughly $549.8 million, representing a 219% boost in the last 24 hours.

					<description><![CDATA[Over the last week, the XRP token has dominated the headlines following Ripple’s partial court victory over the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  On July 13, Judge Analisa Torres of the US District Court of the Southern District of New York ruled that XRP doesn&#8217;t qualify as a security leading to a massive price surge in which the token gained by almost 90%. However, while it may appear that XRP&#8217;s positive effect on the market is waning, with most assets slipping into a bearish state, there is still a high level of interest surrounding this altcoin, proven by a recent report from prominent crypto exchange Bitrue. Bitrue Users Accumulate $800M Worth Of XRP In Futures Market.  In the late hours of yesterday, a crypto analyst with the Twitter handle @cowboycrypto313 revealed that Bitrue had shared a report via email with its users, noting a massive increase in the notional value of the open interest of the XRP token. Related Reading: XRP Price Retreats After Massive 80% Rally, Buy The Dips? The notional value of open interest refers to the total value of outstanding contracts in a futures or optional market. In this context, it represents the total value of XRP on the Bitrue exchange based on what its traders have pledged to buy or sell in the future.  In this report, Bitrue states that XRP holdings in its Futures service spiked from less than $200 million to over $800 million during the weekend. Interestingly, the exchange further revealed that 88% of its users are holding a long position on this asset. According to a chart shared by Bitrue, the notional value of open interest for XRP on its platform had been below $200 million for the majority of the last two weeks. However, following the court ruling on July 13, this index started rising, with the XRP Futures market recording a notable spike on July 16.  Source: Twitter XRP Soars By 57% In Seven Days In other news, XRP remains the center of the crypto market attention, recording a 56.73% gain in the last week, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Currently, XRP, which now ranks as the fourth-biggest cryptocurrency, is tagged biggest weekly gainer. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that this token has shown little to no price movement in the last few days, with its price hovering around the $0.74 region. As of this writing, XRP is trading at $0.742 with a 1.14% gain on the last day.  Related Reading: BTC Price Analysis: Why Is Bitcoin Down Today?

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin price has fallen to the lower end of its almost one-month trading range between $29,800 and $31,300. Already yesterday, BTC briefly fell to as low as $29,704, only to recover to $30,306 within a few hours. At press time, BTC was again moving towards the $30,000 mark, and another fall and liquidity grab seems likely. While this week the macro data releases are pretty quiet, it&#8217;s worth taking a look at what&#8217;s happening in the Bitcoin market itself. Why Is Bitcoin Down Today? Swissblock Insights observed a peculiar calm in the market when Bitcoin reached a new yearly high of $31.840 last week. However, the momentum quickly faded, and selling pressure increased, causing BTC to drop to the low $30ks. They highlight the narrow Bollinger Bands, stating, &#8220;The Bollinger Bands are very narrow, with only a 4.2% value difference separating the upper and lower bands. A move is brewing.&#8221; Moreover, the analysts emphasize the need for a significant catalyst to inject life into the current lackluster scenario: Volatility is expected to appear on the scene, although, in the short term, we are in no man’s land; liquidity remains low, open interest is still flat and shorts are nowhere to be seen. There’s no command in the direction we are going, and only a significant catalyst can spice things up in this dull scenario we are in. According to the analysts, a breakdown of the $29.650 support level would invalidate a long setup. On the other hand, a bullish leg up $31.500 could reignite momentum and surge the price to $33,000. But for this to happen, spot demand needs to reignite strongly and longs need to enter the market, “otherwise momentum will continue to fading.&#8221; Related Reading: This Bitcoin Continuation Pattern Points To 3-6 Months Of Uptrend Ahead Glassnode, an on-chain data provider, further illuminates the current state of the Bitcoin market. Despite the temporary yearly high, they describe the market as &#8220;extremely quiet&#8221;, also pointing to the Bollinger Bands. This compression in volatility signals a market reminiscent of the calm observed in early January, as NewsBTC reported yesterday. Furthermore, Glassnode’s analysis reveals a slow but steady inflow of capital into Bitcoin. The Realized Cap currently sits just shy at $396 billion. After hitting a cycle low at $380 billion, the metric indicates that a slow but steady stream of capital is entering the market throughout 2023. Glasnode also emphasizes that investors remain unwilling to part with their held supply, resulting in choppy market conditions similar to those seen in 2016 and 2019-20 periods. Total realized profit and loss resembles the historic trend: If we take a ratio between total realized profit and loss, [&#8230;] we can also note that a lower high in this ratio was set this week. If sustained, it may allude to similar choppy market conditions seen in both 2019-20, and again in the second half of 2021. The analysis also highlights the profit-locking behavior among Bitcoin holders, with the majority of both short-term (88%) and long-term holders&#8217; balances (73%) held in profit. However, short-term holders are the primary entities that are active in the market.

This means that short term holders may have to trim their profits for the time being before selling pressure eases and the bulls can take the upper hand again. GreekLive, an options expert, explains that the Bitcoin market is still losing liquidity, which makes it highly susceptible to spikes and V-shaped recoveries: Cryptocurrencies encountered a V-shaped market today, with BTC falling below $29,700 and ETH below $1,875, before rebounding in a V-shaped during Asian trading hours to regain the round number of points, but the options market barely reacted to this. The analysis advises sellers to focus on static protection and have risk control plans for holding options until expiration. For buyers, timely profit-taking and using futures to hedge options are recommended risk management strategies. At press time, BTC traded at $30,064.
