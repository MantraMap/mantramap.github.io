										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A survey suggests that should the United States ever default, the public <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-would-be-more-trusted-than-the-dollar-as-a-safe-haven-if-the-us-defaults-survey-says/ar-AA1bdA1A" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">sees bitcoin as more</a> of a “safe haven” than the U.S. dollar.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Is a Bigger Safe Haven Than USD, Survey Says</h2>
<p>Things aren’t as strong as one would assume considering bitcoin only placed third on the list. The first “safe haven” viewed by participants was gold, meaning that if the U.S. defaults, most of these people would want to allocate their portfolios and wealth to gold. After that came Treasurys, and bitcoin placed third, meaning it’s still got a way to go in terms of earning general trust.</p>
<p>However, the news is good in that it means many people now feel safer towards bitcoin than they do fiat currency, and the asset has come a long way in a relatively short period. Bitcoin, as we all remember, has only been around since 2009. That’s about 14 years at this stage, so the fact that people can now see it in a stronger light than they do USD is a good sign that the industry is doing something right.</p>
<p>The survey in question was the Markets Live Pulse survey conducted by <em>Bloomberg</em>. The results suggest that about eight percent (or slightly less) see bitcoin as a stronger “safe haven” when compared to USD. This isn’t much, but it’s a step forward.</p>
<p>There are likely many reasons for this, the first one being that banks throughout the U.S. and Europe are crashing and burning like nobody’s business. Right now, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/analysts-provide-their-thoughts-on-latest-bitcoin-rally/" data-wpel-link="internal">institutions such as</a> First Republic, Signature, and Silicon Valley have all fallen into heaps of failure and are no longer in operation throughout America. Thus, the institutions that once came off as totally safe, sound, and secure are taking on the shape of unstable firms that can lose your coins or dollar bills the minute something troublesome happens.</p>
<p>The other reason could be that we have so many incapable people running the financial scene in the U.S. People like Janet Yellen, the Treasury Secretary, who <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/opinion-crypto-fans-may-want-to-wait-on-their-calls-for-regulation/" data-wpel-link="internal">in the past</a>, has commented that she felt inflation was a problem that would resolve itself. Also, there’s Jerome Powell, who despite all the trouble that he’s caused, still only resorts <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-fed-bitcoins-worst-enemy-right-now/" data-wpel-link="internal">to hiking interest rates</a> as a means of combating inflation.</p>
<h2>Treasurys Shouldn&#8217;t Be This High</h2>
<p>The interest rate hikes have done nothing but cause people to be shut out of the American dream. They can no longer afford cars, homes, or other large (yet necessary) items due to their inability to pay high interest. In addition, these interest rate hikes caused crypto prices to crash and burn throughout 2022.</p>
<p>With all this in mind, however, it’s a little shocking (and scary) to think people still trust Treasurys more than they do bitcoin given they placed second on the survey.</p>

<li>Bitcoin cash started a strong increase above the $225 and $250 levels against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading above the $280 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $270.00 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair must clear $320 and $325 to continue higher in the near term.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin cash price is climbing above $300 against the US Dollar, outperforming <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-bulls-in-control-above-29500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. BCH/USD could start a fresh surge if it clears the $325 level.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash price formed a decent support base above the $180 level. BCH started a decent increase and was able to clear the $225 resistance zone.</p>
<p>The price climbed above the $250 and $280 resistance levels. It even spiked above $300 and traded as high as $326.42. It is now trading above the $280 zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-cash-analysis-rally-seems-unstoppable-above-130/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. The current price action is positive, suggesting high chances of more gains.</p>
<p>There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $270.00 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $320 level.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $325 level, above which the price may perhaps rise toward the $350 level. Any more gains above $350 could set the pace for a move toward the $400 level.</p>
<p>Immediate support on the downside is near the $300 level or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $220 swing low to the $326 high. The first major support sits near the $270 level and the trend line region.</p>
<p>The trend line is also near the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $220 swing low to the $326 high. The next support is near the $245 zone, below which the bears might aim for $225. The next target for them may perhaps be near the $200 level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is investing in crypto equivalent to gambling? That’s how the United Kingdom sees it, and leaders are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/17/cryptocurrency-trading-in-uk-should-be-regulated-as-form-of-gambling-say-mps?ref=dessenter.ghost.io" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">suggesting that crypto be regulated</a> in the same way the U.K. oversees gambling activities.</p>
<h2>The United Kingdom Sees Crypto Investing as Gambling</h2>
<p>To an extent, one can argue that investing in crypto is sort of a gamble. Whenever you buy bitcoin, Ethereum, or some other digital asset, you’re taking a chance… A chance that it could go down or up. You don’t know where it will be.</p>
<p>The same idea applies to sitting down at a blackjack table. You could win big, or you could lose it all in a matter of minutes. In that sense, crypto and gambling are one and the same, and this is the idea that’s making its way into the financial operations of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>U.K. authorities believe that like gambling, investing in crypto can be quite addictive, and thus traders won’t always know when to stop. Thus, necessary rules must be put in place to protect people from themselves. Conservative MP and Treasury committee chair Harriett Baldwin explained in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Effective regulation is clearly needed to protect consumers from harm, as well as to support productive innovation in the U.K.’s financial services industry. However, with no intrinsic value, huge price volatility, and no discernible social good, consumer trading of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin more closely resembles gambling than a financial service and should be regulated as such. By betting on these unbacked ‘tokens,’ consumers should be aware that all their money could be lost.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right now, nothing is set in stone, and laws and rules are merely being suggested to the U.K. Parliament. However, should these rules pass, many analysts believe they will eventually influence future crypto regulations in the United Kingdom. Some even believe they will implement themselves <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/european-union-passes-heavy-string-of-new-crypto-regulations/" data-wpel-link="internal">into the MiCA</a> regulations recently passed by the European Union (EU).</p>
<p>Not everyone is happy about what’s going on. For example, a special committee under the Treasury has released a report claiming that crypto and blockchain are part of financial innovations that cannot – and should not – be governed under the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which is where crypto regulation would occur in the U.K. The report said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is not the government’s role to promote particular technological innovations for their own sake.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Some People Have Lost Everything</h2>
<p>Like gambling, there have been many people out that have ultimately gone nuts whenever a bull market has hit. They put all their money into something, expecting and believing with all their might that they will strike it rich within a set period.</p>
<p>However, this isn’t always the case. Crypto is often very volatile, and in years such as 2018 and 2022, there have been many instances of crypto traders losing all they have.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you run a cryptocurrency company in America and you’re getting tired of the regulatory confusion surrounding your industry? Are you sick of Gary Gensler and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) breathing down the back of your neck? If that’s the case, <a href="https://invezz.com/news/2023/05/17/france-welcomes-cryptocurrency-firms-fleeing-u-s-regulatory-uncertainty/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">you may want to give</a> France a try!</p>
<h2>France Wants American Crypto Firms</h2>
<p>France has commented that it will welcome all companies and enterprises in America devoted to blockchain and crypto as it’s aiming to build up its digital infrastructure and offerings. Regulators are currently working to establish a new framework that will make it so that the U.S. can benefit from its growing crypto environment. The goal is to also appeal to more crypto companies in the United States and appear more inviting – potentially inspiring some of them to move 4,000 miles across the Atlantic and set up stations within the country’s borders.</p>
<p>The United States has long talked about crypto regulation, and these calls for implementing it have only gotten stronger since last November’s <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">FTX collapse</a>. Once one of the top digital currency exchanges, FTX fell into a heaping pile of bankruptcy and fraud, and it really scared American leaders and convinced them that the crypto industry was nothing but a bunch of criminals and fraudsters working together to gain access to the funds of innocent investors.</p>
<p>However, while the U.S. may be all about implementing crypto regulation, its methods for doing so have been questionable. The integration of regulation has fallen primarily on the shoulders of Gary Gensler, the head of the SEC, and it’s become clear he’s not playing fair or clean. In fact, it appears persecution is the only tactic the old geezer is willing to try. Thus far, several big names in crypto – like <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">Coinbase</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-sec-trying-to-kill-crypto-for-good/" data-wpel-link="internal">Kraken</a> – have fallen victim to his antics, and many analysts are worried about what Gensler is doing to innovation and growth when it comes to crypto in the U.S.</p>
<h2>Trying to Create the Right Rules</h2>
<p>France has clearly taken notice of what’s going on in the land of the free and the home of the brave, and it wants to give entrepreneurs in the blockchain space a little leeway. For the most part, the European Union (EU) appears to be way ahead of the game when it comes to crypto regulation in that it recently implemented the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/european-union-passes-heavy-string-of-new-crypto-regulations/" data-wpel-link="internal">new MiCA rules</a>. France, being part of the EU, stands to gain a lot of traction in the coming weeks when it comes to crypto, though some things remain up in the air.</p>
<p>For example, right now, France is working on the types of crypto influences that can promote crypto business, as specific laws haven’t been set in stone, though this will likely be established firmly before we know it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jia is a blockchain-based fintech organization <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/jia-blockchain-based-lender-small-090101365.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">that offers small businesses and</a> emerging markets the loans they need to operate and stay afloat. In recent news, the company announced that it had secured more than $4 million in seed funding, while another $1 million (for a total of $5 million) was delivered to assist its commitment to on-chain liquidity.</p>
<h2>What Will Jia Do with the Money?</h2>
<p>The funding round featured the participation of well-known <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/blockchain/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain</a> and crypto firms including Block Tower, TCG Crypto, Hashed Emergent, Saison Capital, and Global Coin Research. In addition to the companies, several individual angel investors – including Packy McCormick, the founder of Not Boring, and Anand Lyer of Canonical Crypto – also donated funds to help the company move forward.</p>
<p>Jia says it will use the money to boost its operations in many up-and-coming or third-world nations like Kenya and the Philippines. It will also explore a wide array of new markets in regions such as Asia, Latin America, and West Africa. The idea is that many of these areas have seen their standard financial arenas suffer in recent years, and blockchain can assist them greatly.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Zach Marks, Ivan Orone, Yuting Wang, and Cheng Cheng. All previously worked at a firm called Tala and got to know each other in their previous positions. The company works to garner decentralized finance loans, which are then sent to borrowers.</p>
<p>Granted they repay the loans within certain timeframes they’re rewarded with special token offerings. These tokens can then be redeemed at rates based on Jia’s profits. CEO and co-founder Marks said in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>The idea is to provide affordable financing for micro-businesses, and when they repay, they become owners by getting token rewards… The loans range in size from $200 up to $5,000… They are competitively priced. We charge about a third the interest rate of the typical consumer fintech lender.</p></blockquote>
<h2>How It Gets Customers</h2>
<p>The way Jia finds partners and customers is by utilizing their local apps. Among the many customers the firm currently serves is Ilara Health, a medical inventory company that works with over 2,000 small clinics. Marks said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ilara’s focus is on helping clinics grow by selling medicine [and] low-cost diagnostic devices. They don&#8217;t want to deal with credit risk[s] on their balance sheet, so we stepped in to finance an inventory financing program for them. We get access to proprietary data on these clinics, which helps us underwrite in a way that banks and other lenders can&#8217;t… What is exciting in what we&#8217;re doing is opening the world&#8217;s capital to MSMEs so they can receive affordable financing. Jia is not just providing financing. We are providing a path to economic resilience and this opportunity to build wealth in a new way that hasn&#8217;t been done before.</p></blockquote>

<li>The pair could continue to decline if it stays below the $0.720 and $0.750 resistance levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>EOS price is struggling below $0.75 against the US Dollar, unlike <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-bulls-in-control-above-29500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. The price might attempt to recover if there is a clear move above $0.720.</em></p>
<h2>EOS Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, EOS price saw a major decline from the $0.900 resistance against the US Dollar. The price traded below the $0.85 and $0.80 levels to move into a bearish zone.</p>
<p>Recently, there was a minor correction from the $0.600 zone. However, upsides were limited above the $0.770 level. A high is formed near $0.7731 and the price is again moving lower. There was a move below the $0.720 support.</p>
<p>It traded below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.6030 swing low to the $0.7731 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $0.718 on the 4-hour chart of the EOS/USD pair.</p>
<p>EOS is trading well below $0.75 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/eos-price-analysis-bulls-sight-recovery-to-0-78/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.720 level.</p>
<p>The first major resistance is near the $0.75 level. A clear move above the $0.75 level could start a steady increase toward the $0.78 level. The next major resistance might be $0.80. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.850 level.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support is near $0.642. The next key support is near the $0.620 level. If there is a downside break below the $0.620 support, the price could test the $0.603 support in the near term.</p>

<li>The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $86.50 resistance.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Litecoin price is correcting gains from $94 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-bulls-in-control-above-29500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. LTC price could resume its increase if it remains well supported above the $82.50 level.</em></p>
<h2>Litecoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, there was a decent increase in Bitcoin, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-eyes-more-gains-above-1920/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum</a>, Ripple, and Litecoin against the US Dollar. Earlier, LTC formed a base above the $75 level and started a fresh increase.</p>
<p>There was a clear move above the $8 and $88 resistance levels. The price even climbed above the $90 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). However, the bears were active near the $94 zone. The recent high was formed near $93.82 and the price started a downside correction.</p>
<p>There was a move below the $90 level. The price traded below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $71.09 swing low to the $93.82 high.</p>
<p>It is now trading below $88 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $86 level. The next major resistance sits near the $88 level. A clear move above the $88 level could pump the price toward the $94 level. Any more gains might call for a test of $100.</p>
<p>Immediate support is near the $82.50 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $71.09 swing low to the $93.82 high.</p>
<p>There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $82.50 on the 4-hours chart of the LTC/USD pair. The next major support is near the $79.20 zone. A downside break below the $79.20 support might start a strong decline.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Executives behind the stable currency Tether – which is not only popular, but also somewhat controversial – have <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/tether-buys-222-million-worth-of-bitcoin-to-back-its-usdt-stablecoin/ar-AA1bj6a1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced they just bought</a> more than $200 million worth of <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a> as a means of backing their digital currency.</p>
<h2>Tether and Bitcoin&#8230; Together Again</h2>
<p>A stable currency is a digital currency that’s not subjected to the same volatility and speculative nature that one often sees with more mainstream cryptos, such as bitcoin and Ethereum. What makes them stable is that they are often supported by various forms of collateral, whether they be gold (or other precious metals) or fiat currencies like USD, the yen, or the yuan. Thus, they tend to retain their dollar pegs and don’t go crashing into oblivion like so many other assets have done in the past. One unit of a stable currency is often worth $1.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of stable coins out there, and Tether is arguably one of the biggest and most well-known. The goal amongst company members is to “diversify” reserves backing the token. The currency has been on a serious bull run since the early portion of the year, accumulating a net profit of close to $1.5 billion last March. It is also said that Tether reserves are near $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino explained in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>The decision to invest in bitcoin, the world&#8217;s first and largest cryptocurrency, is underpinned by its strength and potential as an investment asset. Bitcoin has continually proven its resilience and has emerged as a long-term store of value with substantial growth potential. Its limited supply, decentralized nature, and widespread adoption have positioned bitcoin as a favored choice among institutional and retail investors alike.</p></blockquote>
<p>This would all be fine and dandy except back in 2019, Texas professor John Griffin <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3195066" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">unveiled a report that</a> explained the full bull run of 2017 and the subsequent bear run in 2018 that occurred for the crypto industry. The report alleges that many Tether holders used their units to purchase BTC, thus tying the stable currency to the asset and keeping it afloat. This is what ultimately helped BTC reach $20K (it’s then all-time high) in the year 2017, though it also contributed greatly to the crash that followed the next year.</p>
<h2>Could This Be Problematic?</h2>
<p>While the circumstances are somewhat different this time around, the situation is virtually the same in that Tether and bitcoin are being tied together. Last time, Tether was supporting bitcoin. This time, bitcoin is supporting Tether. Could the reversal of the roles inherently cause bitcoin to fall again like it did five years ago? It’s a scary thought for many.</p>
<p>Previously, Tether held many of its reserves in commercial paper, which wasn’t considered safe, though it wound down its holdings to zero last February.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mona Faiz Montrage – an influencer on Instagram that’s originally from Ghana, but now lives in New Jersey – <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/16/us/mona-montrage-alleged-romance-scammer-cec/index.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">has been arrested for</a> allegedly taking part in a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/romance-scam/" data-wpel-link="internal">romance scam</a> that saw several old men send her lavish gifts including prepaid cards and cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2>Mona Montrage Sent to Court</h2>
<p>According to her Instagram page, Montrage is an influencer who’s part of the African music scene. Many of her 4.2 million fans are under the impression that she often spends time in London and Accra, the capital of her native country of Ghana.</p>
<p>However, court documents reveal this may not be the case, and that she is in fact part of a large cybercrime ring in West Africa that thus far, has seen more than $2 million stolen from older (and vulnerable) American citizens, many of whom are in their 80s. Not long ago, Montrage was arrested in the United Kingdom and extradited to New York, where she made her first court appearance.</p>
<p>Thus far, she has pleaded not guilty to all the charges laid against her including conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to receive stolen money, and money laundering. She’s 30 years of age and has allegedly been engaging in this scam-like behavior since 2013. She and her cronies would often reach out to the victims via dating apps and after earning their trust, would get them to believe that there was romance in the future. Papers detailing the indictment read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once members of the enterprise had successfully convinced victims that they were in a romantic relationship and had gained their trust, they convinced the victims, under false pretenses, to transfer money to bank accounts the victims believed were controlled by their romantic interests, when, in fact, the bank accounts were controlled by members of the enterprise.</p></blockquote>
<p>In one instance, she took the scam so far that she sent her victim a tribal marriage certificate from Ghana, getting him to believe that they were officially and legally bound. The documents continue with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Montrage sent the victim a tribal marriage certificate purporting to show that Montrage and the victim had been married in Ghana.</p></blockquote>
<p>She got this victim to send close to $90,000 to her through a collection of payments. In another instance, she received close to $200K from a separate victim. Michael J. Driscoll – the FBI assistant director in charge – commented on how common romance scams have become. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Romance scams – especially those that target older individuals – are of major concern.</p></blockquote>
<h2>This Is Too Common</h2>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also threw its two cents in, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>These scammers pay close attention to the information you share, and don’t miss a beat becoming your perfect match. You like a thing, so that’s their thing, too. You’re looking to settle down.</p></blockquote>
