					<description><![CDATA[In a recent tweet, Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao, the CEO of Binance, drew attention to the dynamic nature of Bitcoin&#8217;s price and its increasing practicality. The tweet was timely, aligning with Bitcoin&#8217;s ascent above $31,450, marking its highest value since June 2022. This surge was primarily attributed to the US Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s endorsement of the Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF, referred to as BITX, thereby establishing it as the inaugural leveraged bitcoin futures ETF in the United States. Furthermore, the positive sentiment expressed by BlackRock contributed to the overall strength of the cryptocurrency market. Controversies Surrounding Binance And Its CEO Bitcoin has witnessed a progressive expansion in its practicality as an increasing number of merchants and service providers have embraced it as a viable payment option. The realm of Bitcoin has seen a surge in the availability of futures and options, lending platforms, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Amidst these positive advancements, a series of allegations have surfaced regarding Binance and its CEO, concerning the alleged employment of a &#8220;liquidation waterfall&#8221; strategy in the sale of spot Bitcoin. Zhao has refuted these claims. Related Reading: The CEO of Binance Accuses the SEC – Where to Diversify Your Portfolio? Binance&#8217;s Integration Of Bitcoin Lightning Network Binance has recently announced noteworthy progress in integrating the Bitcoin Lightning Network, aiming to enhance the speed of deposits and withdrawals. Binance is currently in the process of integrating the network, with some technical aspects still pending completion. They recently shared their progress on Twitter, acknowledging that observant users had spotted their new lightning nodes. This confirms Binance&#8217;s active involvement in leveraging the Lightning Network to facilitate faster and more scalable Bitcoin transactions, ultimately enhancing user experience. The community eagerly awaits updates on Binance&#8217;s full integration of the Lightning Network.

While Bitcoin&#8217;s volatility continues to capture attention, another significant event looms on the horizon &#8211; the forthcoming Bitcoin halving. Anticipated to take place between April and May 2024, this 4th halving will bring about a reduction in block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC at the 840,000 block height.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has experienced a remarkable upswing, with its value soaring by 55% in the past week. This surge can be attributed to two key factors: BlackRock&#8217;s recent application for a Bitcoin spot ETF with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the launch of EDX Markets. BlackRock&#8217;s move to seek SEC approval for a Bitcoin spot ETF has sparked a wave of similar applications, generating a bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. This sentiment has had a particularly positive impact on Bitcoin and related projects, including Bitcoin Cash. Nonetheless, the introduction of EDX Markets, a platform catering to institutional investors, appears to be the primary catalyst behind Bitcoin Cash&#8217;s recent price surge. EDX Markets, backed by industry giants Fidelity, Schwab, and Citadel Securities, carries significant weight despite not being registered with the SEC. Jamil Nazarali, CEO of EDX Markets, expressed confidence in the compliance of the four listed crypto tokens (Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin) with the SEC. The platform&#8217;s selective listing of cryptocurrencies, which includes Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash, has been interpreted as a vote of confidence, specifically in Bitcoin Cash.  The listing of BCH on the EDX Markets exchange is an indication of the token&#8217;s regulatory clearance. This interpretation gains significance as the SEC scrutinizes other blockchain projects. Related reading: Here’s What Caused Bitcoin’s Flash Crash To $29,000 Bitcoin Cash Uptrend Fueled By Volume Spike On Upbit A major factor that could have influenced the recent uptrend in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the short squeeze and an unexpected surge in trading volume on the South Korean exchange, Upbit. A short squeeze occurs when the price of an asset rises, leading traders who had bet against the asset&#8217;s price to cover their positions at a loss or face forced liquidation.  The volatility in BCH&#8217;s price resulted in approximately $19 million in liquidations within the past 24 hours, with short orders accounting for 77% of the total amount. These liquidation levels represent the highest recorded in June 2023, according to data from Coinglass. BCH&#8217;s price remained heavily suppressed throughout the year, fluctuating between $100 and $150. However, its value experienced a significant vertical rise after being listed on EDX Markets. Currently, BCH is trading at $308.72, reaching levels last seen 14 months ago in May 2022. According to crypto research outlet The Tie, BCH trading volumes on Binance have reached levels not witnessed in two years. This indicates a resurgence of BCH&#8217;s trading interest following its EDX Markets listing. This renewed interest highlights a positive shift in the trading dynamics surrounding Bitcoin Cash. BCH is trading at $280.7 at press time, with a 5% decline in the past 24 hours. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.

Notably, Polygon&#8217;s staking space has witnessed growth within the span of just seven days. MATIC market cap currently at $10 billion on the weekend chart: TradingView.com Staking Rewards data reveals a noticeable increase in the number of MATIC stakers during this period, reflecting the growing interest and participation in the Polygon ecosystem. Despite the positive developments in Polygon&#8217;s staking community, the MATIC token has encountered a minor setback in its market value. CoinGecko reports the current price of MATIC at $0.659, indicating a slight 0.2% decline in the past 24 hours and a 2.6% loss in value over the past seven days. Source: Coingecko Mixed Signals In MATIC Price Report The latest MATIC price report presents a somewhat intriguing scenario, with certain metrics displaying bullish signals while others suggest a contrasting outlook. Among the positive indicators, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signaled a bullish edge in the market, instilling optimism among investors. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) showed an uptick, indicating increased buying pressure and potential strength in MATIC&#8217;s price movement.

The gap between the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 55-day EMA was widening, raising red flags among traders and market observers. A significant and increasing gap between these two EMAs could suggest a potential loss of short-term momentum and might indicate a more prolonged downtrend for the token&#8217;s price.

<h2><strong>Mixed Signals In MATIC Price Report</strong></h2>
<p>The latest <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/why-matic-may-continue-with-its-bearish-agenda-despite-this-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MATIC price report</a> presents a somewhat intriguing scenario, with certain metrics displaying bullish signals while others suggest a contrasting outlook. </p>
<p>Among the positive indicators, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signaled a bullish edge in the market, instilling optimism among investors. </p>
<p>Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) showed an uptick, indicating increased buying pressure and potential strength in MATIC&#8217;s price movement.</p>

<p>However, the report also highlighted a concerning aspect of MATIC&#8217;s price trend. The gap between the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 55-day EMA was widening, raising red flags among traders and market observers. </p>
<p>A significant and increasing gap between these two EMAs could suggest a potential loss of short-term momentum and might indicate a more prolonged downtrend for the token&#8217;s price.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Compound (COMP) has recently surged with a staggering 113% rise in just two weeks, and the reason behind the rally has been the talk of the crypto community. DeFi Ignas, a decentralized finance (DeFi) researcher, has analyzed the recent developments surrounding Compound and provided insights into the potential factors contributing to the surge. Compound Takes The Lead With Triple-Digit Growth In June This remarkable growth has been fueled by a range of factors, including the recent announcement of the launch of Superstate Funds by Compound&#8217;s founder, which aims to bridge traditional markets with blockchain ecosystems. One of the major challenges facing DeFi is the lack of integration with traditional financial markets. While the DeFi space has grown rapidly over the past few years, it is still relatively small compared to the traditional financial system.  Related Reading: XRP Dips After SEC’s ETF Blow But A Rebound Looks Likely By bridging these two worlds, Superstate could help to bring more institutional investors into the DeFi space and increase the overall liquidity and stability of DeFi protocols. Furthermore, Superstate&#8217;s focus on creating regulated financial products could help address some of the regulatory concerns raised about DeFi. While DeFi protocols are decentralized and operate on blockchain networks, they still fall under the jurisdiction of various regulatory bodies.  By creating regulated financial products that comply with existing regulations, Superstate could help to mitigate some of the risks associated with DeFi and pave the way for more widespread adoption of these protocols. Superstate aims to bridge traditional markets with blockchain ecosystems by buying short-term government debt and tokenizing it on blockchains. While it is unclear whether the tokenization will include COMP holders or lead to an airdrop, this announcement has generated excitement and speculation among the crypto community. Jump Crypto Whale Responsible For COMP Rally? While new governance proposals have been introduced, none have been significant enough to account for the sudden price increase. However, there has been a significant balance change among various Jump Crypto wallets. Jump Crypto wallets are a group of cryptocurrency wallets associated with Jump Trading, a Chicago-based trading firm specializing in high-frequency trading strategies. The wallets have been identified as significant players in the cryptocurrency market, particularly in the DeFi space, where they have been involved in market making and liquidity provision. These wallets have emerged as major players in the COMP market. One of these wallets holds many COMP tokens and has been involved in significant balance changes, including the recent withdrawal of 170,000 COMP tokens from Binance. This withdrawal amounts to $9.7 million and represents 1.7% of the total supply of COMP. Related Reading: OKX Liquid Marketplace Records Over $3 Billion In Institutional Trade Volume The actions of this particular wallet appear to be the primary reason for the recent surge in the COMP price. The withdrawal of such a large amount of tokens from Binance has significantly increased demand for COMP, driving up its price. As a result, this wallet now ranks as the ninth-largest holder of COMP tokens. Compound&#8217;s native token, COMP, is trading at $58, following its uptrend that began on June 16th. In the last 24 hours, COMP has continued to soar with a 14% gain and is currently attempting to break through the $60 level to surpass its yearly high of $64 achieved in February.

					<description><![CDATA[The recent surge in Litecoin (LTC) price propelled it to reach a significant psychological level of $100. This upward movement has provided a bullish boost and allowed the altcoin to register gains in recent trading sessions. However, despite this bullishness, the price of LTC remains within bearish territory, indicating ongoing downward pressure. Reclaiming the $100 price mark is crucial for sustaining a bullish trend. Related Reading: XRP Dips After SEC’s ETF Blow But A Rebound Looks Likely In the past 24 hours, LTC has experienced a rally of nearly 17%. On the weekly chart, the altcoin has maintained double-digit gains, reflecting its positive performance over a longer period. It&#8217;s worth noting that Litecoin&#8217;s halving event is just a little over a month away. Historically, the price of the asset tends to increase before this event. However, due to the fluctuating nature of Bitcoin, which often influences major altcoins, LTC might experience slight depreciation. Significant depreciation is less likely as long as LTC maintains its price above the local support level. A sustained increase in demand for the altcoin is necessary to ensure continued gains on the daily chart. The market capitalization of LTC has also increased, indicating bullish momentum in the market. Litecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart When writing, Litecoin (LTC) was trading at $97.81. After reaching the $100 mark, LTC has been steadily gaining in price. However, despite the bullish momentum, Litecoin remains within a crucial zone that is bearish and could potentially reverse the gains. This bearish zone, indicated in red, extends from $94 to $103. In previous trading sessions, LTC has retraced when attempting to revisit the $103 level. The $94 mark has also been a reversal point over the past few months. Moreover, Litecoin entered the excess selling zone the maximum number of times, where the price fluctuated between the two (upper and lower) bands of the bearish region. The overhead resistance levels are $100 and $103. In case of a decline from these levels, the price could drop to $94 initially, followed by a potential further decline to $90. Technical Analysis Regarding demand, Litecoin (LTC) was approaching overbought conditions. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was above the 60 mark, indicating buyers had gained market control.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recent surge in Litecoin (LTC) price propelled it to reach a significant psychological level of $100. This upward movement has provided a bullish boost and allowed the altcoin to register gains in recent trading sessions.</p>
<p>However, despite this bullishness, the price of LTC remains within bearish territory, indicating ongoing downward pressure. Reclaiming the $100 price mark is crucial for sustaining a bullish trend.</p>

<p>In the past 24 hours, LTC has experienced a rally of nearly 17%. On the weekly chart, the altcoin has maintained double-digit gains, reflecting its positive performance over a longer period.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Litecoin&#8217;s halving event is just a little over a month away. Historically, the price of the asset tends to increase before this event.</p>
<p>However, due to the fluctuating nature of Bitcoin, which often influences major altcoins, LTC might experience slight depreciation.</p>
<p>Significant depreciation is less likely as long as LTC maintains its price above the local support level. A sustained increase in demand for the altcoin is necessary to ensure continued gains on the daily chart. The market capitalization of LTC has also increased, indicating bullish momentum in the market.</p>

<p>When writing, Litecoin (LTC) was trading at $97.81. After reaching the $100 mark, LTC has been steadily gaining in price. However, despite the bullish momentum, Litecoin remains within a crucial zone that is bearish and could potentially reverse the gains.</p>
<p>This bearish zone, indicated in red, extends from $94 to $103. In previous trading sessions, LTC has retraced when attempting to revisit the $103 level. The $94 mark has also been a reversal point over the past few months.</p>
<p>Moreover, Litecoin entered the excess selling zone the maximum number of times, where the price fluctuated between the two (upper and lower) bands of the bearish region.</p>
<p>The overhead resistance levels are $100 and $103. In case of a decline from these levels, the price could drop to $94 initially, followed by a potential further decline to $90.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reportedly told exchanges Nasdaq and Cboe that recent filings for spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from asset managers including BlackRock and Fidelity were not “clear and comprehensive” enough. Bitcoin ETFs In Jeopardy? The SEC has rejected several Bitcoin ETF filings in recent years due to concerns over potential fraudulent and manipulative practices associated with the cryptocurrency market.  The agency has stated that the filings do not meet the standards designed to protect investors and the public interest. In particular, the SEC has expressed concerns about the lack of regulation and oversight in the cryptocurrency market, which could make it easier for bad actors to manipulate the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  Related Reading: Litecoin Up 18% In Past 24 Hours, Is Halving Rally Here? The SEC has also expressed concerns about custody and liquidity issues related to cryptocurrency. While some asset managers have attempted to address these concerns in their filings, the SEC has continued to reject them as inadequate. However, Several proposed solutions have been put forward to address the SEC&#8217;s concerns around Bitcoin ETFs.  One potential solution is the use of regulated custodians to hold the Bitcoin backing the ETF, which would provide greater oversight and security for investors. Some asset managers have also proposed using futures contracts to track the price of Bitcoin, rather than holding the actual cryptocurrency, which could help address liquidity concerns.  In addition, some have suggested that the SEC could work with industry participants to establish best practices and guidelines for the cryptocurrency market, which could help mitigate risks associated with fraudulent and manipulative practices.  Despite these proposals, the SEC has continued to scrutinize Bitcoin ETF filings, indicating that more work may need to be done to address the agency&#8217;s concerns. The SEC declined to comment on the Wall Street Journal report, while Nasdaq and Cboe were not available for immediate comment. The decision is a blow to asset managers&#8217; attempts to launch Bitcoin ETFs, which have been repeatedly blocked by regulators in the US. BTC’s Price Tumbles, Signaling The End Of The Bull Run?  The latest criticism by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on filings for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds has caused BTC’s price to drop from over $31,000 to $29,800.  Although Bitcoin is currently trading above the $30,000 line, there is uncertainty around the ETF filings by BlackRock and other major financial players, which could lead to another downtrend and a test of lower support. If this were to happen, Bitcoin bulls must hold the $29,500 line, which is the next support below $30,000. Additionally, Bitcoin&#8217;s 50-day moving average (MA) on the daily chart could provide strong support for the cryptocurrency, currently placed at $28,100. Related Reading: Ethereum Classic (ETC) Resumes Uptrend, Notches 13% In The Last Day Nevertheless, as reported on June 29th by NewsBTC, Bitcoin is likely to enter a 10-day period of downtrend due to the loss of the strength of the current uptrend, as noted by the Average Directional Index (ADX) on the 1-day chart. The ADX is a technical indicator that measures the strength of a trend and is used by traders to identify potential price movements. Bitcoin&#8217;s ADX is already spiking down, which suggests a potential shift in trend. Additionally, the squeeze momentum indicator also reflects the downtrend that Bitcoin could be poised to experience in the coming week and a half. Overall, the recent criticism by the US SEC of the filings for spot BTC ETFs by BlackRock and Fidelity adds to the uncertainty surrounding the cryptocurrency&#8217;s future price movements. If the asset managers cannot find common ground with the SEC&#8217;s expectations, their ETF applications could be in jeopardy.

					<description><![CDATA[The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has raised concerns about the recent filings for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), stating that they are insufficient. This comes after asset management giants BlackRock and Fidelity submitted their applications to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: Cardano Shows Signs of Recovery: When Will it Reach $0.30? The Wall Street Journal reported that the SEC shared its perspective on the filings with Nasdaq and Cboe. Specifically, the agency expressed that the filings lacked clarity and comprehensiveness. Following the release of this news, Bitcoin experienced a drop of nearly 2% in its value. Similarly, other altcoins, including XRP, also saw a decline in their respective charts. Over the past 24 hours, XRP witnessed a decrease of approximately 1%, while on the weekly chart, it recorded a loss of more than 4%. As a result, the technical outlook turned bearish, leading to a decrease in investor interest. The charts reflected a decline in both demand and accumulation. Currently, XRP is hovering around a crucial support level, and a breach of this level may potentially trigger an upward movement for XRP. The market capitalization of XRP decreased, indicating that sellers had a stronger grip on the market. XRP Price Analysis: One-Day Chart As of the time of writing, the altcoin XRP was trading at $0.46. Currently, XRP has reached its lowest level since the end of May. This level has historically acted as a significant support level for the coin. This level is often referred to as a bullish order block, and it has the potential to drive price recovery. Looking ahead, the first hurdle for XRP would be the resistance at $0.48, followed by a potential move above the $0.50 mark. However, if XRP faces another rejection at $0.50, it could lead to a return to trading at $0.46 and possibly even a further decline to $0.43. Technical Analysis Due to low demand, there has been a decline in buying interest. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below the half-line and close to the 40-mark, suggesting that buyers have lost their influence and sellers have gained control. Similarly, XRP has dropped below the 20-Simple Moving Average line. This indicates a weakening demand and implies that sellers are currently driving the price momentum in the market As demand for the altcoin decreased, the altcoin generated sell signals, although these signals were diminishing in size. This indicates that the bearish momentum might be subsiding. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed red histograms associated with the sell signals, but their size was decreasing. This suggests that while bearish sentiment still existed, the price could potentially experience a rebound in the near future.

<p>As demand for the altcoin decreased, the altcoin generated sell signals, although these signals were diminishing in size. This indicates that the bearish momentum might be subsiding.</p>
<p>The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed red histograms associated with the sell signals, but their size was decreasing. This suggests that while bearish sentiment still existed, the price could potentially experience a rebound in the near future.</p>

<p>When considering volatility, the Bollinger Bands are used. In this case, the bands were wide and parallel, indicating a range for the altcoin. The upper band, which aligned with the $0.52 price level, is expected to serve as a significant resistance level.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Institutional trade volume on the OKX Liquid Marketplace has surpassed $3 billion, the second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume announced on Friday. The Liquid Marketplace is an on-demand liquidity network for professional and institutional traders. This platform allows traders to send requests for quotes (RFQs) to market makers for large digital asset transactions.  OKX Liquid Marketplace Experiences Rapid Growth In Q2 In a press release on Friday, OKX announced that its Liquid Marketplace has now exceeded $3 billion. “This milestone is a testament to the Liquid Marketplace&#8217;s success in providing institutional traders with deep liquidity and reliable execution,” the press statement read.

In April 2023, OKX revealed that the institutional Liquid Marketplace recorded over $1 billion in trading volume in the first quarter of 2023. As of now &#8211; the end of June and 2023 Q2, this figure has more than tripled, surpassing the $3 billion mark. Furthermore, the Liquid Marketplace has been advancing in innovation and product development lately. A few days ago, OKX disclosed the launch of the “Nitro Spreads” feature on the institutional trading platform. Nitro Spreads allows professional and institutional traders to make complex basis trades in a single click. Basis trading refers to trading the difference between an asset’s price on two distinct markets, such as spot vs futures, to generate profits.  This type of trading can be cumbersome, as it usually requires both legs of the trade to be executed simultaneously. However, Nitro Spreads automates this process by executing the two legs of the trade via a central orderbook. On the Liquid Marketplace, traders can use the feature across any combination of the spot, perpetual, and futures markets. OKB Price Slows Down, Makes No Significant Movement In The Past Week While the OKX ecosystem has been surrounded by positivity in recent days, this has not been reflected in the price of OKB, the exchange’s native token. The coin has not registered any loss or gain in the past seven days, according to CoinGecko data. That said, the OKB token appears to be losing the momentum that pushed its price by nearly 13% in the previous week. The cryptocurrency has also not made any significant price movement since then.

Price data reveals that OKB has been in a ranging market in the past few months, trading between the $55 and $40 price points. Since reaching a yearly high of $57.98, the cryptocurrency’s price has decreased by roughly 23%. As of this writing, the OKB token changes hands at $44.53, representing a 2.6% price increase in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the coin has a 24-hour trading volume of more than $6 million, with a 33.7% increase in the last day.
