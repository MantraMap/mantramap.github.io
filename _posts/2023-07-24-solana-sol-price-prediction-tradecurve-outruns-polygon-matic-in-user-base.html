Tradecurve Becomes The Face Of Next-gen Cryptos
<p class="s5">After the collapse of the FTX exchange, which caused a loss of around $2 billion in the crypto market, investors have become apprehensive about centralized exchanges. The market trust in centralized exchanges has suffered a blow. Therefore, the demand for decentralized exchanges has increased, and Tradecurve (TCRV) is considered the best option by experts.</p>
<p class="s5">It is a unique blockchain platform, which enables users to trade a wide range of assets without relying on fiat payments. It keeps users&rsquo; identities anonymous, and allows them to trade privately.</p>
<p class="s5">On this platform, users are not required to undergo any KYC checks. This is contrary to existing trading platforms like ByBit and Robinhood, where users must share their personal details.</p>
<p class="s5">Its native crypto is TCRV, which will fuel the platform&rsquo;s ecosystem. The token&rsquo;s smart contract has been verified by Cyber Scope, and the team verification was performed by Assure DeFi. The token&rsquo;s presale is live, and currently progressing through the fourth stage, where a token is available for purchase at $0.018.</p>
<p class="s5">So far, the price of a token has increased by 80%, and is likely to rise to $0.025 in stage 5. Moreover, the platform&rsquo;s value may rise 50 times before the end of the presale round. Interestingly, only 40% of the total 1.8 billion tokens will be available during the presale.</p>
