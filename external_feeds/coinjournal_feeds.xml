<li>The British Museum is venturing into the Metervese following its partnership with the Sandbox.</li>
<li>Other museums including Ukraine&rsquo;s Kharkiv Art Museum have already ventured into the metaverse.</li>
<li>The Sandbox (SAND) token price reacted minimally following the partnership.</li>
</ul>
<p>The British Museum will be working with the Sandbox Metaverse development platform to bring it into the Metaverse, according to a July 27 <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSandboxGame/status/1684581767158566912?s=20">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>The partnership, according to the announcement, aims to develop fresh &ldquo;immersive experiences&rdquo; for users to learn about global history. The generation of a variety of digital collectibles will take into account the museum&rsquo;s various collections.</p>
<p>The chief operating officer and co-founder of the Sandbox Sebastien Borget called the partnership an opportunity to share the museum&rsquo;s collections with new audiences. He said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This is a great opportunity for The Sandbox players, regardless of where they are, to learn about and enjoy the amazing collections of human history, art, and culture in the British Museum.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2>The British Museum ventures into Web3</h2>
<p>The partnership also involves the licencing partner for the museum, a Web3 platform called laCollection, which has previously worked with top museums all over the world to digitise their collections.</p>
<p>The British Museum may be entering the Web3 space for the first time at this time, but it is not the first time a significant museum has entered the Metaverse.</p>
<p>A new exhibition on the expanding nexus between art and blockchain debuted this past spring at the Centre Pompidou, one of France&rsquo;s top museums for modern art and the location of the continent&rsquo;s first modern art collection. As part of a permanent exhibition, the museum unveiled items from some of the most coveted nonfungible token (NFTs) collections in the world, including CryptoPunks and Autoglyphs.</p>
<p>Prior to that, the Kharkiv Art Museum, one of Ukraine&rsquo;s oldest museums of modern art, started an NFT collection as a fundraiser to support its operations and safeguard its cultural heritage.</p>
<p>The first museum in Europe to tokenize a work of classical art with a million-euro value was the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp, Belgium.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Chancer revolutionises betting by making it possible to predict multiple events.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Chancer launched a presale on June 13, which has been happening fast.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The token is a 50x investment in the future as blockchain-based betting gains prominence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">A few weeks since Chancer launched a presale, investors have accumulated more than $1 million of the tokens. Very few presales raise these amounts that quickly, underlying a strong interest in the token of the peer-to-peer betting platform. As the world&rsquo;s first decentralised betting ecosystem, investors believe Chancer could be revolutionary. That stems from the growing interest in betting, which Chancer aims to take to the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>About Chancer and its P2P betting model</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer is a new blockchain-based betting platform. The platform will be powered by a $CHANCER token. The token will be the platform&rsquo;s medium of exchanging value and claiming winnings on successful bets and other rewards. There are a total of 1.5 billion Chancer tokens in supply, but only 65% are available for presale.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer aims to become the go-to destination for decentralised social and predictive markets. Betting on Chancer occurs through a P2P model, where users set their rules and odds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Picture this: You expect candidate X to win an election. Your peers may hold a contrary opinion. So, you place a bet against them for this probabilistic outcome. Under normal circumstances, you won&rsquo;t be able to bet on such a political event. Chancer allows betting via these less popular events.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Through Chancer, investors can bet on many events. They simply create a P2P Chancer market for the particular event or incidence and bet on it. In other words, Chancer increases investors&rsquo; choice and flexibility in betting. This makes the platform a remarkable way to decentralise betting and enable investors to be in charge.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The exciting bit is that users are rewarded for creating the P2P markets. The use case makes Chancer more than a betting platform. Users can also generate passive income by sharing the platform and staking the native token.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>How big is the P2P betting opportunity?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Since P2P betting is new, estimating the market size is down to estimations. However, it is easy to predict based on the market size and trends in traditional betting.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.polarismarketresearch.com/industry-analysis/sports-betting-market" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Market reports</u></a> point out that online sports betting was valued at $70.23 billion in 2021. This level is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.7% by 2030. Growth in technology and the proliferation of the digital arena are linked with these strong trends.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The projected growth in betting is positive for Chancer. Traditionally, sports betting dominated, but Cancer wants to bring new ways to bet. Coupled with the ever-growing popularity of blockchain, Chancer will craft a niche from traditional betting. It will also build a new niche that could increase the betting market size further through the P2P model.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Given the above, Chancer&rsquo;s betting market size is huge, conferring significant opportunities to investors. A strong demand for the platform is positive for the token and its ability to return huge.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Chancer prediction in 2023, 2024, and the future</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Chancer token&rsquo;s long-term value will be derived from the platform&rsquo;s continued use and demand. As such, quantifying the future value would be highly speculative. Most cryptocurrencies have risen by thousands of percentages after finding and earning the market trust. Thus, a potential 50x increase or more in the future is probable if Chancer lives to its promise.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, in the short term, $CHANCER could start to find higher values when it lists on Uniswap in Q3 2023. This is when the token will unlock more demand and rise, potentially by double or triple-digit percentages.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2024, $CHANCER could rise by over 1,000%. The basis for the prediction is that the main platform will allow $CHANCER to be deployed for real-world use cases. That could unlock organic demand that will sustain the token&rsquo;s value and push it to higher levels.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Immutable X token went vertical on Thursday and Friday morning after a series of partnerships.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Chancer token sale has continued, with the token sale hitting over $1.2 million.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/immutable-x/"><u>Immutable X</u></a> (IMX) price went parabolic on Friday even as the crypto market remained in a consolidation phase. The token jumped by more than 20% and reached a high of $0.9290, the highest level since May 6. In all, it has soared by more than 58% from the lowest point in June this year.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Immutable X new partnerships</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Immutable X is one of the biggest blockchains that focuses on gaming and non-fungible tokens (NFT) in the world. It is a layer-2 network that helps solve some of the main challenges in Ethereum&rsquo;s ecosystem. Some of those challenges are higher fees and slow transaction speeds in the network.</p>
<p dir="ltr">IMX, its native token, jumped on Friday, making it the best-performing cryptocurrency in the industry. This rally happened because of the growing partnerships in the network. On Thursday evening, the developers announced a new partnership with Helika Analytics. The partnership will see creators in the ecosystem do in-depth analysis using its no-code tools.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Ef Defense, a developer using Immutable tools, announced its commitment to Immmutable zkEVM tool. In a statement, the CEO said that Endless Frontier had over 30 million downloads, bringing over $80 million in revenue. He added:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I believe that collaborating with Immutable will offer us the opportunity to learn invaluable expertise on how to promote web3 games in various forms, communicate with users, and continue to develop the platform.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The statement came a day after Immutable revealed that the value of the pipeline of games in its ecosystem had grown to over $2.5 billion. This happened after the developer announced a new&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/polygon-and-immutable-partner-to-accelerate-web3-game-development/"><u>partnership with Polygon</u></a>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">IMX price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The 4H chart shows that the Immutable X crypto price made a strong recovery in the overnight session. This rally saw it reach a high of $0.9296, which was much higher than last month&rsquo;s low of $0.5584. It moved above the key resistance level at $0.8420, the highest point in June.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also, the token has moved above the 25-day and 50-day moving averages while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved to the overbought level. Therefore, the token will likely retreat and retest the support at $0.80.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/06/28/1690521209101-5688a74b-ba33-49e5-af13-094d3b0faea2.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="615" height="338"></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">AltSignals token sale continues</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Another important&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/"><u>crypto news</u></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>is that AltSignals&rsquo; token sale gained steam this week as the developers raised over $1.2 million. This amount represents about 54% of all the available tokens since the goal of this stage 2 is to raise $2.25 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Buy the AltSignals token&nbsp;<a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For starters, AltSignals is a company that hopes to incorporate artificial intelligence in the financial market. The developers will transition their already&ndash;profitable product to one that uses AI, neural language processing (NLP), and machine learning. You can read the comprehensive white paper <a href="https://token.altsignals.io/whitepaper.pdf"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition, once complete, the existing platform will transition from a centralized one into a fully decentralized one. In this, $CHANCER token holders will be able to vote for key activities in the network. There will also be profit-sharing mechanisms in the network.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are two main reasons for buying the ASI token. First, the token&rsquo;s price will be hiked by 12% in the next stage of the sale. This means that you can buy more tokens now.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Second, there is soaring demand for stocks and tokens in the AI industry. A good example of this is Intel, AMD, Nvidia, SingularityNET, and Fetch.ai. All these assets have jumped in the past few months.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Third, the Fed made what is likely the final interest rate of the year. This decision could lead to more crypto gains later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>FTX and Genesis are bankrupt and have been trying to collect funds for creditors under court supervision.</li>
<li>The agreement will resolve FTX&rsquo;s claims against Genesis debtors and vice versa.</li>
<li>Genesis is the largest unsecured creditor of FTX.</li>
</ul>
<p>Defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX has reached an in-principle agreement with the bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Genesis. Legal representatives from both companies informed bankruptcy judge Sean Lane in a letter dated July 27 that a deal had been reached.</p>
<p>Both businesses are in bankruptcy and have been working to recoup money for creditors while being watched over by the court.</p>
<p>The agreement would put an end to FTX&rsquo;s claims against the debtors of Genesis and vice versa. Additionally, it would rescind any ongoing motions pertaining to such claims. It was said that both sides intended to swiftly document and request court approval of the settlement.</p>
<p>The in-principle agreements stated:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Parties have reached an agreement in principle, subject to documentation, regarding a settlement that would resolve, among other things, the claims asserted by the FTX Debtors against the Debtors in these Chapter 11 Cases and the claims asserted by the Genesis Debtors against the FTX Debtors in the FTX Chapter 11 Cases.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2>What was the issue between Genesis and FTX?</h2>
<p>FTX previously asserted that Genesis, which is controlled by Digital Currency Group, owed the exchange up to $4 billion. However, in a letter earlier this month to Judge Lane, the exchange reportedly decreased the sum to $2 billion.</p>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/genesis-files-for-bankruptcy-what-does-it-mean-for-crypto/">Genesis filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> protection in a New York bankruptcy court in January following the failure of cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. According to court documents, the crypto lender owes FTX and its affiliates $226 million, making it the largest unsecured creditor.</p>
<p>Genesis estimated that it was entitled to claims totalling zero in June; but, with this most recent development, it appears that FTX debtors&rsquo; claims and objections have been resolved. This also comes amid speculations of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ftx-considering-relaunching-in-q2-after-asset-recovery/">FTX resuming operations</a> in the near future.</p>

<li>Bitcoin and EUR/USD have a direct correlation</li>
<li>EUR/USD leads</li>
<li>Bitcoin&rsquo;s recent bullish trend has been based solely on the dollar&rsquo;s weakness</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Today is the last trading day of a busy trading week in the traditional currency market. Three central banks (Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan) have announced their interest rate policy decisions.</p>
<p>For cryptocurrency traders, and especially for Bitcoin investors, the first two central banks directly impact Bitcoin&rsquo;s price action. As it turns out, after being part of numerous institutional investors&rsquo; portfolios, Bitcoin&rsquo;s price just follows the US dollar movements.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the volatility in the cryptocurrency space is much higher than in the traditional currency market. Nevertheless, one cannot ignore the direct correlation between the EUR/USD exchange rate and Bitcoin in the past several months.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/06/28/1690535318038-9b0a1c51-5fd0-4edf-bb48-47776119c574.jpg" style="width: 1800px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="1800" height="488"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/?exchange=CRYPTO" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bitcoin chart by TradingView</a></p>
<h2>Bitcoin and EUR/USD have a direct correlation &nbsp;</h2>
<p>EUR/USD bottomed in October last year and has rallied ever since. Sure enough, corrections appeared, but the overall trend remained in place.</p>
<p>The chart above shows the different cycles that the EUR/USD formed from left to right. Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin followed.</p>
<p>For example, despite making a new lower low at the end of 2022, Bitcoin bounced and rallied at the start of the new year. Basically, it caught up with the EUR/USD bullish trend.</p>
<p>Since then, every correction or rally on the EUR/USD pair was met with a similar response from Bitcoin. Therefore, it is fair to assume that if Bitcoin hodlers hope for the price to break and hold above $30k, it can only do so with a bullish EUR/USD price action.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Kin&rsquo;s path to decentralisation</h2>
<p dir="ltr">About 4.96 trillion KIN held by the foundation and 2.1 trillion KIN planned for burning by Kik should be destroyed by end of day Friday, July 28. That would see roughly 71% of the total KIN supply burned.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;As a next step, the 4.96T Kin Reserves will be sent to a new Solana address and burned. After this the 2.10T Kin that Kik has agreed to burn will follow the same process. Once these burns are complete I will publish a new post that shows the on chain proof of these burns. I am hopeful this will happen by the end of day tomorrow,&rdquo; the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kin/comments/15b7iwc/kin_burn_vote_passes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">update</a> read.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ted Livingston, founder and CEO of Code, says the burn will make Kin a fully decentralised cryptocurrency. There will be no inflation, foundation or website.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>The vote to burn the Kin Reserves has passed, with the vast majority of votes in support. Kin is about to become one of the only fully decentralised cryptocurrencies out there, with no inflation, no foundation, and no website. More details to come once the burn is complete</em>,&rdquo; he <a href="https://twitter.com/ted_livingston/status/1684579497386065923" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to data from CoinGecko, the cryptocurrency&rsquo;s current circulating supply is 2,207,205,857,149. The maximum supply is 10 trillion.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">KIN price surges</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://coinjournal.net/price/">price of KIN</a> soared after the vote closed, with the token&rsquo;s value having reached an intraday high of $0.000022. KIN was up 22% in the past 24 hours and more than 68% in the past week after its price jumped to highs near $0.000030 following the proposal.</p>
<p dir="ltr">KIN&rsquo;s all-time high of $0.00122572 was reached on January 7, 2018.</p>

<li>TD Cowen analyst sees upside in MicroStrategy to $520.</li>
<li>Lance Vitanza explained his bullish view in a research note.</li>
<li>MicroStrategy stock has already tripled since the start of 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p>MicroStrategy Inc has already tripled since the start of this year but a TD Cowen analyst continues to see further upside in this stock.</p>
<h2>MicroStrategy stock could climb to $520</h2>
<p>Lance Vitanza assumed coverage of the software company today with an &ldquo;outperform&rdquo; rating and said its shares could climb to $520 &ndash; up another 22% from here.</p>
<p>For institutional investors, he said in his research note, MicroStrategy stock is the best way to gain exposure to <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>MSTR uses all its retained earnings and then some to buy and hold BTC [that] reflects a belief that Bitcoin will prove a superior store of value relative to metals and fiat currencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Nasdaq-listed firm is set to report its Q2 earnings next week. <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/mstr/earnings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consensus</a> is for it to lose 71 cents a share versus an alarming $92.81 per share a year ago.</p>
<h2>MSTR trumps BTC or a Bitcoin ETF</h2>
<p>The Virginia-based company currently owns more than 150,000 Bitcoin in total.</p>
<p>Vitanza recommends MicroStrategy stock also because it&rsquo;s free from some of the fees related to investing directly in Bitcoin or a Bitcoin ETF. He&rsquo;s convinced that its underlying business serves as downside protection as well.</p>
<blockquote><p>We see MicroStrategy as an attractive vehicle for investors looking to gain Bitcoin exposure.</p></blockquote>
<p>MicroStrategy is lobbying for a change in accounting rules related to BTC which may also boost its financials. Bitcoin-specific catalysts, including &ldquo;<a href="https://decrypt.co/149829/bitcoin-halving-is-less-than-40000-blocks-away-heres-what-that-means/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">halving</a>&rdquo; and approval of a <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/united-states-sec-officially-accepts-valkyrie-spot-bitcoin-etf-application/">spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund</a> will also benefit MSTR, the TD Cowen analyst concluded.</p>

<li>PancakeSwap initially launched on BNB Chain but is now available on five blockchains.</li>
<li>The zkSync Era blockchain is the most recent blockchain that the DEX will be available on.</li>
<li>The move is aimed at expanding PancakeSwap&rsquo;s user base and increasing protocol revenue.</li>
</ul>
<p>The decentralized exchange PancakeSwap (CAKE) is now available on the zkSync Era blockchain according to a statement made by the DEX&rsquo;s creator &ldquo;Chef Cocoa&rdquo; on Thursday. While this is a major milestone for the DEX, the news has not caused a significant price movement on the native token <a href="https://coinjournal.net/pancakeswap/">CAKE</a>, seeing it has only gained about 1.40% today.</p>
<p>The move is consistent with PancakeSwap&rsquo;s goals to grow its user base and boost the protocol&rsquo;s income.</p>
<h2>Available Pancakeswap features on Era blockchain</h2>
<p>To start with, PancakeSwap&rsquo;s token swap and liquidity provisioning features will be available with transactional fees of 0.01% of the trading value.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, the farms feature that allows users to stake their liquidity pool (LP) tokens to earn CAKE while keeping the LP tokens will go live.</p>
<p>As a decentralized exchange, PancakeSwap uses smart contracts instead of middlemen to process trades, lending and lottery services for users. Besides zkSync Era, PancakeSwap is currently available on the BNB Chain, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>, Polygon zkEVM, and Aptos. As of Wednesday, the DEX held more than $1/57 billion worth of tokens according to data from DefiLlama.</p>
<p>On the other hand, zkSync Era, which was launched by Developer Matter Labs as an <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/what-is-ethereum/">Ethereum</a> layer 2 blockchain compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) allows developers to deploy applications between zkSync Era and the Ethereum mainnet using the same code.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Optimism and Arbitrum are some of the best-known layer-2 networks.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The two network&rsquo;s metrics have diverged in the past few days.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">These metrics include the number of users and open interest.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Optimism and Arbitrum ecosystems have diverged in the past few weeks. Arbitrum&rsquo;s number of active addresses has dropped from an all-time high of 191,612 in March this year to over 148k. Most recently, Optimism&rsquo;s users has been in an upward trend and reached a high of 132,893.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The same trend is happening in their the performance of their decentralized finance (DeFi) industry. Data compiled by DeFi Llama shows that Optimism&rsquo;s total value locked (TVL) in its ecosystem stands at over $1.27 billion while Arbitrum&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Arbitrum"><u>stands</u></a> at over $3 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The two ecosystems have been relatively stable in the past few weeks. However, while Arbitrum&rsquo;s TVL has dropped by 0.40% in the past 30 days, Optimism&rsquo;s TVl has risen by over 13% in the past 30 days. This makes it second only to Solana whose TVL has jumped by more than 30%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">TVL is an important metric in the crypto industry in that it shows the amount of money locked in a network. Ideally, a network with a higher TVL is seen as being more active. In this regard, the most active ecosystems are&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/"><u>Ethereum</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/tron"><u>Tron</u></a>, and BNB Chain.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additional data shows that the open interest of Optimism and Arbitrum&rsquo;s tokens has diverged. The open interest of Arbitrum futures stands at $160 million, where it has been in the past few months. Optimism&rsquo;s open interest, on the other hand, has been in an upward trend as you can see below. It rose to over $171 million this month and has now stabilised at $143 million.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A likely reason for this divergence is Worldcoin, the recently launched cryptocurrency. The WLD token has done well mostly because of the underlying technology and the fact that its creator is the founder of OpenAi, the company that introduced ChatGPT. Worldcoin is built on top of &nbsp;Optimism.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the same time, the OP token has outperformed Arbitrum&rsquo;s token. OP has risen by more than 20% this year while ARB token has risen by 4% in the past 30 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/06/27/1690475473039-1e535975-8d13-4f3d-b28f-6359512697e6.png" style="width: 640px;height: 311.018px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="640" height="311.018"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, the next catalyst for Optimism token will be the upcoming token unlock that will happen on Sunday. The event will see the number of outstanding tokens jump according to the vesting schedule.</p>
