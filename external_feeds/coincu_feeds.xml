<p>The crypto business owes $3.8 billion to its top creditors, who include hedge fund manager <strong>VanEck</strong> and the <strong>Stellar Development Foundation</strong>, the makers of <strong>XRP</strong> competitor Stellar, according to recent voluntary bankruptcy filings (XLM).</p>

Previously, <strong>the now-bankrupt crypto firm and Gemini teamed to launch Gemini&#8217;s Earn program</strong>, which let retail investors earn money by lending out their digital assets.</p>



<p>As reported in the statement, the firm owes $765 million to members of Gemini&#8217;s Earn program, the largest single sum it owes.</p>

<p>Three voluntary applications were submitted to the bankruptcy court by <strong>Genesis Global Holdco, LLC</strong>, <strong>Genesis Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd.</strong>, and<strong> Genesis Global Capital, LLC</strong>. </p>



<p>Last year, <strong>the business encountered difficulties when crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital failed</strong>, resulting in liquidity challenges. The crypto broker&#8217;s difficulties were aggravated by the failure of FTX.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">While we have made significant progress refining our business plans to remedy liquidity issues caused by the recent extraordinary challenges in our industry, including the default of Three Arrows Capital and the bankruptcy of FTX, an in-court restructuring presents the most effective avenue through which to preserve assets and create the best possible outcome for all Genesis stakeholders.</p>

<p><strong>The price movement and whale buildup occur as the ecosystem prepares for the introduction of Shibarium</strong>, a projected layer-2 solution that intends to provide scalability among other benefits.</p>



<p>Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), the token that will be used to purchase gas on Shibarium, has also seen gains since the beginning of the year. <strong>BONE is now up 60% year to date</strong>, trading at $1.40 at the time of writing.</p>



<p>Shibarium was teased earlier this month by Shiba Inu creators, but <strong>no particular release date has been established</strong>.</p>



<p>Previously, Coincu reported that the world’s greatest Ethereum (ETH) whales’ <strong>Shiba Inu (SHIB) holdings have increased by hundreds of millions of dollars in less than a week.</strong></p>

<p>Treasure, which was first constructed on the Ethereum mainnet,<strong> eventually switched to Arbitrum</strong>, an optimistic rollup scaling solution that resolves transactions off-chain for cheaper costs. Arbitrum does not yet have a token.</p>



<p>Treasure&#8217;s native coin and natural resource is <strong>MAGIC</strong>. Treasure intends to build a decentralized video gaming ecosystem.</p>



<p>Treasure has officially <strong>established a new Game Builders Program (GBP) to incentivise the development of aligned</strong>, high-potential games in the Treasure ecosystem. According to a Treasure post, Arbitrum supports the initiative.</p>

<p>Arbitrum isn&#8217;t the only Ethereum layer-2 that is thriving. <strong>Optimism (OP)</strong>, another prominent Ethereum scaling solution, reached an all-time high of $2.50 on Saturday, representing a gain of almost<strong> 175%</strong> since the beginning of 2023.</p>



<p>Polygon (MATIC), the most valuable Ethereum scaling solution by market cap, is presently trading at $0.99, up over 31% year to date.</p>

<p><strong>A monthly closing over $20,000 on the trader&#8217;s chart is a high period positive for Bitcoin</strong>. If BTC ends the month on a positive tone, DonAlt&#8217;s initial high timeframe resistances are around $35,000, followed by $58,800.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $22,975, seeing an increase of nearly 9% over the last 7 days.</p>



<p>DonAlt believes that Bitcoin will continue to rise until bears cease shorting it, saying that <strong>this rally is basically sidelined capital pain fueled by bears retard shorting sub $20k</strong>. That narrative doesn&#8217;t really allow for pullbacks until we&#8217;re getting close to the top. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">So uponly until bears/sidelinooors buy then downonly for a while is my best guess</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The crypto expert also notes that <strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s recent rise above $20,000 resembles BTC&#8217;s peak at $69,000</strong>. DonAlt claims that Bitcoin printed bogus breakout setups in both cases.</p>

<p>As he wrote, they are still active on socials and he expects that <strong>they start making announcements and trying to raise prices again to take advantage of this rally</strong>. The reclaim and retest setup that has been seen broadly across all Altcoins is on the table as well.</p>

<p><strong>Optimism (OP)</strong>, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, is the final currency on the trader&#8217;s radar (ETH). Cantering Clark predicts that <strong>OP will set new all-time highs.</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">OP is about to enter price discovery. This means anyone who sold before was wrong, and new highs usually bring inflows from all types of traders. New all-time high after a prolonged period of time is +expected value buy.</p>

<p><strong>Hish</strong> <strong>Bouabdallah</strong>, founder and CEO of Tribes, said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Web3 primitives for co-ownership and collective action are transformative but few people can make sense of the existing products and processes required. In order to realize the full promise of Web3, nailing collective action is absolutely essential. Our approach to embed it directly into group chat makes these powerful and newly-possible Web3 actions understandable and accessible to the masses.”</p>

<p>Tribes group wallets allow users to co-own and manage digital assets while corresponding directly within the wallet as opposed to using a third-party chat platform like Discord or Twitter. </p>



<p><strong>Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)</strong>, token-gated groups with a common goal, as well as something as basic as family members seeking to partake in property ownership, are some examples of use cases. Digital assets like <strong>non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</strong>, memberships, and currencies may all be sent, received, and stored in wallets. The group must agree in order to send or use any of its resources.</p>



<p>Best-in-class technologies are combined in the Tribes social wallet, including <strong>Gnosis Safe<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </strong>multi-signature smart contracts, secure in-app signatures or <a href="https://news.coincu.com/147556-coinbase-wallet-no-support-xrp-jan-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase Wallet</a> for transaction signing, and support for Web3 identity (ENS, Lens, etc.) for co-owner collaboration.</p>

<p>The hacking outfit Lazarus Group, which was responsible for the <strong>$635 million Ronin Bridge hack, is thought to be responsible for the attack and the subsequent transactions.</strong></p>



<p>Before shifting the money to different exchanges last week, the hackers transmitted <strong>$63.5 million (41,000 ETH) to Railgun, a cryptocurrency wallet that prioritizes secrecy.</strong> After that, the bitcoin (BTC) was taken out of the exchanges and part of it was bridged to the Avalanche network.</p>



<p>The bridged bitcoin was exchanged for<strong> the stablecoins tether (USDT) and USDD</strong>, which were then transmitted to a multi-chain USDT address on both the Ethereum and Tron networks in an effort to further obscure the stolen assets.</p>



<p>After the U.S. sanctioned well-known coin mixing provider Tornado Cash, hackers are being compelled to take exceptional measures in order to convert stolen cryptocurrency to fiat currency.</p>



<p>In 2022,<strong> 125 hacks resulted in the loss of more than $3 billion in cryptocurrency,</strong> according to blockchain security company Chainalysis.</p>

<p><strong>Floor, the startup behind the NFT portfolio app of the same name</strong>, raised $8 million last year and claims sizable growth for its token-gated app amid the NFT bear market. The firm has now unveiled the next step in its plans to grow both its feature set and audience, <a href="https://mirror.xyz/treasury.floornfts.eth/eLoZs5lRYfq84qgRd3eRJwC4Gd1V5btakPYBciBYBoA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcing today</a> that it has acquired NFT analytics platform.</p>



<p>While Floor delivers a streamlined way for <strong>NFT collectors to view and track their holdings</strong>, WGMI.io is focused on analytics around market activity and trading trends. Together, they aim to deliver richer features for Floor users while bringing WGMI’s analytics features to a potentially broader audience.</p>



<p>WGMI, formed by Thomas Mancini a year ago and named for the<strong> &#8220;we&#8217;re going to make it&#8221; slogan popular in crypto areas, will assist in developing web3 analytics for Floor, which touts itself as an app &#8220;for everything NFTs.&#8221;</strong></p>



<p>Speaking with Thomas revealed a synergy between the WGMI acquisition and the Floor aim to make NFTs intelligible and accessible. founder of Floor, Chris Maddern.</p>



<p>The transaction occurs as NFT prices have fallen precipitously over the past 12 months.<strong> Floor received $8 million in Series A </strong>funding last year. The business claimed that during the 2022 bad market, it increased by over 700%, with 20,000 active wallets on the platform each month.</p>

<p>A shadow fork is a test version of the mainnet that enables engineers to determine whether a section of code from the planned upgrade will function properly on the actual blockchain. Around 5:30 a.m. ET, the Shanghai upgrade test was conducted.</p>



<p>According to<strong> Geth creator Marius Van Der Wijden, there were a few small technical challenges with Ethereum&#8217;s nodes switching to Geth clients after the fork</strong>. However, the problems were resolved by developers, and now all nodes are in accord. Van Der Wijden noted that more testing will be done to make sure everything functions properly.</p>



<p>Shanghai will enable users to access their staked coins that were momentarily rendered inaccessible during the transition known as <strong>&#8220;The Merge&#8221; in September.</strong> Withdrawals will be made available on the mainnet in March. While withdrawals will be the main feature, developers have also completed three other enhancements that will reduce gas expenses for specific activities.</p>



<p>Before the end of February, developers are thinking on launching a public test network that would allow staking companies to test the Shanghai upgrade. There will be more shadow forks in the upcoming weeks.</p>

<p>NYDFS superintendent Adrienne Harris stated in a Jan. 23 statement that cryptocurrency companies and exchanges operating under a BitLicense, which is required in New York state,<strong> should separate corporate funds from users&#8217; virtual currency holdings both on-chain and in the &#8220;internal ledger accounts&#8221; of the company&#8217;s custodian.</strong> The regulator states that cryptocurrency companies must only hold user money &#8220;for the restricted purpose of carrying out custody and safekeeping services&#8221;:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“A [virtual currency entity’s] customer agreement should make clear the parties’ intentions to enter into a custodial relationship, rather than a debtor-creditor relationship.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The NYDFS further stated that all licensed businesses that custody assets must &#8220;keep suitable books and records&#8221; and publish information about their goods and services in terms and conditions that are made available to customers.<strong> According to Harris, the advice was intended to ensure the &#8220;safekeeping of customer assets.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>The announcement came after a number of American-based cryptocurrency exchanges, including<strong> FTX, BlockFi, Voyager Digital, and Genesis, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in response to some alleged liquidity concerns. </strong>Despite bankruptcy procedures, many former consumers of the crypto companies have not been compensated.</p>

<p>In reference to New York&#8217;s BitLicense system, Harris said during a speech in November 2022 that federal lawmakers should take into account a &#8220;framework nationwide that looks like what New York has&#8221; in terms of crypto regulation. Additionally, the NYDFS has previously published regulatory guidelines for stablecoins backed by the US dollar.</p>
