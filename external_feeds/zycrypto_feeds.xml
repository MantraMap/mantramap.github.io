<p>While many <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-whale-burns-2500-eth-crypto-community-questions-motive/">Ether</a> proponents remain convinced that the altcoin will overthrow Bitcoin, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency market asserts that Ether still has a long way to go.</p>



<p>After the Ethereum network successfully carried out the highly anticipated merge, market players were on the lookout for a massive price rally that could result in Ether overthrowing Bitcoin in the long term.</p>



<p>However, a prominent crypto market analyst, Benjamin Cowen, has pushed back on these sentiments. Cowen noted that the ETH/BTC pairs have steadily declined since the merge.</p>



<p>“<em>The flippening narrative gets promoted a lot, and more so following the merge. But if the merge were a game changer that would lead to ETH flipping BTC, why has ETH / BTC been putting in lower highs and lower lows since the merge? Narratives are fun. Price action is king.”</em> Cowen wrote.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The flippening narrative gets promoted a lot, and more so following the merge.<br><br>But if the merge were a game changer that would lead to ETH flipping BTC, why has <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ETH?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ETH</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BTC</a> been putting in lower highs and lower lows since the merge?<br><br>Narratives are fun.<br><br>Price action is king. <a href="https://t.co/7VGv9p6CZX">pic.twitter.com/7VGv9p6CZX</a></p>&mdash; Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) <a href="https://twitter.com/intocryptoverse/status/1689074298026065920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 9, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>While the merge has not triggered a flippening, it has enhanced Ethereum’s overall performance. The Merge was the co-joining of the Ethereum mainnet (the original execution layer of the Ethereum network) with the Beacon Chain (Proof of Stake blockchain).</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-merge-goes-live-and-a-new-era-for-ethereum-begins-heres-the-whole-bushel/">The merge was essential</a> for Ethereum to fix some of its longstanding scalability issues. After the merge, Ethereum’s carbon footprint reduced significantly, while the network sustained security using staked ETH.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-market-participants-are-bullish-on-ether-nbsp"><strong>Market participants are bullish on Ether&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The analyst’s comments come not long after a recent survey conducted by CryptoVantage found that 47% of Ether investors were hopeful that Ether will dethrone Bitcoin. For the survey, CryptoVantage interviewed 1,000 North Americans who also happen to have invested in Ether over the past five years.</p>



<p>Although there is no telling what could happen in the long term, the near-term predictions are notably bullish. Back in July, Fidelity Digital Assets rolled out its Q2 2023 Signals Report. The report highlighted a positive outlook for Ether, stating that the next 12 months are highly promising for the asset.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that Ether (ETH) has already seen its year-to-date gains surge by 62%, despite the constant fluctuation in price value.</p>



<p>At report time, Ether is trading for $1,851. The asset has sustained mild losses over the last 24 hours, although the bulls have successfully cleared out weekly losses.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Bitcoin is heading towards the $30,000 price mark after momentum last month. Bitcoin is now valued at a press time price of $29,410.</p>

<p>Data from blockchain analytics platform Santiment shows <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-whales-re-emerge-as-on-chain-transactions-hit-6-month-high-1-ada-price-incoming/">whales are eagerly stocking up on ADA</a>, Cardano’s native cryptocurrency. The numbers of ADA added to existing wallets which hold between 100,000 and 10 million ADA, have soared to heights last seen in September 2022.</p>



<p>Santiment wrote: <em>“As Cardano sits just above $0.29, whales and sharks holding between 100K-10M $ADA have accumulated back to their highest level since September, 2022. Additionally, on-chain transaction volume has been rising nearly every week for the past 6 months.”</em></p>



<p>Despite the legal woes caused by the SEC’s blanket assumption that dozens of cryptocurrencies, including ADA, are securities, daily trading volumes have steadily risen to over 67 billion ADA. The whales and sharks in question have amassed $116.1 million more in ADA since May 21 of 2023.</p>



<p>The renewed interest has, however, attracted bad actors, it seems. According to some in the Cardano community, a potential rug pull of 60,000 ADA has occurred, it seems the associated Twitter account from blockchainmages has since been deleted.</p>



<p>Popular community member Cardano Whale, who regularly buys hundreds of thousands of ADA worth of DeFi (decentralized finance) tokens to jump-start emerging projects on Cardano, was among the victims, it appears.</p>



<p>The ADA whale said on Twitter: <em>“I have to own this one. Been too naive again.”</em> Prompting a timely reminder of the pitfalls that still exist in crypto. Of course, 60k ADA seems negligible compared to the over 600 million ADA that makes up the Cardano DeFi space, according to data from DefiLama.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cardano-developments-gain-momentum"><strong>Cardano Developments Gain Momentum</strong></h2>



<p>Nevertheless, the increased interest during this bear market also comes from some interesting developments in the Cardano ecosystem. Currently, in the second last stage of development, called Basho, the network now focuses on scalability and predictability before the previous phase, Voltaire targets governance.</p>



<p>The main projects right now are Hydra which, as a layer 2 solution, increases scalability and resource utilization; Mithril, on the other hand, improves the speed and throughput of nodes on the network. Additionally, side chains will free up the main chain while optimizations will change block structure, leading to fewer resources being tied up on-chain.</p>



<p>Further, in late July, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-ada-network-achieves-zero-downtime-milestone-amidst-high-user-engagement/">Cardano achieved the milestone of zero downtime</a> in over 2,130 days, highlighting the network&#8217;s track record of reliability. At the time of writing, ADA traded for $0.29, a slight plus of 1% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>

<p>Gemini Cryptocurrency exchange has officially listed <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-hanging-by-a-thread-as-sec-finally-moves-for-appeal-against-ripple-what-to-expect-next/">XRP</a> on its platform. </p>



<p>The New York-based exchange made this known on Thursday in an official announcement. XRP holders can access USD trading pairs on its API/FIX and ActiveTrader application.</p>



<p>“<em>We are delighted to announce support for XRP Ledger (XRP), adding a new blockchain to Gemini’s growing list of supported networks! XRP is now available for trading on our API/FIX and ActiveTrader applications for USD trading pairs and on the Gemini Mobile App and website for USD, GBP, EUR, CAD, SGD, HKD, and AUD pairs!”</em> The announcement read. </p>



<p>Notably, the recent addition has increased the number of Gemini exchange blockchains to 13. The numbers will likely increase as Gemini continues to expand its network.</p>



<p><em>“With the addition of XRP Ledger, Gemini is now compatible with 13 blockchain networks, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Polkadot (DOT), Avalanche (AVAX), Cosmos (ATOM), Zcash (ZEC), Filecoin (FIL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Tezos (XTZ).”</em> The announcement read. </p>



<p>It is worth noting that while XRP can be stored on Gemini’s exchange wallet, it is not yet available in Gemini Custody.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xrp-records-price-jump-following-gemini-s-announcement"><strong>XRP records price jump following Gemini’s announcement</strong></h2>



<p>After Gemini announced its support for the XRP Ledger, XRP saw a wild upswing in its price on the exchange. XRP’s price skyrocketed to $50 on the exchange; however, the price rally was short-lived. </p>



<p>One XRP user took to social media to explain that the price surge resulted from a glitch on the Gemini Crypto exchange. Meanwhile, at report time, XRP is trading for $0.63.</p>



<p>Price predictions for XRP are still primarily bullish, as some market players expect the asset to hit a new all-time high in the near term. One popular XRP proponent who seems to share this bullish sentiment has predicted that the asset <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pundit-highlights-possibility-of-xrp-price-at-1800-as-ripple-enters-1-quadrillion-derivatives-market/">could surge to $1,896</a>. </p>



<p>Although the XRP proponent did not share a timeframe for his bullish call, he cites Ripple’s addition to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) as a catalyst for the expected price pump.</p>



<p>“<em>Now that Ripple has joined ISDA, take a look at the possibilities for XRP Price and adoption. $1,896.23 per XRP. It&#8217;s always been about how much adoption, what Percentage will Ripple and XRP get from the remittance/clearing/settling derivatives market?”</em> He wrote.</p>

<p>Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-primed-for-huge-price-outburst-after-shibarium-beta-bridge-goes-live-for-public-testing/">Shiba Inu</a>, has boldly asserted that the upcoming Shibarium blockchain will outshine Elon Musk&#8217;s X platform and other major crypto projects like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sam-altmans-crypto-project-worldcoin-targets-2-billion-users-with-worldwide-launch/">Worldcoin</a>.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, LUCIE, a notable Shiba Inu team member, <a href="https://twitter.com/LucieSHIB/status/1689386244952760321">shared</a> a screenshot of Kusama&#8217;s proclamation in the Shibarium Discord group. The statement read, &#8220;<em>With Shibarium, we will X-plain (apologies for the pun) why EXACTLY Shib surpasses X or any token that resorts to scanning your eyeballs or other tactics in their efforts to counter this global movement.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Whereas the developer gave no additional information, the bold claim could place Shibarium in direct competition with Elon Musk&#8217;s company X, which is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-eyes-record-highs-as-elon-musk-hints-on-some-exciting-news-doge-payments-coming-to-x/">exploring payment functionality</a> within the social media platform.</p>



<p>After purchasing Twitter last year, Musk shared his vision for the platform, including adding payment features, with the potential for crypto-functionality. His recent decision to rebrand Twitter to X and make it an “everything app” further cemented this vision, potentially broadening the use of Dogecoin, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Notably, even before Musk&#8217;s leadership, Twitter had already been exploring features <a href="https://zycrypto.com/twitters-bitcoin-tipping-feature-big-win-for-crypto/">related to tipping</a> and e-commerce. The introduction of Lightning-based Bitcoin tips marked a pivotal step in these updates, followed closely by including Ether tips and support for NFTs.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Shibarium, the highly anticipated blockchain project within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, is expected to play a pivotal role in boosting the cryptocurrency&#8217;s scalability, speed, and affordability. With Ethereum&#8217;s rising gas fees necessitating a more efficient alternative, Shibarium emerges as a solution that addresses these challenges and opens doors for new decentralized applications (dApps). Its launch will mark a significant shift for Shiba Inu, transitioning from a meme token to a versatile and utility-driven crypto asset, potentially posing stiff competition to other payment networks and platforms.</p>



<p>As <em>ZyCrypto</em> <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-monster-move-draws-near-amid-imminent-launch-of-shibarium-in-august/">reported</a>, Shibarium&#8217;s official launch is scheduled for the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto, Canada, from August 13<sup>th</sup> to 17<sup>th,</sup> 2023. That said, as Shiba Inu seeks to transform its meme-inspired origins into a fully functional and valuable ecosystem, the clash of visions between Kusama&#8217;s Shibarium and Musk&#8217;s X platform will undoubtedly be a development to watch out for.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, amid these developments, Shiba Inu’s native token, “SHIB”, has continued to soar, surging by an impressive 18% over the past seven days as the community anticipates the ecosystem developments pushing the SHIB price to $0.001. At press time, the cryptocurrency was trading at $0.000010 after a brief dip of 1.4% over the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>Jose Fernandez da Ponte, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Blockchain, Crypto, and Digital Currencies at PayPal, recently shared insights into the company&#8217;s new venture, a stablecoin named PYUSD. The executive spoke to<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/08/08/watch-full-interview-paypal-jose-fernandez-da-ponte-new-stablecoin.html"> CNBC</a>, expressed enthusiasm for the technology, and highlighted its potential for revolutionizing the payment space.</p>



<p>Stablecoins are emerging as a significant application for blockchain technology. Considering PayPal&#8217;s deep involvement in the payments sector, da Ponte outlined the inherent advantages of stablecoins. These advantages, including reduced costs, enhanced programmability, and quicker settlement times compared to traditional methods, da Ponte called stablecoins the “killer app for blockchain technologies right now”. With increasing institutional interest, growing demand for additional tokens, and evolving regulations, PayPal sees the opportunity to enter crypto.</p>



<p>PYUSD hopes to unlock novel functionalities for users compared to traditional fiat currency. By offering cost-effective transactions, programmable capabilities, and swift settlement times, the stablecoin appeals to businesses and consumers alike. Notably, da Ponte emphasized that while the transition to stablecoin usage might not be immediate, it could provide significant advantages in specific use cases like remittances and digital goods.</p>



<p>There are concerns about regulatory scrutiny and scepticism surrounding large tech companies entering the crypto space, as seen with Facebook and Diem. Da Ponte, however, underscored PayPal&#8217;s position as a regulated financial institution with over two decades of experience in the payments industry, having a track record in risk management, compliance, and regulatory expertise.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-differentiating-use-cases"><strong>3 Differentiating Use Cases</strong></h2>



<p>Da Ponte explained the need for another stablecoin and precisely one by PayPal, due to 3 main differentiating factors.</p>



<p>The integration of PYUSD with Venmo, the PayPal-owned platform, promises to leverage access to an increased network. This integration will enable dollar-denominated value transfers between Venmo and PayPal accounts, fulfilling a long-standing user demand. Additionally, this move opens avenues for PayPal merchants to receive payments from Venmo users, expanding their customer base.</p>



<p>According to da Ponte, the second pull factor for PYUSD is the Fiat connectivity PayPal can offer. Moving funds quickly between Fiat and web3 and acquiring funds with a debit card ensures seamless access.</p>



<p>And finally, as a regulated company with almost 25 years of experience, PayPal sees itself well positioned with a strong compliance framework and infrastructure, which others still need to build.</p>



<p>And then there is the potential role PYUSD may play in international remittances. Da Ponte stated that while currently focusing on launching in the US, PayPal has set the groundwork for international remittances using compatible wallets and exchanges. Additionally, PayPal&#8217;s existing international P2P and remittance business will align with PYUSD&#8217;s capabilities, enhancing the scope for cross-border transactions.</p>



<p>He highlighted that PYUSD runs on the Ethereum network as an ERC-20 token and is very easy to support and interact with. Da Ponte said, &#8220;And let&#8217;s not forget that PayPal has its own international P2P and its own remittances business, and we also want to bring those assets in play.”</p>

<p>Cardano has experienced a notable increase in decentralized application (dapp) transactions, highlighting the thriving growth of its ecosystem.</p>



<p>According to a report by crypto research firm Messari, the average daily dapp transactions on Cardano had risen by an impressive 49% Quarter-over-Quarter (QoQ). This activity surge was driven by various factors, including introducing new dapps and enhanced infrastructure within the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-ada-network-achieves-zero-downtime-milestone-amidst-high-user-engagement/">Cardano ecosystem</a>. As per the report, among the standout contributors to this growth was Minswap, an automated market maker (AMM), which experienced substantial growth, bolstering the overall increase in dapp transactions. </p>



<p>Furthermore, the Total Value Locked (TVL) in USD on Cardano exhibited a robust upward trajectory, marking a 9.7% QoQ rise and an astonishing 198.6% Year-to-date increase. Cardano&#8217;s ascent in TVL ranking across all blockchain networks was equally remarkable, moving from the 34th to the 21st spot.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4Ab4h61jnFs0XGc4Pcowj0bpLjBIfAOiTMiSGND38Km5Dl8oSHZlq0LddgXq6-zrfQzztUVD8cDM055l59m4PAtcw4fhnE-AZNfEY7CUq5lBGyfgbspGdvBklVMEqvO7O8SI43yhHkpjuqQkOgjd-Q" alt=""/></figure>



<p>One of the biggest contributors towards this growth has been the development of Hydra Head, a layer 2 scaling protocol for Cardano. The innovation aimed at increasing transaction speeds and lower costs has attracted a lot of attention from creators who continue to build. Moreover, the continued efforts in sidechain development, notably by projects like Milkomeda C1, Midnight, Wanchain, and IOG&#8217;s sidechains team, have also enhanced interoperability and paved the way for new applications within the broader Cardano landscape. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/r7FNs9eY-aga30nDamqMXyO2DwwPycD4zZ9JP9P1Kgn9bEyupSx4tikyoPfvjL_KuUbn_uETKDcPdctMOpuoAVyvryp9KEXudkO8B5a2lW8-cK4JfDZ83mSKUcljtH7uekcYmf-BB4vjII1KKa5d6A" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Cardano has made significant strides in the past year, with key milestones such as the Alonzo hard fork enabling smart contracts on the network. This set Cardano apart in the competitive smart contract network space by entering markets like DeFi and NFTs. Last week, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-gears-up-for-mithril-mainnet-launch-bolstering-network-efficiency-and-versatility-for-ada/">Mithril,</a> an innovative stake-based signature protocol aimed at elevating the network&#8217;s speed and effectiveness through enhanced node synchronization efficiency, was also formally introduced on the Cardano mainnet.</p>



<p>That said, with a diverse range of dapps, improved infrastructure, and the continual pursuit of enhanced scalability, Cardano stands poised to make a significant impact in the broader blockchain industry. This is so, especially considering that ADA&#8217;s utility extended beyond price speculation to settling network fees, stake pool registration, and staking to secure the network.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, despite the developments, ADA&#8217;s price and market cap continues to experience fluctuations. Interestingly, however, the cryptocurrency has maintained a resilient performance, with a 12.0% YTD increase. ADA was trading at $0.29 at press time, down roughly 0.40% in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>Galaxy Digital founder and CEO Mike Novogratz has shared insights on the factors that could lead to Bitcoin&#8217;s resurgence to all-time highs.</p>



<p>Speaking to Bloomberg Wealth host <a href="https://zycrypto.com/billionaire-investor-david-rubenstein-wishes-he-had-bought-bitcoin-at-100-for-this-sole-reason/">David Rubenstein</a> on Wednesday, Novogratz mentioned that the Federal Reserve&#8217;s pivot towards monetary easing and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/multiple-spot-bitcoin-etf-approvals-on-the-way-cathie-wood-predicts/">approving a Bitcoin ETF</a> as key events could drive Bitcoin&#8217;s price substantially higher.</p>



<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price has remained sideways, hovering near $30,000 after breaching the $25,000 resistance in March. Amid regulatory issues and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s influence, the cryptocurrency has struggled to gain momentum, with experts divided on whether the next bullish phase has already kicked off or it’s just a relief rally.</p>



<p>Novogratz’s involvement in crypto began around 2013 before founding Galaxy Digital, an investment firm focused on digital and crypto assets, in 2018, after experiencing a successful career in traditional finance. Novogratz reminisced about his initial Bitcoin investment when the cryptocurrency was trading at around $100. He disclosed that he was convinced by a friend to go down the rabbit hole before spending three million dollars on his initial Bitcoin purchase and riding the bull market to the top.</p>



<p>However, Novogratz, often called an “elder statesman” of the crypto industry, acknowledged that he had been a victim of the subsequent market crash, blaming it on bad actors.</p>



<p>“<em>When every Central Bank in the world just flooded the world with money as a macro asset, it was supposed to go up and then come back down and it did. It went further than it should have because, in the excitement of building this crypto industry, we attracted a lot of frauds,”</em> he said, citing FTX and Celsius.</p>



<p>Novogratz also touched on the impact of major financial institutions like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/approval-incoming-sec-officially-acknowledges-blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-application/">BlackRock entering the crypto space</a>. He highlighted the significance of BlackRock&#8217;s involvement and its plan to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), signalling a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in traditional finance.</p>



<p><em>“I think the most important thing that happened this year in Bitcoin is Larry Fink got orange pilled,” </em>he said. <em>“As we say, orange pill is when you take a non-believer, you make them a believer in Bitcoin and Larry was a non-believer. Now, he says this is going to be a global currency…that&#8217;s kind of huge.”</em></p>



<p>That said, despite the recent challenges faced by the crypto industry, Novogratz remains a staunch believer in the resilience of the crypto community. He acknowledged the industry&#8217;s toughness and compared it to the equity community, noting the religious zeal that many in the Bitcoin community possess.</p>

<p>In a bid to simplify the complex world of web3 and bridge the gap between blockchain&#8217;s potential and user apprehension, Aptos Labs has joined forces with tech giant Microsoft. The partnership that intends to revolutionize tokenization and digital payments while offering an easy entry point into the complex world of blockchain technology has caused a surge in the Aptos token.</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/aptos-mainnet-to-experience-nft-boom-despite-network-scalability-problems/">Aptos Labs</a> launched the Aptos Assistant to increase the user experience for onboarding new web3 users. The tool, which is hoped to simplify entry into web3, connects web2 and web3 seamlessly for the common internet user and organizations alike. The Aptos Assistant is a knowledgeable companion, answering Aptos blockchain queries in plain language. In addition to providing tutorials for new users, it also points developers in the direction of pertinent resources as they build smart contracts and decentralized apps.</p>



<p>The CEO of Aptos Labs, Mo Shaikh, emphasized the fusion of AI with blockchain, which he claims is a significant change, reshaping the digital environment. <em>&#8220;Together with Microsoft, our shared vision is to ensure that this technology is accessible to more people and organizations than ever before,&#8221;</em> Shaikh affirms.</p>



<p>Rashmi Misra, General Manager at Microsoft, echoed the idea and said, <em>&#8220;the intersection of AI and blockchain is one of the most interesting combinations of emerging technologies and can generate transformational use cases.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>The partnership is an ambitious move forward in the growth of web3 usage in financial services and may include asset tokenization, payments, and even central bank digital currencies. Aptos will also increase the security and dependability of its blockchain by hosting validator nodes on Microsoft&#8217;s Azure network.</p>



<p>Aptos Labs&#8217; driving force consists of talented engineers who have dealt with the intricacies of blockchain on a large scale. Their experience highlights Microsoft and Aptos&#8217; joint commitment to decentralization.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aptos-token-up"><strong>Aptos Token Up</strong></h2>



<p>Aptos Labs, the brainchild of Mo Shaikh and Avery Ching, is the developer behind layer 1 blockchain Aptos with its native APT token. The former Facebook employees aim to streamline network tools and improve usability, bringing the advantages of decentralization to a wider audience. Several well-known investors, including a16z, Jump Crypto, Apollo Global, Franklin Templeton, Dragonfly, PayPal Ventures, and Coinbase Ventures, have raised more than $400 million for the company.</p>



<p>The relationship between Aptos and Microsoft has the potential for democratizing blockchain usage and ushering in an era of cutting-edge digital solutions as they set their sights on a collaborative future.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, APT, the Aptos token is at $7.34, up 9.34% in the past 24 hours, data from CoinMarketCap shows.</p>

<p>In another twist in the long-lasting legal fight between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs over whether XRP is a security and whether Ripple sold it wrongfully as one, the SEC has taken another significant step. After Judge Analisa Torres <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">ruled on July 13th</a> partly that XRP was a security when sold to institutional investors, granting the SEC’s motion and denying its motion as to programmatic XRP sales, the SEC filed a motion to file an interlocutory appeal.</p>



<p>“Interlocutory review is warranted here. These two issues involve controlling questions of law on which there is substantial ground for differences of opinion as reflected by an intra-district split that has already developed,&#8221; the SEC argued.</p>



<p>Simply put, a &#8220;motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal&#8221; is a formal request by one party in a legal case to ask a higher court for permission to appeal a specific decision or ruling made by a lower court before the entire case concludes. Commentators like John E. Deaton, a lawyer himself, have said that while not impossible, it would be highly unlikely that the SEC was to file this motion and even less likely that the Judge was to grant it.</p>



<p>Although an appeal is expected to be lodged after the case concludes, it is not uncommon to have an interlocutory appeal if the question at hand is substantial, which is now for Judge Torres to decide. The case still has a pending jury trial, which Judge Torres set for 2024. The Jury will decide about the charges brought against Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chairman Chris Larsen, claiming they &#8220;aided and abetted&#8221; in the institutional sales of billions of dollars in XRP.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xrp-a-security"><strong>XRP a Security?</strong></h2>



<p>It must be noted that the filing does not dispute that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/anti-crypto-congressman-brad-sherman-takes-aim-at-ridiculous-ripple-ruling-claims-xrp-is-a-security/">XRP itself is a security</a> but rather the question of programmatic and individual sales. Early commentators on Twitter claimed that the SEC appeal could make XRP sales on exchanges securities; however, this is not the case. As Bill Morgan, an Australian lawyer and close observer of the case said, Judge “Torres&#8217;s decision was not just that she found XRP itself was not a security but that she referred to the SEC v Telegram case (amongst others) and found digital assets such as the gram token are commodities”.</p>



<p>In addition, it must be said that the Judge&#8217;s ruling and the SEC&#8217;s appeal are centred around the specific allegations against Ripple, its executives, and their sales of XRP, not those on exchanges.</p>



<p>The SEC also asked Judge Torres for all other parts of her judgment not to be enforced until an appeal has been decided in the Second Circuit. As James K. Filan, a prominent lawyer, said, this would be unlikely for Torres to agree to; in his words, <em>“that would be an epic battle between the parties, and whether the court agrees to that remains to be seen.”</em></p>



<p>The price of XRP is slightly down 3.51% in the past 24 hours and fell 6% from last week, and now stands at $0.63, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>

<p>After Elon Musk rebranded Twitter as X, speculation flourished regarding the payment infrastructure that could turn X into the Everything app, similar to WeChat. Upon the initial announcement that X would replace the bird logo, many presumed Musk would <a href="https://zycrypto.com/x-marks-the-spot-elon-musk-rebrands-twitter-use-case-for-dogecoin-incoming/">embrace Dogecoin for payments</a>, resulting in a 20% surge in the popular meme coin&#8217;s price. This increase was unsurprising, given Musk&#8217;s well-known fondness for Dogecoin and the hints he dropped suggesting its adoption.</p>



<p>Launched as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin has amassed a significant following and now ranks as the 7th largest coin by market cap, boasting an impressive $10.5 billion cap. Musk even added it to the location field of his Twitter bio.</p>



<p>Initially, there were speculations about the possibility of using cryptocurrency, particularly Dogecoin, for transactions on X. However, there have been no updates or confirmations regarding these plans since then. Additionally, recent news has emerged that might surprise cryptocurrency enthusiasts and pique curiosity.</p>



<p>Now, X offers creators global monetization and has partnered with the global fintech company Stripe, facilitating payouts since April 2022. The Ireland-based payments and money transfer company provides fiat and crypto transfers and payouts. Thus, it appears that X might not have a direct plan to make payments in cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Musk could still use cryptocurrencies for peer-to-peer transfers or other payments. However, there hasn&#8217;t been much information on this front yet. Until a recent cryptic tweet, that is.</p>



<p>Musk tweeted, <em>&#8220;Something special is coming.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>While it may not relate to payments or cryptocurrencies, crypto Twitter swiftly rallied to support Dogecoin payments. Naturally, if X were to embrace Dogecoin, its price could experience significant growth. However, this would hinge on the overall success and adoption of payments and transfers via X, which remains uncertain.</p>



<p>As of writing, the price of Dogecoin hovers just under $0.08 at $0.075, experiencing a 1% decline in the last 24 hours. No further comments about the &#8220;special something&#8221; have been published, urging investors to weigh the risks when investing in volatile assets based on speculations and enigmatic tweets.</p>



<p>One thing is certain, though: Elon Musk continues to stir up things with his tweets, garnering significant attention from the industry. The use of crypto on one of the largest social media platforms could serve as a bullish catalyst for the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>Popular crypto exchange Kraken tweeted, <em>&#8220;Now imagine the option to receive payouts in Bitcoin. Wen crypto integration?&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Chainlink whales have injected a staggering $100 million into the market by acquiring around 14 million LINK tokens in just one week. This purchase surge coincides with a notable increase in developer activities and GitHub contributions to the project.</p>



<p>Renowned crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, reported on the substantial movement of LINK tokens in the market Tuesday, emphasizing the confidence displayed by major investors in Chainlink&#8217;s potential and technology. Earlier Monday, Santiment, a crypto analytics firm, highlighted Chainlink&#8217;s recent GitHub development activity surge, pushing the asset into the top 5 most frequently developed projects.</p>



<p><em>“Chainlink&#8217;s github development activity has been notably higher this summer, leading to the asset cracking the top 5 most frequent developed assets,”</em> wrote Santiment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, the firm highlighted that whale and shark holders, owning 100K to 10M LINK tokens, now possess the most coins since December 2022. According to Santiment, chainlink’s whales and sharks have cumulatively added $192 million worth of LINK in just under four weeks, further solidifying Martinez’s assertions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/PZBiqlKrRhcTZ07bas5gLD7I3pNHRFzEk8j3t6HUu2c6ofsdsE-xg6kIz6Ur4LeHIIoF7TDrpoE1S1XZZDFwrrd17VRmc3b87QqHJuztPEt23QdCi0HMi58hFYlk23cRuzFik0CHfcZRmV_8kKYhjA" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Chainlink&#8217;s role as a provider of Oracle solutions, facilitating smart contract interaction with real-world data, has driven its popularity and adoption in various decentralized applications (dApps).</p>



<p>Mid-last month, the network<a href="https://zycrypto.com/bridging-the-gap-chainlink-unveils-cross-chain-interoperability-protocol-to-connect-tradfi-with-crypto/"> launched</a> a Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) on the Mainnet to create a standard communication system between various blockchain networks. The protocol, supported by Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon (MATIC) networks, has already gained early adoption from DeFi lending platforms like Aave and Synthetix.</p>



<p>Following the launch, Chainlink&#8217;s Co-founder Sergey Nazarov emphasized the importance of CCIP, noting that apart from boosting security between bridges, the protocol would<em> “create a private-public dynamic that will give access to traditional finance to digital assets and the cryptocurrency space to trillions of dollars.”</em></p>



<p>This perhaps explains the growing interest from institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals, considering Chainlink already collaborates with major players in traditional finance like Swift, BNY Mellon and Citigroup. Through the protocol, banks will be able to access real-world asset tokens and participate in the blockchain space more comprehensively, opening new opportunities for global finance.</p>



<p>That said, amidst these developments, LINK has been showing considerable strength, surging by over 50% since June, albeit trading in consolidation since May. Presently, the price faces monthly solid resistance at $9 and support around $5.15. With growing optimism and more LINK purchases, the cryptocurrency could soon breach that resistance to tap $14, as crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1688580767935500288">envisions.</a></p>

<p>Ripple Labs, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency market, recently achieved a significant milestone by becoming a member of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA).</p>



<p>The ISDA, known for its association with financial giants like JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs, welcomed Ripple into its fold, establishing the company as one of the few cryptocurrency enterprises to gain entry into this elite group.</p>



<p>Ripple&#8217;s ISDA membership follows <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">favourable legal rulings</a> concerning the sale of its XRP tokens. The ruling, issued by Judge Analisa Torres in July, clarified that the sale of XRP to retail buyers does not qualify as securities, while sales to institutional holders amount to securities. This legal victory has bolstered Ripple&#8217;s operations, leading the company to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-to-expand-presence-in-u-s-market-after-xrp-court-win-top-executive-reveals-big-plans/">resume activities with United States-based partners and clients</a>.</p>



<p>Ripple&#8217;s entry into the ISDA paves the way for potential collaborations with other member institutions from 79 countries. With over 1000 members, the ISDA provides an influential platform for corporations, investment managers, insurance companies, and digital asset companies like Ripple to interact and explore opportunities in the global financial market.</p>



<p>The move signals a growing trend of acceptance and adoption of digital assets in traditional finance circles. Ripple has already established partnerships with various global financial institutions, businesses, and governments, and its association with the ISDA is expected to strengthen these connections further.</p>



<p>Amidst this development, market participants and observers have closely monitored the potential impact on XRP&#8217;s price. On Monday, August 7, a crypto pundit using the pseudonym &#8220;Mr Man&#8221; made a <a href="https://twitter.com/MrManXRP/status/1688545770557911040">bold prediction</a>, suggesting that XRP could surge to $1,896.23, fueled by its entry into the $1.2 quadrillion derivatives market through its ISDA membership.</p>



<p>Mr Man&#8217;s prediction was based on the expectation that XRP could process 10% of the derivatives market, estimated to be over $1 quadrillion in notional value. By calculating the required market cap increase (approximately 2,865 times) for such a scenario, he arrived at the estimated potential price for XRP. However, he was quick to caution his followers, asking them to take his assertions with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, other pundits have also been making <a href="https://zycrypto.com/as-crazy-as-it-sounds-xrp-may-hit-100-based-on-these-key-driving-factors/">daring predictions</a> for XRP. Brad Kimes, a popular crypto analyst and host of Digital PerspectivesPermaBull, recently stated, <em>“I believe XRP will go to four in five digits based on its intended use case and let&#8217;s be clear utility and use case is not driving the price of XRP at this point so we are a little early”</em> on his youtube channel, praising the recent Ripple&#8217;s entry to ISDA.</p>



<p>At press time, XRP was trading at $0.66, up 5.71% in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>Billionaire investor David Rubenstein has expressed regret about not purchasing Bitcoin when it was priced at just $100 per unit.</p>



<p>Speaking to Bloomberg on Tuesday, Rubenstein remarked that he wished he had taken the opportunity to buy Bitcoin at that early stage, acknowledging the substantial profits that early adopters have since enjoyed.</p>



<p><em>“There&#8217;s no doubt that Bitcoin is something that I wish I had bought at a hundred dollars a Bitcoin when Mike Novogratz started buying it. It&#8217;s now at twenty-nine thousand dollars so he&#8217;s made a lot of money,” </em>he said. Novogratz is the current CEO of crypto investment firm Galaxy Investment Partners.</p>



<p>Rubenstein&#8217;s candid reflection comes as Bitcoin has seen both staggering highs and notable declines in value, capturing the attention of both seasoned investors and newcomers alike. Notably, however, the cryptocurrency&#8217;s journey from relative obscurity to mainstream prominence has been marked by unprecedented price appreciation, making those who invested early significant gains.</p>



<p>The billionaire investor also highlighted the changing dynamics within the financial sector. He noted that the entry of established institutions, such as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/approval-incoming-sec-officially-acknowledges-blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-application/">BlackRock</a>, into the Bitcoin space adds a layer of credibility to the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p><em>“People make fun of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies but now the establishment of Larry Fink at BlackRock is now saying they&#8217;re going to have an ETF if approved by the government in Bitcoin,”</em> said Rubenstein, adding <em>“So you&#8217;re saying, wait a second, the mighty BlackRock is willing to have an ETF in Bitcoin. Maybe Bitcoin is going to be around for a while.”</em></p>



<p>Addressing Bitcoin&#8217;s role as a store of value, Rubenstein further drew parallels to traditional assets like gold and silver. He dismissed concerns that regulatory challenges would lead to the demise of cryptocurrencies, citing the sustained interest in digital assets worldwide.</p>



<p>This is not the first time Rubenstein has expressed his bullish stance on Bitcoin, even as several other billionaires maintain a more <a href="https://zycrypto.com/berkshire-billionaire-warren-buffett-remains-clueless-about-bitcoin-labels-it-a-gambling-token/">pessimistic outlook</a>. In 2021, during a period of market turbulence, the businessman confidently asserted during an interview with CNBC, <em>&#8220;Cryptocurrency is not going away, just like gold is not going away.&#8221; </em></p>



<p>Rubenstein has also disclosed personal investments in companies facilitating crypto trading, emphasizing that cryptocurrencies are a substantial and lasting addition to the financial landscape.</p>

<p>In a recent<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACidaZdlrGI"> interview with Bloomberg</a>, Cathie Wood, the CEO and CIO of Ark Invest, shared some insights on the potential impact of Bitcoin ETFs on the market. Wood stated the announcement from BlackRock regarding its filing for a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/why-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-odds-just-shot-up-according-to-bloomberg/">spot Bitcoin ETF</a> in June had caused the price to move upward but has been steady since. She said it was quite remarkable that the Bitcoin price went from $19,000 to $30,000 during a regional banking crisis.</p>



<p>According to Wood, Bitcoin is attractive because of its ability to protect against inflation and asset confiscation, as well as its resilience to counterparty risk. This is why Bitcoin saw an inflow due to its decentralized and transparent characteristics, providing a safe haven among mounting counterparty anxieties.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, Wood projects that the impending date of August 13th will likely pass with the SEC possibly delaying the approval of Ark’s Bitcoin ETF. She believes that if the SEC authorises a spot Bitcoin ETF, it would likely approve many at once, emphasizing the need for excellent marketing and communication tactics in separating them. <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ark-invests-spot-bitcoin-etf-to-get-ruling-in-6-days-heres-what-market-players-are-saying/">Ark Invest</a>, for its part, has been releasing monthly Bitcoin insights, as well as initiating Bitcoin brainstorming sessions to emphasize its research depth and commitment. Wood said the firm was the first asset manager to gain exposure to Bitcoin in 2015.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-the-sec-shifting-its-stance"><strong>Is the SEC shifting its stance?</strong></h2>



<p>Wood pointed out that the SEC has lost some recent court cases challenging its regulation efforts. She said that even though SEC chair Gary Gensler claims that 5 commissioners vote, “one assumes that the way that Gary votes is the way the SEC will vote” since 2 commissioners are each Republican and Democrats. His comments could highlight Gensler distancing himself a little from crypto enforcement actions, which may ultimately benefit the industry.</p>



<p>However, Wood criticized the contradicting approach by the SEC and questioned the decision-making around the approval of a Bitcoin futures ETF while remaining opposed to a spot Bitcoin ETF. She finds it perplexing how the former, which involves counterparty risk, gained approval while the latter, backed one-to-one by Bitcoin in cold storage, did not.</p>
