										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Grayscale says it disagrees with SEC&rsquo;s staff over suggestions that Filecoin (FIL) is a security.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The letter from the SEC staff was sent on 16 May 2023, after Grayscale applied to list the Grayscale&reg; Filecoin Trust (FIL) (OTCQB: FILG)&nbsp;</li>
<li dir="ltr">SEC staff also believe the meet the Grayscale&reg; Filecoin Trust &ldquo;meets the definition of an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Grayscale says it received comment from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff regarding the underlying asset of the Grayscale&reg; Filecoin Trust (FIL) (OTCQB: FILG) that the digital asset manager was looking to register.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In particular, Grayscale&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/05/17/2671509/0/en/Grayscale-Investments-Shares-Update-Regarding-Grayscale-Filecoin-Trust-Registration-Statement-on-Form-10.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> points to a letter from SEC staff sent on 16 May. According to the staff, FIL, the native token of the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/filecoin/">Filecoin</a> cryptocurrency ecosystem, &ldquo;meets the definition of a security.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/sec/">SEC</a> comment highlighted that this view was taken with an understanding the securities laws.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Grayscale disagrees with SEC&rsquo;s letter that FIL is a security</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Filecoin Trust appears to also &ldquo;meet the definition of an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940,&rdquo; the letter stated. &nbsp;The staff therefore requested that <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/grayscale/">Grayscale</a> seeks the withdrawal of the registration of the FILG that it had applied for in April.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Grayscale does not believe that FIL is a security under the federal securities laws and intends to respond promptly to the SEC staff with an explanation of the legal basis for Grayscale&rsquo;s position</em>,&rdquo; Grayscale said in its press release on Wednesday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to Grayscale, it&rsquo;s difficult to tell whether the US regulator&rsquo;s staff will agree with it in terms of the assessment that Filecoin is not a security. The company says if their communication fails to persuade the SEC, it may have to seek accommodations in the quest to register the Filecoin Trust.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company could also go the recommended way and have the Trust dissolved, the statement read.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the SEC in 2022 after the agency denied the company&rsquo;s application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an exchange-traded fund (ETF).</p>
<p dir="ltr">The SEC on the other hand sued <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/ripple/">Ripple</a>, the company behind the XRP cryptocurrency over allegations the blockchain firm had been selling unregistered securities. That case has dragged since December 2020, although its conclusion looks to be imminent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Elsewhere, the agency has been criticized for its approach to crypto regulation, particularly with regard to its regulation by enforcement as seen over the past several months.</p>

<p class="fr-img-space-wrap2">&nbsp;BNB, Cardano and Polygon were looking to break key resistance areas as crypto prices rose late Wednesday.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">Stocks jumped as all the major US indices ended the day higher while Bitcoin bounced above $27,400 again.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Other coins to see gains include XRP, Dogecoin and Litecoin.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market remains largely flat today after a slow week for the broader market amid investor cautiousness on US debt-ceiling sentiment. On Wednesday, US <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/stocks/">stocks</a> closed higher as reports emerged of positive progress from lawmakers, with the Dow ending over 400 points up and the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both notching +1.2%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In crypto, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> was changing hands just above $27,000, Ethereum (ETH) was at $1,824, and XRP (XRP), one of the best performers today among the top 10 cryptocurrencies, traded near 45 cents.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/binance-coin/">Binance Coin (BNB)</a>, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cardano/">Cardano (ADA)</a> and <a href="https://coinjournal.net/polygon/">Polygon (MATIC)</a> were among altcoins to see a slight uptick, while XRP, Litecoin and Dogecoin have also climbed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here is a short term price prediction for BNB, ADA and MATIC.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">BNB (BNB) price</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bnb/">BNB</a> is trading at $314, about 1% in the green at the time of writing after bulls turned up to defend the $310 area.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the 20-day EMA ($317) and 50-day EMA (319) are offering a major resistance zone. With the averages suggesting further weakness, bears are likely to try to pull the price below the strong support at $300. If they succeed, the BNB/USD pair could extend the decline to $270.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the other hand, if the price bounces off support and BNB sees fresh demand, a rise to the highlighted EMAs could afford buyers breathing space to target the hurdles in the $330 &ndash; $350 range.</p>

<p></p></span>
<p></p></span>
<h2 class="fr-img-space-wrap2">Cardano (ADA) price</h2>
</div>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/cardano/">Cardano</a> was above $0.37 at the time of writing. While ADA/USD is up 3% in the past 24 hours and has broken above a key horizontal line, the bulls are not in the clear yet. &nbsp;To pull the price higher, buyers need to break past $0.40 in order to target the recent uptrend peak of $0.46.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If bears succeed in retaking control, the ADA/USD pair could decline to $0.30.</p>
<div class="fr-img-space-wrap"><span class="fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib fr-draggable" style="width: 700px"><span class="fr-img-wrap">

<p></p></span>
<p></p></span>
<h2 class="fr-img-space-wrap2">Polygon (MATIC) price</h2>
</div>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/polygon/">Polygon</a> is currently trading at $0.87, up by about 5% in the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bulls are likely to try to push the price above the resistance line at $0.91. If they succeed, the MATIC/USD pair target the psychological $1.00 area, with potential to retest the supply wall near $1.20.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the flipside, if the price turns down and break below the new range support, further weakness could offer bears the encouragement to target $0.70.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">PEPE is the worst performer amongst the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap today.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The meme coin has lost more than 10% of its value as it continues to underperform.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">PEPE could experience further dumping as the broader crypto market undergoes a correction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">PEPE loses more than 12% of its value today</h2>
<p dir="ltr">PEPE, one of the most popular meme coins of the year, has been underperforming over the past few days. It recorded massive profits a few weeks ago but has been underperforming since reaching its all-time high price of $0.000004354 12 days ago.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The token is now down by more than 65% from its all-time high and could continue to dip lower.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At press time, the price of PEPE stands at $0.000001506 per coin. Over the past 24 hours, PEPE has lost roughly 12% of its value, making it the worst performer amongst the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Will PEPE go back up soon?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">PEPE&rsquo;s poor performance coincides with that of the broader cryptocurrency market. The token has been underperforming since it&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/pepe-price-dives-after-whale-transfers-trillions-of-tokens-to-binance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>began to be listed</u></a> on some major cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The broader cryptocurrency market has been underperforming in recent days. At press time, the total cryptocurrency market cap stands at $1.12 trillion, down by less than 1% so far today.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin, the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is also underperforming, and is now trading just below the $27k level.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the broader crypto market currently experiencing a poor run, PEPE could find it tough to regain its all-time high price in the near term.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The meme coin mania in the cryptocurrency space seems to have subsided in recent weeks. If the fundamentals of the broader market improve, PEPE could see its value soar higher over the next few weeks. However, if the current market conditions persist, PEPE could see its price retest the all-time low level of $0.00000002764 once again.</p>

<li>Coinbase yesterday evening announced it was suspending ETH staking reward payouts.</li>
<li>The crypto exchange has been having some issues with ETH staking recently.</li>
<li>The exchange, however, expects to resolve the issue within 48 to 72 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a <a href="https://status.coinbase.com/incidents/h69ddyxyw859">statement</a> issued on the exchange&rsquo;s website on May 16, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/coinbase/">Coinbase </a>announced that it was temporarily pausing issuing <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/what-is-ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> staking reward payouts.</p>
<p>The exchange is currently investigating the issue following the temporary halt.</p>
<h2>ETH rewards stuck</h2>
<p>There was an issue on Coinbase with ETH rewards Last week. ETH rewards became stuck because of the lack of support for ETH addresses from external validators in its systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hiccup made the crypto community frustrated with a majority venting their anger on social media platforms.</p>
<p>Besides issues with ETH staking rewards, a significant number of withdrawals were also stuck in the withdrawal queue.</p>
<p>While the recent Ethereum Shapella upgrade had a number of positive implications for ETH holders, the ability to withdraw staked ETH seems to be putting pressure on most ETH-staking platforms.</p>
<p>Coinbase has recently received over 53,400 ETH deposits with a significant portion of these deposits coming from Coinbase&rsquo;s cbETH deposit address. The address witnessed a withdrawal of 44,000 ETH, which was transferred to the Coinbase 10 wallet address, according to CryptoQuant data.</p>

<li>The Graph is now down over 90% versus its recent high.</li>
<li>Factors that could unlock further upside in AltSignals.</li>
<li>AltSignals native &ldquo;ASI&rdquo; token is currently in presale.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/the-graph/">The Graph</a> was first thought of as a project that would play a pivotal role in the rise of &ldquo;Web3&rdquo;. Still, its performance over the past two years seems to suggest otherwise.</p>
<h2>The Graph has been a pain for its investors</h2>
<p>Versus its all-time high in early 2021, &ldquo;The Graph&rdquo; has lost more than 90% on the back of several challenges. These include, first of all, the added competition that GRT has evidently failed to survive.</p>
<p>The Graph has been restricted in terms of the use cases it can potentially address as well. Consequently, experts are not entirely convinced that the GRT token would even manage to hold at the current 12 cents per token through this year.</p>
<p>But such may not be the case for <a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AltSignals</a> that&rsquo;s in presale at writing and, therefore, does not have the risks that are usually coupled with late entry.</p>
<h2>What you need to know about AltSignals</h2>
<p>AltSignals is the financial technology company behind &ldquo;AltAlgo&rdquo; &ndash; a tool that informs a trader on when to buy or sell in any tradeable market, including cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>What makes it all the more exciting is that AltSignals plans on adding a touch of artificial intelligence into its state-of-the-art trading algorithm to launch an enhanced, more accurate service for traders that it&rsquo;s calling ActualizeAI.</p>
<p>In a way, it&rsquo;s an opportunity to bet early on the recent AI mania, initially sparked by Microsoft when it announced a multi-billion-dollar investment in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2023/01/27/microsoft-confirms-its-10-billion-investment-into-chatgpt-changing-how-microsoft-competes-with-google-apple-and-other-tech-giants/?sh=b72d93d36246" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT</a>. Other notable names, including Snap Inc, Amazon, Baidu, Salesforce etc. then followed in its footsteps this year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bard&rdquo; &ndash; a chatbot that may be called Google&rsquo;s panic response to ChatGPT failed to interest investors when it first launched in February. Earlier this month, though, it made a series of updates and notable <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718158/google-io-2023-biggest-announcements-ai-pixel-fold-tablet-android-14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcements</a> at its annual developer conference that confirmed it&rsquo;s not giving up without a fight.</p>
<p>All in all, the aforementioned developments suggest AI is here to stay &ndash; and AltSignals seems prepared to capitalise on it.</p>
<h2>Should you invest in the ASI token?</h2>
<p>AltSignals is winning in terms of popularity considering it&rsquo;s raised over $740K already and more than 50,000 traders are using its flagship trading signals from across the globe.</p>
<p>Once ActualizeAI goes live, experts believe the demand for &ldquo;ASI&rdquo; will climb further as it&rsquo;s what powers the said artificial intelligence-based service. And like any financial instrument, higher demand will eventually lead to price appreciation.</p>
<p>Owning the ASI token is attractive because it opens a world of members-only benefits for holders as well. These include having a say in how the project develops moving forward and access to a number of earnings opportunities via participating in trading tournaments for example.</p>
<p>AltSignals may particularly be a great investment opportunity as it&rsquo;s in presale only at writing. You can build an early position in this AI token in three simple steps as per its <a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=beincrypto#how-to-buy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>.</p>
<h2>How high could AltSignals (ASI) go?</h2>
<p>AltSignals expects its native ASI token to hit $0.02274 by the end of the current <a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presale</a> &ndash; up roughly 50% from here.</p>
<p>Starting with Uniswap, the ASI token will then go live on major crypto exchanges. That&rsquo;s significant because coins like Floki and Pepe recently noted a sharp price increase following listing on crypto exchanges. If the same materialises for AltSignals, your returns would continue to expand.</p>
<p>Lastly, ASI could also benefit from the easing monetary policy. Earlier in May, the U.S. Federal Reserve signalled a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-03/fed-raises-rates-by-a-quarter-point-and-hints-at-possible-pause" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pause</a>&rdquo; after consumer prices were reported to have eased further to 4.9% last month.</p>
<p>Put together with the ongoing bank failures, Chair Jerome Powell no longer has a lot of room to raise rates any further. Such macro developments could see investors return to more aggressively to riskier bets such as cryptocurrencies &ndash; and so the AI token could benefit from the continued recovery in this space at large.</p>
<p>To conclude, as <a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=beincrypto#how-to-buy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AltSignals</a> integrates artificial intelligence to become the leading trading toolkit, many experts believe its native ASI token could be valued at around 5 cents by the end of 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Bankrupt lender Celsius is trying to withdraw $779 million worth of ETH from Lido</li>
<li dir="ltr">The ETH represents 7% of the total amount staked with Lido</li>
<li dir="ltr">Celsius has $4.7 billion of debts with creditors, and sent the market into a tailspin last year after it got caught up in the Terra contagion</li>
<li dir="ltr">Celsius also staked $75 million of ETH with staking provider Figment last week</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">Celsius is the temperature unit of choice for all bar three countries: Liberia, Burma and the United States. Celsius is also the name of a popular energy drink beginning to make rounds on social media. But utter the word &ldquo;Celsius&rdquo; around a cryptocurrency investor, and they will think of neither of these things. Rather, they&rsquo;ll likely shudder and picture nothing but lost cash.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Celsius, of course, is the crypto lender which suspended withdrawals on June 12th, 2022. Getting caught up in the contagion that followed the spectacular death spiral of the Terra ecosystem a few weeks prior, it did not have the necessary funds on deck to honour the flood of withdrawal requests.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was forced to declare bankruptcy, a gruesome $4.7 billion owed to creditors.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/13791917">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">Now, it is trying to withdraw 428,000 ETH from Lido, equivalent to $779 million at current market prices. Transaction data on the blockchain can be seen <a href="https://etherscan.io/tokentxns?a=0x4A87EcDfb459eb36d25226D9CCd7Ec4f684AB3Fc&amp;p=1"><u>here</u></a> (withdrawn in increments of 1,000).&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lido is a liquid staking platform, where ETH stakers have been able to lock up their ETH in return for stETH tokens, receiving a yield in the process. Until the Shanghai upgrade (also known as Shapella) went live in April, the any ETH staked, regardless of platform, was locked and could not be withdrawn. This changed once the upgrade went live, and last week, Lido opened up withdrawals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Looking at the total amount of ETH staked on the network, it sits at 21.8 million, equivalent to 18.15 of the total circulating supply.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/13792042">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">Celsius&rsquo; requested withdrawal of 428,000 ETH constitutes 0.36% of the entire ETH supply (it also represents 2% of the total staked ETH).&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Looking at the amount of ETH staked with Lido specifically, Celsius&rsquo; withdrawal of 428,000 ETH represents nearly 7% of all the ETH staked with Lido. Lido has a 28% market share with regard to Ethereum staking.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/13792267">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">The ETH withdrawals will all be processed, but such is the size of the outflux that it may take time, especially if others move to withdraw from Lido. In this event, validators could exit which would slow down the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">What is more interesting is the reasons behind this Celsius withdrawal. The locked ETH was cited as one of the reasons that Celsius was unable to honour withdrawal requests last summer, although with $4.7 billion in debts, it is hardly the only one. And to be clear, this was very much an insolvency crisis rather than a liquidity crisis.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The funds may be getting moved to prepare for a (partial) repayment of creditors in future. The bankruptcy process is notoriously slow, however, with Mt Gox users still awaiting compensation, despite the exchange succumbing in 2014.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The intriguing aspect to this is the inherent volatility of the underlying assets. When Celsius suspended withdrawals, ETH sat close to where it is now, around $1,800, but the road in between has been far from smooth. It nearly halved in the ten-day period following the news last June, dropping to $990. During the pandemic bull run, it came close to breaching $5,000.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This means creditors awaiting payment are subject to the wild volatility &ndash; against their own will. This could also be a reason that Celsius is withdrawing the underlying ETH.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the flipside, according to data released by blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, Celsius staked $75 million worth of ETH last week with the staking provider Figment. This is surprising for multiple reasons. Most notably, Celsius operates its own staking pool with nearly $300 million in assets under management, so it is curious why it decided not to funnel the ETH into its own pool.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Perhaps this suggests that the ETH withdrawn from Lido will be sent there, but that pure speculation. Either way, the entire process is confusing, although that has been the case with many of Celsius&rsquo; actions in the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">One thing crypto investors may fear is the ETH being monetised quickly. Were Celsius to flood the market with the $779 million of ETH it is withdrawing from Lido, this would have a tangible effect on prices, especially as liquidity <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-liquidity-falling-as-market-makers-pull-back-from-hostile-us-market/"><u>continues to thin</u></a> in crypto markets.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Pantos has launched its Multichain Token Creator.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The Multichain Token Creator will allow users to configure and deploy their own multichain tokens built on top of the Pantos Digital Asset Standard.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;The team will also launch the Pantos Digital Asset Standard (PANDAS) at the upcoming EDCON conference.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">Pantos&rsquo;s Multichain Token Creator goes live</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Pantos, a Multichain Token System conceived by the team behind Bitpanda, announced the public release of the Multichain Token Creator on Wednesday, May 17th.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a press release shared with Coinjournal, Pantos said its multichain token creator is an easy-to-use web app that allows users to configure and deploy their own multichain tokens built on top of the Pantos Digital Asset Standard (PANDAS).&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to that, developers have the opportunity to configure their base token and download the contract code to extend it with their custom functionality.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The team explained that the &nbsp;Multichain Token Creator makes it easy for projects to launch on multiple blockchain networks, increasing their reach without much effort and creating more opportunities for the community and the projects themselves. This implies that developers, users and their assets no longer have to be locked to a single chain.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">While commenting on this <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>latest cryptocurrency news</u></a>, Marius Ciortan, the Director of Product Engineering at Pantos, said;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Our Multichain Token Creator is a defining innovation in the blockchain space, offering developers and projects an effortless way to adopt a revolutionary multichain token standard that drives unparalleled cross-chain collaboration and opens up endless possibilities for the future of decentralized technology.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Multichain Token Creator reduces complexity for developers&nbsp;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Pantos team explained that the Token Creator is beneficial to developers because it reduces the time and complexity of developing multichain assets, enabling them to launch their tokens within minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">For users, the solution allows them to enjoy a smoother multichain experience thanks to the increased availability of native multichain assets through the easy token creation process.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Pantos team said they would showcase the Token Creator to the public for the first time during Super Demo at the upcoming EDCON conference, to be held between May 19-23 in Montenegro. The team will also launch the Pantos Digital Asset Standard (PANDAS) at the event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In February, Pantos&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bitpanda-backed-pantos-launches-public-beta-of-its-multichain-token-system/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>launched the public beta</u></a> of its Multichain Token System. Pantos has been around since 2018 and currently supports seven chains on testnet: Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB, Cronos, Celo and Fantom. The project plans to integrate more EVM and non-EVM chains continuously.&nbsp;</p>

<li>At press time AXS token was trading at $7.44, up 9.64% in 24 hours.</li>
<li>The token has hit $8.06, the highest price level in May 2023.</li>
<li>The Axie Infinity: Origins card game will be available on the Apple App Store.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/axie-infinity/">Axie Infinity price</a> is trending today after Sky Mavis, the developer of the non-fungible token (NFT) project Axie Infinity, announced that it is releasing its Axie Infinity: Origins card game via the Apple App Store in the game&rsquo;s most popular regions.</p>
<p>The price of AXS surged to a high of $8.06 before pulling back to $7.44 at press time mainly because of Sky Mavis&rsquo; announcement and the introduction of Mavis Market, a curated NFT marketplace powered by the Axie Infinity&rsquo;s own <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/axie-infinitys-ronin-bridge-and-katana-dex-halted-after-suffering-a-612m-exploit/">Ronin blockchain, which suffered a $612M exploit</a> a year ago.</p>
<h2>Axie Infinity game arrival on App Store</h2>
<p>The arrival of Axie Infinity: Origins card game on the App Store comes five months after the game debuted on Google&rsquo;s Play Store. Initially, Axie Infinity was inaccessible on Apple&rsquo;s App Store and Google&rsquo;s Play Store and players could only download it through Sky Mavis&rsquo; website.</p>
<p>To start with, Sky Mavis will launch the game on App Store in regions where the game is popular. Most of these regions are in Southeast Asia and Latin America.</p>
<p>Malaysia, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Mexico, Venezuela, Indonesia, and Vietnam are among the launch areas for the game.</p>
<p>Axie Infinity currently has 1.5 million installations across all platforms around the world and intends to expand this through Google and Apple mobile consumers.</p>
<h2>Introduction of Mavis Market</h2>
<p>Besides launching its Axie Infinity game on App Store, Sky Mavis is also introducing Mavis Market, a curated NFT marketplace powered by the company&rsquo;s own Ronin blockchain</p>
<p>Certain NFT treasures from dApp developers and third-party games that use the Ronin blockchain will be accessible on the Mavis Market marketplace starting from Wednesday.</p>
<p>The marketplace is a huge milestone for Sky Mavis&rsquo; long-term ambition to capitalize on the success of Axie Infinity Classic by offering a better gaming experience that doesn&rsquo;t require players to purchase NFTs.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">ETH price has gone nowhere this week as cryptocurrencies waver.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The coin&rsquo;s volatility and volume have crashed hard in the past few days.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum"><u>Ethereum</u></a> price drifted downwards on Wednesday as the coin&rsquo;s volume and trading volatility slumped. ETH was stuck below the important support level at $1,800, where it has been in the past few days. It remains about 16% below the highest point this month.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Volume and volatility retreats</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Ethereum,&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/"><u>Bitcoin</u></a>, and other&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/"><u>cryptocurrencies</u></a> have remained in a consolidation phase in the past few days. A likely reason for this is that there have been no major catalysts in the industry this month. Another reason is that investors started taking profits after the remarkable comeback that happened earier this year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ethereum price has likely retreated as many investors started withdrawing some of their ETH tokens from Lido, the biggest player in the liquid staking industry. Lido activated its V2 software on Tuesday, making it possible for people to make these withdrawals. Before that, it was impossible to withdraw the coins.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Data also shows that the overall volume of Ethereum traded has dropped in the past few days. Data compiled by CoinGecko shows that the volume in the past 24 hours stood at about $6.5 billion, which is lower than average. Historically, cryptocurrencies tends to attract less volume when they are not doing well.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another data shows that open interest has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coinglass.com/currencies/ETH"><u>dropped</u></a> to 3.48 million ETH. As shown below, the futures open interest has remained in a tight range in the past few days.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://console.igms.io/791fe801-969e-47d5-849b-bc7e4e75df64" width="624" height="152" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Ethereum volatility slips</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/04/17/1684329005204-9e02511a-9198-4049-b79c-61596e29ca8f.png" style="width: 605px;height: 294.433px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="605" height="294.433"></p>
<p dir="ltr">The other notable thing is that Ethereum&rsquo;s volatility has dropped sharply in the past few days. Using moving averages on the daily chart, we see that the coin is loitering at the 25-day and 50-day exponential moving averages (EMA). This is a sign that there have been no major swings in the price.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the same time, the Bollinger Bands width has narrowed. Most importantly, the Average True Range (ATR) has slipped to its lowest level since March 10. The ATR is one of the most important volatility indicators in the market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The implicatons of all this is that it is highly risky to either invest or be short &nbsp;Ethereum right now since it is unclear the direction of the breakout. Bullish trades should only be placed when the ETH price jumps above the year-to-date high of $2,134 in a high volume environment. If this happens, the next level to watch will be at $2,500.</p>
