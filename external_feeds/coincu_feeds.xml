<p>The transfer was made at a Bitcoin price of $29,956 and was recorded at block height 799701 on July 22, according to <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/1MchKSZg4ETtfxJdhNXrDxg3hp9UAiNZ96" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/1MchKSZg4ETtfxJdhNXrDxg3hp9UAiNZ96" rel="noreferrer noopener">BitInfoCharts</a>. Interestingly, the wallet address that received the transfer seems to be a fresh one, indicating that the owner may be a new player in the cryptocurrency market.</p>

<p>The dormant address acquired the 1,037 BTC back in April 2012 when BTC&#8217;s price was only $4.92. At the time, the stash was only worth around $5,108. This means that the owner has benefited greatly from the surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s price over the years.</p>

<p>The US government has also been involved in some significant cryptocurrency transfers recently. On July 12, it transferred out nearly 10,000 BTC, worth $299 million, in a series of transactions related to the Silk Road seizure. It is not yet clear whether the transactions were sent to cryptocurrency exchanges or if they remain in the custody of the Justice Department.</p>



<p>In June, another mysterious Bitcoin whale moved 1,400 BTC, worth $36 million at the time, to a Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) address. The motive behind this transaction remains unclear, but some experts believe it may have been to enhance privacy.</p>



<p>Despite a few high-value transfers, over 55% of BTC has not moved in over two years, according to a chart by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, which was shared by cryptocurrency researcher Will Clemente. This indicates that a significant amount of Bitcoin is being held as a long-term investment, and investors are confident in its future growth potential.</p>

<p>The<a href="https://opensea.io/collection/azuki/analytics" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://opensea.io/collection/azuki/analytics" rel="noreferrer noopener"> floor price</a> of any cryptocurrency refers to the lowest price at which it is currently being traded in the market. For Azuki, a popular and promising crypto asset, the floor price acts as a key indicator of its overall market health and attractiveness to potential buyers. However, the recent plunge of 21% in just seven days has sent shockwaves throughout the crypto community.</p>



<p>The news of Azuki&#8217;s floor price dipping below 5 ETH came as a surprise to many investors who had placed their trust in the token&#8217;s performance. The decline has prompted heated discussions on online forums and social media platforms, with investors expressing their concerns and speculating on the reasons behind this sudden downturn.</p>

<p>Some analysts attribute the drop to a combination of factors, including the broader market sentiment and potential regulatory challenges in the cryptocurrency space. Market sentiment can heavily influence the performance of digital assets, and any negative perception can trigger a downward spiral in prices.</p>



<p>Despite the concerning drop, seasoned traders and crypto enthusiasts are looking at this development as an opportunity. They believe that such price fluctuations offer a chance to buy the dip and accumulate more Azuki tokens at a discounted rate. The crypto market has a history of displaying remarkable resilience, and many investors are hopeful that Azuki will regain its momentum in the near future.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The dYdX Foundation warns users that it has not released any news regarding any airdrops or token incentives related to the dYdX v4 public test network.</em></li>



<li><em>The warning was issued after fake airdrops appeared.</em></li>



<li><em>Recently there have been many scam links about airdrops and token incentives launched with many sophisticated tricks. Users need to be vigilant.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Today, the dYdX Foundation officially warned users about fraudulent airdrop links. Specifically, dYdX has not released any news regarding any airdrops or token incentives related to the dYdX v4 public test network.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>That&#8217;s why users need to be careful and consider any non-platform announcements related to the dYdX v4 public test network as well as potential scams.</p>



<p>Not only dXdY, on July 21st, but the Twitter account of defi protocol founder Uniswap was also <a href="https://coincu.com/204553-uniswap-founder-control-twitter-hacked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hacked</a> to post fraudulent airdrop and token distribution links. Fortunately, control of the account was restored a few hours later, the tweets with the phishing link were removed without any damage.</p>



<p>One approach that has been growing in popularity recently is called &#8220;Airdrop scams&#8221;. This trick involves creating a malicious scam token to send to user accounts. Rely on users investigating what this token is to scam them.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1624.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="715" height="424" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1624.png" alt="dYdX Foundation Warning No Any Airdrops Related To dYdX v4 Testnet" class="wp-image-205201" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1624.png 715w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1624-300x178.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px" title="dYdX Foundation Warning No Any Airdrops Related To dYdX v4 Testnet 9"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">dYdX CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/charlesdhaussy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warns</a> about fraudulent sharing</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Scammers take advantage of the popularity of major platforms and the community&#8217;s excitement to seize assets. The problem occurs when users access block explorers or wallets and detect strange tokens. Wallets or block explorers even display the price of the tokens. It is worth noting here that these tokens work, unlike other tokens when a user Swap (converts) will get errors and direct the user to a phishing site for support.</p>



<p>Scammers have impersonated famous crypto accounts on Twitter to lure users to malicious websites. In 2020, several major Twitter accounts, including Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and Bill Gates, were targeted by hackers in a crypto-related scam.</p>



<p>According to a report from cybersecurity company Kaspersky, these attacks have increased by 40% compared to the previous year. And it looks like in 2023. The situation shows no signs of slowing down.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>It is known that the UniSat team has experience in developing BSV. BSV (Bitcoin Satoshi Vision) is a cryptocurrency created to restore the original Bitcoin protocol as envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto, its creator. Bitcoin SV aims to accomplish several critical features mentioned in Nakamoto&#8217;s original white paper that are still absent in Bitcoin.</p>



<p>On the surface, the most striking difference between BTC (Bitcoin Core) and BSV (Bitcoin Satoshi Vision) is the choice of block size. While BTC emphasized small blocks (one megabyte per block), BSV opted for large blocks, ultimately with unlimited block sizes.</p>



<p>Although BSV is considered to have a lot of growth potential, the network is still in the early stages of development.</p>



<p>According to Dune&#8217;s datasheet, Unisat Wallet&#8217;s transaction volume and transaction time on the Bitcoin Ordinals trading market currently accounts for about 10%~20%, and the total number of unique users is around 60,000.</p>

Any user can deploy new trading pairs to add liquidity to the Swap. brc20-swap is designed to be technically compatible with existing brc20 variants.</p>



<p>UniSat said that brc20-swap is designed to enable developers to deploy versions of the brc20-swap service independently and will continue to provide source code, APIs and documentation to help developers build their Swap platform on top of this.</p>



<p>It is rumored that OKX is not currently participating, and the two sides have cooperated more in the early stages, but OKX has launched similar competing products.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In recent years, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has taken the cryptocurrency world by storm, revolutionizing traditional financial systems. Among the myriad of DeFi applications, yield farming has emerged as a prominent and sought-after investment strategy. Today, we&#8217;ll look at what top 5 DeFi yield farming strategies with <a href="https://twitter.com/Coincuofficial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coincu</a>.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1615.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="694" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1615-1024x694.png" alt="Top 5 Yield Farming Strategies In LSDfi" class="wp-image-205179" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1615-1024x694.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1615-300x203.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1615-768x520.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1615-750x508.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1615-1140x772.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1615.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Top 5 Yield Farming Strategies In LSDfi 12"></a></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Overview of yield farming strategies in LSDfi</h2>



<p>As DeFi grows, a new and exciting trend is emergingâ€”LSDfi, an integration of Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) with the DeFi ecosystem, bringing forth a realm of possibilities for investors.</p>



<p>Yield farming, in its essence, mirrors traditional financial incentivization mechanisms like lending for passive returns. However, the interoperability of DeFi applications expands the scope of opportunities available to investors, ranging from native protocol tokens and stablecoins to NFTs and other digital assets. Such versatility has transformed yield farming into a vast and complex realm within DeFi, with numerous sub-sectors to explore.</p>



<p>Yet, alongside the enticing prospects, yield farming does come with its own set of risks. Smart contract vulnerabilities and fund custody issues present unique challenges that require cautious consideration. Nonetheless, for those willing to explore this decentralized frontier, yield farming offers a plethora of opportunities to put idle assets to productive use.</p>



<p>Within the DeFi landscape, Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) have emerged as a transformative force. These projects form the foundation for LSDfi, enabling the integration of DeFi components like decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending platforms with the innovative properties of LSD. Projects like Lido have led the way, propelling LSD to become a prominent category in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL) within DeFi.</p>



<p>LSDfi, as a rising trend, is reshaping the DeFi space, and specialized DEXs or aggregators catering exclusively to LSD are expected to emerge. The amalgamation of DeFi and LSD is proving to be a powerful catalyst for the growth of both ecosystems. As the DeFi landscape continues to evolve, investors can expect even more sophisticated and groundbreaking products, driven by the symbiotic relationship between these two transformative forces.</p>



<p>While yield farming and LSDfi may not be without their challenges, their potential to reshape the financial landscape is undeniable. As more participants embrace these decentralized opportunities, the collective effort will contribute to the maturation and mainstream adoption of DeFi, paving the way for a more inclusive and decentralized financial future.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pendle Finance</strong></h3>



<p>Pendle Finance has found its place in the rapidly growing world of Yield Trading or Yield Derivatives (LSDfi). With a recent redirection towards LSDfi, the project has gained significant attention and stands out in the market. Let&#8217;s explore the factors that contributed to its newfound success.</p>



<p>LSDfi, a niche market focused on yield derivatives, allows users to profit from future earnings with a sense of certainty. Pendle Finance entered this relatively new market quite some time ago, but it was only after its recent redirection to LSDfi that the project truly gained prominence.</p>



<p>One crucial catalyst for Pendle Finance&#8217;s surge in popularity was the successful Shanghai Upgrade. The Total Value Locked (TVL) in the LSD industry experienced a meteoric rise, positioning it as the largest sector within the DeFi market. Consequently, the number of Liquidity Staking Tokens (LSTs) also witnessed a substantial increase. This surge in liquidity encouraged users to seek specialized projects like Pendle Finance to optimize their profits.</p>



<p>Pendle Finance offers a unique proposition for investors, particularly those involving Ethereum (ETH). The profits available within the LSDfi space, especially when paired with ETH, are considered safe and sustainable over time. In contrast, ETH staking alone offers an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of only 6-8%, prompting ETH holders to explore alternative avenues for generating higher returns.</p>

<p>Another factor that set Pendle Finance apart from its competitors was its distinct direction. While most LSDfi projects primarily focused on the Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) model, Pendle Finance carved its own path. This differentiation proved critical in attracting users seeking alternative options.</p>



<p>The combination of a thriving LSDfi market, secure and lucrative returns with ETH, and a unique project direction has propelled Pendle Finance to the forefront of the industry. As users increasingly search for ways to maximize their earnings and diversify their investment portfolios, Pendle Finance&#8217;s specialized approach has provided them with a compelling choice.</p>



<p>With its successful redirection towards LSDfi and the growing adoption of its unique offerings, Pendle Finance is poised to make a significant impact on the DeFi landscape. As the market continues to evolve, projects like Pendle Finance exemplify the potential for innovation and growth within the decentralized finance space.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Flashstake</strong></h3>



<p>In a major breakthrough for the world of DeFi, the Flashstake protocol has emerged as a novel financial infrastructure, presenting users with the opportunity to earn instant yields on their assets by locking up their principal for a selected duration. Powered by Flash Strategies, the protocol leverages underlying platforms like AAVE, Yearn, and others to generate attractive yields for its users.</p>



<p>The foundation of Flashstake lies in its unique ability to provide users with prepaid profit, revolutionizing the traditional staking experience. Unlike conventional staking platforms where users must wait for their assets to mature, Flashstake allows them to earn profits instantly without any delay.</p>



<p>One of the standout features of Flashstake is its promise of a &#8220;time travel with their assets&#8221; experience. This means users can not only transact with their assets at present market value but also tap into the future value (profit) of those assets during the transaction. Such a groundbreaking feature opens up new possibilities for investors and traders alike, granting them unprecedented flexibility and potential gains.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1618-1024x410.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="410" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1618-1024x410.png" alt="Top 5 Yield Farming Strategies In LSDfi" class="wp-image-205184" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1618-1024x410.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1618-300x120.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1618-768x307.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1618-750x300.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1618-1140x456.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1618.png 1250w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Top 5 Yield Farming Strategies In LSDfi 14"></a></figure></div>


<p>Security is a paramount concern in the DeFi space, and Flashstake addresses this by eliminating the risk of liquidation. Regardless of market fluctuations or changes in token interest rates, users can rest assured that their assets will always remain safe and will not face liquidation.</p>



<p>The process of participating in Flashstake is designed to be seamless and user-friendly. By staking LSD tokens on the platform, users can unlock a world of instant profits, making it an attractive option for those seeking to maximize their yields with minimal waiting time.</p>



<p>Moreover, Flashstake not only offers prepaid profits but also enables users to retrieve their original assets whenever they desire. This is accomplished by returning prepaid profits through TBD tokens, further enhancing the platform&#8217;s flexibility and accessibility.</p>



<p>Another significant benefit for users engaging with Flashstake is the ability to reclaim the Time Fee paid during staking. This real yield feature sets the platform apart from many other staking mechanisms, providing an added incentive for investors to actively participate and engage with their assets.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Origin Ether</strong></h3>



<p>Origin Ether (OETH) introduced a yield aggregator specifically designed for Ethereum (ETH) and LSTs. Building on the success and experience gained from Origin Dollar, OETH presents a fully backed and gas-free solution for users seeking yield opportunities in the ever-expanding DeFi space.</p>



<p>At the core of Origin Ether&#8217;s ecosystem is the Origin Dollar Governance (OGV) token, which serves both as a governance tool and a value-accrual asset for OETH. OGV holders are empowered to participate in critical decision-making processes, including voting on collateral allocations, future yield strategies, and fees for OETH holders. This democratic approach ensures the platform&#8217;s evolution aligns with the collective interests of its community.</p>



<p>Upon launch, Origin Ether has reserved 20% of the generated yield to acquire and vote-lock additional CVX tokens, safeguarding the platform&#8217;s ability to provide sustainable rewards to its users. Furthermore, protocol fees can be deployed for strategic investments or even buybacks of OGV, subsequently distributed to stakers based on the consensus of veOGV holders.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1619-1024x500.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="500" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1619-1024x500.png" alt="Top 5 Yield Farming Strategies In LSDfi" class="wp-image-205185" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1619-1024x500.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1619-300x146.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1619-768x375.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1619-1536x750.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1619-750x366.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1619-1140x556.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1619.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Top 5 Yield Farming Strategies In LSDfi 15"></a></figure></div>


<p>Liquid staking tokens are rapidly gaining popularity in the DeFi sector, but they currently lack diverse yield opportunities beyond validator rewards. While some users might be content with earning approximately 5% APY through traditional staking, these rewards are expected to compress following Ethereum&#8217;s Shanghai upgrade earlier this year.</p>



<p>Origin Protocol recognized this challenge and seized the opportunity to create a platform that offers more attractive APYs on ether, thanks to its robust smart contracts and ingenious yield aggregation techniques derived from the successful Origin Dollar model.</p>



<p>The Origin Ether vault strategically includes exposure to Lido Staked ETH, Rocket Pool ETH, and Staked Frax Ether to capitalize on validator rewards, combining them with liquidity provision strategies for optimum yield generation. The platform&#8217;s debut strategy involves an OETH/ETH AMO approach on Curve, aimed at maintaining the peg, providing cost-effective liquidity, and securing higher yields for OETH holders.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, Origin Ether envisions expanding its capabilities, potentially operating its own nodes and evolving into a liquid staking token itself. The team also expresses keen interest in exploring emerging yield opportunities, such as integrating with novel restaking protocols like Eigenlayer.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Asymetrix Protocol</strong></h3>



<p>In a pioneering move, Asymetrix Protocol has emerged as a decentralized and non-custodial platform that focuses on the Ethereum blockchain as the underlying asset for staking, leading to substantial profits. This trailblazing protocol aims to bring transparency and fairness to the distribution of earnings generated from staking activities.</p>



<p>At its core, Asymetrix Protocol leverages LSDs provided by various liquidity staking providers. After extensive evaluation, stETH, the rebase token with transparent balance updates every 24 hours, was identified as the ideal asset due to its product-market fit and exceptional transparency. With a market capitalization surpassing $5 billion, stETH stands as the dominant token among liquidity staking protocols.</p>



<p>One of the primary reasons for Asymetrix&#8217;s focus on stETH is the unique staking mode it offers, enabling users to earn up to an impressive 999% APR in stETH rewards. While some users may receive a 0% wagering bonus, a select group of lucky winners will witness a remarkable 500% return on their staked investment.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1620-1024x480.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="480" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1620-1024x480.png" alt="Top 5 Yield Farming Strategies In LSDfi" class="wp-image-205186" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1620-1024x480.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1620-300x141.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1620-768x360.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1620-750x351.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1620.png 1095w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Top 5 Yield Farming Strategies In LSDfi 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>The protocol&#8217;s ambitious goal is to establish a crypto equivalent of Premium Bonds with a multitude of winners. To achieve this, Asymetrix employs a meticulously designed reward distribution system, ensuring that the base average return for all users remains relatively unaffected, even while providing the chance to claim super-large rewards, potentially equivalent to up to 1 million USD.</p>



<p>By implementing this fair and transparent mechanism, Asymetrix Protocol seeks to level the playing field, allowing a select few bettors to enjoy superior returns while others preserve their initial capital without receiving any profits.</p>



<p>The novel approach of Asymetrix has garnered significant attention within the crypto community, attracting both seasoned investors and newcomers alike. As the demand for sustainable and equitable investment opportunities continues to grow, the protocol&#8217;s unique offering may revolutionize the staking landscape, paving the way for greater adoption of decentralized financial instruments.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Instadapp</strong></h3>



<p>Offering an array of captivating features, Instadapp aims to empower users to take full control of their assets while maximizing their yield and returns.</p>



<p>At the heart of Instadapp&#8217;s offerings lies &#8220;Avocado,&#8221; their highly regarded Web3 wallet. Providing users with a secure and user-friendly interface, Avocado serves as a gateway to the DeFi ecosystem, enabling seamless interactions with various protocols and applications.</p>



<p>Among Instadapp&#8217;s standout features is &#8220;Instadapp Pro,&#8221; an all-in-one solution that puts users firmly in the driver&#8217;s seat. Instadapp Pro empowers users with built-in strategies, automation capabilities, and batch operations, streamlining complex DeFi transactions and investment decisions.</p>



<p>For users looking for a more hands-off approach, &#8220;Instadapp Lite&#8221; provides an enticing option. By depositing stETH into the protocol, Instadapp Lite&#8217;s smart contracts spring into action, employing a range of innovative strategies to optimize yield generation.</p>



<p>One of the defining aspects of Instadapp is its seamless integration with a variety of DeFi applications, enabling users to strategically deploy their assets to earn attractive yields. The options at users&#8217; disposal are extensive and include refinancing, Vaults, automation, flash loans, and LP (Liquidity Provider) rebalancing.</p>

<p>A standout achievement for Instadapp is the successful creation of its own native token, iETH. Currently commanding an impressive 13.38% market share in LSDfi, the token underscores the project&#8217;s widespread recognition and adoption within the DeFi space.</p>



<p>Promoting interoperability within the DeFi ecosystem, Instadapp fosters collaboration and compatibility among different protocols. Recently, Instadapp unveiled &#8220;Lite v2&#8221; as an upgrade to its original Lite v1 strategy. While Lite v1 focused solely on ETH deposits for Aave v2, the evolution to Lite v2 brings a more comprehensive approach by incorporating various stETH-related strategies.</p>



<p>Lite v2 takes advantage of a diverse array of lending markets, including Aave v2, Aave v3, Morpho, Compound, and Euler, to leverage wstETH (wrapped stETH). By utilizing wstETH as collateral, users can borrow ETH, convert it back to wstETH, and engage in recycling to earn enhanced LSD (Lido) income. Instadapp retains 20% of the generated returns, while depositors enjoy slightly higher yields compared to Lido stETH.</p>



<p>As Instadapp continues to innovate and expand its offerings, it reaffirms its commitment to shaping the future of DeFi. With a strong emphasis on user empowerment, sophisticated strategies, and interoperability, Instadapp is poised to remain a driving force in the ongoing revolution of Decentralized Finance.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Decentralized finance (DeFi) has gained significant traction in recent years, and one of its most popular products is Collateralized Debt Position (CDP). Within the flourishing DeFi landscape, LSDfi has emerged as a prominent player, offering innovative stablecoin solutions. Let&#8217;s find out with <a href="https://twitter.com/Coincuofficial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coincu</a> the top 5 CDP platforms of LSDfi.</strong></h5>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Collateralized Debt Position (CDP)?</h2>



<p>The CDP system is a sophisticated agreement that enables users to lock up their collateral in a secure smart contract. In return, they receive a decentralized stablecoin issued by the platform. Unlike traditional stablecoins pegged to centralized authorities, these stablecoin maintains their value by being backed by the collateral locked in the CDP.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Top 5 CDP platforms of LSDfi</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>MakerDAO &#8211; DAI</strong></h3>



<p>MakerDAO, a prominent Ethereum-based blockchain protocol, has been at the forefront of decentralized finance (DeFi) since its inception. One of its innovative creations, the Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) system, has garnered significant attention within the blockchain industry.</p>



<p>The mechanics of a CDP are simple yet powerful. When a user deposits collateral into the smart contract, it undergoes a process of collateralization, determining the amount of DAI they can generate. This process ensures that there is always sufficient collateral to back the circulating DAI in the ecosystem, maintaining stability and preventing wild fluctuations.</p>



<p>By using CDPs, users can access liquidity without the need for intermediaries like banks. This permissionless and decentralized financial system has opened up new opportunities for individuals globally, providing them with greater control over their finances.</p>



<p>MakerDAO&#8217;s dedication to decentralization and transparency has earned it a reputation as a pioneer in the DeFi space. As the DeFi industry continues to grow and evolve, the CDP system remains a fundamental pillar of MakerDAO&#8217;s ecosystem, contributing to the broader adoption of blockchain-based financial solutions. With the ongoing support of the DeFi community, MakerDAO and its CDP system are poised to shape the future of decentralized finance, bringing financial empowerment to individuals worldwide.</p>



<p>A fundamental principle of MakerDAO&#8217;s CDP system is that the value of the collateral locked must always exceed 150% of the DAI generated. This safety mechanism ensures the stability of the system and mitigates risks associated with market fluctuations. If the value of the collateral falls below the threshold due to market changes, the system automatically initiates a liquidation process. The collateral is sold off to repay the DAI loan, accompanied by a 13% liquidation penalty and 8.5% stability fees, protecting the integrity of the DAI stablecoin.</p>



<p>Currently, there are approximately 440 million DAI stablecoins in circulation, an impressive feat achieved through the CDP process. These DAI coins represent loans that are fully backed by the value of the collateral held in their respective CDPs, ensuring their stability and reliability.</p>



<p>Originally, MakerDAO&#8217;s CDPs solely accepted Ether (ETH) as collateral. However, in a move to diversify and enhance the system&#8217;s robustness, MakerDAO has expanded its accepted collateral assets. Users can now utilize a range of cryptocurrencies, including Basic Attention Token (BAT), USD Coin (USDC), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), TrueUSD (TUSD), Kyber Network (KNC), 0x (ZRX), and Decentraland (MANA). This expansion not only widens the utility of the system but also opens up new possibilities for users seeking decentralized lending and stablecoin solutions.</p>



<p>In addition to its varied collateral options, MakerDAO also offers a decentralized stablecoin called SAI, which is backed by Ether. This further enriches the DeFi ecosystem by providing a stable alternative to the traditionally volatile cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>As the pioneer of CDPs, MakerDAO has set the stage for other DeFi projects to follow suit and implement similar systems. The widespread adoption of CDPs by other projects would mark a significant step forward for DeFi, increasing accessibility to stablecoins and decentralized lending while promoting financial inclusivity and innovation.</p>



<p>With MakerDAO leading the way, the DeFi community eagerly anticipates the continued evolution of CDPs and the positive impact they will have on the world of decentralized finance. As the industry moves towards a more sustainable and interconnected future, MakerDAO&#8217;s groundbreaking initiatives will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping the financial landscape for years to come.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lybra Finance &#8211; eUSD</strong></h3>



<p>Lybra Finance empowered users to collateralize their ETH/stETH holdings to mint the platform&#8217;s stablecoin, eUSD, without incurring any fees, including loan fees. This innovative approach sets Lybra apart from its competitors, providing users with unparalleled opportunities to leverage their assets and earn passive income.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional CDP platforms, Lybra Finance&#8217;s unique selling proposition lies in its ability to offer eUSD as a yield-bearing asset. Simply by holding this stablecoin in their wallets, users become eligible to receive passive income in the form of the platform&#8217;s inflation token, esLBR. This revolutionary concept allows individuals to take advantage of a form of &#8220;negative-interest loans,&#8221; presenting an attractive prospect in the rapidly expanding DeFi landscape.</p>



<p>At the core of Lybra Finance&#8217;s offering is its straightforward process: users collateralize their ETH/stETH holdings on the platform, enabling them to mint eUSD as collateral at a value exceeding 150% (1$ eUSD backed by 1.5$ ETH).

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gravita Protocol &#8211; GRAI</strong></h3>



<p>It appears you have provided information about Gravita Protocol, a lending and borrowing platform that utilizes Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and stablecoins to mint its stablecoin, GRAI. Users can profit GRAI by providing liquidity to Stable Pools and utilizing it on other DeFi protocols.</p>



<p>The peg holding mechanism of GRAI is designed to maintain its value close to $1. Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>



<ul>
<li>When GRAI &gt; $1: If the price of GRAI goes above $1, users have the option to mortgage more assets to mint additional GRAI. They can then sell the excess GRAI they minted at a higher price in the market, thereby profiting from the price difference.</li>



<li>When GRAI &lt; $1: If the price of GRAI falls below $1, users can take advantage of the situation by buying GRAI from the market at a lower price. They can then exchange this GRAI for collateral at a 1:1 ratio, creating an arbitrage opportunity. By doing so, they can acquire more collateral than they initially mortgaged to mint GRAI, profiting from the price difference.</li>
</ul>



<p>The goal of this mechanism is to incentivize users to maintain the value of GRAI close to its $1 peg, as arbitrage opportunities arise when the price deviates from this peg.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the success of this peg holding mechanism depends on the overall liquidity and trading activity of GRAI in the market. Additionally, users should carefully assess the risks involved in collateralizing their assets and participating in the protocol. As with any DeFi platform, there are potential risks, including impermanent loss and smart contract vulnerabilities, that users should be aware of before engaging with the protocol.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Curve Finance &#8211; crvUSD</strong></h3>



<p>crvUSD is a decentralized Stablecoin issued by the Curve Finance protocol. Acting as a card for Curve to establish its dominance in the Stableswap arena, crvUSD is set to revolutionize the stablecoin landscape and bring forth new possibilities for the Ethereum network and beyond.</p>



<p>One of the key features of crvUSD is its issuance through the CDP mechanism. This approach ensures that the stablecoin is backed by secure and low-risk collateral assets, primarily including ETH and BTC. Additionally, the protocol supports a range of other assets such as wstETH and sfrxETH, with plans to integrate more Liquid staked DeFi (LST) assets, further enticing DeFi enthusiasts.</p>



<p>The strength of crvUSD lies in its ability to maintain a stable peg and liquidity, owing to Curve Finance&#8217;s vast user base and abundant liquidity reserves. With approximately $200 million in liquidity distributed across numerous pools, the multi-pool mechanism facilitates seamless asset swaps for users, catering to their diverse needs.</p>



<p>An essential aspect of the crvUSD ecosystem is the borrowing functionality it offers to users. Just like other CDP protocols, Curve allows individuals to collateralize their holdings, specifically in ETH, BTC, or wrapped assets, to mint and borrow crvUSD. However, borrowers must be mindful of the annual interest rates incurred during the borrowing process.</p>



<p>To ensure the safety of the system, Curve Finance employs a strategic liquidation mechanism. When a borrower&#8217;s position enters the soft liquidation mode due to a decline in asset prices within the liquidation price zone, they can only repay the loan or liquidate their position. However, if the position continues to deteriorate and reaches hard liquidation, the borrower stands to lose their entire collateral.</p>



<p>In the future, crvUSD aims to extend its support beyond the Ethereum network, embracing a multi-chain approach. By exploring Layer 2 solutions such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and Zksync Era, the stablecoin seeks to widen its user base and offer enhanced scalability to its growing community.</p>



<p>Curve Finance&#8217;s ambitious roadmap and commitment to bolstering crvUSD&#8217;s utility and resilience are set to attract Liquid staked DeFi players and further solidify its position in the decentralized finance landscape. As the protocol continues to revolutionize the world of stablecoins, the future of crvUSD appears promising, poised to foster financial inclusion and drive the adoption of DeFi across various blockchain ecosystems.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Liquid staking is an innovative solution that addresses the limitations of traditional cryptocurrency staking, providing users with enhanced liquidity and flexibility.</em></li>



<li><em>Users receive liquid staking tokens (LST) when staking their cryptocurrencies, allowing them to trade, lend, or use their staked assets as collateral while still earning staking rewards.</em></li>



<li><em>The method democratizes the staking process and aligns with the principles of DeFi, offering users a user-centric approach to growing their assets in the dynamic decentralized finance ecosystem.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>With the increasing popularity of cryptocurrency staking as a means of earning rewards and among networks, concerns surrounding illiquidity, complexity, and centralization have arisen among investors. However, a groundbreaking alternative known as &#8220;Liquid Staking&#8221; has emerged as an innovative solution to address these limitations.</strong></h5>



<p>Cryptocurrency staking involves locking up funds to support blockchain networks and validate transactions, thereby earning rewards in return. Traditional staking methods like self-staking and exchange staking have their drawbacks, including the inability to access locked assets for a specific period, complexity in managing staking operations, and concerns about centralized custody of staked assets.</p>



<p>In contrast, Liquid Staking introduces a novel approach that seeks to sidestep these risks. By tokenizing staked assets, users can maintain liquidity while participating in staking activities. This newfound liquidity allows investors to trade, lend, or use their staked assets as collateral, providing flexibility that was previously unavailable in conventional staking models. Let&#8217;s learn about this staking method with <a href="https://twitter.com/Coincuofficial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coincu</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is liquid staking?</h2>



<p>At its core, liquid staking is a software-based innovation that facilitates direct staking on proof of stake (PoS) networks. When users stake their cryptocurrencies, they receive a liquid staking token (LST) that is programmatically minted by the protocol. This LST serves as evidence of ownership for the staked tokens and any associated network rewards.</p>



<p>The primary advantage of liquid staking lies in its ability to address the liquidity constraints imposed by traditional staking methods. Unlike the latter, which require users to endure bonding and unbonding periods lasting several days to weeks, liquid staking empowers token holders with enhanced liquidity and capital efficiency. The LSTs they receive can be transferred, stored, traded, or utilized in various DeFi applications without compromising their staking rewards.</p>



<p>One of the pioneering platforms in the liquid staking landscape is Lido. This platform enables users to stake any amount of Ethereum and receive stETH (a tokenized representation of their staked funds) in return. The stETH can be utilized for lending, used as collateral, or traded in other DeFi activities, all while the user continues to earn daily staking rewards. Additionally, Lido&#8217;s approach enables users to unstake at any time through stETH-ETH liquidity pools.</p>



<p>In the context of liquid staking, the process is akin to depositing ETH into a third-party application, which then deposits the user&#8217;s ETH into the Ethereum deposit contract through their own validators. In exchange, the app mints a representative ETH token (e.g., stETH) for the user. This representative token grants users the flexibility to transfer their ETH while still earning Ethereum staking rewards.</p>



<p>However, it is crucial to acknowledge that liquid staking comes with its own set of risks. While it offers increased liquidity, it also exposes users to potential security vulnerabilities or network-related issues. As with any financial venture, cautious research and risk assessment are vital when considering participation in liquid staking activities.</p>



<p>The year 2022 witnessed significant adoption of liquid staking, riding on the wave of DeFi opportunities. As more crypto enthusiasts explore innovative ways to earn rewards and optimize their assets, liquid staking is anticipated to play a prominent role in shaping the future of staking and contributing to the continuous growth of the DeFi ecosystem.</p>



<p>In conclusion, liquid staking represents a paradigm shift in the world of staking and DeFi. It empowers users to unlock the potential of their staked assets while participating in securing PoS networks. As the demand for DeFi opportunities continues to surge, liquid staking is poised to become an integral component of the evolving decentralized finance landscape. However, prudent consideration of the risks and benefits associated with liquid staking is essential for users seeking to make the most of this groundbreaking innovation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How does it work?</h2>



<p>While bearing some resemblance to traditional staking options, the execution methods of liquid staking stand apart as a distinct and game-changing approach.</p>



<p>Liquid staking protocols represent a new generation of opportunities that enable users to stake any desired amount of an asset and easily withdraw them without impacting their initial deposit. This process involves depositing assets into specialized platforms, where users are then issued tokenized versions of their staked crypto assets. These derivative tokens carry an equivalent value and operate on a one-to-one basis with the original asset, albeit usually distinguished with a unique emblem.</p>



<p>For instance, if a user decides to stake 1 ETH into one of the liquid staking services, they would receive one stETH, with the &#8220;st&#8221; signifying staked ETH.</p>



<p>One of the key benefits of liquid staking is the fluidity it offers to users. The newly issued tokens can be freely transferred, traded, stored elsewhere, or even used for transactions without interfering with the initial deposit. This enhanced accessibility sets liquid staking apart from conventional staking methods. Additionally, users can earn staking rewards on their initial deposits while simultaneously generating more funds from their derivative tokens, creating a win-win situation.</p>



<p>Should a user choose to withdraw their initial deposit, they must return an equivalent deposit value to regain access to their funds. It is worth noting that certain liquid staking protocols may charge fees for the use of their platforms, though the fee structures can vary.</p>



<p>In contrast to conventional staking, where locked-up assets remain inaccessible for a set period, liquid staking empowers users to grow their crypto holdings while retaining the flexibility to capitalize on other investment opportunities or navigate volatile market conditions.</p>



<p>Liquid staking operates through a process of users delegating their crypto assets to a validator node on a delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) network by pooling tokens in a staking pool via a third-party liquid staking service provider or native projects within the network. In return for locking their tokens in the network, users are issued derivative tokens representing their underlying assets, granting them access to liquid funds while their crypto remains staked. Liquid staking protocols typically utilize two primary mechanisms: rebasable and exchange rate-based tokens.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rebasable Liquid Staking Derivatives</strong></h3>



<p>Under the rebasable LSD model, the value of the underlying asset and the derivative token remains consistently pegged at a 1:1 ratio. The balance of the derivative token is recalculated daily through updates from an oracle, reporting changes in the balance of the underlying token. For example, staking 1 Ether (ETH) on platforms like Lido would yield users 1 stETH, and upon withdrawal, users can redeem their ETH by burning stETH at the same 1:1 ratio established during minting.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exchange Rate-Based Liquid Staking Derivatives</strong></h3>



<p>Exchange rate-based LSDs differ by experiencing fluctuations in value over time to reflect accrued rewards and fees while maintaining an unaltered balance. This results in a constant change in the exchange rate between the LSD and its underlying asset, usually updated on a 24-hour basis, depending on the specific protocol. For instance, staking 1 ETH on Rocket Pool would grant users 1 rETH, with the rETH/ETH exchange rate updated daily based on rewards earned by Rocket Pool&#8217;s Beacon Chain node operators, leading to an increase in the value of rETH over time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Advantages</strong></h3>



<ol>
<li>Mobility: Liquid staking offers the flexibility to withdraw tokenized assets, allowing users to move their funds and react to market changes swiftly. This prevents users from being locked into long-term staking commitments during volatile market conditions, reducing the risk of potential losses.</li>



<li>Multiple Income Streams: Liquid staking enables users to leverage their staked assets as collateral for crypto-backed loans, creating additional income streams. By depositing these loans into higher-yield accounts, users can optimize their returns and take advantage of various DeFi opportunities.</li>



<li>Barrier-Free Entry: The concept of liquid staking aims to address the barriers associated with traditional staking, such as illiquidity, immobility, and inaccessibility. By converting locked capital into liquid assets through Receipt Tokens, users gain immediate access to liquidity, fostering a more accessible and inclusive staking ecosystem.</li>



<li>Composability of Yield Strategies: Liquid staking tokens can be utilized as collateral on centralized or decentralized platforms, allowing stakers to earn interest on top of their staking rewards. This opens up a wide array of yield strategies in the DeFi space, enhancing the overall profitability of staked assets.</li>



<li>Enhanced Technical Features: Unlike traditional staking, which delegates funds to a single validator, liquid staking offers more technical sophistication. Users can interact with smart contracts to manage their staked assets, granting them greater control and diversification options.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Disadvantages</strong></h3>



<ol>
<li>Depegging Risk: One significant risk of liquid staking lies in the possibility of tokenized assets depegging from the original staked tokens. If the tokenized version&#8217;s value deviates significantly from the underlying asset, users may experience losses when trading or redeeming their assets.</li>



<li>Loss of Access to Deposited Funds: Users face the risk of losing access to their deposited funds if they lose their tokenized assets in a trade. Retrieving the original deposit then requires making an equivalent deposit, which could be problematic for users facing financial constraints.</li>



<li>Smart Contract Vulnerabilities: Liquid staking relies on smart contracts to manage the tokenization process. While smart contracts are efficient, they are not immune to bugs or vulnerabilities. If a smart contract is exploited, it could lead to the loss of users&#8217; funds, with no recourse for recovery.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Liquid staking, a groundbreaking new-generation system, has emerged as a game-changer in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), offering users unprecedented opportunities to grow their assets. Unlike traditional staking, which often locks funds, it provides a flexible and accessible approach, enabling users to make the most of their assets while reaping the benefits of staking.</p>



<p>Led by prominent platforms like Lido, liquid staking empowers users to utilize a liquid version of their staked assets on various other platforms. This newfound liquidity has quickly made liquid staking a favorite among users who seek greater control over their funds, allowing them to redeem their assets at any time without the usual restrictions.</p>



<p>One of the main attractions of liquid staking is that it eliminates the risks and complexities associated with self-staking while still providing the same benefits. Users can now enjoy the rewards of staking without the need to navigate intricate processes or depend on centralized exchanges.</p>



<p>In the realm of Ethereum, liquid staking stands out as a viable alternative to both self and exchange staking. By skillfully balancing risk, reward, and convenience, liquid staking opens doors for traders to exchange staked tokens without facing the stringent requirements often imposed on stakers in the Ethereum network.</p>



<p>Furthermore, liquid staking democratizes the staking process, catering to holders of all ETH amounts. For those with smaller wallets, the system allows staking any desired amount of Ethereum while retaining the flexibility to unstake at any moment. On the other hand, larger ETH holders can leverage liquid staking services to hedge their funds against the volatility of ETH prices, enjoying the benefits without the burden of maintaining a complex staking infrastructure.</p>



<p>As the greater DeFi movement continues to gather momentum, liquid staking aligns perfectly with its core values of decentralization and accessibility. Enabling users to earn staking rewards while actively participating in the dynamic DeFi ecosystem, liquid staking represents the epitome of decentralized finance in action.</p>



<p>With its user-centric approach and revolutionary features, liquid staking is poised to disrupt the traditional staking landscape, unlocking a wealth of opportunities for users and fostering the growth of the DeFi space as a whole. As the popularity of liquid staking continues to surge, the future of decentralized finance looks brighter than ever.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a surprising turn of events, large holders of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens experienced a remarkable 923% surge in outflows within a span of 24 hours.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2021-09-10-20.28.19.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2021-09-10-20.28.19.jpeg" alt="Large Shiba Inu Holders Witness Jaw-Dropping 923% Surge in SHIB Outflows Overnight" class="wp-image-205155" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2021-09-10-20.28.19.jpeg 1000w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2021-09-10-20.28.19-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2021-09-10-20.28.19-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2021-09-10-20.28.19-750x500.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Large Shiba Inu Holders Witness Jaw-Dropping 923% Surge in SHIB Outflows Overnight 27"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>On-chain data revealed that the SHIB tokens moved from 268 million to a staggering 2.47 trillion, leaving experts puzzled over the sudden spike. Notably, this surge occurred despite the <a href="https://coincu.com/202984-shiba-inu-shib-burning-rate-surges-by-2000/">Shiba Inu</a> token&#8217;s price showing no extraordinary fluctuations during the same period.</p>



<p>While some tokens were flowing back into the wallets, the incoming amounts were relatively smaller in comparison to the massive outflows. The most intriguing aspect of this development is the fact that the majority of the Shiba Inu token supply, an astounding 636.42 trillion SHIB (including the burn address), is concentrated in whale wallets. Many of these large wallets belong to centralized exchanges&#8217; hot wallets, which has led to speculation about orchestrated efforts by centralized entities.</p>



<p>The coordinated movement of tokens between these wallets raises questions about potential motives and actions taken by these entities. The lack of clear reasons for such large-scale outflows has left the crypto community guessing about the intentions behind these transactions. Additionally, the apparent resilience of these large holders in the face of significant outflows has further fueled discussions about their potential influence on the Shiba Inu token market.</p>

<p>The concentration of such a substantial portion of the SHIB supply in a few wallets raises concerns about the impact these holders could have on the overall token market. With such a significant stake in their possession, these large holders could potentially influence token prices and market sentiment through their actions.</p>



<p>While the Shiba Inu community is still trying to make sense of this sudden surge in outflows, analysts and investors are keeping a close eye on any further developments. The dynamics of large holders and their activities continue to be a topic of interest, prompting discussions about the need for transparency and decentralization within the crypto space.</p>



<p>As the situation unfolds, the crypto market will closely monitor the movements and actions of these major SHIB holders to gain a better understanding of their impact on the token&#8217;s performance and overall market stability.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a recent and concerning security breach, Alphapo&#8217;s hot wallet experienced a devastating attack resulting in the theft of $23 million in funds.&nbsp;</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Alphapo-Loses-23-Million-in-Multi-Platform-Attack-1024x527-1.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="527" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Alphapo-Loses-23-Million-in-Multi-Platform-Attack-1024x527-1.png" alt="Alphapo Hot Wallet Breach: $23 Million Stolen Due To Compromised Private Key" class="wp-image-205150" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Alphapo-Loses-23-Million-in-Multi-Platform-Attack-1024x527-1.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Alphapo-Loses-23-Million-in-Multi-Platform-Attack-1024x527-1-300x154.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Alphapo-Loses-23-Million-in-Multi-Platform-Attack-1024x527-1-768x395.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Alphapo-Loses-23-Million-in-Multi-Platform-Attack-1024x527-1-750x386.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Alphapo Hot Wallet Breach: $23 Million Stolen Due To Compromised Private Key 29"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>According to CertiK monitoring, the breach occurred on July 23, raising alarms within the cryptocurrency community. The stolen funds included 5,700 ETH, which were subsequently bridged to BTC, and a substantial amount of 118.3 million TRX, traced to a wallet address beginning with &#8220;TJF7m.&#8221;</p>



<p>The primary cause of the breach appears to be a compromised private key, a sensitive cryptographic code used to access and secure the wallet&#8217;s contents. This incident is part of a growing trend of losses due to compromised private keys in 2023, contributing to a staggering total of $214 million in losses.</p>



<p>The security firm ZachXBT also reported on the incident, confirming the gravity of the situation. Following the breach, Alphapo&#8217;s client HypeDrop swiftly implemented precautionary measures, temporarily disabling withdrawals to prevent further unauthorized access and safeguard users&#8217; assets.</p>



<p>The stolen funds were cleverly laundered through multiple cross-chains, attempting to obscure the digital footprint of the attackers. The first step involved transferring the stolen assets to the Ethereum network, followed by intricate cross-chaining to the Avalanche and BTC networks, making it more challenging to track and recover the stolen funds.</p>

<p>The incident has raised concerns within the cryptocurrency community, highlighting the critical importance of securing private keys and employing robust security measures. Users are urged to exercise caution, verify security protocols, and utilize multi-factor authentication to protect their assets from potential breaches.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/205076-alphapo-loses-23-million-multi-platform-attack/">Alphapo</a>&#8216;s security team is actively investigating the breach and working to bolster their security infrastructure to prevent future attacks. Additionally, the broader cryptocurrency industry may also use this incident as a valuable learning opportunity to enhance security practices across the board.</p>



<p>As the investigation unfolds, users are advised to stay informed and follow updates from Alphapo and HypeDrop to ensure the safety of their holdings. Cybersecurity remains a top priority in the crypto space, and industry stakeholders must continue to collaborate and innovate to create a safer environment for all participants.</p>
