An intriguing development has caught the crypto community&#8217;s attention as a Bitcoin whale deposited a substantial amount of BTC on the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange, Binance. This significant move has sparked speculation about potential selling pressure and the subsequent impact on Bitcoin&#8217;s price. Notably, the massive deposit was recorded when Bitcoin showed signs of a rebound following its recent losses in the past week. Whale Moves BTC To Binance According to renowned on-chain analyst Lookonchain, a notable Bitcoin whale made a deposit of 1,750 BTC which is worth over $48 Million, on the Binance exchange a few hours ago. This occurrence has raised concerns among market observers, as large transactions can indicate imminent selling pressure.

On April 21, the same individual deposited a staggering 5,791 BTC (equivalent to $163 million), leading to a subsequent 3% drop in Bitcoin&#8217;s price within five hours. Notably, Lookonchain says this whale has a history of buying large amounts of Bitcoin. The analyst reports that the whale initially acquired 10,000 BTC, valued at $171 million, on December 1, 2022, when Bitcoin was priced at $17,101. And as of now, the whale has a current Bitcoin holding balance of 2,459 BTC and an approximate profit of $107 million. Bitcoin Reaction: Analyzing the Possibilities It is worth noting that the Bitcoin market reaction to this whale can be quite unpredictable as the large investor alone might have a different reason to move the coins besides selling them. However, given the historical evidence of price movements following whale deposits on exchanges, Bitcoin will likely experience a spike in volatility soon.

Glassnode Co-Founder Weighs In Particularly, If the past is any indication, there is a possibility of a short-term dip in Bitcoin&#8217;s price if the whale sells its BTC deposit. The sudden influx of 1,750 BTC into the exchange may trigger a cascade of sell-offs from other market participants, leading to a temporary downturn. Regardless, Bitcoin&#8217;s price has experienced a quick spike in the past 24 hours, up by 1%. Bitcoin has shown possible signs of rebound along with the rest of the crypto market. BTC has surged from low trading below $27,000 yesterday to trading for $27,406 at the time of writing. Before the bullish signs, BTC has since been in a downward trend in the past weeks, down by more than 10% in the past month. Interestingly, BTC trading volume remains below $10 billion despite the whale movement. Featured image from, Unsplash, Chart from TradingView
