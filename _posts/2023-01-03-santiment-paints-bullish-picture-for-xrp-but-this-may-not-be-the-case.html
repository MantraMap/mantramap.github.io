XRP price is having a shaky start to the year 2023 after a sharp drop on Monday during Asia hours. The digital asset eventually recovered but it remains shaky even now a new report from Santiment shows that there could be a bull case for the cryptocurrency. This bull case is tied to large XRP holders who have been accumulating coins over the past six months. A Bull Case For XRP The report from Santiment starts out with the revelation that large investors holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP tokens have been increasing their bags aggressively. Apparently, over the last six years, these investors raised their collective balances by 25%. This now meant that they were holding more than 4 billion XRP.

Basically, when these whales go on a buying spree such as this, it is when the price has already reached its lowest point in the bear market. So if history is anything to go by and this was to have the same effects as previously seen, then it could mean that there is a bull rally in scope for the digital asset. Additionally, it explains that the MVRV 30 for the altcoin shows that short-term holders were seeing losses of 7% on average. So this points to a hesitancy to sell among these holders because they do not want to take a loss. This refusal to dump tokens and whales adding to their balances adds up to less supply hitting the market while demand is on the rise. Basic laws of economics will easily put this as a recipe for a jump in the price of assets, hence the bull case for XRP. XRP price continues to struggle at $0.34 &#124; Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com But What If This Isn’t The Case? One thing that XRP holders have to take into account is the Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple. This case is yet to be concluded and it continues to put a damper on the price of XRP. To know just how much of an effect it had, while most cryptocurrencies in the market were hitting new all-time highs, XRP’s price had declined, unable to even reclaim its own all-time high price from 2018.

Furthermore, if the final judgment were to be against Ripple, then investors should expect a rapid decline in the price of the asset. The only thing that can categorically determine if there is a bull rally coming for the altcoin would be for the outcome of the case to be in favor of Ripple. Until then, the price of the digital asset is expected to trade sideways, as well as lag behind the general crypto market. Featured image from Outlook India, chart from TradingView.com
