Litecoin has recently managed to break past the $95 mark as on-chain data shows the whales have become active on the network. Litecoin Has Surged After Spike In Whale Activity According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the current whale activity is the highest it has been since January. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;whale transaction count,&#8221; which measures the total number of transfers taking place on the Litecoin network that involve the movement of coins worth at least $100,000. Since such transactions are quite large in scale, generally only the whale entities are capable of making them. Thus, this indicator can provide us with an idea about the number of transfers that these humongous holders are making on the blockchain. Due to the sheer number of coins involved in each of these transfers, if a large amount of them take place at once, the market can register noticeable fluctuations. So, whenever the whale transaction count has a high value, the price of LTC becomes more probable to display volatility. On the other hand, when this metric has low values, the price may stay relatively calm, as it suggests that the whales aren&#8217;t making too many moves on the market right now. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Litecoin whale transaction counts over the last six months or so: The value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent days &#124; Source: Santiment on Twitter As shown in the above graph, the Litecoin whale transaction count has observed a large spike recently. This means that whales have ramped up their transfer activity in the last couple of days. Related Reading: XRP Hype Spikes As Price Surges 12%, Is This A Top Signal? At the peak of this spike, the indicator had reached its highest level since January 26, 2023. These high values have come as the price has been going up, and since they have taken place, the uptrend has only continued further, with LTC managing to break past $95. Generally, when whales become active, the price volatility can go either way as the transaction count metric only tells us about the pure number of transfers happening on the chain and not about whether they are buying or selling moves. However, as the price has seemingly continued to rise following this latest spike, it may appear that the Litecoin whales could be supportive of the current uptrend. The chart also includes the data for the transaction volume, which is a measure of the daily total amount of LTC that is registering some movement on the blockchain.

Such a trend is generally a sign of activity being high throughout the network and is often constructive for the price. This new surge in the price of Litecoin has come as the halving, an event where the coin&#8217;s block rewards will be permanently cut in half, is just a couple of months away now. LTC Price At the time of writing, Litecoin is trading around $95, up 9% in the last week. Looks like the asset has seen a rise recently &#124; Source: LTCUSD on TradingView Featured image from Michael FÃ¶rtsch on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net
