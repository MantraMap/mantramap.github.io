<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/imf-tax-crypto-assets/">IMF Seeks Ways to Tax Crypto Assets</a></p>
<p>According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), tens of billions of dollars of crypto tax are still out there. The financial agency noted that governments are yet to address all the possible ways to tax <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/news/crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto</a>. Even if the crypto tax has no hindrances, the IMF noted the challenges in processing the action. The group released a paper on “taxing cryptocurrencies” to discuss the problems with accommodating crypto assets within the tax systems. The research did not fail to mention that the tax system is not designed for crypto, causing a significant struggle to home them. Notably, the tax systems were in place way before the emergence of blockchain technology, which has given birth to several assets.</p>
<h2>IMF Investigates Crypto Tax and Suggests How to Gather the Pending Taxes</h2>
<p>In the paper, the IMF noted that the “semi-anonymity” of crypto makes it difficult to tax the asset. The group also referred to its dual nature, which includes an investment vehicle and means of payment. In addition, high volatility is common to cryptocurrencies, and this is a major challenge for tax collections. As a matter of fact, there is no consensus on how to tax cryptocurrency &#8211; whether as gambling, capital gains, or income. The paper stated that crypto is not specifically influential in evading taxes considering its high fees and volatility. It noted the exploration of green taxation but called for more mechanisms to help the current situation.</p>
<p>Summarizing the challenges policymakers face to tax crypto, the IMF <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/06/30/Taxing-Cryptocurrencies-535510" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The greatest challenges are for implementation: crypto’s quasi-anonymity is an inherent obstacle to third-party reporting. Design problems arise from cryptocurrencies’ dual nature as investment assets and means of payment: more straightforward is a compelling case for corrective taxation of carbon-intensive mining. Ownership is highly concentrated at the top, but many crypto investors have only moderate incomes. The capital gains tax revenue at stake worldwide may be in the tens of billions of dollars, but the more profound risks may ultimately be for VAT/sales taxes.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The financial group added that the high adoption of crypto in growing economies where there is a limit to collection technology is another setback. The category of crypto holders &#8211; the smallholders and the whales also causes the IMF not to tax crypto. The retail crypto holders require a different approach compared to the whales that hold larger portions. Hence, there is a need for a proper tax design. The agency also spoke of anonymous transactions, noting that that could result in anonymous transactions.</p>
<p>To tax crypto, the IMF explained that the distributed ledger technology could be helpful too. It referred to the technology’s transparency, which could help trace transaction history and eventually be used in administering the due taxes. It added that “the use of smart contracts (self-executing programs) within blockchains, for example, might in principle help secure chains of VAT compliance and enforce withholding”.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/general-motors-deliveries-q2-2023/">General Motors Announces 19% Increase in Vehicle Deliveries YoY in Q2 2023</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/general-motors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Motors Co</a> (NYSE: GM), a Detroit-based automaker with several vehicle subsidiaries, announced its second-quarter sales on Wednesday, July 05. According to the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/05/gm-second-quarter-2023-new-vehicle-sales.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announcement</a>, General Motors delivered 691,978 vehicles in the United States during the second quarter, up approximately 19 percent Year over Year. The company announced that all its four subsidiaries delivered double-digit increases in sales YoY. During the second quarter, GM announced that its EV section delivered about 15,652 units to the market.</p>
<p>However, the company recorded a significant decline in first-quarter sales, which resulted in a mixed reaction on its stock market. During the first quarter of 2023, General Motors reported total vehicle sales of about 1.3 million including more than 36k electric vehicles. As a result, GM shares closed Wednesday trading at $39.42, up approximately 1.18 percent from the day’s opening price. However, GM shares dropped approximately 0.15 percent during the after-hours trading session. Nonetheless, the company’s stock market has gained approximately 17 percent YTD.</p>
<h2>General Motors and Its Market Performance</h2>
<p>Undeniably, the company has lagged behind the electric vehicle industry compared to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla Inc</a> (NASDAQ: TSLA) which has significantly dominated the American market. As a result, the company has been blamed for not ramping up production of EVs amid the global transition. For comparison purposes, Tesla produced nearly 480k electric vehicles during the second quarter alone and delivered more than 466k units to customers.</p>
<p>The slow transition of General Motors from combustion engines to electric vehicles has seen its global market share decline as more countries champion greener energy.</p>
<p>In the company’s defense, GM CEO Mary Barra highlighted that its EV sector has significantly been hampered by battery production that has been taking longer than expected. Notably, its competitor Tesla has an in-house battery production site that has significantly streamlined its supply chain.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the company is expected to significantly increase its EV production especially after Tesla confirmed that its charging spots can be used by other EV companies including General Motors. The move is in line with the Biden administration&#8217;s to help struggling electric vehicle companies rise and create more jobs.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>During the second half of the year, General Motors has planned to unveil several electric vehicle models including the Chevrolet Silverado, Blazer,  Equinox, and a $300,000-plus bespoke Cadillac EV dubbed the Celestiq. Previously, the company heavily relied on Chevrolet Bolt models in its EV sales but announced the model will be discontinued during the second half of 2023.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company is expected to release detailed Q2 earnings results on July 25.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ai-web3go-4m-seed-funding/">AI-centric Web3Go Raises $4M in Seed Funding Round Led by Binance Labs</a></p>
<p>Web3Go, a blockchain company that is revolutionizing artificial intelligence (AI) and data services, has received tremendous support from different sectors including governments, big tech corporations, and crypto veteran companies. Web3Go announced that it successfully raised $4 million in its seed funding round led by Binance Labs. This funding can help to ensure future growth prospects for the company. Other key participants in the Web3Go seed funding round include Hashkey Capital, NGC, Shima Capital, IVC, LIF, Big Brain Holdings, and Archerman Capital.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>— Web3Go 🚀 To the DIN (@Web3Go) <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Go/status/1676538376206553089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The strategic funding comes amid the high global demand for AI-backed products, especially in emerging blockchain markets. As a result, Web3Go intends to channel the funds to construct an intelligent network on the blockchain that will be powered by its in-house AI and big data infrastructure.</p>
<p>According to the company, the intelligent network will allow users to seamlessly utilize on-chain and off-chain data sets to create a wide range of AI-backed digital assets. Notably, Web3Go users can utilize the intelligent data network in trading strategies, trading support bots, education, and entertainment among others.</p>
<p>In addition to the seed funding round, Web3Go has also received funding from different entities seeking to venture into the AI side of blockchain technology.</p>
<p>For instance, Web3Go has been selected by various tech entities including BNB Chain MVB V, AWS Activate, Google Cloud Startup, and Web3 Foundation Grant program to assist in the same sector of AI and blockchain solutions. Last month, Web3Go was selected for the Cyberport Incubation Program, which highlights the company&#8217;s position as a key Web3.0 startup supported by the Hong Kong government. The Hong Kong government has already passed crypto-friendly policies to attract international investors seeking to tap into blockchain technology.</p>
<h2>Closer Look at Web3Go Market Outlook</h2>
<p>The significant backing of Web3Go from Binance Labs and its venture into the Hong Kong market speaks volumes. Notably, the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> crypto exchange has received serious hostility in the United States, the United Kingdom, and some European countries. With the shrinking Western market, Binance has recently increased its focus in Asian countries with Hong Kong its latest target. Moreover, Hong Kong is the floodgate to the vast Chinese market with a huge gap in crypto and blockchain adoption.</p>
<p>With a keen interest in creator ownership and building the foundational tools for the widespread application of AI and blockchain, Web3Go intends to make digital asset ownership a simple process backed by big data. Moreover, the startup’s native asset creation platform DIN is expected to release its Beta version by the end of this month.</p>
<p>“By leveraging the power of blockchain technology to redefine the paradigm of production relations, the company aims to address the challenge of verifying ownership for AI-native digital assets,” the company <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/7/5/2699615/0/en/Web3Go-DIN-Creating-AI-Native-Digital-Assets-Redefining-Production-Relations-with-Blockchain.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a> in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/authors-copyright-lawsuit-openai/">Authors File Copyright Lawsuit against OpenAI for Using Their Books to Train ChatGPT without Consent</a></p>
<p>Two authors have filed a class-action <a href="https://llmlitigation.com/pdf/03223/tremblay-openai-complaint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lawsuit</a> against <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT</a> creator OpenAI for allegedly infringing on their copyright, and using their books to train the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot without obtaining consent. According to the suit, ChatGPT can produce “very accurate summaries” of their books, which is “only possible” if OpenAI used their books to train the chatbot.</p>
<p>Authors Paul Tremblay and Mona Awad filed the lawsuit in a San Francisco federal court. Their lawsuit states that OpenAI used a lot of data protected by copyright law to train ChatGPT, including their books. The authors state that OpenAI exploits published material and that they want financial compensation on behalf of authors in the US whose publications OpenAI “unfairly” benefit from.</p>
<p>Both authors have rights to and have published several books, including Tremblay’s “The Cabin at the End of the World”, as well as Awad’s “13 Ways of Looking at a Fat Girl” and “Bunny”. Included in the complaint are a few “<a href="https://llmlitigation.com/pdf/03223/tremblay-openai-complaint-exhibits.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">exhibits</a>” of ChatGPT’s responses containing summaries of these books, which include some wrong information. However, the complaint states that ChatGPT “retains knowledge of particular works in the training dataset” since the summaries are largely accurate.</p>
<p>University of Sussex intellectual property law reader Andres Guadamuz <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/05/authors-file-a-lawsuit-against-openai-for-unlawfully-ingesting-their-books" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirms</a> in a conversation with The Guardian that this is the first copyright lawsuit against OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Guadamuz believes that the lawsuit could clarify what constitutes legal actions in the general AI space, especially with generative text.</p>
<h2>Is There a Legitimate Copyright Case against OpenAI?</h2>
<p>According to the filing, OpenAI owes plaintiffs a duty of care to protect obligations, customs, and practices, and reasonably control the information it holds. The lawsuit then states:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Defendants breached their duties by negligently, careless, and recklessly collecting, maintaining and controlling Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ Infringed Works and engineering, designing, maintaining and controlling systems &#8211; including ChatGPT &#8211; which are trained on Plaintiff’s and Class members’ Infringed Works without their authorization.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However, Guadamuz suggests that the plaintiffs may not have much of a case. According to him, proving that Tremblay and Awad were financially exploited by ChatGPT’s use of their publications could be tricky even if there is proof ChatGPT appropriated their works. Guadamuz believes that ChatGPT could work “exactly the same” even if these books were not used for its training. This is because much of the chatbot’s training relies on public information on the internet, which may include conversations about books.</p>
<p>Newcastle University professor of law, innovation and society, Lilian Edwards, believes the court’s interpretation may be the most important. According to Edwards, a resolution of the copyright lawsuit against Open would depend on the court’s understanding of OpenAI’s use of copyrighted material. Edwards says plaintiffs may win or lose if the courts determine OpenAI’s application of the books is “fair use” or “simple unauthorized copying”.</p>
<p>Interestingly, she states that the court’s interpretation would be different in the UK since the country does not allow the “fair use” justification in the same way the US might.</p>

<p>While the Binance.US market share remains on the downside, the Coinbase share has somehow managed to appreciate.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-us-market-share-plummets/">Binance.US Loses Over 20% Market Share amid SEC&#8217;s Indictment</a></p>
<p>The market share of US-based crypto exchange Binance.US has reportedly dropped over 20% in the past couple of weeks. A July 5 Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/binance-market-share-takes-regulatory-hit-its-us-affiliate-shrinks-2023-07-05/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> quoted data from Kaiko as suggesting that the exchange held a little above 22% of the market back in April. However, as of June 26, its share had dropped to nearly 0.9%.</p>
<h2>Binance.US Market Share Suffers Huge Blow as Coinbase Sees Boost</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, it might be safe to say that this situation is not unrelated to the exchange&#8217;s recent run-in with federal regulators. This follows after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) recently <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sec-sues-binance-securities-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed</a> a suit against Binance.US, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a>, and CEO Changpeng Zhao (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/changpeng-zhao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CZ</a>).</p>
<p>The June 5 lawsuit alleges that Binance had been operating as an unregistered securities exchange. And it might also be interesting to note that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) had earlier filed a similar lawsuit against Binance and CZ. That was as far back as March.</p>
<p>While Binance.US&#8217; market share remains on the downside, Coinbase&#8217;s share has somehow managed to appreciate. That is even though the crypto exchange is also currently facing a <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-sec-coinbase-unregistered-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar lawsuit from the SEC</a>.</p>
<p>According to the data pulled by Reuters, Coinbase&#8217;s market share in the US saw a 7% boost. Within the same period as Binance.US, it went from approximately 48% to 55%.</p>
<p>But the surge appears to be related to Coinbase being named as a surveillance partner in about three SEC filings where asset managers are applying to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. One such is an <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blackrock-coinbase-spot-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated application</a> by BlackRock.</p>
<p>Coinspeaker <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> on June 16 that BlackRock joined the race for a spot Bitcoin ETF. And though the SEC has not approved any such applications, BlackRock&#8217;s part in the race has seen investor sentiment rising, albeit unsurprisingly. The firm has also been tipped to have a 50% chance of having its application approved by the SEC. As a result, the combined spot and derivatives trading volume on centralized exchanges has now surpassed $2.7 trillion.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-stops-deposits-withdrawals-8-multichain-tokens/">Binance Stops Deposits and Withdrawals for 8 Multichain-Bridged Tokens Until Further Notice</a></p>
<p>Binance has announced it would stop support for withdrawals and deposits for 8 Multichain-bridged tokens from Friday. The crypto exchange <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/updates-on-the-suspension-of-deposits-withdrawals-for-multichain-bridged-tokens-3c7d279dd37043bd8290ac718b5c08a4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the suspension would last until further notice.</p>
<p>The recent cessation comes following a previous suspension of the affected tokens because of a problem with the Multichain (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/multichain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MULTI</a>) protocol. On May 25, Binance had previously suspended these tokens because transactions via the Multichain protocol were stalling. Many transactions were stuck, leaving users wondering without word from the protocol.</p>
<p>The affected tokens are Harvest Finance (FARM) via BSC, Travala (AVA) via ETH, Alchemy Pay (ACH) via BSC, and Polkastarter (POLS) via BSC. Others are SuperVerse (SUPER) via BSC, Alpaca Finance (ALPACA) via Fantom, Beefy.Finance (BIFI) via Fantom, and Spell Token (SPELL) via Avalanche C-Chain.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1661443109019062272?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> on May 24, Multichain revealed: “some of the cross-chain routes are unavailable due to force majeure, and the time for service to resume is unknown.” Multichain also said in the tweet that it will automatically credit pending transactions, and compensate all users affected.</p>
<h2>Market Reactions to Multichain Problem</h2>
<p>At the time, a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-suspends-deposits-for-bridged-tokens-seeks-clarity-from-multichain-team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> stated that Binance was not the only crypto firm to react to Multichain. Blockchain analysis service Lookonchain reported MULTI outflows of $3 million. In addition, a Fantom Foundation wallet address removed $2.4 million (449,740) of liquidity on SushiSwap.</p>
<p>Intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence also confirmed in a <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1661405156469030915?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1661405156469030915%7Ctwgr%5Ecb822edae6d5607dcdaee499ec2bccce38465295%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fbinance-suspends-deposits-for-bridged-tokens-seeks-clarity-from-multichain-team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> that wallets moved around $3 million worth of MULTI tokens to crypto exchange Gate.io. The move scared investors and caused MULTI’s price to plunge 26.5% in 24 hours. Arkham Intelligence’s tweet also referenced a rumor that authorities in Shanghai arrested the Multichain team.</p>
<p>Binance’s announcement states that all mentioned tokens are still available via other networks supported on the exchange. According to data from CoinGecko, MULTI is trading at $3.13 after losing 6.1% in 24 hours and 7.4% in the past week. MULTI’s 24-hour high is $3.34, with a 7-day high at $3.53.</p>
<h2>Binance Multichain Suspension a Likely Move to Protect Funds and Avoid Regulatory Attention</h2>
<p>The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, Binance is facing a lot of regulatory stress and is likely acting carefully with Multichain to avoid further problems. In May, Binance announced it would suspend access to some privacy coins in specific European countries to comply with EU regulations. Binance named XVG, DASH, NAV, MOB, and several more, announcing they would no longer be available in Spain, Poland, Italy, and France. However, the exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-privacy-coins-eu-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opted not to delist</a> these tokens by reclassifying its assessment of privacy coins.</p>
<p>Away from the EU, Binance still has problems in Australia. In February, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/regulator-asic-binance-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began investigating</a> the exchange over the wrongful closure of some accounts. In April, the exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/asic-binance-crypto-license/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asked</a> the Australian ASIC to revoke its derivatives license granted through a local subsidiary. The revocation meant that Binance had to close all existing derivatives positions by April 21. As of yesterday, the ASIC <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-australia-offices-raided/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raided</a> Binance’s office in Australia, according to a Bloomberg report.</p>

<p>The RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has severally admitted that the country is moving towards CBDC adoption amid de-dollarization. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/india-rbi-central-banks-digital-rupee/">Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in Talks with Other Central Banks to Promote Digital Rupee for Cross-border Payments</a></p>
<p>With 19 of the G20 nations in the advanced stage of Central Bank Digital Currency (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/amp/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CBDC</a>) development, the most populous country in the world, the Republic of India, has been working towards the same goal. According to a recent <a href="https://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/finance/rbi-in-talks-with-leading-global-peers-to-promote-digital-rupee-payments/articleshow/101288604.cms" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> by the Economic Times, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is currently in discussions with more than 18 global central banks on how to use the digital rupee in cross-border payments. The South Asian country has seen its economy significantly grow in the past few years fueled by modern technology adoption.</p>
<h2>Indian Market and Digital Rupee</h2>
<p>The report noted that RBI Governor, Shaktikanta Das, has severally pointed out the importance of foreign trade infrastructure for the digital rupee. India already hosts billions of cross-border payments from its citizens working abroad. However, it is worth noting that most of the need for third parties in cross-border payments has significantly been reduced since the onset of Bitcoin and other crypto assets. Moreover, the RBI forecasts the digital rupee will hit 1 million users soon.</p>
<p>“But cross-border payments will also become much quicker, more seamless, and very cost-effective. That is another area where a lot of attention needs to be given. We are constantly in dialogue with other central banks that have introduced or are introducing CBDCs,” Shaktikanta noted during a speech in London recently.</p>
<p>With the supply of the United States dollar becoming a hustle to traders seeking to import goods in most countries, Shaktikanta highlighted that a digital rupee will help streamline the supply chain. Moreover, more countries will have digital rupee in their Vostro accounts to facilitate seamless cross-border payments with less friction.</p>
<p>“In India, we have no shortage of dollars, but in some other markets, due to a shortage of dollars, they are unable to do imports,” Shaktikanta added.</p>
<h2>Bigger Picture</h2>
<p>India has already joined forces with other countries including Russia, China, Brazil, and South Africa in breaking away from the United States dollar dependence as the global reserve currency. Undeniably, the United States regulators are already feeling the heat of more countries ditching the dollar as the reserve currency. Moreover, inflation has been rising despite the Fed&#8217;s rising interest rates in the past 10 months.</p>
<p>Undeniably, the RBI intends to counter the rising use of Bitcoin among other crypto assets as a means of fast payments.</p>
<p>However, the Indian government has severely tried to ban the use of crypto assets to no avail in the past few years. In response, the Indian government has imposed a harsh crypto tax for crypto uses in a bid to discourage their use.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-academy-coursera-blockchain/">Binance Academy Partners with Coursera to Promote Blockchain Technology</a></p>
<p>Binance Academy, the educational arm of top cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a>, has collaborated with the popular online learning platform Coursera. According to the official announcement, the partnership will help in its bid to foster the global adoption of blockchain technology.</p>
<p>By leveraging Coursera&#8217;s wide audience, which sits at over 124 million learners worldwide, Binance Academy can bring more than simple awareness of blockchain technology.</p>
<p>With the new partnership, Binance hopes to draw up a comprehensive suite of learning programs that it can launch over the next few months.</p>
<h2>Binance Academy Eyes Global Recognition for the Blockchain Industry</h2>
<p>According to the firm, the programs it intends to float will focus on blockchain, Web3, and crypto technologies. There will be courses for beginners with zero knowledge of these fields who are looking to just gain a basic understanding.</p>
<p>Binance will also develop certification courses for those that may want to explore career opportunities within the blockchain industry.</p>
<p>The programs will consist of several courses and would also come with video lectures, readings, practice assignments, and graded tasks.</p>
<p>In a statement about the recent partnership, Yi He, Binance co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer said the firm is focused on making blockchain technology accessible to everyone, adding that Coursera provides the platform to achieve exactly that. Part of the statement reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We&#8217;re combining the strengths of two industry leaders with a shared vision &#8211; to provide best-in-class education that will drive adoption and build the foundations for Web3.”</p></blockquote>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, the partnership with Coursera is only one of several educational initiatives that Binance Academy has embarked upon. It currently has other initiatives such as multimedia content, <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/learn-and-earn/2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Learn &amp; Earn campaigns</a>, and the University Outreach Program among others.</p>
<p>The firm has always worked with the belief that education is the cornerstone of progress and innovation. So, with the Coursera partnership, the firm appears set to be a front-runner as far as blockchain adoption is concerned. But more importantly, the partnership will also help it create a global system that will bring millions of people into the digital economy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-slashes-price-japan/">Tesla Slashes Price of Model 3 and Y Electric Vehicles in Japan</a></p>
<p>American multinational Electric Vehicle (EV) giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla Inc</a> (NASDAQ: TSLA) has recently announced a price reduction for its Model 3 and Model Y cars in Japan. The company implemented a low single-digit percentage price cut, effective from the beginning of this month.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-cuts-prices-japan-model-100649805.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a>, Tesla reduced the prices of all variants of its lower-priced Model 3 by approximately 3%, as reflected on its official website. Additionally, the costs of all Model Y variants were reduced by around 4%.</p>
<p>The Tesla&#8217;s move has highlighted that the recent price reduction of the Model 3 in Japan has made it more affordable than ever before, especially when considering various subsidies that can be applied to the purchase. This move is in line with Tesla&#8217;s ongoing efforts to make EVs more accessible to a broader customer base.</p>
<p>Notably, the price cuts come approximately two months after Tesla had previously increased the prices of Model 3 and Model Y prices  Asian nation. With this adjustment, the Model 3 now has a price tag of 5,245,600 Yen ($36,362), while the Model Y is priced at 5,637,000 Yen.</p>
<p>In addition to the price reductions for the Model 3 and Model Y in Japan, it is worth noting that Tesla has maintained the prices of its higher-end electric vehicles, the Model S and Model X. These premium models have retained their existing price points, as Tesla continues to accept orders for them in the Japanese market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a> emphasized during <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-q1-2023-deliveries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla&#8217;s Q1 2023</a> earnings call, that the firm is focused on increasing sales volumes rather than increasing margins. This strategy suggests Tesla&#8217;s commitment to expanding its market presence and capturing a larger share of the electric vehicle market.</p>
<h2>Is Tesla Inc’s Price Cut Influenced by Heightened Competition?</h2>
<p>Tesla Inc&#8217;s unwavering commitment to innovation, technological advancement, global expansion, and customer satisfaction has positioned it as a formidable player in the electric vehicle market. According to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-auto-production-shanghai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>, Tesla automobiles accounted for over a quarter of total auto production in Shanghai last year.</p>
<p>However, as more traditional automakers and new entrants embrace electrification, the market has become more crowded, prompting Tesla to navigate this landscape strategically. One approach Tesla has considered to maintain its competitive edge is by implementing price reductions.</p>
<p>Notably, heightened competition puts pressure on Tesla to evaluate its pricing strategy. Lowering prices can help Tesla stay ahead of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/byd-tesla-denza-n7-electric-suv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rivals</a> by making its electric vehicles more attractive to consumers.</p>
<p>By reducing prices, Tesla aims to offer a compelling value proposition compared to other electric vehicle options in terms of features, performance, range, and affordability.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s important to note that Tesla&#8217;s pricing decisions are multifaceted and take into account various factors. Some of these factors vary by region and it includes production efficiency, economies of scale, competition and profitability amongst others.</p>

<p>Clients of the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) can now get payments from their customers in e-CNY, electronic Chinese Yuan. The e-CNY is the digital currency of the Chinese central bank, issued by the People&#8217;s Bank of China. The announcement about this was made on Wednesday, July 5.</p>
<p>The merchant program launched by the bank helps businesses receive payments in digital currency while having automated settlement of e-CNY in their DBS bank deposit accounts.</p>
<p>Based on the information from the Development Bank of Singapore, at least one client has transacted using the platform. With this, when a client pays a business using e-CNY, the fund will automatically appear in the business&#8217;s DBS account.</p>
<p>Ginger Cheng, the Chief Executive Officer of DBS Bank (China), <a href="https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_launches_e_CNY_merchant_collection_solution_for_mainland_businesses_to_receive_CBDC_payments_completes_first_client_transaction" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;We received strong interest from several clients for the solution since its launch, and we are pleased to have completed the first e-CNY collection for a client &#8211; a catering company in Shenzhen. By seamlessly integrating a CBDC collection and settlement method into our clients&#8217; existing payment systems, this will help position their business for a digital future where consumers in China use e-CNY for their daily activities.&#8221;</p>

<h2>DBS Committed to Making Digital Innovations to Facilitate Payments with e-CNY</h2>
<p>DBS is also engaging in other initiatives in the financial technology space. The bank is participating in Project Guardian, a program launched by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to see how asset tokenization and decentralized finance (defi) will work with a bank like DBS. The project will explore the potential benefits and the likely challenges banks may face when incorporating these new technologies.</p>
<p>Project Guardian includes institutions like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/jpmorgan-chase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JP Morgan</a>, Japan&#8217;s SBI Digital, Marketnode, and Temasek. It uses technologies like Aave, Uniswap, and Polygon as part of the infrastructure for testing the DeFi and asset tokenization programs.</p>
<p>In the first phase of Project Guardian testing, transactions were carried out with tokenized versions of the Singapore dollar (SGD), Japanese Yen (JPY), Singapore government securities, and Japanese government bonds.</p>
<p>The bank is also involved in projects surrounding the creation of infrastructure for issuing programmable digital Singapore dollars. The project seeks to determine how to create a digital version of the Singapore dollar that can carry out specific functions based on how it is programmed. This is no doubt related to the goal of creating a more efficient financial service.</p>
<p>Apart from the projects that have been described, DBS has been involved in several other projects. In 2021, it co-founded Partior, a solution for carrying out payments across borders and also easing the global movement of value for banks. It was also a part of Project Orchid, which aimed at creating a structure for issuing programmable digital Singapore dollars.</p>
<p>These developments show that the Development Bank of Singapore is committed to exploring digital innovations to make payments safer and more efficient. These are solid moves toward transforming the future of money.</p>
