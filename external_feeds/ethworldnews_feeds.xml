<p>United States-based Gemini Trust Co. has picked Ireland for its European headquarters. The Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange has announced that it will oversee its European operations out of Dublin. The news comes amid an industry-wide push among American crypto exchanges to increase their global footprint in light of intensifying regulatory crackdown in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Gemini Encouraged By Dublin’s Thriving Start-up Culture</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/crypto-exchange-gemini-picks-ireland-for-europe-headquarters" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Gemini cited Dublin’s thriving start-up culture as one of the reasons for picking it as its European base of operations. The Irish capital’s pool of talent was another factor that prompted the Winklevoss-owned exchange to establish its European headquarters there. The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations approved by the European Union last month are a big motivating factor behind several crypto entities in the U.S. considering a shift across the Atlantic. </p>



<p>Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar took to Twitter earlier today to congratulate <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/philippines-gemini-derivatives-exchange/">Gemini</a> on its latest decision and welcome the crypto exchange to Ireland. PM Varadkar added that the exchange’s decision to set up its headquarters in Dublin was a significant indicator of the government’s dedication to innovation. In July last year, the crypto exchange became the first company to be registered as a virtual asset service provider by the Central Bank of Ireland. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Gemini&#8217;s decision to locate in Ireland highlights our competitive offering for the international financial services sector. I wish Gemini every success as they build their team in Ireland.” </p><cite>Leo Varadkar, Prime Minister of Ireland</cite></blockquote>



<p>Gemini’s decision to set up its European headquarters in Dublin comes less than a month after it launched an offshore crypto derivatives trading platform as part of a global push. Paris has emerged as the more popular destination for crypto entities looking to establish their European headquarters. Crypto exchanges, including Binance, OKX, and Crypto.com, have based their European operations in Paris, France.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>A consortium of investors called Fahrenheit, led by Arrington Capital, has won the bid to acquire Celsius’ assets.&nbsp;</li><li>The consortium, which includes Coinbase, beat NovaWulf LLC and another group of investors, that included Gemini.&nbsp;</li><li>Celsius’ restructuring will begin right away with over $400 million allocated for its development.&nbsp;</li><li>Fahrenheit’s winning bid means that NovaWulf is owed up to $20 million in break-up fees.</li></ul>



<p>Celsius Network’s months-long bankruptcy auction has finally come to an end, with Arrington Capital-led Fahrenheit emerging as the top bidder for the bankrupt crypto lender’s assets. The new owners of Celsius’ assets include <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-sings-licensing-deal-bitpanda/">Coinbase</a>, US Bitcoin Corp, Algorand’s former CEO Steven Kokinos, and investment banker Ravi Kaza. This consortium of investors also had the support of senior executives at Wall Street giant Fortress Investment Group. </p>



<h2><strong>Celsius’ New Owners Plan To Scale Up Mining Operations</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230525005382/en/Celsius-Announces-Fahrenheit-LLC-as-Winning-Bidder-to-Manage-New-Entity-to-Be-Owned-by-Celsius-Creditors" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from the Celsius Network, the bankrupt crypto lender’s new owners will provide the required capital and technical resources to successfully establish the new company, in line with the firm’s Chapter 11 plan. The plan also provides for Celsius’ liquid crypto assets to its account holders, along with settlements with the custody and withhold groups. A new company will be created to manage the crypto lender’s illiquid assets, including its institutional loan portfolio, mining business, and alternative investments. </p>



<p>The bankrupt crypto lender’s account holders will have 100% of the new equity in the new company. This firm will be overseen by a board of directors that will be appointed by the creditors. The new owners will allocate up to $500 million in liquid cryptocurrency for the new company. Fahrenheit LLC’s US Bitcoin Corp will build and energize crypto mining facilities with a 100-megawatt capacity in order to scale up Celsius’ bitcoin mining operations immediately.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“We are very pleased that our competitive auction process produced a positive result for customers, including, most prominently, hundreds of millions of dollars in lower management fee savings and increased liquid cryptocurrency distributions to Celsius’ customers.” </p><cite>David Barse and Alan Carr, members of the Special Committee of the Board.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Fahrenheit LLC beat other investor groups, including NovaWulf Digital Management, which was backed by Apollo Global Management, and the Blockchain Recovery Investment Committee, which was backed by the Winklevoss-owned Gemini Trust. NovaWulf’s defeat entitles it to up to $20 million in break-up fees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Binance suspended deposits for 10 bridged crypto coins pending an update from the Multichain team.</li><li>The Binance deposits for these coins are only affected on four blockchains &#8211; Avalanche, BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Fantom networks.</li><li>The temporary deposit suspension on Binance follows growing concerns about the Multichain protocol and unverified rumors about the teams&#8217; arrest in China</li></ul>



<p>Major crypto exchange Binance <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1661649462387957760?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1661649462387957760?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">suspended</a> deposits for 10 bridged crypto coins pending an update from the Multichain team.</p>



<p>The bridged tokens include pairs like AVA-ETH, ALPACA-FTM, FTM-ETH, and ACH-BSC to name a few. These 10 affected crypto coin deposits are spread across four different blockchain networks &#8211; Avalanche, BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Fantom. </p>



<p>The temporary halt on deposits will remain until <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-reuters-commingling-user-funds/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-reuters-commingling-user-funds/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> receives &#8220;clarity from the Multichain team&#8221;, an update from the crypto exchange said on Thursday. Binance clarified that users will be able to deposit these assets on other networks and the exchange.</p>



<h2>Multichain&#8217;s &#8220;force majeure&#8221;</h2>



<p>Today&#8217;s update is the latest development in an ongoing saga with Multichain. The protocol which allows users to move assets across multiple chains by acting as a bridge, suffered technical issues according to the team. </p>



<p>Several transactions are now jammed on the protocol on bridges linked to chains like Polygon zkEVM and zkSync. The team later claimed “force majeure&#8221; as the problem amid rising concerns about Multichain&#8217;s <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/multichain" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://defillama.com/protocol/multichain" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$1.5 billion TVL</a> protocol.</p>



<p>These concerns turned up a notch following radio silence from the protocol after its last vague update to the community. Also, there are rumors that the core Multichain team was arrested in China. The protocol has neither denied nor responded to the claims at press time. </p>



<p>Fears surrounding the protocol have seemingly led players like the Fantom Foundation, crypto investment company Haskkey, and Justin Sun to pull out almost $3 million combined from Multichain. </p>



<h2>Binance Enters NFT Lending Market With Ether Loans</h2>



<p>In other Binance news, the crypto exchange will allow users of its NFT marketplace to borrow crypto tokens against NFT collateral. </p>



<p>The new feature comes with no fees and a 7.91% p/a interest rate.  Users will be able to <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/nft/loan" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.binance.com/en/nft/loan" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">offer</a> up their blue-chip NFTs from collections like Bored Apes and Azuki as collateral for ETH loans. </p>

<ul><li>Coinbase has signed a licensing deal with Bitpanda to cater to European banks serving crypto clients.&nbsp;</li><li>The partnership will see the American exchange provide liquidity and custody services to Bitpanda.&nbsp;</li><li>The latest deal is part of Coinbase’s efforts to increase its presence abroad amid intensifying crackdown in the U.S.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>American crypto giant <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-l2-base-mainnet-launch-no-token/">Coinbase</a> has signed a licensing deal with Vienna-based Bitpanda, amid its push to increase its global presence. The deal will see the Austrian crypto exchange connect its American counterpart with European financial institutions that are looking to offer crypto products to their clients. </p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase Seeks To Increase Global Footprint Amid U.S. Crypto Crackdown</strong></h2>



<p>According to a recent report by<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/05/24/bitpanda-partners-with-coinbase-to-help-europes-banks-offer-customers-crypto/" rel="nofollow noopener"> CoinDesk</a>, the new partnership will see Coinbase use Bitpanda’s B2B infrastructure layer provider to cater to European banks and fintech firms. The American exchange will provide liquidity and custody to Bitpanda, which already has relationships with several banks, neo-banks and fintech platforms, including Raiffeisenlandesbank, European mobile </p>



<p>Speaking on the deal with Coinbase, Bitpanda’s COO Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad said that the American exchange will be able to leverage Bitpanda’s services to use an infrastructure middle layer and increase its customer base in Europe. During the announcement, both exchanges highlighted that they are regulated entities that conform to the highest know your customer (KYC) norms.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>They understand how much business they are missing out on, and also how much more of their customer base would do that business, if they had enough trust in the process.” </p><cite>Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, COO at Bitpanda </cite></blockquote>



<p>Coinbase’s European push comes shortly after the European parliament voted to approve the highly anticipated Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework for its crypto industry. Apart from the easing regulations in the European market, the crypto exchange&#8217;s latest move is also prompted by the intensifying crackdown on crypto entities in the United States.</p>

<ul><li>Coinbase’s layer 2 network Base recently published its mainnet launch criteria.&nbsp;</li><li>Base’s mainnet will go live after Optimism’s Bedrock upgrade, full audits, and demonstration of testnet stability.&nbsp;</li><li>Since testnet, the network has attracted several builders from gaming, NFTs, and DeFi verticals.&nbsp;</li><li>The L2 network confirmed that there are no plans to issue a network token for now.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Coinbase’s layer 2 network Base is gearing up for its widely anticipated mainnet launch. The Base team published a roadmap titled “Path to Mainnet” earlier today that provided an insight into the network’s progress and upcoming milestones in the run-up to its mainnet launch. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-lobbying-dc-nationwide-campaign/">Coinbase</a> also listed a series of objectives to be fulfilled before its L2 solution’s mainnet goes live later this year. </p>



<h2><strong>Base Doesn’t Plan To Issue A Network Token</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://base.mirror.xyz/gxOzGCE-9C7cNZBCo4Ubkkxr87L8BcHDfn5HViSdYGg" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> by Base, safety and security are the top priorities for the network as it gears up for its mainnet debut. The key milestones to the way to mainnet include the demonstration of testnet stability, Optimism’s successful upgrade of Bedrock, and the completion of reviews and audits. The completed milestones include the completion of the Regolith hardfork in testnet and the infrastructure review with Optimism’s team ahead of the Bedrock upgrade. </p>



<p>The objective remains to increase economic freedom and opportunity around the world by onboarding the next million developers and billion users into the crypto economy. Contradictory to the speculation in the crypto community online, Base stated that there are no plans to issue a network token.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Following Mainnet Genesis begins our Genesis Window — a focused, coordinated window for developers to deploy dapps on Base mainnet. During this window, we will be exclusively focusing on developers and providing support to ensure they are successful.” </p><cite>Base team</cite></blockquote>



<p>Base revealed that it had attracted tremendous interest from the developer community and projects from several spaces. including Gaming, NFTs, Infrastructure, Developer Tooling, Wallets, Security, DeFi, Oracles, Analytics, Bridging, Payments, DAOs, and Social. Among the most exciting builders on Base are Blackbird, Parallel, Thirdweb, and OAK. The team behind the L2 network also launched a “Path to Base Mainnet NFT” that users can mint to commemorate this milestone.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Shaquille O’Neal has been served in Miami by a law firm representing FTX creditors.&nbsp;</li><li>The NBA legend was served for a second time while he was attending a basketball game.&nbsp;</li><li>Shaq was previously served by the same lawsuit, but he disputed the manner in which he was served.&nbsp;</li><li>O’Neal has been accused of evading multiple attempts by process servers to serve the summons.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal has been served in the class action lawsuit against <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celebrities-promoted-ftx-victims-cant-sue/">FTX</a> founder Sam Bankman-Fried, again. The law firm representing thousands of customers that were defrauded by the Bahamas-based bankrupt crypto exchange, recently revealed that it had managed to serve the basketball Hall of Famer for a second in Miami. </p>



<h2><strong>Shaq Was Served At Stadium Formerly Known As FTX Arena</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by T<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/shaq-served-again-in-ftx-lawsuitat-former-ftx-arena-a2ccbfd8" rel="noopener">he Wall Street Journal</a>, Shaquille O’Neal was served earlier this week during Game 4 of the NBA’s Eastern Conference Finals held at Kaseya Center in Miami, which was formerly known as FTX Arena. O’Neal was commentating on the match between the Miami Heat and Boston Celtics when he was served by the process servers of the Moskowitz Law Firm that represents thousands of the bankrupt crypto exchange’s stranded customers. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>It seems absurd to have to go to such great lengths to serve Mr. O’Neal. I hope we can just get to the merits of the case.” </p><cite>Adam Moskowitz, The Moskowitz Law Firm</cite></blockquote>



<p>According to the Moskowitz Law Firm’s Adam Moskowitz, the process servers were instructed to serve O’Neal again for the FTX lawsuit, to ensure that any allegations of improper serving do not hold up the court proceedings in the future. Last month the process servers tossed the legal documents into Shaq’s moving car in Atlanta, Georgia. However, his lawyers attempted to get the lawsuit dismissed on the grounds that the process servers served him improperly by throwing the summons into his vehicle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The judge overseeing the case against FTX and its disgraced founder denied Shaq’s motion to have the case dismissed. Shaq previously defended himself by claiming that he never believed in crypto. “A lot of people think I’m involved, but I was just a paid spokesperson for a commercial,” the NBA star stated at the time.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>A High Court in Montenegro repealed bail terms for TerraUSD creator Do Kwon and his colleague Han Chang-Joon.</li><li>Do Kwon and his former CFO Han were each granted €400,000 ($437,000) bail in a travel paper forgery case.</li><li>Local prosecutors appealed the decision, arguing that Kwon and his CFO were flight risks.</li><li>The decision will now return to the Basic Court which initially granted bail a day after Kwon&#8217;s lawyers filed the request.</li><li>Authorities in Montenegro, South Korea, and the U.S. continue to debate extradition rights.</li></ul>



<p>Do Kwon and his former CFO Han Chang-Joon will not be granted bail after a Montenegrin High Court overruled a previous approval for their release, per <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-24/crypto-mogul-do-kwon-s-bail-is-revoked-in-montenegro?sref=3REHEaVI#xj4y7vzkg&amp;in_source=embedded-checkout-banner&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-24/crypto-mogul-do-kwon-s-bail-is-revoked-in-montenegro?sref=3REHEaVI#xj4y7vzkg&amp;in_source=embedded-checkout-banner&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>.</p>



<p>A Basic Court ruled to release Kwon and Han on May 12 on the condition that both defendants pay €400,000 ($437,000)  in bail. The terms of the release included home arrest pending further court proceedings. </p>



<p>Local prosecutor Haris Šabotić and the State Prosecutor’s Office in the capital Podgorica <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-bail-appealed-montenegro/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-bail-appealed-montenegro/" rel="noreferrer noopener">appealed</a> the decision all the way, arguing that the amount was not enough to guarantee their presence in the country.  Šabotić stressed that the pair were a flight risk.</p>



<p>Kwon&#8217;s attorneys said that the defendants&#8217; spouses would post bail on behalf of the pair and Kwon himself boasted &#8220;average finances&#8221; when asked by the court. Notably, reports said that the Terraform Labs founder withdrew $100 million to a Swiss bank account last year. South Korean authorities also froze over $170 million in assets belonging to the former Terraform CEO. </p>



<h2>What&#8217;s Next For Do Kwon and His CFO? </h2>



<p>According to reports, the decision will return to the Basic Court which initially <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/terrausd-do-kwon-granted-bail-montenegro/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/terrausd-do-kwon-granted-bail-montenegro/" rel="noreferrer noopener">granted</a> Kwon his bail. It&#8217;s currently unclear how this misalignment between both courts will play out for the former Terra execs. Both Kwon and Han will remain in detention pending a decision from the Montenegrin judiciary. </p>



<p>In the background, authorities from South Korea and the U.S. remain undecided as to who should extradite Do Kwon and charge him for fraud among other claims in the more than $40 billion collapse of Terraform Labs. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>A proposal to launch Uniswap&#8217;s third generation DEX or V3 on Fantom&#8217;s blockchain is currently undergoing a &#8220;temperature check&#8221; governance vote.</li><li>The proposal highlighted a market opportunity that could pull in $30-40 million in weekly trading volume while onboarding a scalable network with low transaction fees for users</li><li>Fantom seems next in line of EVM chains eyed by the leading decentralized exchange after expanding to BNB Chain, DeFi&#8217;s second-largest ecosystem by TVL.</li></ul>



<p>The Uniswap DAO is currently considering <a href="https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-uniswap-v3-deployment-to-fantom/21290" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-uniswap-v3-deployment-to-fantom/21290" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">launching</a> the third iteration of its decentralized exchange protocol on Fantom, a layer 1 blockchain with a proof of stake (PoS) consensus model and Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatibility (EVM).</p>



<p>Uniswap&#8217;s Business Source License (BSL) expired on April 1 and will allow other entities to leverage the V3 design. This opportunity could lead to &#8220;potentially unsafe forks&#8221; of the startup&#8217;s DEX model, the proposal from Blockchain@Columbia in conjunction with Fantom and Axelar noted. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>With the expiry of the Uniswap v3 BSL, other DEXs including Beethoven X, are eyeing the opportunity to seize market share on the Fantom chain. In order to stay ahead of the competition, Uniswap must establish its presence on Fantom quickly and efficiently.</p></blockquote>



<p>Fantom&#8217;s low fees and developer-friendly architecture also offer Uniswap users wider access to larger liquidity pools and a basket of DeFi markets. Fantom users will also be able to access DeFi&#8217;s leading blue-chip trading venue and one of crypto&#8217;s most popular protocols. </p>



<p>Axelar, a cross-chain bridge platform that connects multiple blockchain networks, will act as the bridge infrastructure provider. </p>



<h2>Uniswap Expansion Frenzy</h2>



<p>Several proposals to expand Uniswap beyond Ethereum&#8217;s network have emerged in 2023, possibly propelled by the BSL expiry and a strategy to claim greater market share as the leading DEX. A 0XPlasma Labs plan to launch V3 on BNB Chain &#8211; another EVM-compatible network &#8211; was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/uniswap-community-greenlights-bnb-chain/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/uniswap-community-greenlights-bnb-chain/" rel="noreferrer noopener">approved</a> in January. Wormhole was chosen as the bridge provider. </p>



<p>Another proposal to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/uniswap-launch-v3-polygon-zkevm/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/uniswap-launch-v3-polygon-zkevm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch V3 on Polygon&#8217;s zero knowledge EVM (zkEVM)</a> garnered massive support from the governance community. </p>

<p>The world’s largest crypto exchange has taken issue with a recent report put out by legacy media house Reuters. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-australia-suspend-aud-withdrawal/">Binance</a> has responded to a report from Reuters earlier today, which alleged that the crypto exchange mismanaged customers’ funds and commingled them with the company’s revenue. </p>



<h2><strong>Binance: Reuters Report Written By A Desperate Journalist</strong></h2>



<p>Citing a former insider at Binance, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/crypto-binance-money/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a> reported earlier today that between 2020 and 2021, the crypto exchange commingled customer funds with company revenue. A person with direct knowledge of the exchange’s finances told Reuters that the commingling occurred on a near-daily basis, with the sum running into billions of dollars. The mixing of funds happened in the accounts that the crypto exchange held at the United States-based Silvergate Bank. </p>



<p>While Reuters wasn’t able to independently verify the figures or the frequency of commingling revealed by the former insiders, it did review a bank record from February 2021, which showed that Binance mixed $20 million from a corporate account with $15 million from an account that received customer funds. Reuters accused the crypto exchange of breaching U.S. banking laws by commingling funds and failing to control internal controls to ensure customer funds were clearly identifiable and segregated from company revenues. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>Patrick Hillmann, the Chief Communications Officer at Binance, responded to Reuters’ controversial article on <a href="https://twitter.com/PRHillmann/status/1660987014626287617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1660987014626287617%7Ctwgr%5Ece7a86ae7c600962020db0968aeea215ef8df4a2%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fbinance-customer-fund-mismanagement-denial-against-mainstream-reports" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>. Hillmann brushed aside the report as the work of a “desperate journalist” trying to publish a negative story against the crypto exchange. He indicated that Reuters had framed the allegations in such a way that they would be protected from a libel suit. He further accused the media firm of peddling conspiracy theories without backing them up with evidence. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We’ve been very public about where the company had regulatory shortcomings in the past, there’s no reason for a respected news outlet like @Reuters to continue making stuff up.” </p><cite>Patrick Hillmann, Chief Communications Officer, Binance </cite></blockquote>



<p>According to Hillmann, the report by Reuters was based on the fact that when users purchased BUSD (Paxos) from Binance, they were taken to a transaction page that had the term “deposit” on it. He clarified that users were purchasing a stablecoin that was redeemable by Paxos, which was explicitly stated on the website.</p>

<ul><li>FTX CEO John Ray III has been reviewing plans to reboot the bankrupt crypto exchange.&nbsp;</li><li>Ray spent several hours last month finalizing the material related to the exchange’s reboot for distribution to investors.&nbsp;</li><li>A recent court filing revealed that there is a bidder list that likely contains investors interested in FTX 2.0.</li><li>The bankrupt exchange’s native token FTT surged by over 16% following the latest developments.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried’s defunct crypto exchange is likely going to be restarted by its new management under the leadership of current CEO John Ray III. A recent court filing of a monthly staffing report and compensation for Ray for the month of April 2023 revealed that the Chief Executive has been working on a reboot plan called FTX 2.0 to make the bankrupt exchange operational again.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>FTX CEO Billed $290k For His Services In April 2023</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://t.co/rcSIuyM2YX" rel="nofollow">filing</a> made earlier today with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, John Ray III charged FTX’s bankruptcy estate more than $290,000 for his services. While the majority of his services pertained to day-to-day administrative and legal work, a few activities mentioned in the filing revealed that the CEO had been working on the FTX 2.0 reboot plan. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">FTX CEO John Ray III confirms FTX 2.0 plans. <a href="https://t.co/FeCXOvdrt0" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/FeCXOvdrt0</a></p>&mdash; FTX 2.0 Coalition (@AFTXcreditor) <a href="https://twitter.com/AFTXcreditor/status/1660753728792584195?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">May 22, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>These activities included consulting cybersecurity firm Sygnia to fortify the international crypto platform, reviewing a term sheet for the plan restructuring exchange, exploring the next steps for restarting the crypto exchange, as well as reviewing and finalizing the FTX 2.0 material for distribution to investors. Ray also reviewed a summary of steps sent by investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners LP regarding the 2.0 reboot plan. The CEO remained in constant communication with the investment bank to discuss the reboot plan. throughout the past weekend. </p>



<p>The court filing further revealed that John Ray III had reviewed a list of bidders for FTX 2.0. As previously reported, venture capital firm Tribe Capital <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftt-22-tribe-capital-interest-ftx-reboot/">expressed</a> interest in restarting the bankrupt crypto exchange. The latest development led to a 16% jump in the native token <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ftx-token/" rel="nofollow noopener">FTT</a> price, which reached as high as $1.16 before dropping to its current trading price of $1.08. </p>



<p>Plans regarding a potential restart of the crypto exchange were shared by Sullivan &amp; Cromwell in the bankruptcy court last month. At the time, the law firm stated that customer funds would be employed to bring the reboot plan to fruition. Last week, a court filing shared by a creditor on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/AFTXcreditor/status/1659748127304286208" rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> that exchange was hiring new developers to work on the 2.0 project. </p>
