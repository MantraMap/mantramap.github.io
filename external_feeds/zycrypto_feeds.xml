<p>As some countries like the United States continue to restrict innovative technologies like Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, other Latin American countries, such as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/tag/el-salvador/">El Salvador</a>, are working to boost the growth of their tech industries.</p>



<p>On May 4th, Nayib Bukele, President of El Salvador, announced the enactment of a law that eliminates taxes on innovative technologies, including software creation, coding, artificial intelligence, and other fields.</p>



<p>The law<a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1654121271548866560"> signed</a> by Bukele will exempt fiscal taxes on these technologies for at least 15 years. Additionally, it includes the elimination of capital gains tax, paid when obtaining profits from the sale of an asset.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’ve just signed into law, the INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANUFACTURING INCENTIVES ACT, that eliminates all taxes (income, property, capital gains and import tariffs) on technology innovations, software and app programming, AI, computer and communications hardware manufacturing. <a href="https://t.co/rZtGzPgVzW">pic.twitter.com/rZtGzPgVzW</a></p>&mdash; Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) <a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1654121271548866560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 4, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>El Salvador wants to become a technological leader in Latin America</strong></h2>



<p>The bill was approved on April 19th by the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador with 69 votes in favor and none against during the 103rd plenary session of the legislative body.</p>



<p>Congresswoman Elisa Rosales stated during the plenary session that the new Legislative Assembly and the Executive Branch are working to position the country as a leader in Latin America on technological manufacturing.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;There are five incentives being granted for 15 years, and we are not establishing a minimum investment amount because we want to encourage all those StartUps. We have a different vision; we are positioning our country with a different face internationally,&#8221; </em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-el-salvador-bets-on-emerging-technologies-to-improve-its-economy"><strong>El Salvador bets on emerging technologies to improve its economy</strong></h2>



<p>Congressman Estuardo Rodríguez pointed out that the Law for the Promotion of Innovation and Technological Manufacturing will “contribute significantly to the country&#8217;s economic development,&#8221; creating more jobs for young people.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the new law will create opportunities for the development of artificial intelligence, a cutting-edge technology used daily by millions of users and companies to improve their efficiency and productivity.</p>



<p>Thanks to Nayib Bukele&#8217;s technological proposals, such as enacting the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-officially-becomes-legal-tender-in-el-salvador-country-secures-first-400-btc-purchase/">Bitcoin Law</a>, which establishes the use of Bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador, the country has become one of the most attractive nations for cryptocurrency companies.</p>



<p>As recently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitfinex-awarded-first-ever-digital-asset-service-provider-license-in-el-salvador/">reported</a> by ZyCrypto, Bitfinex became the first cryptocurrency exchange to expand to El Salvador after acquiring a digital asset license allowing it to operate in a regulated manner in the country. Will other major exchanges follow?</p>

<p>U.S. regulators, not least of all the Securities and Exchange Commission, have taken an aggressive tack lately with the crypto industry. Amid the regulatory headwinds, Coinbase’s and Ripple’s top legal experts met to discuss pressing matters in the fast-growing crypto space.</p>



<p>The news of the meeting has prompted speculation about the U.S.’s largest and best-known exchange relisting Ripple’s cryptocurrency XRP.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-and-coinbase-legal-officers-hang-out"><strong>Ripple And Coinbase Legal Officers Hang Out</strong></h2>



<p>The top lawyers from Ripple and Coinbase convened for a recent offsite meeting to discuss pressing concerns in the vibrant crypto landscape.</p>



<p>Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, took to Twitter earlier today to express his appreciation to Ripple’s Stuart Alderoty for being invited to the meeting and suggested more meetings in the future. Alderoty then tweeted his gratitude to Grewal for taking the time to connect with the Ripple legal team.</p>



<p>Details of the meeting were sparse, but both Ripple and Coinbase are currently at an impasse with the U.S. SEC. Ripple Labs was sued back in December 2020 for allegedly selling unregistered securities in the form of XRP.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Coinbase — which has become the second-largest crypto exchange, trailing only Binance — was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-action-against-coinbase-triggers-ballistic-reaction-from-crypto-community/">slapped </a>with a Wells Notice by the SEC in March over potential violations of U.S. securities law. In a document last week, the San Francisco-headquartered platform pushed back against the SEC’s enforcement notice.</p>



<p>These two U.S.-based companies have often called for formal rulemaking within the crypto assets sector, which the watchdog agency has ignored and chosen regulation by enforcement instead. In recent months, the SEC has taken action against notable industry players, including digital asset exchanges Bittrex, Kraken, Gemini, crypto lender Genesis and individual actors such as Tron founder Justin Sun. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>But Will Coinbase Relist XRP?</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase has previously <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-sec-case-takes-surprising-turn-as-coinbase-asks-court-for-permission-to-support-ripple/">requested </a>the court for permission to file a friend of the court (&#8220;amicus&#8221;) brief in Ripple’s case with the SEC, arguing that the lawsuit threatens the broader industry. Grewal has also, in recent weeks, hailed the legal defense mounted by Ripple. </p>



<p>Many XRP fans are once again suspecting that Coinbase could soon relist XRP on its platform following the offsite meeting, where the two chief legal officers are seen pictured in a close friendly pose.</p>



<p>Even if Grewal and Stuart’s body language indicates improving cordiality between Coinbase and Ripple, a relisting of XRP soon seems unlikely at this point. As <em>ZyCrypto </em><a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-will-get-relisted-on-coinbase-immediately-after-ripples-victory-over-sec-exchanges-chief-legal-officer-hints/">reported</a>, Grewal pointed out in a recent interview with Tony Edward that a possible timeline for relisting depends on various factors.</p>



<p>At press time, XRP was changing hands at $$0.456461, a gain of 0.9% in the past day, according to CoinGecko.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tensor marketplace has taken a slight lead over rival Magic Eden in the past seven days after dominating 45% of Solana’s market share. </li>



<li>Mad Labs remains key in the recent surge of Tensor, with the marketplace offering rewards to top traders ahead of Magic Eden. </li>



<li>With a week ahead, commentators assess Tensor’s chances in the top spot with new updates coming on their rivals.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Non-fungible tokens (NFT) remain in the driving seat of the Solana (SOL) as the network continues its development amid tight competition with other smart contract blockchains.</p>



<p>This week, a new king of Solana’s NFT was crowned, but how long can the reign last? According to data from Tiexo, Tensor has toppled Magic Eden as the marketplace with the most volume in the past seven days. Tensor now commands 45% of total Solana’s NFT volume, leaving Magic Eden with a  little under 44%.</p>



<p>The uptick in Tensor’s volume can be linked to the launch of Mad Labs, with both platforms offering rewards on it. From the stats, traders prefer bonuses offered by Tensor over Magic Eden after it started its reward program last month.</p>



<p>The NFT market witnessed a burst of energy after Mad Labs was introduced in April. Mad Labs is a Profile Picture Collection on Solana that has generated over $15 million in trading volumes since its launch, becoming the latest Solana buzz after the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-is-losing-its-touch-with-nfts-as-major-projects-announce-departure/">network</a> lost DeGods and yOOTs this year.</p>



<p>Armanti Ferranter, co-developer of Mad Labs, described the void and the importance of the project on Solana.</p>



<p>“<em>There was this void, where the heart and soul of the NFT space needed to kind of have a new heartbeat, basically,” </em>he explained.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-little-drops-make-an-ocean">Little drops make an ocean</h2>



<p>Launched in 2022, Tensor has grown gradually in terms of trade volume and constantly dubs itself the home of “<em>pro traders.” </em>Loyalty rewards have been key to the rise of Blur as it moved past OpenSea in February on the Ethereum Network. Learning a couple of tricks from Blur, Tensor jumped in on Mad Labs with a special offer.</p>



<p>Tensor announced that it would divert all trading fees on Mad Labs NFTs for the first three months to purchase floor NFTs from the project, which will be given to top traders via raffle. So far, Tensor has spent $93,640, about 4,280 SOL, to purchase NFTs for top traders.</p>



<p>Tensor’s CTO, Richard Wu, hailed the project’s community-based approach targeted at Mad Labs.</p>



<p>“<em>If you show people that you&#8217;re truly about giving back to the community, and trying to make your product the best for Mad Lads or the next NFT project then people will come and trade on your platform, and people will align with a Tensor versus a Magic Eden,” </em>Wu said.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>MicroStrategy reported a Q1 2023 profit of $94 million attributed to a one-time income tax benefit.</li>



<li>The firm purchased 7,500 BTC in the first quarter bringing its total holdings to 140,000 BTC with no signs of slowing down.</li>



<li>The firm’s Bitcoin stash turned to profit after BTC made a 72% gain in the first quarter, wiping away 2022 losses.</li>
</ul>



<p>Michael Saylor says his Bitcoin (BTC) strategy has outperformed stocks, similar assets, and Bitcoin itself after positive showings this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategy-doubles-down-on-bitcoin-vows-to-keep-accumulating-btc-despite-market-volatility/">MicroStrategy</a> has posted its Q1 2023 report, which shows a profit of $94 million, marking the company’s first-ever quarterly profit in nearly three years. Profits recorded this quarter can be linked to a tax benefit of $453 million and an upward revenue stream of 2.2% from the last quarter ( $121 million).</p>



<p>The firm also announced a net income of $46.2 million, an increase of a loss of $130.8 million in Q1 2022. The company also paid a $161 million BTC-backed loan to Silvergate Bank with the former releasing its 34,619 BTC.</p>



<p>MicroStrategy’s CEO Phong Lee stated that the company’s BTC stance is “<em>stronger than ever”&nbsp; </em>as the year progresses.</p>



<p><em>“The conviction in our Bitcoin strategy remains strong as the digital asset environment continues to mature. We remained disciplined on cost while investing in growth and will continue to execute our dual strategy of growing our intelligence software business and acquiring Bitcoin for the future,” he added.</em></p>



<p>Saylor, the chairman of MicroStrategy, praised the company’s BTC strategy as the backbone of its success in the first quarter. </p>



<p>“<em>So ultimately, it’s not easy what a better strategy might be. And so, we are strong proponents of the Bitcoin strategy. And as you see from this chart, prudently acquiring Bitcoin is a good way to outperform the market.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bullish-on-btc-despite-slight-losses">Bullish on BTC despite slight losses</h2>



<p>According to the firm’s filings at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company acquired 7,500 BTC in Q2 2023 with two huge purchases worth $179 million on March 23 and April 5. The firm&#8217;s BTC stash now stands at 140,000 with no signs of slowing down.</p>



<p>Purchased at an average of 29,803, the company’s BTC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategys-bitcoin-stash-now-in-the-green-as-crypto-assets-soar/">holdings</a> flipped green after BTC surged past the $30,000 mark in April. With the price of BTC below $29,000 at press time, MicroStrategy BTC holdings are at a loss of 5.8%.</p>



<p>Michael Saylor has maintained his bullish stance on BTC through the years and revealed that he had integrated Bitcoin Lightning into his email address while also developing a layer 2 lightning network for corporations. </p>

<ul>
<li>Pro-Ripple attorney John Deaton has dismissed the rumour as unlikely.</li>



<li>The price of the native token XRP is yet to respond to the speculations.</li>
</ul>



<p>A fresh rumour is circulating that Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are arranging an undisclosed meeting on May 8. The claim has caused speculation that the discussion could be about a settlement in the duo&#8217;s long-standing case.</p>



<p>A Twitter account dubbed Blockchain Daily posted about the rumour, citing unconfirmed sources. &#8220;Just in: reportedly Ripple and SEC to hold an undisclosed meeting on May 8th – unconfirmed source.&#8221;</p>



<p>XRP community attorney John Deaton quickly dismissed the rumour as unlikely, saying the commission had no reason to go for a settlement before the summary judgment was out. According to Deaton, such a step could only happen if the presiding judge rules in favour of Ripple.</p>



<p>‘‘This is not how a settlement happens. First, I believe the only time a settlement occurs, in this case, is after a ruling by Judge Torres. That happens if Ripple wins so Gensler can save face and get a political win via settlement. Sorry, it&#8217;s not going to happen,’’ he wrote.</p>



<p>Deaton also argued that due to market manipulation and insider trading regulations, the commission could not set a meeting, leak information about it, and influence the market. Instead, how it could happen, in his view, is that Ripple and the SEC could meet and enter into a settlement before presenting it to the presiding judge.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lawsuit-plagued-with-decision-delays"><strong>Lawsuit plagued with decision delays</strong></h2>



<p>The rumours and speculations come when the crypto community is growing impatient <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-john-deaton-highlights-4-likely-outcomes-in-ripple-vs-sec-suit-as-case-takes-surprising-turn/">concerning the outcome</a> of the long-awaited Ripple and SEC case. Deaton had earlier speculated that considering the previous cases handled by Judge Torres, the Ripple community could welcome the summary judgment by last month.</p>



<p>A month ago, to bolster its fair notice defence against the regulator, Ripple <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-invokes-key-ruling-in-voyager-bankruptcy-case-to-strengthen-its-defense/">filed</a> a Letter of Supplemental Authority, referring to a case involving a takeover bid by Binance.US of Voyager Digital. In the case, the presiding Judge Michael Wiles, among other things, dismissed the commission’s claims that the Voyager token (VGX) amounted to an issue of securities.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the crypto community has seemingly taken the rumour with a pinch of salt per the current price of XRP, which changed hands at $0.46 at press time, a difference of +0.91% in the past day.</p>

<p>Solana, one of the largest “Ethereum Killers”, has surpassed the latter to become the network with the most transactions.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Nansen shared a <a href="https://twitter.com/nansen_ai/status/1653581937620164609">tweet</a> comparing April&#8217;s most active on-chain addresses. According to the firm, Solana came in second after BNB Chain, becoming the network with the most active address by chain at 5.1 million in April.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-4-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80473" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-4-1024x576.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-4-300x169.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-4-768x432.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-4.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>And despite that figure dropping by around 12% from March, the cryptocurrency network still managed to outdo Ethereum, which had 4.9 million active addresses in April.</p>



<p>Solana also surpassed Ethereum by non-vote transactions last month. Non-vote transactions are transactions that do not involve any voting or decision-making by token holders. They typically involve the transfer of cryptocurrency between wallets or accounts and are the most common type of transaction on most blockchain networks due to their simplicity. According to Nansen data, as of April 30, Solana’s total non-vote transactions stood at 24.3 million compared to Ethereum’s 974,972.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="705" height="663" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80474" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-5.png 705w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-5-300x282.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px" /></figure>



<p>Solana’s attractive growth can be attributed to various factors, including a surge in developers and users due to its attractive transaction speeds and costs. Apart from announcing various developments that go into improving the network, including a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sol-jumps-over-8-as-solana-makes-groundbreaking-entry-into-ai-with-chatgpt-plugin/">Chat GPT plugin</a> and a web3 phone, Solana’s ballooning transactions have also been propelled by NFTs.</p>



<p>Recently, Mad Lads, a new project launched on Solana, became the most traded collection generating $17 million compared with $11 million for Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club collection during the last week of April. This is despite the Solana facing a major setback following the exit of y00ts and DeGods,&nbsp;two of its most popular collections, earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Launched roughly a month ago, Mad Lads is a unique type of NFT that falls in a category called xNFTs. Ideally, xNFTs combine the features of traditional NFTs and executable code, meaning users can use them to conduct other activities such as gaming and chatting.</p>



<p>That said, Solana&#8217;s native token SOL has <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-predicts-why-solana-could-bounce-back-even-better/">also performed well</a>, soaring by over 116% since January 1. This is compared to Bitcoin, up 70%, and Ether, up just over 50% year-to-date.</p>



<p>At press time, SOL was trading at $21.47, down 3.36% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. On the other hand, Ether rose by 1.66% in the same period and was exchanging hands at $1,851.</p>

<li>Cardano’s transaction volume surges to new highs not recorded in past months as the wider market also witnesses improved activity.&nbsp;</li>



<li>ADA’s price plunged further after losing its stance going below the $0.4 mark in May, trading at $0.38.</li>



<li>The future of Cardano’s development looks strong as the network rolls our new upgrades in preparation for the much anticipated Voltaire era.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-whales-are-taking-no-days-off-as-ada-transactions-hit-rooftop/">Cardano</a> (ADA) has been debated within crypto circles due to its huge developments lined up this year, coupled with a huge leap in price. </p>



<p>Transaction volumes on Cardano have been up this week together with the total number of active wallets on its network. According to a recent report by Input Output Global, the organization responsible for the network’s growth, Cardano processed 65.4 million transactions in the past seven days.</p>



<p>The network has also recorded a massive inflow of new wallets bringing the total number of wallets to over 4 million as of March 2023. The volatility of ADA this past month has been a significant concern for pundits despite the latest wins in transaction volume.</p>



<p>The current trend can be linked to reports of increased <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-primed-for-massive-boom-as-ada-whales-network-activity-heats-up/">whale activity</a> on the network. The accumulation of coins in whale addresses points to a growth in the confidence of bigger players, which often ignites bull runs.</p>



<p>Cardano’s futures market is also showing bullish signs as increased transactions are recorded on the network. According to a chart from IntoTheBlock, transaction volume fell below 10B ADA in January before growing above 20B ADA.</p>



<p>ADA currently exchanges hands at $0.38 and has surged by a staggering 58% this year, with bulls expecting more gains to clear huge losses in the bear market. Although the year has been good, ADA is still 49% down from May 2022.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-community-can-feel-voltaire">The community can feel Voltaire</h2>



<p>Voltaire, described as the last phase of Cardano’s evolution, primarily aims to create a completely decentralized decision-making platform. Among the developments to flag off Voltaire is the Conway Ledger and CIP-1694.</p>



<p>CIP-1694 improved the governance of the network, making it more decentralized with any user having powers to submit governance actions which will go through three groups: The Constitutional Committee, Delegation of Representatives, and Stake Pool Operators.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the Ledger Team has added new technologies, including Plutus v3, in addition to the Haskell Code and API receiving new updates.</p>

<ul>
<li>Balaji Srinivasan has settled a high-stakes BTC bet he made in March by donating $1.5 million to charity and similar projects.&nbsp;</li>



<li>He bet on what he termed a buzz of “<em>hyperbitcoinization” </em>sweeping the financial markets in the United States.</li>



<li>With the safe haven narratives springing up once more, Srinivasan landed blows on fiat as they “<em>head towards hyperinflation.”&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Balaji Srinivasan took his Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiasm to the next level by making a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/black-swan-author-nassim-taleb-weighs-in-on-balajis-1-million-bitcoin-price-prediction/">controversial bet</a> on the future price of Bitcoin in March. </p>



<p>On May 2, Srinivasan, an investor and former CTO of Coinbase announced that he has settled the bet he entered into by mutual agreement. He will now donate $1.5 million and states that it was done to prove a point because of the bad shape of the economy.</p>



<p>In March, Srinivasan coined the term “<em>hyperbitcoinization” </em>to describe the potential mass adoption that will flock to web3 due to a rapid change in global finance. The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/former-coinbase-cto-makes-massive-bet-that-bitcoin-will-rampage-past-1-million-within-90-days/">bet was made</a> with Twitter web3 pundit James Medlock with the terms that should BTC fail to hit $1 million within 90 days, Srinivasan would pay $1 million in USD Circle.</p>



<p>From the mutual agreement, Srinivasan would donate $500,000 to Give Directly, $500,000 to Medlock, and another $500,000 to BTC core developers. Settling the bet ahead of time he <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1653449321185169409?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">stressed</a> that he did so for the public good while criticizing public finance experts for not being reliable anymore.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“So, I settled the bet ahead of time and donated even more than I had committed. I spent my own money to send a provably costly signal that there’s something wrong with the economy and that it&#8217;s not going to be a ‘soft landing’ like Powell [Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell] promises but something much worse,” </em>he added.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hyperinflation-claims-could-drive-btc-adoption">Hyperinflation claims could drive BTC adoption</h2>



<p>Pundits have tipped Bitcoin as a store of value to counter fiat inflation when things get bad. Srinivasan is among those commentators and has stressed that the American economy will hit hyperinflation, making Bitcoin a safe haven.</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-maximalist-matthew-kratter-asserts-1-million-value-for-btc-counters-balajis-forecast/">He estimates</a> a potential BTC market cap of $19.3 trillion after the period of hyperbitcoinization. Bitcoin currently has a market cap of $548 billion and exchanges for $28,325, which means, according to his projection, BTC will skyrocket by 3,369% to hit $1 million per coin. </p>

<p>While many have called this a long shot, in 2013, BTC was valued at $122, meaning the market leader surged over 23,000% in the last decade.</p>

<p>Business intelligence firm MicroStrategy has vowed to continue purchasing Bitcoin, despite cryptocurrency prices fluctuating wildly of late.</p>



<p>This assertion was made by Phong Le, Chief Executive Officer of MicroStrategy, while announcing the firm’s Q1 financial results Monday. </p>



<p><em>&#8220;As you all know, our strategy is to acquire and hold Bitcoin, and we plan to continue to accumulate Bitcoin over time using our excess cash and with the net proceeds of capital markets transactions,&#8221;</em> said Le during the earnings call noting that Microstrategy&#8217;s core business is not impacted by near-term Bitcoin price fluctuations.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;We remain committed to our Bitcoin acquisition strategy with a high degree of conviction,&#8221;</em> he added.</p>



<p>MicroStrategy has had a long-term focus and a risk-managed approach for its Bitcoin strategy. Since 2020 the firm has continued to purchase Bitcoin, with the most recent foray being for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategy-spends-29-million-buying-more-bitcoin-as-btc-eyes-30000/">1045 Bitcoins</a> earlier last month. Microstrategy currently holds 140,000 Bitcoins with an aggregate cost of $4.2 billion or an average of approximately $29,800 per Bitcoin. This makes MicroStrategy the world&#8217;s largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Le also reassured investors of the firm’s financial health, noting that it had repaid its $205 million Bitcoin-backed loan from Silvergate last year at a 22% discount. In March, MicroStrategy disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it used part of the proceeds from a $339.4 million public sale of its shares to pay back the loan.</p>



<p>According to Le, following the repayment, MicroStrategy recovered 34,619 Bitcoins that were serving as collateral for the loan, which is now unencumbered. As of March 31, 2023, only 11% of MicroStrategy&#8217;s total Bitcoin holdings were pledged as collateral for debt.</p>



<p>MicroStrategy&#8217;s decision to invest heavily in Bitcoin has been controversial, with some investors expressing concerns about the cryptocurrency&#8217;s volatility. However, Michael Saylor, now the company’s Executive Chairman, has remained bullish on Bitcoin, saying it&#8217;s “100% better than gold”. He has also argued that Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation and a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty.</p>



<p>That said, despite MicroStrategy&#8217;s Bitcoin stash remaining in the red for roughly a year, its bold investment has recently paid off handsomely, with the holdings <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategys-bitcoin-stash-now-in-the-green-as-crypto-assets-soar/">increasing in value</a> as the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price surged in recent months. According to ‘Saylor Tracker’ a service that tracks MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin purchases, the firm’s Bitcoin stash value is currently at a loss of $203 million. That said, it remains to be seen whether Bitcoin prices can rise for those holdings to turn green or if the cryptocurrency will continue plunging.</p>



<p>At press time, BTC was trading at $28,762, up 2.08% in the past seven days, as per CoinMarketCap data. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization traded mostly flatly Tuesday, gaining only 0.53% in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>As the crypto world eagerly awaits District Judge Analisa Torres&#8217;s ruling in the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-john-deaton-highlights-4-likely-outcomes-in-ripple-vs-sec-suit-as-case-takes-surprising-turn/">landmark case</a> between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs, pro-XRP attorney John E. Deaton is hinting that the San Francisco-based enterprise blockchain company could agree to new settlement terms. Deaton, however, emphasized that this will depend on the ruling in the lawsuit.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-expert-s-opinion-regarding-a-likely-ripple-sec-settlement"><strong>Expert’s Opinion Regarding A Likely Ripple-SEC Settlement</strong></h2>



<p>John Deaton has taken to Twitter to highlight various scenarios that could influence Ripple’s decision on whether or not to settle.</p>



<p>Deaton’s comments come amid chatter among the community of a secret meeting between Ripple and the SEC. In his opinion, the terms of a potential settlement would depend on the specifics of the outcome of the ongoing litigation.</p>



<p>One important consideration would be whether leading U.S.-based digital assets exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken would immediately restart XRP trading on their platforms or wait for a possible appeal by the SEC. Coinbase delisted XRP in January 2021, immediately after the SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">launched </a>its lawsuit against Ripple. Despite vocal appeals by the XRPArmy, Coinbase has remained unmoved.</p>



<p>Another key consideration would be whether major Ripple partner, Bank of America, would feel comfortable about the court verdict or wait to see if Judge Torres gets overturned in the event the SEC appeals her decision.</p>



<p>Deaton notes that the SEC could possibly file a notice of appeal and later withdraw it, leaving room for more negotiations.</p>



<p>The XRP amicus curiae also pinpointed a theoretical scenario in which the U.S. securities regulator told Ripple it would issue a public statement that all future sales of XRP don’t constitute securities and not appeal Judge Torres’ ruling if the payments firm agrees to pay $50 million. Deaton says, in this case, Ripple boss Bradley Garlinghouse would swiftly sign off on the settlement as this would provide the certainty the company has long clamoured for and return liquidity to the U.S. market.</p>



<p>Still, if Judge Torres rules that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripples-q1-2023-xrp-markets-report-shows-xrps-super-bullish-trajectory-despite-sec-lawsuit/">Ripple</a> did not violate federal securities laws and subsequently revives liquidity to U.S. markets without causing businesses to worry about being in the SEC’s crosshairs if they utilize the XRP cryptocurrency, then Ripple will ultimately decide to refrain from a settlement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After two gruelling years in the Southern District of New York, a ruling in the XRP lawsuit could further define what crypto assets are considered securities in the United States.</p>

<p>Could digital asset firms be facing a de-banking crisis? Potential coordinated efforts to de-bank the digital asset ecosystem are being investigated by CryptoUK, the Blockchain Association (BA), and now three Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee.</p>



<p>On March 21, 2023, CryptoUK wrote letters to the Financial Conduct Authority and the Payment Systems Regulator over concerns about the increasing number of new blanket bans and restrictions on transfers from United Kingdom (U.K.) banks to crypto asset platforms as well as seeking potential solutions. CryptoUK is an independent industry body that works directly with policymakers and market players to identify and promote use cases for digital and crypto assets.</p>



<p>CryptoUK is concerned that other banks and Payment Services Providers would take similar action. CryptoUK said that these actions had the potential to undermine the Government’s ambition to become a crypto asset hub.</p>



<p>On March 16, 2023, the Blockchain Association (BA) submitted a request for information from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve System (Fed), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) over potential de-banking of crypto firms in the United States.</p>



<p>The Blockchain Association is a collective voice of industry players promoting blockchain technology. The BA also requested impacted crypto industry participants to submit any de-banking allegations for further investigation.</p>



<p>On April 14, 2023, the Blockchain Association submitted additional information requests to Investigate the de-banking of Crypto Firms to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).</p>



<p>On April 25, 2023, three Republican members of the United States House of Representatives Financial Services Committee sent letters to the heads of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, seeking information on possible coordinated efforts taken against digital asset firms.</p>



<p>The information requested related to compliance by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on the Interpretive Letter #1179 issued in November 2021 on whether it was permissible for national banks and Federal savings associations to engage in certain crypto-related activities.</p>



<p>The US lawmakers also requested information on the compliance to a January 2023 joint statement on crypto-asset risks to Banking Organizations issued by the Fed, the FDIC, and the OCC that banking organizations need to be aware of.</p>



<p>The debate on the coexistence of digital asset firms and banking organizations appears far from over.</p>

<p>Coinbase today announced the launch of a global derivatives platform as the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange faces harsh regulatory crackdown at home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new facility, Coinbase International Exchange (CIE), follows regulatory approval from the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) and will start trading by listing bitcoin and ether perpetual futures.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-coinbase-rolls-out-offshore-perps-exchange-with-5x-leverage"><strong>Coinbase Rolls Out Offshore Perps Exchange With 5X Leverage</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase has set up shop in Bermuda as it battles regulators in the U.S., its home market.</p>



<p>The firm said Tuesday that it would allow international clients to trade perpetual futures out of Bermuda via an application programming interface (API) in eligible, non-U.S. jurisdiction. Dubbed Coinbase International Exchange, the new venture will not be open to U.S. users.</p>



<p>The platform will first let traders bet on the price of Bitcoin and Ether through so-called perpetual futures with leverage capped at 5%. All trading on the new platform will be settled in the USDC stablecoin.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Very excited to see <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@coinbase</a> International Exchange launch.  Highly competitive, excellent execution and product quality, and USDC as the sole native digital dollar used for funding, collateral and trading.  Congrats <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@brian_armstrong</a>!</p>&mdash; Jeremy Allaire (@jerallaire) <a href="https://twitter.com/jerallaire/status/1653398782774575105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 2, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The move marks Coinbase’s latest foray into crypto perps trading, one of the most popular sectors accounting for nearly 75% of global crypto trading volume in 2022, according to a blog post by the firm.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional futures, where buyers and sellers are forced to enforce the deal on a specified date despite the prevailing market conditions, perpetual futures don’t have an expiration period, meaning that traders can hold their positions infinitely.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Regulatory Shakeup In The U.S.</strong></h2>



<p>There have been recent headwinds in the regulatory regime in the U.S. Coinbase has been publicly feuding with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since the watchdog agency <a href="https://zycrypto.com/insider-trading-former-coinbase-employee-pleads-guilty-to-charges-as-sec-clamps-down-on-the-cryptosphere/">charged </a>former Coinbase product manager Ishan Wahi and his brother Nikhil with insider trading in July 2022 — and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-action-against-coinbase-triggers-ballistic-reaction-from-crypto-community/">sent </a>the exchange a Wells Notice in March.</p>



<p>The publicly-traded company emphasized that it is still committed to the United States, but noted that countries across the globe are increasingly moving forward with responsible, crypto-forward regulatory rulebooks as they endeavor to fortify their positions as themselves as hubs for crypto.</p>



<p><em>“We would like to see the U.S. take a similar approach instead of regulation by enforcement, which has led to a disappointing trend for crypto development in the U.S.,” Coinbase stated. “The Coinbase International Exchange is an expansion, bringing the safest, most trusted name in crypto to the global market.”</em></p>



<p>The ongoing regulatory crackdown in America has forced other exchanges to expand overseas. Bittrex recently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-community-in-shock-as-bittrex-exchange-shuts-down-u-s-operations/">shuttered </a>its stateside operations shortly before being sued by the SEC. And today, rival Gemini also announced that it would offer derivatives trading to customers in 30 countries and territories.</p>

<p>After performing moderately well in April, albeit all the FOMO and regulatory scares, Bitcoin stepped into May with its head down, dropping over 5% during the first half Monday, May 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>



<p>Over the past six or so weeks, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has had difficulties pushing above the $30,000 resistance range despite showing a lot of strength in the first week of April as such price has been trapped in a tight squeeze.</p>



<p>Various market pundits have been trying to project Bitcoin’s behaviour this month, even as the cryptocurrency’s fundamentals <a href="https://zycrypto.com/data-highlights-massive-btc-accumulation-by-whales-as-extreme-fear-grips-bitcoin-price/">continue improving</a>. According to seasoned markets analyst Peter Brandt, Bitcoin currently sits on a &#8220;huge significance&#8221; level. On Saturday, Brandt noted that the price had reached the upper band of a range pattern, stating that a decisive break out of a particular range could significantly impact Bitcoin&#8217;s future.</p>



<p>According to Brandt, the current range pattern suggests that there is a certain price level that Bitcoin has struggled to surpass in the past two years. However, if Bitcoin breaks above this level, it could signal a major shift in the market.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;The confining range has been in place for some time now, but a decisive breakout would have huge significance,</em> “he said, adding, <em>“My bias is that Bitcoin will bury all pretenders eventually. There will be only one &#8216;King of the Hill&#8217;, and it will be Bitcoin.”</em></p>



<p>And Brandt is not alone in his analysis. Caleb Franzen, a research analyst at Cubic Analytics, also noted that Bitcoin needs to break out decisively or get rejected at its current range before he can make any major decisions.</p>



<p>“<em>People are predicting that Bitcoin dominance will skyrocket. Here&#8217;s my take: I don&#8217;t know yet b/c we haven&#8217;t seen a decisive breakout or rejection on this range. Once we get clarity around this major resistance level, I&#8217;ll listen to what the market is telling me,”</em> Franzen tweeted Sunday.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="575" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1024x575.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80395" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1024x575.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-300x168.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-768x431.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image.png 1430w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Today, crypto pundit “Titan of Crypto” shared a Bitcoin % Dominance chart, forming a monthly “W bullish structure”. According to him, the structure suggests dominance could soon break out of the range. He further noted that if April’s monthly candle closes above the range (which it has), Bitcoin’s dominance could increase, tagging along with the price. He, however, warned that as Bitcoin’s season starts, “alts might suffer a bit.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, as the week starts, some analysts expect Bitcoin to falter further due to the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting Wednesday, which will likely raise interest rates by 25 basis points.</p>



<p>At press time, Bitcoin was trading at  $28,110, down 4.45% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data.  </p>

<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/ordinals-project-surpasses-11000-nft-mints-in-weeks-amid-criticisms-from-bitcoin-maxis/">Bitcoin (BTC) Ordinals</a>, popularly referred to as Bitcoin non-fungible tokens (NFTs), are steering a new pathway for the growth of the Bitcoin network despite the harsh criticism from a section of the community in its development phase.</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s average weekly transactions have hit levels not recorded in six years, according to new data from crypto analytics firm IntoTheBlock. On Sunday, the seven-day <a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1652553421323399171?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">average</a> of BTC stood at 396,000, its highest mark since Dec 2017.</p>



<p>The surge in transaction volumes can be linked to the rising popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals, a project launched five months ago amid widespread criticisms. Daily inscriptions on Ordinals hit a new record on Saturday with over 223,000 NFTs, according to a Dune report.  </p>



<p>This daily figure above 200,000 was the first after showing string signs in April, breaking its record four times, including 72,000 daily inscriptions and 193,000 inscriptions on April 2 and April 23rd, respectively. </p>



<p>Text-based Ordinals inscriptions also dominated the ecosystem compared to image-based which differs from the popular Ethereum NFT model. On Saturday, out of the 233,000 inscriptions 99.,8% were text-based, while 273 inscriptions, 0.1, were image-based.</p>



<p>Within its first five months, the total number of Bitcoin Ordinals crossed 2 million on April 26 and further passed 2.5 million Ordinals 2 days later.</p>

<p>Despite criticisms from Bitcoin Maxis and other commentators on the development of NFTs on the Bitcoin network, the Ordinal project has proved doubters wrong, with many tipping marking it as ‘instrumental’ in the next bull run.</p>



<p>Digital asset investment firm Grayscale has marked increased miner fees and developer enthusiasm as two positive ways Ordinals could impact the network.</p>



<p>“<em>The advent of ordinals has led to an increase in total fees paid to miners, which could potentially establish a sustainable baseline level of transaction fees to incentivize miners,” </em>the firm wrote.</p>



<p>The total amount now paid to miners stands at $6.6 million at press time, giving miners the necessary boosts at survival. The firm also believes the project would be key to attracting a new user base to the network, just like NFTs in Ethereum.</p>



<p>“<em>We believe the emergence of ordinals is likely to promote a development-oriented community and culture in support of the Bitcoin network.”</em></p>
