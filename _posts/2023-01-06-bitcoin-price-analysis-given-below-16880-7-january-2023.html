<p>BTC/USD Given Below 16880:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 7 January 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) encountered additional volatility early in the Asian session as the pair continued to trade below the 17000 figure after recently peaking around the 16988 level, its strongest print since 20 December.&nbsp; &nbsp;Traders lifted BTC/USD higher to the 16809.30 level, representing a test of the 50-hour simple moving average, and then BTC/USD retreated lower to the 16670.82 area, representing a test of the 200-hour simple moving average.&nbsp; Traders recently drove BTC/USD as low as the 16326.16 area after Stops were elected below the 16375.18 area, a downside retracement level related to selling pressure around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels.&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD depreciated approximately 64% in 2022, was off more than 3% in December, and is up approximately 1.4% month-to-date. Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16725.67 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16711.39.</p>
