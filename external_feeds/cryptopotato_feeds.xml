			            <description><![CDATA[Two former police officers and 14 other Vietnamese supposedly kidnapped an individual and stole $1.5 worth of bitcoin. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The People&#8217;s Court of Ho Chi Minh City reportedly brought to court 16 Vietnamese who might stand behind a $1.5 million crypto robbery and kidnapping. Interestingly, two of the defendants are former police officers.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Vietnam is one of the global leaders in terms of cryptocurrency adoption. Despite its rising popularity, the government has not imposed a legal framework on the asset class.¬†</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Movielike Story</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a local media outlet, the whole drama </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://tuoitre.vn/lam-quan-su-cho-nhom-cuop-tien-ao-cuu-canh-sat-hinh-su-cung-dong-pham-hau-toa-20230510070447545.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">started</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">¬†in 2018 when Le Duc Nguyen advised Ho Ngoc Tai to sell around 1,000 BTC (valued at approximately $4.2 million at the time) to purchase other digital currencies.</span></p>
<p>Nonetheless, the investment did not go as planned, making Tai believe he had become a victim of a crypto scam. He could not accept the loss and assembled a team in May 2020 whose goal was to steal the assets back.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The entity, consisting of 16 people (including two former police officers), tracked Nguyen&#8217;s whereabouts using GPS devices installed on his vehicle. The individuals hired a van, bought realistic weapons, and kidnapped the target at gunpoint.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While in their custody, the team insisted Nguyen&#8217;s bother transfers the original amount of 1,000 BTC to Tai&#8217;s wallet. However, the gang realized that his relative did not have the requested amount and restored &#8220;only&#8221; $1.5 million worth of crypto. The victim was later abandoned in the city of Thu Duc: about 15 kilometers north of Ho Chi Minh City&#8217;s center.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The law enforcement agencies of the Vietnamese city recently brought to trial Tai and his 15 alleged accomplices. It is worth noting that the mastermind of the operation initially admitted to standing behind the crime. However, he reversed his confession during the process of investigation. For their part, the remaining defendants said they thought Tai would collect the debt from Nguyen normally and not via kidnapping.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Vietnamese are Fond of Crypto</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Asian country often tops studies that are focused on cryptocurrency adoption. The blockchain service provider &#8211; Chainalysis &#8211;¬†</span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/vietnam-reaffirms-global-leadership-in-crypto-adoption-chainalysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">estimated</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">¬†in September 2022 that Vietnam is the world&#8217;s leader in that field with a score of 1.000. The company further suggested that 21% of the locals have used or owned digital currencies at some point during their lives.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The &#8220;Vietnam Crypto Market Report 2022,&#8221; released in March this year,¬†</span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-flourishes-in-vietnam-with-16-6-million-holders-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">showed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">¬†that the asset class continues to be highly popular inside the country&#8217;s borders. According to the research, 17% of Vietnamese (around 16.6 million people) are HODLers. Nearly a third of those have invested in bitcoin.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The report claimed that Vietnam ranks second to Thailand in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in terms of crypto adoption.¬†</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Popular Ethereum wallet MetaMask has teamed up with payment giant PayPal to increase offerings for American users.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On May 11, MetaMask revealed that it had added PayPal as a payment option for Ethereum purchases. However, the new payment channel is only available to U.S. users.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúMetaMask is the first web3 wallet to enable users to buy ETH using PayPal, a leader in the digital payment space,‚Äù it said.</p></blockquote>
<p>The integration also supports ETH transfers from PayPal to MetaMask, creating more self-custody adoption.</p>
<p>However, many of those responding to the tweet were more interested in when MetaMask would be launching its own token. The firm has urged users to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/there-wont-be-a-metamask-airdrop-snapshot-on-march-31st-team-member-warns-of-scams/" data-wpel-link="internal">avoid scams</a> for MASK tokens, adding that there are no immediate airdrop plans.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>MetaMask PayPal Collaboration</h2>
<p>The collaboration was initially announced in December, but payments have only just been <a href="https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-and-paypal-all-you-need-to-know-about-buying-eth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">launched</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúWith this new integration, users will be able to use their PayPal balance, linked bank account, or debit card to add ETH to their MetaMask wallet directly.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>Ethereum purchases can be made easily through the MetaMask browser extension, mobile app, or portfolio feature. The ‚ÄúBuy Crypto‚Äù feature also supports debit and credit cards and bank transfers.</p>
<p>In addition to PayPal, MetaMask already supports several payment channels, including Coinbase Pay, MoonPay, Sardine, Transak, and Wyre.</p>
<h2>Recent Moves by PayPal and MetaMask</h2>
<p>In a quarterly report filed this week, PayPal <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/paypal-holds-1-billion-in-crypto-on-balance-sheet-records-show/" data-wpel-link="internal">revealed</a> it had $943 million in crypto assets under management as of March 31. Furthermore, the figure is a 56% increase over the previous quarter when the company disclosed $604 million.</p>
<p>In late March, MetaMask <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/metamask-taps-moonpay-to-enable-nigerians-buy-crypto-via-instant-bank-transfers/" data-wpel-link="internal">integrated</a> crypto fintech platform MoonPay to expand its offerings in Nigeria.</p>
<p>In February, the popular Web3 wallet <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/metamask-unveils-new-privacy-features-for-crypto-wallets/" data-wpel-link="internal">unveiled</a> a raft of privacy features following online criticism of how it handled transaction data.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The US IRS supposedly partnered with Ukrainian agencies to provide assistance in the economic battle against Russia. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The US IRS has reportedly provided advanced training to Ukrainian law enforcement agencies in an attempt to detect illegal cryptocurrency transactions carried out by Russian oligarchs and companies.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Numerous entities and experts have argued that Russia could employ digital assets to evade restrictions (imposed by the Western World after the start of the military conflict in Ukraine) or finance war-related efforts. The US Treasury Department sanctioned five crypto addresses tied to Task Force Rusich last year. The latter is a Russian paramilitary group that has committed atrocities against soldiers.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Battling on the Economic Front¬†</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As¬†</span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-trains-ukrainian-law-enforcement-to-pursue-russian-crypto-assets-e005ba5" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by the Wall Street Journal, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provided Ukraine with licenses to use Chinalysis Reactor (an investigation software that connects cryptocurrency transactions to real-world entities) to trace illicit proceedings conducted by Russians.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ukrainian investigators have also received in-person training from the American department that could give the war-torn country an upper hand in its economic clash with Russia.¬†</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;We resist the aggressor state not only on the battlefield but also on the economic front,&#8221; said Eduard Fedorov &#8211; Acting Director of Ukraine&#8217;s Economic Security Bureau.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another goal for the Ukrainian agencies is to halt Russian fundraising campaigns related to cryptocurrencies. Yurii Vykhodets, who leads the cyber department of Ukraine&#8217;s National Police, said:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;One key area is the identification and elimination of centers of support for occupation forces that raise funds for the purchase of things necessary for the war. We often see fundraising campaigns conducted with the use of cryptocurrency, as Russia believes in the possibility of circumventing sanctions by using virtual assets.&#8221;¬†</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Russia Should Stay Away From Crypto</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine in February last year (described as a &#8220;special military operation&#8221; by President Vladimir Putin) has resulted in severe sanctions against the world&#8217;s largest country by landmass.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The USA, the European Union, Australia, and many others have¬†</span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-imposes-sanctions-over-100-targets-action-over-russias-invasion-ukraine-2023-04-12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">imposed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">¬†crippling financial restrictions in a bid to cease the aggression and dwindle Russia&#8217;s military strength.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition, many agencies and prominent figures have warned crypto companies to cut all ties with the invader, arguing that sanctioned oligarchs and organizations could use digital currencies to bypass penalties or fund war-related operations.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One example was the President of the European Central Bank &#8211; Christine Lagarde &#8211; who¬†</span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/ecb-president-warns-crypto-companies-against-helping-russians-avoid-sanctions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">said</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">¬†entities interacting with Russia could be the subject of enhanced scrutiny.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The International Money Fund (IMF) has also given its two cents on the matter,¬†</span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/russia-could-mine-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-to-evade-sanctions-imf-warns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">suggesting</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">¬†the nation could mine bitcoin and altcoins to dodge restrictions.¬†</span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amidst regulatory tussle, an SEC disclosure revealed an expensive bill for Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong&#8217;s security benefits.</p>
<p>The exec was granted security benefits of $6.3 million last year, representing more than triple the amount his security cost Coinbase the previous year.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to the public <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001679788/000167978823000065/coin-20230428.htm#i3cb39573656744c194f48e26318d6b44_40" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">document</a>, Armstrong&#8217;s total compensation for the whole of 2022 was $7.5 million, and received a flat salary of $1 million, while the remaining can be characterized as security and legal costs. The base salary was the same for the previous two years as well.</li>
<li>Moreover, a huge chunk of the Coinbase CEO&#8217;s wealth comes from his holdings and sales of the company stock.</li>
<li>Armstrong received nearly $57 million in option awards as well, besides making a profit after Coinbase went public. He still holds 39 million shares in the company, which is currently worth around $2.4 billion if sold.</li>
<li>The CEO&#8217;s compensation for 2022 was up by almost 134% since the previous year. His subordinates, including COO Emilie Choi, CFO Alesia Haas, CPO Surojit Chatterjee, and CLO Paul Grewal, also witnessed a considerable appreciation in their total compensation for the year.</li>
<li>In fact, all the five top executives of the San Francisco-based exchange giant receive nearly $1 million in cash salary.</li>
<li>The development emerges just a week after Coinbase <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-posts-79m-net-loss-but-beats-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> a fifth consecutive quarter of losses. The company posted $79 million in losses while its total revenue plunged to $772.5 million, representing a decline of 37% from the $1.1 billion in revenue for Q1 2022.</li>
<li>Coinbase&#8217;s stock also took a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-stock-slides-as-exchanges-regulatory-woes-deepen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">beating</a> as a result of tremendous regulatory pressure in the United States.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple&#8217;s price is currently hovering near a crucial support region which consists of both the 200-day moving average and the $0.41 price zone. A breach below this critical level could potentially trigger a significant downturn toward the descending trendline.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/greatest_trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>On the daily chart, it‚Äôs apparent that after the recent weeks of rejection, the price has arrived at a strong support area at the 200-day moving average of $0.41. Considering the power of this moving average, XRP may enter a consolidation phase.</p>
<p>However, if the price fails to hold above this crucial support zone, it could trigger a cascade leading to bearish sentiment over the market. Conversely, if the cryptocurrency finds support at the 200-day moving average, buyers can hope for a mid-term uptrend toward the $0.56 resistance level.</p>
<figure id="attachment_250389" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-250389" style="width: 2708px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRP-Dailly.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-250389 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRP-Dailly.png" alt="xrp_price_chart_1205231" width="2708" height="1466" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRP-Dailly.png 2708w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRP-Dailly-300x162.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRP-Dailly-1024x554.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRP-Dailly-768x416.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRP-Dailly-1536x832.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRP-Dailly-2048x1109.png 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRP-Dailly-50x27.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2708px) 100vw, 2708px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-250389" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>On the 4-Hour Chart, Ripple&#8217;s price has formed an ascending channel. The recent rejection has caused it to drop below the minor support level of $0.48 and the channel&#8217;s mid-trend line. Currently, the price faces a crucial support level at $0.41.</p>
<p>In summary, this PA is supportive of a potential consolidation stage around the mentioned support area until a breakout occurs. However, it&#8217;s important to see how the price will actually react, as this would probably give us a clue about the short-term trend.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Easy come - easy go. This week saw PEPE crash and burn, losing over 70% since its all-time high. The rest of the market is also bleeding out.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The past seven days saw the cryptocurrency market lose close to $100 billion off its total capitalization, which currently sits at $1.150B. It&#8217;s not been very fun for market participants as the majority of coins are trading well in the red. Once again, the hottest story of the week might as well be PEPE, but not for the same reasons as last week. Let&#8217;s dive in.</p>
<p>First things first, Bitcoin&#8217;s price crashed by roughly 9% through the past week and is currently trading at around $26,500. There&#8217;s no sugarcoating it &#8211; it&#8217;s been down-only, and buyers failed to catch a break. The bears were relentless and rejected the price at the single attempt at $30K this time last week, and it&#8217;s been an avalanche afterward.</p>
<p>The price dipped below $29K last Saturday and was unable to recover above that level. By Monday evening, it was already trading at close to $27K. The CPI announcement on Wednesday provided some hope, as BTC pumped above $28K, but it was shortlived as the correction was almost immediate. Since then, the cryptocurrency continued spiraling downward and is found where it currently trades at around $26,500.</p>
<p>Looking at the altcoins, it doesn&#8217;t get much better, as most of them are trading well in the red. ETH, BNB, XRP, ADA, DOGE, SOL, MATIC, DOT &#8211; all of them are charting considerable losses.</p>
<p>But all of the above fade in comparison to PEPE. The memecoin that reigned over the market in the past few weeks seems to have finally found some sort of a top and has crashed by 60% on the weekly and by more than 70% since its ATH.</p>
<p>And while it&#8217;s interesting to see whether PEPE will stage a recovery, the odds aren&#8217;t looking very good at the moment.</p>
<p>All in all, the market sentiment has definitely shifted throughout the past few weeks, and the optimism is fading. It&#8217;s interesting to see if this is just a temporary correction or if a deeper winter is once again in the making, albeit in the summer. Sell in May and go away? Will the popular saying keep true?</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, we take a closer look at Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Pepe, and Dogecoin.</p>
<h2>Ethereum (ETH)</h2>
<p>With the market in the red, Ethereum has fallen by 7.4% this week. In the process, the key level at $1,800 has turned into a resistance. This highlights a major change in the structure and puts bears in control of the price action.</p>
<p>The momentum has turned bearish, and a test of the key support at $1,660 appears likely in the coming week. This becomes increasingly so if Bitcoin continues with its correction.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, if the key support at $1,660 holds, Ethereum might maintain its macro uptrend (higher lows). If not, then bulls will be put in a very difficult position, as that would open the path for this cryptocurrency to revisit levels not seen since March 2023 (under $1,500).</p>

<h2>Ripple (XRP)</h2>
<p>Ripple&#8217;s downtrend accelerated this week and resulted in an 8% loss in valuation. With the support at 44 cents lost and turned into resistance, buyers have retreated to the 40 cents level.</p>
<p>Historically, it has been a critical point where the price pivoted and reversed. If buyers return, then XRP could put a stop to its correction.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, sellers are in charge, and the seemingly more likely scenario is for XRP&#8217;s price to fall until the 40 cents support. Once there, its reaction to this level would likely determine the short-term trend.</p>
<figure id="attachment_250311" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-250311" style="width: 1814px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-12_14-22-08.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-250311" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-12_14-22-08.png" alt="XRPUSDT_2023-05-12_14-22-08" width="1814" height="803" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-12_14-22-08.png 1814w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-12_14-22-08-300x133.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-12_14-22-08-1024x453.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-12_14-22-08-768x340.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-12_14-22-08-1536x680.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-12_14-22-08-50x22.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1814px) 100vw, 1814px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-250311" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Cardano (ADA)</h2>
<p>With the head and shoulders reversal pattern confirmed ADA fell by 7.7% this week. It seems less likely that the price will stop until it hits the support at 34 cents. This price action is somewhat similar to XRP, and buyers will likely be absent until the key support is hit.</p>
<p>The momentum indicators, like the MACD and RSI, are bearish and falling to lower lows. The daily RSI is under 40 and still has room until it hits the oversold area (under 30). Together with a bearish MACD, this indicates sellers may likely continue to dominate for some time.</p>
<p><span style="color: #2b2b2b;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead</span></span>, this cryptocurrency remains bearish. If buyers don&#8217;t return at the 34 cents support, then the next likely candidate will be found at 30 cents, which is also a key psychological level.</p>
<figure id="attachment_250312" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-250312" style="width: 1814px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-12_14-20-43.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-250312" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-12_14-20-43.png" alt="ADAUSDT_2023-05-12_14-20-43" width="1814" height="860" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-12_14-20-43.png 1814w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-12_14-20-43-300x142.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-12_14-20-43-1024x485.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-12_14-20-43-768x364.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-12_14-20-43-1536x728.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-12_14-20-43-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1814px) 100vw, 1814px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-250312" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Pepe (PEPE)¬†</span></p>
<p>The spectacular performance from PEPE ended up with an equally spectacular crash. This meme coin crashed by 37% in the past week and by over 75% from its all-time high. Worst yet, the selling pressure has intensified in the past few days. This highlights that some holders have capitulated and taken the loss.</p>
<p>The Binance listing turned out as a top event, and the price has not stopped falling since. PEPE is also the worst performer on our list this week. In a way, this is not surprising, considering that the level of FOMO and hype achieved peak irrationality around that period.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, PEPE has support at $0.0000010. However, any support for this meme coin is fragile, and considering its supply, it would not be surprising to see it crash by over 90%. This is even more likely if the overall market remains bearish.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Dogecoin (DOGE)</span></p>
<p>With Dogecoin being completely overshadowed by PEPE, this meme coin did not find any buyers, and its price has fallen by 10.5% in the past seven days.</p>
<p>Since the momentum favors sellers, the daily RSI is approaching fast the oversold area at 30 points. This could provide buyers with an opportunity to stop the downtrend at the key support level. The current resistance is at 7.5 cents.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, a test of the key support appears imminent. On the weekly timeframe, the price action in 2023 shows a flat trend, and DOGE has failed to gather enough strength to enter into an uptrend.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[After his arrest in March in Montenegro, Kwon is facing trial for traveling on forged documents to the Southeastern European country.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do Kwon, founder of Terraform Labs, which operated Terra stablecoin and Luna cryptocurrency, has pleaded not guilty to traveling to Montenegro on a forged passport.</p>
<p>In the Basic Court of Montenegro‚Äôs capital Podgorica, Kwon and Terraform‚Äôs chief financial officer Han Chang-Joon denied document forgery charges.</p>
<p>Shortly after, another local <a href="https://www.pobjeda.me/clanak/prihvaceno-jemstvo-od-800000-eura-korejskim-drzavljanima" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a> informed that the Court approved the bail worth ‚Ç¨400,000 that was proposed by Kwon. As such, he is set to be released ahead of the trial.</p>
<p>The prosecutors objected to the decision, arguing that Kwon and Chang-Joon had no interest in remaining in Montenegro until the court date.</p>
<h2>Kwon Proposes ‚Ç¨400K for Bail</h2>
<p>Kwon and Han were <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/terras-do-kwon-reportedly-arrested-in-montenegro/" data-wpel-link="internal">arrested</a> at the Podgorica airport on March 23, and the prosecutors filed the charges against them on April 2. On the May 11 hearing, their lawyers sought the defendants&#8217; bail and proposed a combined amount of ‚Ç¨400,000. They also asked the court to define the measures for the defendants to ‚Äúleave the apartment‚Äù during the prohibition and its supervision.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúA trial was held before the Basic Court in Podgorica in the case against the defendants C.J.H. and K.D.H., who are accused of having committed the criminal offense of document forgery. At the main hearing, the defendants denied the commission of the criminal offense they were charged with and presented their defense,‚Äù Podgorica‚Äôs Basic Court, in a¬†<a href="https://sudovi.me/ospg/sadrzaj/aL9R" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">statement</a>, said.</p></blockquote>
<p>The defense lawyers further asked the court to allow Kwon and Han to ‚Äúreport to the state authority periodically.‚Äù However, the state prosecutors opposed these proposals. The court has not decided on the matter and set June 16 as the next hearing date.</p>
<h2>No Immediate Extradition</h2>
<p>After his arrest, the US and South Korea officially asked Montenegro for Kwon‚Äôs <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorea-us-seeking-extradition-crypto-entrepreneur-do-kwon-montenegro-2023-03-29/#:~:text=PODGORICA%2C%20March%2029%20(Reuters),Marko%20Kovac%20said%20on%20Wednesday." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">extradition</a>, the country‚Äôs Justice Minister Marko Kovac told a press conference in Podgorica on March 23. He further said Kwon and Han had been charged with traveling to the country on forged documents, and they would be deported only after the trial was completed and they had served the sentence that the courts might give against them.</p>
<p>Both countries also requested the Montenegro authorities to hand over the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-sec-gains-access-to-do-kwons-singaporean-records-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">computers</a> of the two arrested Terraform executives.</p>
<p>Terraform Lab‚Äôs Terra and Luna coins, which were pegged to each other in an algorithmic arrangement, collapsed in early May 2022 and left the crypto market with a loss of nearly $40 billion.</p>
<p>The South Korean courts clubbed the complaints from investors in these coins who lost their money in two cases and pursued to bring Kwon and his associates to justice. Kwon has denied any wrongdoing, except that his business strategies failed, leading to the collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem. However, he refused to answer the summons and has been evading arrest by the South Korean authorities.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Geneva, Switzerland, May 12th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://messari.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Messari</a>, a leader in crypto market research and intelligence, recently released reports on both the USDD stablecoin as well as the TRON blockchain ecosystem. ‚ÄúThe <a href="https://trondao.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">TRON DAO</a> team appreciates Messari‚Äôs work overall, and like normal, its objective research in these latest TRON-related reports offers data-driven, insightful remarks,‚Äù a TRON spokesperson commented.</p>
<p><a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-usdd-q1-2023?referrer=all-research" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><strong>State of USDD Q1 2023</strong></a></p>
<p>USDD is an overcollateralized stablecoin managed by the TRON DAO Reserve (TDR). The number of USDD holders consistently remained above 130,000 in Q1 2023. The quarter also saw USDD expand its reach through various partnerships, and integrations with platforms like SwapFish, LayerZero Labs&#8217; Aptos Bridge, and SushiSwap on the BitTorrent Chain (BTTC).</p>
<p><a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-tron-q1-2023?referrer=all-research" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><strong>State of TRON Q1 2023</strong></a></p>
<p>The TRON ecosystem overall held steady in Q1 2023.</p>
<p>There was a growth of 193,000 new accounts per day, surpassing the 12-month average of 172,000. Daily transactions grew by 7.7%, and TRON&#8217;s deflation rate was around 1% in Q1. Additionally, TRON&#8217;s position in the stablecoin landscape remains substantial, second only to Ethereum. The network&#8217;s integration with platforms like Blockbank, Fireblocks, and Uphold has improved access to the ecosystem, while initiatives like the TRON Climate Initiative and TRON Academy highlight its commitment to sustainability and next-gen education.</p>
<p><strong>Other highlights of note from the TRON report were:¬†</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>JustLend and JustStables benefited from the market rebound throughout Q1 as both were up QoQ (26% and 21%, respectively)</li>
<li>TUSD value on the network grew by 420% QoQ to ~$1.3 billion</li>
<li>Average amount of stake for Energy increased by 37.8% QoQ</li>
<li>Technical developments advanced steadily</li>
<li>TRON initiated developments to expand DeFi, including liquid staking and a decentralized resource marketplace.</li>
<li>While USDT maintained 95% of the stablecoin value on TRON, there was a notable uptick in TUSD.</li>
<li>TRON positioned itself in the AI space by partnering with Oraichain and launching a $100 million AI development fund.</li>
</ul>
<p>TRON looks to remain competitive and continue its growth strategies to expand DeFi, stablecoin adoption, AI, and other use cases through 2023.</p>
