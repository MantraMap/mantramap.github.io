<p>Key Points:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>The UK&#8217;s data regulator, the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office (ICO), is launching an investigation into Worldcoin, a crypto project led by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, which offers free cryptocurrency in exchange for users&#8217; iris scans.</em></li>



<li><em>Worldcoin, which recently launched with a user base of two million from its trial phase, plans to expand its eyeball-scanning operations to 20 countries, raising concerns over potential privacy risks associated with the collection and storage of sensitive biometric data.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The project, which offers users the opportunity to receive free cryptocurrency in exchange for their iris scans, has caught the attention of the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office (ICO). The ICO spokesperson informed Reuters that they have taken notice of the recent launch of Worldcoin in the UK and have decided to initiate further inquiries into the matter. This move comes amid growing concerns over the potential implications of widespread iris scanning and the use of sensitive biometric information in a financial context.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/coin.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="315" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/coin.jpeg" alt="UK Data Watchdog To Investigate Worldcoin Crypto Project Over Privacy Concerns" class="wp-image-205800" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/coin.jpeg 600w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/coin-300x158.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="UK Data Watchdog To Investigate Worldcoin Crypto Project Over Privacy Concerns 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p><a href="https://coincu.com/205302-worldcoin-token-openai-ceo-sam-altman/">Worldcoin</a>&#8216;s launch on Monday attracted a substantial user base, with two million individuals participating in the trial phase of the project. As the crypto initiative scales up its operations, it plans to conduct eyeball-scanning procedures in 20 countries, aiming for a global reach.</p>



<p>The concept of utilizing iris scans for digital identification and cryptocurrency rewards has raised eyebrows among privacy advocates and regulatory bodies alike. Critics argue that the collection and storage of biometric data on such a vast scale could pose serious privacy risks for individuals, potentially leading to identity theft and misuse of sensitive information.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1200x0.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1200x0-1024x683.jpeg" alt="UK Data Watchdog To Investigate Worldcoin Crypto Project Over Privacy Concerns" class="wp-image-205801" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1200x0-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1200x0-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1200x0-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1200x0-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1200x0-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1200x0.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="UK Data Watchdog To Investigate Worldcoin Crypto Project Over Privacy Concerns 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>While Worldcoin promises free cryptocurrency as an incentive for users to participate, the use of biometric data remains a contentious issue. Proponents of the project claim that it can foster financial inclusion for those without access to traditional banking systems. However, detractors argue that such benefits may not outweigh the potential dangers associated with compromising biometric data.</p>



<p>As the ICO launches its investigation, Worldcoin&#8217;s future remains uncertain. The outcome of this inquiry will likely have significant implications not only for the project itself but also for the broader crypto industry&#8217;s approach to utilizing biometrics and handling user data.</p>

<p>The total amount pilfered from Alphapo has now surged to a staggering $60 million, making it a high-profile attack in the cryptocurrency world. The heist has raised concerns over security and highlighted potential vulnerabilities within the crypto ecosystem.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hack update: An additional $37M stolen on TRON &amp; BTC from this hack has been located.<br><br>This now brings the total amount stolen to $60M.<br><br>This hack appears to likely have been done by Lazarus as they create a very distinct fingerprint on-chain. <a href="https://t.co/ACGSXiDwW3" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/ACGSXiDwW3</a></p>&mdash; ZachXBT (@zachxbt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1683747073227624448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 25, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>As per previous <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1683747073227624448" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1683747073227624448" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports </a>from ZachXBT&#8217;s monitoring, it was initially reported that the Alphapo hot wallet had been breached, leading to a theft of $23 million in US dollars. In response to the attack, the Alphapo HyperDrop client took immediate action by disabling withdrawals to prevent further losses.</p>



<p>The investigation into the theft has unveiled an intricate web of transactions, revealing a sophisticated and well-coordinated operation. The stolen funds were first moved to the Ethereum network, presumably in an attempt to obfuscate the source and origin of the funds. Subsequently, they were cross-linked to the Avalanche network and Bitcoin (BTC), creating multiple layers of complexity to mask the hacker&#8217;s tracks.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Alphapo-Hot-Wallet.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="768" height="432" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Alphapo-Hot-Wallet.jpeg" alt="Alphapo Hot Wallet" class="wp-image-205786" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Alphapo-Hot-Wallet.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Alphapo-Hot-Wallet-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Alphapo-Hot-Wallet-750x422.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" title="Alphapo Hot Wallet Losses Surge to $60M, ZachXBT Reports 7"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Attributing the hack to a group with potential links to Lazarus, a notorious cybercriminal organization known for conducting large-scale attacks, has further fueled concerns about the rising threats posed by such sophisticated hacking entities in the cryptocurrency space.</p>



<p>The Alphapo heist serves as a stark reminder that the cryptocurrency world is not impervious to cyberattacks, and all stakeholders must remain vigilant to combat and deter such criminal activities. Collaborative efforts between exchanges, law enforcement agencies, and cybersecurity experts will be essential in bringing the perpetrators to justice and restoring trust in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The growing popularity of <a href="https://coincu.com/205356-real-world-asset-rwa-risks-to-solve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RWAs</a> in DeFi underscores the growing importance of incorporating real-world assets into decentralized financial solutions to open up more opportunities to bring more stable assets into DeFi, making user investments safer and protocols more accessible. So why is the integration of these two areas becoming more and more important, and are there ways to bring RWA deep into the Defi market?</strong></h5>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Real World Assets (RWA) became a significant driver of Defi</h2>



<p>DeFi is successful in the crypto space because it benefits all participants. Cryptocurrency holders can earn passive income from their assets through mechanisms like yield farming. At the same time, borrowers can get loans in seconds on favorable terms that no other traditional financial institution can match.</p>



<p>One of the biggest drawbacks of DeFi is the requirement that borrowers over-collateralize their loans to account for price fluctuations. Most DeFi protocols require collateral that is higher than the loan&#8217;s value. This excessive collateral requirement poses a significant risk to the borrower and severely impedes access. Currently, most businesses cannot use DeFi as a source of funding because they are not allowed to use anything but cryptocurrencies as collateral.</p>



<p>Besides, the DeFi Market has grown enormously since the beginning of 2020 and reached the TVL milestone of more than $180 billion by the end of 2021. Since then, along with the market&#8217;s downtrend, the TVL on DeFi protocols has plummeted to less than $50 billion as it is now.</p>

<p>As a pillar of technological progress and the driving force of the entire blockchain industry today, however, DeFi still needs to work on better tokenomics models with a high token inflation rate.</p>



<p>Some tokens lost more than 90% of their value, and even disappeared from the market, leading to a significant reduction in profits for users. The yield from DeFi is now only equivalent to TradFi (Traditional Finance).</p>



<p>Now there is a new innovation in the field of DeFi that can revolutionize the traditional way of lending/borrowing and drive DeFi adoption globally across all businesses, small and large. RWA refer to physical assets with tangible value, such as real estate, merchandise, vehicles, and collectibles. These assets are increasingly tokenized, meaning their ownership is represented by digital tokens that can be bought, sold, or traded on the blockchain.</p>



<p>Integrating Real World Assets (RWA) into decentralized finance (DeFi) has greatly expanded the range of financial opportunities and services available to users, including lending, borrowing, and trading. By making high-value, physical assets more accessible, liquid, and interoperable, tokenized real-world assets are creating opportunities for both individual investors and companies to participate in the process.</p>



<p>Currently, Real World Assets is contributing a huge part to the value of global finance. Of which, the debt market (with fixed cash flow) is already worth about $127 trillion, the real estate market is worth about $362 trillion, and the gold market capitalization is about $11,5 trillion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, with TVL at just $50 billion, the DeFi market is like a tiny person compared to RWA&#8217;s capitalization. If RWA is put on the blockchain, the DeFi market will receive a richer stream of assets with more diverse profit models, thereby driving growth.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Ways DeFi Leverages RWA to Real Profits</h2>



<p>In recent years, the term Real World Asset (RWA) has emerged more commonly to distinguish cryptocurrencies from traditional financial assets. Compared to cryptocurrencies that only exist in digital form, physical assets (RWAs) are often tangible assets and involve physical institutions.</p>



<p>However, with the development of blockchain technology, real assets have become able to connect to DeFi. The developer uses smart contracts to generate a token that represents an RWA and provides off-chain security to ensure the token is redeemable for the underlying asset.</p>



<p>So when Real World Assets are put on the blockchain, how will they be used in DeFi?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Stablecoins</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1812.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="207" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1812-1024x207.png" alt="How Are Real World Assets (RWAs) Integrated Into Defi Protocols?" class="wp-image-205763" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1812-1024x207.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1812-300x61.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1812-768x155.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1812-1536x311.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1812-2048x415.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1812-750x152.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1812-1140x231.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="How Are Real World Assets (RWAs) Integrated Into Defi Protocols? 11"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Source: <a href="https://defillama.com/stablecoins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DefiLlama</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Stablecoins are a perfect example of successful real-world use of assets in DeFi, with three of the top seven crypto tokens by market capitalization being stablecoins ($126 billion in total). USDT and USDC are two stablecoins that are regularly in the top 5 crypto tokens by market capitalization. What both have in common is that real assets like USD and bonds back them.</p>



<p>Currently, USDC is backed by a 1:1 peg against the USD, thanks to an asset reserve of $8.1 billion in cash and $29 billion in U.S. Treasuries. Similarly, more than 80% of USDT&#8217;s reserve assets are in cash and Treasuries, with the remainder in corporate bonds, loans, and other investments.</p>



<p>By this nature, stablecoins are an important asset of DeFi, supporting the transfer of value between the real world and the blockchain, as well as an intermediary asset to shelter from market volatility.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Synthetic tokens</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1814.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="700" height="394" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1814.png" alt="How Are Real World Assets (RWAs) Integrated Into Defi Protocols?" class="wp-image-205766" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1814.png 700w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1814-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" title="How Are Real World Assets (RWAs) Integrated Into Defi Protocols? 12"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Another application of the synthetic token involves connecting physical assets to DeFi. This synthetic token enables on-chain trading of financial futures involving currencies, stocks, and commodities. The leading synthetic token trading platform, Synthetix, locked up to $3 billion worth of assets in its protocol during a massive bull run in 2021.</p>



<p>Synthetic tokens have many interesting uses. For example, holders of real assets such as real estate can securitize cash flows from rental operations, then tokenize that security into a synthetic token for trading on DeFi.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lending Protocol</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1815.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="656" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1815-1024x656.png" alt="How Are Real World Assets (RWAs) Integrated Into Defi Protocols?" class="wp-image-205768" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1815-1024x656.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1815-300x192.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1815-768x492.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1815-1536x984.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1815-750x480.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1815-1140x730.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1815.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="How Are Real World Assets (RWAs) Integrated Into Defi Protocols? 13"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Another interesting application of RWA in DeFi is related to lending protocols. Compared to primitive lending protocols that use crypto borrowing, DeFi platforms focus on RWAs to serve actual businesses that are borrowing money. This pattern offers relatively stable yields and is protected from cryptocurrency volatility.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also no surprise that lending protocols lead the DeFi space. Out of the top 10 DeFi protocols on the market, 4 are just lending deals.</p>



<p>With RWA-based crypto loans, you are providing collateral that may have an objective value lower than the amount you are borrowing. In some cases, you may not even need to put down any collateral. RWA-based loans help businesses survive and expand by allowing them to access capital without having to put up large amounts of collateral.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Yield Generator</strong></h3>



<p>The DeFi lending business model provides the most cost-effective way to pool and distribute capital among many lenders and borrowers. It eliminates middlemen and automates money transfers while providing users with relative anonymity.</p>



<p>However, the focus on serving crypto investors creates significant limitations. The capital pool in DeFi needs to be more utilized, especially during bear markets. The world&#8217;s biggest borrowers don&#8217;t have access to these funds either &#8211; real world businesses don&#8217;t have crypto assets as collateral.</p>



<p>Lending protocols address these limitations by building a robust model to help businesses with real-world economic activity access DeFi capital.</p>



<p>Real Yield platforms can use RWAs as real estate (Real Estate) tokenized into NFTs as collateral for loans. Then, Yield Generator will generate profits from this lending and share profits with investors through tokens issued by the platform.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Bringing real-world assets onto the blockchain and integrating them into decentralized finance is one of the most significant potential use cases of cryptocurrencies and Web 3 technology.</p>



<p>Some of the prominent applications of RWA in DeFi are stablecoins, synthetic tokens, lending, and yield generators. These are just simple applications, so this field has a lot of potential for future growth.</p>



<p>Currently, the introduction of RWA into the Crypto market is still facing many challenges. One of them is the ability to evaluate and convert RWA value to cryptocurrency accurately. Besides, the stability of RWA value in the Crypto market is also affected by volatility and the possibility of capital loss.</p>



<p>However, the development of Blockchain technology and DeFi applications are helping to solve some of the above problems and provide new solutions for RWA trading in the Crypto market. This is attracting the interest of many investors and financial professionals in the hope of creating a connection between the Crypto market and the traditional asset market, helping to bring greater investment opportunities to investors around the globe.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Ribbon Finance community proposes a merger with Aevo and the adoption of Aevo as the new brand name has been approved.</em></li>



<li><em>The proposed merger seeks to consolidate Ribbon Finance&#8217;s structured products into Aevo&#8217;s platform, introducing a new token (AEVO) while phasing out the original token (RBN) at a 1:1 ratio.</em></li>



<li><em>Aevo will become the premier destination for on-chain derivatives, offering exchange-traded options, perpetual contracts, OTC derivatives, and a suite of structured products.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The <a href="https://coincu.com/202024-ribbon-finance-to-merge-into-aevo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposal</a> put forth by the Ribbon Finance community to merge into Aevo and adopt Aevo as the new brand name has been overwhelmingly <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/rbn.eth/proposal/0x68cddae9c345383838357d5e61e0d07b2263ad541e40c4ae84de829ccee673e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">approved</a>.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1810.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="866" height="631" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1810.png" alt="Ribbon Finance Promotes Merger Of Aevo, Making New Brand Name" class="wp-image-205760" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1810.png 866w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1810-300x219.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1810-768x560.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1810-120x86.png 120w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1810-750x546.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 866px) 100vw, 866px" title="Ribbon Finance Promotes Merger Of Aevo, Making New Brand Name 14"></a></figure></div>


<p>The community-backed proposal received resounding support, with an impressive approval rate of 99.68%, signaling a decisive mandate for the merger.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/136910-ribbon-finance-offered-government-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ribbon Finance</a>, known for its innovative structured products on the blockchain, set its sights on a new path by launching the proposal to merge with <a href="https://coincu.com/187553-ribbon-finances-new-protocol-aevo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aevo</a> and undergo a comprehensive restructuring of governance and token economics. The merger entails significant changes that are set to elevate Aevo&#8217;s position as the premier venue for on-chain derivatives trading, ushering in a new era for the platform.</p>



<p>One of the key components of the merger involves the phasing out of the original Ribbon Finance token, RBN, and the introduction of a fresh token named AEVO. The migration will see RBN token holders receive a one-to-one exchange ratio for AEVO tokens, paving the way for a seamless transition.</p>



<p>Aevo&#8217;s vision revolves around becoming the ultimate destination for on-chain derivatives trading, comprising exchange-traded options, perpetual contracts, OTC derivatives, and a range of structured products, including passive and active investment options. By integrating Ribbon Finance&#8217;s offerings into Aevo&#8217;s suite of structured products, the platform aspires to evolve into a DeFi super-app, boasting a comprehensive array of perpetuals, options, and yield products under one roof.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1813.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1813-1024x512.png" alt="Ribbon Finance Promotes Merger Of Aevo, Making New Brand Name" class="wp-image-205764" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1813-1024x512.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1813-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1813-768x384.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1813-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1813-750x375.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1813-1140x570.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1813.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Ribbon Finance Promotes Merger Of Aevo, Making New Brand Name 15"></a></figure></div>


<p>The merger will enable users to navigate effortlessly between Aevo&#8217;s exchange, OTC, and structured products, enhancing the overall user experience. Furthermore, this pivotal move brings the deployment of structured products directly onto the Aevo rollup closer to reality, unlocking significant synergies between the exchange and vaults.</p>



<p>The proposal also underlines the importance of a unified brand identity for both Ribbon and Aevo. As part of this endeavor, all components of Ribbon Finance, including the user interface, visual design elements, communication channels, and governance protocols, will be seamlessly integrated under the Aevo brand umbrella. This unified approach is expected to maximize the products&#8217; success and growth while fostering confidence and alignment among long-term token holders.</p>



<p>The plan encompasses two significant changes: first, positioning Aevo as the singular brand encompassing both Ribbon Finance&#8217;s offerings and Aevo&#8217;s structured products on its exchange, and second, initiating the transition from Ribbonomics to AEVO, the novel token that will govern the Aevo protocol and chain on the Ethereum mainnet. Detailed discussions on the new AEVO tokenomics will be presented in a subsequent proposal.</p>



<p>Practically, the merger will involve strategic steps, including migrating Ribbon Finance from its existing domain (app.ribbon.finance) to Aevo&#8217;s strategies platform (strategies.aevo.xyz). Additionally, Aevo&#8217;s visual identity will be implemented across Ribbon&#8217;s structured products, and the Aevo brand will replace Ribbon Finance on all internal and external sites, communication channels, and labels.</p>



<p>With the resounding approval from the community, the merger between Ribbon Finance and Aevo is set to redefine the DeFi landscape. Aevo&#8217;s ambition to be the leading on-chain derivatives platform, along with the integration of Ribbon&#8217;s offerings, holds the promise of opening new horizons for decentralized finance, offering a more seamless and comprehensive trading experience to users worldwide.</p>

<p>Derivatives are financial instruments or contracts that derive their value from an underlying asset. The underlying asset can be any instrument that has a value, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, or market indices. Derivatives can be used for various purposes, such as hedging against risks, speculation, and arbitrage.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1802.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="610" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1802-1024x610.png" alt="What is Derivatives?" class="wp-image-205742" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1802-1024x610.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1802-300x179.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1802-768x458.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1802-750x447.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1802.png 1118w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="What is Derivatives? 18"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What Is a Derivative?</h2>



<p>The term derivative refers to a financial contract whose value is derived from an underlying asset, group of assets, or benchmark. This underlying asset can be anything from stocks to commodities, making derivatives a versatile tool for traders and investors. Essentially, a derivative is a contract that derives its value from the performance of an underlying asset. It&#8217;s important to note that derivatives are not the asset themselves, but rather a contract that gives the holder the right or obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a specific time and price.</p>



<p>These contracts can be used to trade any number of assets and carry their own risks, which vary depending on the type of derivative. For example, options give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a set price and time. Futures contracts, on the other hand, obligate the buyer and seller to carry out the transaction at a specific price and time in the future.</p>



<p>Prices for derivatives derive from fluctuations in the underlying asset. This means that the value of the derivative is derived from the performance of the asset it&#8217;s based on. Since the underlying asset can vary, the price of the derivative can fluctuate as well. These financial securities are commonly used to access certain markets and may be traded to hedge against risk. Derivatives can be used to either mitigate risk (hedging) or assume risk with the expectation of commensurate reward (speculation).</p>



<p>Derivatives can move risk (and the accompanying rewards) from the risk-averse to the risk seekers. Despite being considered complex financial instruments, derivatives have become increasingly popular in recent years, with the global derivatives market now worth trillions of dollars. Derivatives are used by investors and traders to manage risk, speculate on market movements, and gain exposure to certain assets or markets. They are also used by financial institutions to manage their own risk exposure.</p>



<p>Derivatives are a powerful financial tool that can be used for a variety of purposes. They allow traders and investors to gain exposure to markets and assets they might not otherwise have access to, while also managing risk and maximizing potential returns. However, it&#8217;s important to remember that derivatives are complex financial instruments that come with their own set of risks. As such, it&#8217;s important to have a solid understanding of how derivatives work before investing in them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Understanding Derivatives</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1803.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="634" height="788" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1803.png" alt="What is Derivatives?" class="wp-image-205743" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1803.png 634w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1803-241x300.png 241w" sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" title="What is Derivatives? 19"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A derivative is a financial instrument that holds a complex structure between two or more parties. Derivatives grant traders access to specific markets and assets that they otherwise might not be able to trade in. These types of securities are commonly used by advanced investors. The underlying assets of derivatives include stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, and market indexes, and their values are based on price changes in these assets.</p>



<p>There are various ways in which derivatives can be utilized. One such way is to hedge a position, which is essentially a strategy to mitigate risk by taking an offsetting position in a related security. Derivatives can also be used to speculate on the directional movement of the underlying asset or to give leverage to holdings. These securities are typically traded on exchanges or Over-The-Counter (OTC) and are commonly purchased through brokerages. One of the world&#8217;s largest derivatives exchanges is the <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cmegroup.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</a> (CME).</p>



<p>It is important to note that when companies hedge, they are not speculating on the price of the commodity. Rather, the hedge is a way for each party to manage risk. Each party has its own profit or margin built into the price, and the hedge helps to protect those profits from being eliminated by market moves in the price of the commodity.</p>



<p>There is an increased risk of counterparty risk associated with OTC-traded derivatives. Counterparty risk refers to the danger that one of the parties involved in the transaction might default. These contracts trade between two private parties and are unregulated. To hedge this risk, the investor could purchase a currency derivative to lock in a specific exchange rate. Derivatives that can be used to hedge this kind of risk include currency futures and currency swaps. Additionally, it is important to note that over-the-counter derivatives can be customized to fit the specific needs of the parties involved, making them more complex than exchange-traded derivatives.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Special Considerations</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1804.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="788" height="510" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1804.png" alt="What is Derivatives?" class="wp-image-205745" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1804.png 788w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1804-300x194.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1804-768x497.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1804-750x485.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" title="What is Derivatives? 20"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Derivatives are complex financial instruments that are used to manage risk, speculate on price movements, and gain exposure to various asset classes. They were originally used to ensure balanced exchange rates for internationally traded goods, providing a system to account for the differing values of national currencies.</p>



<p>However, as the financial markets have evolved, derivatives have become increasingly popular among investors and speculators. For example, assume that a European investor has investment accounts that are all denominated in euros (EUR). If they purchase shares of a U.S. company through a U.S. exchange using U.S. dollars (USD), they become exposed to&nbsp;exchange rate risk&nbsp;while holding that stock. Exchange rate risk is the threat that the value of the Euro will increase in relation to the USD. If this happens, any profits the investor realizes upon selling the stock become less valuable when they are converted into Euros.</p>



<p>To mitigate this risk, the investor can use derivatives. For instance, a&nbsp;speculator&nbsp;who expects the Euro to appreciate versus the dollar could profit by using a derivative that rises in value with the Euro. Derivatives are becoming increasingly popular among investors because they provide a way to speculate on the price movement of an underlying asset without owning it. This allows investors to take advantage of market opportunities without having to invest in a holding or&nbsp;portfolio&nbsp;presence in the underlying asset.</p>



<p>Derivatives come in a variety of forms, including options, futures, swaps, and forwards. Each type of derivative has its own unique characteristics and can be used to achieve different investment objectives. For example, futures contracts are commonly used to hedge against price fluctuations in commodities, while options contracts can be used to speculate on the price movements of individual stocks or entire markets.</p>



<p>Despite their benefits, derivatives can be complex and risky. They require a high level of understanding and expertise to use effectively. As such, it&#8217;s important for investors and speculators to carefully consider their investment objectives and risk tolerance before using derivatives.</p>



<p>Derivatives have become an important tool for investors looking to diversify their portfolios and manage their risk exposure. By providing a way to speculate on the price movements of underlying assets without owning them, derivatives offer investors a way to take advantage of market opportunities and achieve their investment goals.</p>

<p>Derivatives have become an essential part of the modern financial system, and their use has grown significantly over the years. A derivative is a financial instrument whose value is derived from an underlying asset, such as a stock, bond, or commodity. Derivatives can be used for various purposes, including risk management, speculation, and leveraging a position.</p>



<p>The derivatives market is vast and continues to evolve, offering a wide range of products to fit nearly any need or risk tolerance. In addition to traditional derivatives, there are also specialized derivatives based on weather data, such as rainfall or temperature. These derivatives are used in industries such as agriculture or energy, where weather conditions can have a significant impact on business operations and revenues.</p>



<p>The derivatives market has two main classes of products: &#8220;lock&#8221; and &#8220;option.&#8221; Lock products, such as futures, forwards, or swaps, bind the respective parties from the outset to the agreed-upon terms over the life of the contract. On the other hand, option products, such as stock options, provide the holder with the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset or security at a specific price on or before the option&#8217;s expiration date.</p>



<p>Futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a specific asset at a predetermined price and date in the future. Forward contracts are similar to futures contracts but are not standardized and are traded over-the-counter. Swaps are agreements to exchange cash flows based on different variables, such as interest rates or currencies. Options contracts provide the buyer with the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a specific price, but not the obligation to do so.</p>



<p>Derivatives play a crucial role in modern finance, but their complexity and risk have also led to controversies. The 2008 financial crisis, for instance, was partly caused by the widespread use of complex derivatives, such as mortgage-backed securities, that were poorly understood and mispriced.</p>



<p>Despite their challenges, derivatives remain an important tool for investors and businesses to manage their risks and achieve their financial objectives. The derivatives market will continue to evolve, and new products will emerge to meet the changing needs of market participants.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Futures</strong></h3>



<p>A futures contract is a standardized agreement between two parties to purchase and deliver an asset at an agreed-upon price on a future date. The use of futures contracts is widespread in various industries, including agriculture, energy, and finance. For instance, farmers use futures contracts to sell their crops before they even grow. By doing so, they can lock in a price for their crops and eliminate the risk of price fluctuations. Similarly, oil companies use futures contracts to hedge against the risk of falling oil prices.</p>



<p>In a futures contract, the buyer and the seller are both obligated to fulfill their commitment to buy or sell the underlying asset at the agreed-upon price when the contract expires. Futures contracts provide traders with an opportunity to hedge their risk or speculate on the price of an underlying asset. A trader who wants to hedge their risk can take a long position in a futures contract, which means they agree to buy the underlying asset at the future date. On the other hand, a trader who wants to speculate on the price of an underlying asset can take a short position in a futures contract, which means they agree to sell the underlying asset at the future date.</p>



<p>To illustrate, suppose an investor wants to hedge against the risk of rising oil prices. The investor can buy an oil futures contract that expires in the future at a fixed price. If the price of oil rises in the future, the investor can still buy oil at the agreed-upon price. However, if the price of oil falls, the investor loses money on the futures contract, but gains money on the actual purchase of oil.</p>



<p>Conversely, a speculator may take a position in a futures contract with the opposite view of the market. For example, a speculator may take a long position in a futures contract for oil if they believe that the price of oil will rise in the future. If the price of oil increases as predicted, the speculator can sell the futures contract for a profit. However, if the price of oil falls, the speculator loses money on the futures contract.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cash Settlements of Futures</strong></h3>



<p>Not all futures contracts are settled at expiration by delivering the underlying asset. If both parties in a futures contract are speculating investors or traders, it is unlikely that either of them would want to make arrangements for the delivery of a large number of barrels of crude oil, for instance. In such cases, speculators can easily end their obligation to purchase or deliver the underlying commodity by closing (unwinding) their contract before expiration with an offsetting contract.</p>



<p>On the other hand, it is important to note that many derivatives are cash-settled rather than physically settled. This implies that the gain or loss in the trade is simply an accounting cash flow to the trader&#8217;s brokerage account. It is worth mentioning that futures contracts that are cash-settled include many interest rate futures, stock index futures, and more unusual instruments such as volatility futures or weather futures. Given the wide range of derivatives that are cash-settled, it is essential for traders and investors to understand the differences between cash-settled and physically settled contracts, as well as the implications of each type of contract on their overall trading strategy and risk management approach.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Forwards</strong></h3>



<p>Forward contracts are agreements between two parties to buy or sell an asset on an agreed-upon future date at an agreed-upon price. Unlike futures, forward contracts are not traded on an exchange, but rather over-the-counter between two parties. One of the benefits of forward contracts is that the parties can customize the terms, size, and settlement process to fit their specific needs, which can be particularly valuable for unique or complex transactions.</p>



<p>However, one of the downsides of forward contracts is that they carry a greater degree of counterparty risk for both parties. Counterparty risk refers to the risk that one of the parties in the contract may not be able to meet its obligations under the agreement. This can happen if, for example, one of the parties becomes insolvent. If this occurs, the other party may have no recourse and could lose the value of its position.</p>



<p>To mitigate this risk, parties in a forward contract can offset their position with other counterparties. However, this can also increase the potential for counterparty risks as more traders become involved in the same contract. Therefore, it&#8217;s important for parties entering into forward contracts to carefully consider the potential counterparty risks and take appropriate steps to manage them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Swaps</strong></h3>



<p>Swaps are a popular type of derivative that enables the exchange of cash flows between two parties. This exchange can help companies manage risks and take advantage of opportunities in the financial market.</p>



<p>For instance, if a company borrows $1,000,000 at a variable interest rate of 6%, they may worry about rising interest rates that could increase the costs of the loan or discourage lenders from offering more credit. To mitigate this risk, the company could engage in an interest rate swap with another company, such as Company QRS. In this case, Company QRS agrees to exchange the variable-rate loan payments with fixed-rate loan payments of 7%. That is, XYZ will pay 7% to QRS on its $1,000,000 principal, and QRS will pay XYZ 6% interest on the same principal. At the beginning of the swap,&nbsp;XYZ will just pay QRS the 1 percentage-point difference between the two&nbsp;swap rates.</p>



<p>Swaps can also be used to manage currency-exchange rate risk or the risk of default on a loan or cash flows from other business activities. For instance, if a company deals with overseas clients, they may need to manage the risks involved in currency exchange rates, which might fluctuate and lead to unexpected losses. Similarly, if a company has a large loan that it fears may default, it can use a credit-default swap as insurance against the risk of default.</p>



<p>While swaps can be useful tools for managing risks, they can also be risky themselves. Swaps related to the cash flows and potential defaults of mortgage bonds, for example, were a key factor in the&nbsp;credit crisis&nbsp;of 2008. Before engaging in swaps or other derivatives, companies should carefully evaluate the risks and consult with financial professionals to ensure that they understand the potential impacts.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Options</strong></h3>



<p>An&nbsp;options contract&nbsp;is a type of financial instrument that allows two parties to agree to buy or sell an asset at a specific price on a predetermined future date. While options are similar to futures contracts, one key difference is that the buyer of an option is not obligated to follow through with the purchase or sale of the asset. This means that an option provides an opportunity but not an obligation, unlike futures contracts.</p>



<p>Options can be used to hedge or speculate on the price of an underlying asset. For example, imagine an investor owns 100 shares of a stock currently valued at $50 per share. While they believe the stock&#8217;s value will rise in the future, they&#8217;re also concerned about potential risks. To hedge their position, the investor could buy a put option that gives them the right to sell 100 shares of the stock for $50 per share until a specific date in the future known as the&nbsp;expiration date.</p>



<p>If the stock&#8217;s value falls to $40 per share by the expiration date and the put option buyer decides to exercise their option, they can sell the stock for the original strike price of $50 per share. If the put option cost the investor $200 to purchase, they will have only lost the cost of the option because the strike price was equal to the price of the stock when they originally bought the put. This strategy is known as a&nbsp;protective put&nbsp;because it helps mitigate the stock&#8217;s downside risk.</p>



<p>Now, let&#8217;s consider a different scenario. Imagine an investor doesn&#8217;t own a stock currently valued at $50 per share but believes its value will rise over the next month. In this case, the investor could buy a call option that gives them the right to buy the stock for $50 before or at expiration. Assume that this call option costs $200, and the stock rises to $60 before expiration. The buyer can now exercise their option and buy a stock worth $60 per share for the $50 strike price, resulting in an initial profit of $10 per share. Since a call option represents 100 shares, the real profit is $1,000, less the cost of the option—the&nbsp;premium—and any brokerage commission fees.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that in both examples, the sellers of the options are obligated to fulfill their side of the contract if the buyers choose to exercise the contract. However, if the stock&#8217;s price is above the strike price at expiration, the put option will be worthless, and the seller (the option writer) gets to keep the premium as the option expires. Conversely, if the stock&#8217;s price is below the strike price at expiration, the call option will be worthless, and the call seller will keep the premium. In conclusion, options contracts can be a useful tool for investors to manage risks and potentially profit from fluctuations in asset prices.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Derivatives are financial instruments or contracts whose value is derived from an underlying asset. These assets can include stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, or market indices. Derivatives are used for various purposes, such as hedging against risks, speculation on price movements, and arbitrage opportunities.</p>



<p>Common types of derivatives include futures contracts, options contracts, forwards contracts, and swaps. Futures and forwards are agreements to buy or sell an asset at a specified price on a future date. Options provide the holder with the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Swaps involve the exchange of financial instruments or cash flows based on specified conditions.</p>



<p>Derivatives serve as essential tools in financial markets, allowing investors and businesses to manage risk, increase liquidity, and gain insights into price movements. However, they also come with a higher level of risk and complexity, necessitating a thorough understanding and prudent management when using them in investment strategies.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Island Pay launches CiNKO, a digital wallet using Circle&#8217;s USDC stablecoin, aiming to revolutionize remittances in Latin America and the Caribbean.</em></li>



<li><em>CiNKO allows users in over 30 countries to fund prepaid cards, make peer-to-peer payments, and transact with merchants without needing a bank account.</em></li>



<li><em>The USDC stablecoin&#8217;s stability and direct parity with the US dollar make CiNKO an attractive option, potentially reducing remittance costs by 80%.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Migrants in Latin America and the Caribbean are witnessing a groundbreaking solution to traditional remittances as Island Pay unveils its latest digital wallet, CiNKO, in partnership with Circle&#8217;s USDC stablecoin, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-25/bahamas-payment-platform-island-pay-is-latest-to-offer-crypto-remittance#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>.</strong></h5>

<p>Despite the high costs and challenges associated with conventional money transfers, remittances from immigrants to their families and friends continue to surge at unprecedented rates.</p>



<p>The adoption of cryptocurrencies for remittances in regions with a large unbanked population, like Latin America, has faced skepticism in the past, leaving cash as the prevailing choice for money transfers. However, Island Pay&#8217;s innovative foray with CiNKO is poised to disrupt the status quo.</p>



<p>CiNKO, the new digital wallet, will be accessible in over 30 countries, offering users the convenience of funding prepaid cards, engaging in merchant transactions, and making peer-to-peer payments, even without a bank account. The primary currency of this groundbreaking wallet is Circle&#8217;s USDC stablecoin, ensuring stability and reliability in comparison to the volatile nature of traditional cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Richard Douglas, the Chief Executive Officer of Island Pay, expressed the company&#8217;s commitment to advancing financial inclusion in the region. He emphasized that CiNKO aims to enhance financial experiences for both banked and unbanked populations across Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>



<p>Island Pay is not alone in its venture. The market has seen several crypto wallets and cross-border payment systems in existence, each striving to meet the growing demand for more efficient remittance options.</p>



<p>Circle&#8217;s collaboration with MoneyGram International Inc. and Stellar, a network for storing and moving money, is just one example of such a partnership. Additionally, Bitso, based in Mexico, has joined forces with Stellar to enable businesses in Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico to transact in USDC. Western Union Co. has also recognized the increased competition from the crypto space and has been deploying its own digital payment platforms.</p>



<p>The CiNKO wallet is part of a larger movement to introduce stablecoins and decentralized finance protocols in Latin America. Circle&#8217;s Chief Business Officer, Kash Razzaghi, highlighted a recent study that estimated the technology&#8217;s potential to reduce remittance costs by an impressive 80%. Although CiNKO users are charged a &#8220;gas fee&#8221; depending on the blockchain used for transactions, receiving USDC in CiNKO wallets is fee-free.</p>

<p>The USDC-backed currency&#8217;s stability and direct one-to-one parity with the US dollar make it an attractive option for remittances, eliminating the unpredictability often associated with traditional cryptocurrencies. Moreover, a flourishing ecosystem of merchants already accepts USDC, ensuring immediate usability for CiNKO&#8217;s users.</p>



<p>CiNKO, designed for both Android and Apple iPhone users, has ambitious plans to onboard 100,000 users, primarily in Central and South America, by next year. The fintech company Island Pay initially honed its digital payment services in the Caribbean and played a pioneering role in collaborating with the Bahamas&#8217; Sand Dollar, the nation&#8217;s central bank digital currency launched in 2021.</p>



<p>While Island Pay&#8217;s focus is currently on Latin America, Douglas affirmed the company&#8217;s readiness to expand this revolutionary technology to other regions in the future.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the advent of CiNKO and the USDC stablecoin marks a pivotal moment in the remittance landscape for Latin America and the Caribbean. With its secure, cost-effective, and user-friendly approach, CiNKO has the potential to empower millions of unbanked individuals in the region and pave the way for a more inclusive financial future.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a significant shift as Bitcoin retreats below $30,000. The once-impressive lead that digital assets held over stocks in 2023 is now cracking. The year-to-date climb in the top 100 digital tokens has cooled to just 46%, not much higher than the 41% jump in the Nasdaq 100 Index of tech stocks. This growth in the equity measure is attributed to hype over artificial intelligence products.</p>



<p>Digital assets received a boost from a court setback for a regulatory crackdown in the US and optimism that the country might allow spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. However, with those drivers now gone, investors are assessing how the expected Federal Reserve interest-rate hike this week may affect markets.</p>



<p>According to Caroline Mauron, co-founder of digital-asset derivatives liquidity provider OrBit Markets, &#8220;the rally has lost momentum following the initial excitement sparked by the ETF news, and there are no other visible catalysts on the horizon.&#8221; She adds that downside risk &#8220;should be limited as the Fed is near the end of the current rate-hiking cycle, which should support risk assets including crypto.&#8221;</p>



<p>Some chart patterns signal caution. Bitcoin&#8217;s 20-week Bollinger bandwidth has shrunk to the narrowest in seven years, suggesting intense moves in the largest digital asset, potentially on the way down if key thresholds give way. The Bollinger study is a way of analyzing volatility.</p>



<p>According to Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG Australia Pty, &#8220;Bitcoin’s drop should extend toward $26,000/$25,000 before finding support.&#8221; In the meantime, the token fell 3.3% on Monday and was steady at about $29,150 as of this writing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance is to launch a compliant platform in Japan in August.</em></li>



<li><em>Acquisition of Sakura Exchange BitCoin marks Binance&#8217;s entry into the East Asian market.</em></li>



<li><em>Meanwhile, Binance.US faces wash trading scrutiny amid global regulatory challenges.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In an announcement made via video at a conference in Tokyo on Tuesday, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) revealed that the cryptocurrency exchange giant is all set to introduce its comprehensive services on a new platform tailored specifically for Japan. The launch is scheduled for August this year, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-21/s-p-500-s-great-bear-market-unwinding-is-happening-at-a-frenetic-clip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1795.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="600" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1795.png" alt="Binance Unveils Compliant Japan New Platform Amidst Global Expansion" class="wp-image-205720" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1795.png 1000w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1795-300x180.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1795-768x461.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1795-750x450.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Binance Unveils Compliant Japan New Platform Amidst Global Expansion 26"></a></figure></div>


<p>This development follows Binance&#8217;s acquisition of Sakura Exchange BitCoin (SEBC), a cryptocurrency exchange service provider based in Japan, in November of the previous year. The <a href="https://coincu.com/147732-binance-acquired-100-of-sakura-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquisition</a> was a strategic move to establish its presence in the Japanese market while adhering to the regulations set forth by the Japan Financial Services Agency (JFSA). However, the terms of the deal were not publicly disclosed.</p>



<p>Notably, the move marks a significant milestone for Binance, as it secures the exchange&#8217;s first license in East Asia through SEBC&#8217;s existing registration with the JFSA.</p>



<p>In line with the company&#8217;s commitment to compliance, the exchange officially <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/land/japan-may-notice-en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> in May that it was developing a platform specifically designed to cater to the Japanese market while ensuring full adherence to local rules and regulations. As part of this initiative, it announced that it would discontinue its existing global platform&#8217;s services for Japanese residents, effective from November 30. Users currently operating on the global platform will be given the option to transition to the new local platform. To facilitate the migration process, Binance will introduce a new identity verification system after August 1.</p>

<p>The SEBC platform, registered with the JFSA, offers not only brokerage services but also consulting services to its customers. Presently, SEBC supports trading in 11 pairs, including popular cryptocurrencies like BTC/JPY, ETH/JPY, BCH/JPY, XRP/JPY, LTC/JPY, ETC/JPY, XEM/JPY, MONA/JPY, ADA/JPY, XYM/JPY, and COT/JPY.</p>



<p>Despite Binance&#8217;s expansion into Japan and efforts to comply with local regulations, the exchange is no stranger to regulatory scrutiny globally. Binance.US, a separate entity under the Binance brand, has been under intense regulatory investigation in various jurisdictions.</p>



<p>Recently, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://coincu.com/205506-binance-grapples-with-wash-trading-accusations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that some of Binance.US&#8217;s initial cryptocurrency trades involved wash trading, wherein trades are conducted internally to manipulate trading volumes. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been investigating allegations of wash trading against the company. The SEC claims that the US subsidiary inflated trading volumes through accounts linked to <a href="https://coincu.com/205581-binance-cz-file-a-petition-dismiss-cftcs-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Changpeng Zhao</a>, such as Sigma Chain. It is alleged that wash trading between Sigma Chain accounts and executive accounts accounted for a significant portion of one cryptocurrency&#8217;s trading volume.</p>

<p>The SEC also raised concerns about the lack of trading surveillance on Binance.US until at least February 2022. Memos between executives revealed that no action would be taken against self-trading without regulatory pressure.</p>



<p>Additionally, a 2019 study cited by the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> showed that wash trading accounted for over 46% of its global trading volume during the surveyed period, though the report did not include data on Binance&#8217;s U.S. arm due to its ongoing launch.</p>



<p>As the exchange prepares to embark on its new venture in Japan, the exchange will continue to address regulatory challenges in various jurisdictions while ensuring compliance with local laws. The launch of the dedicated platform for Japanese users is a significant step towards strengthening Binance&#8217;s presence in the region and providing enhanced services to its growing user base in Japan.</p>
