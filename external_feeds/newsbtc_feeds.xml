					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency network whose coin, BTC, is the most valuable, seems to have been invaded by an unknown miner. And the community has the new guest on their radar. Unknown Miner Dominates  In the last few hours, the entity has not only plugged into the network but has proceeded to mine several blocks, getting rewarded with the precious 6.25 BTC.  What’s intriguing is that trackers cannot pick out the true identity of the miner who has usurped the established pools such as Binance Pool, AntPool, and even giant mining farms like Foundry USA.  Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Over $40 Billion After Shanghai Upgrade: What It Means For ETH For the last day, the miner has verified over 10 Bitcoin blocks, earning over 65 BTC worth over $1.7 million at spot rates. While there is a chance that a “big” player is new to Bitcoin and has plugged in possibly thousands of mining rigs to stay competitive and verify blocks successfully, it is almost likely that the “unknown” entity is a mining pool. In proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin, a group of miners, that is, retail individuals operating mining nodes, can join hands and merge their computing power called hash rate in “pools.” Whenever they do this, they stand a chance of verifying a block of BTC transactions.  In return, the network automatically rewards them with not only the block rewards of 6.25 BTC but also fees associated with the block. Although rare, fees accumulated in a block may be over 50% of the block reward distributed from the protocol level.  With the Bitcoin hash rate constantly rising and more miners pouring in, mining pools dominate. However, several pools are tailored to meet the needs of various miners. Applicable fees, reliability, and the size of their hash rate are some considerations that may also affect reputation. However, over the years, some of the biggest include AntPool and ViaBTC. Is This F2Pool? It is speculated that the “unknown” entity is F2Pool. The error is displayed on trackers because “Mempool’s attribution logic is just missing them.”  Whether this will also turn out to be true or false will later be verified.  This is because attribution &#8220;depends on who the miner says they are. It’d be easy to impersonate another pool and not guaranteed that that pool would notice and deny it was them”. Related Reading: Crypto Market Alert: Tether Market Cap Fuel Hopes For Major Rally F2Pool is one of the oldest and largest mining pools in the world.  According to data from mempool.space, the pool controls 8.19% of the total Bitcoin hash rate.  While it is popular, recent data shows there could have been a hitch in the attribution logic. Trackers show that the last time F2Pool mined was in late May 24. Feature Image From Canva, Chart From TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum started the week with a promising performance, experiencing a gain of over 3%. However, the bullish momentum was short-lived as the altcoin failed to sustain its position above a key resistance level. Within the past 24 hours, ETH&#8217;s market value has declined by nearly 3%. Throughout the week, the ETH price has shown limited progress, with the bears dominating the price movement. The altcoin&#8217;s technical outlook indicates a decline in buying strength, accompanied by low demand and accumulation on the daily chart. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Over $40 Billion After Shanghai Upgrade: What It Means For ETH To prevent further strengthening of the bears, it is crucial for Ethereum to surpass its immediate resistance in the upcoming trading sessions. Failure to do so may lead to additional pressure from sellers, potentially causing Ethereum to breach its immediate support level and experience a significant loss in value during future trading sessions. Additionally, the fall in the ETH market capitalization suggests an increase in selling strength, as observed on the daily chart. Ethereum Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, the trading price of ETH was $1790. Despite attempting to trade within the $1800 price range, the altcoin encountered selling pressure, resulting in its depreciation. The current overhead resistance for Ethereum is $1810. If the altcoin surpasses this resistance level, it has the potential to trigger a rally in its price. On the other hand, if the present price level experiences a decline, Ethereum is likely to decline further to $1750 before eventually reaching the $1700 price mark. The recent session saw a decrease in the volume of Ethereum traded, indicated by the red colour, indicating a weak buying strength. Technical Analysis Throughout this month, Ethereum experienced a decline in demand, resulting in reduced buying strength. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) dropped below the midpoint line, suggesting a decrease in demand and an increase in selling pressure on the chart. Additionally, the price of Ethereum fell below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA), indicating that sellers were dominating the market&#8217;s price momentum. Given that Bitcoin&#8217;s price movement remains uncertain, several altcoins, including Ethereum, have followed a similar price trajectory. However, if Ethereum gains broader market strength, there is a possibility that demand could return, causing ETH to surpass the 20-SMA line and potentially climb higher. Due to the absence of demand, ETH did not exhibit significant buy signals. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), a tool used to indicate price momentum and potential trend reversals, showed small green histograms that do not provide conclusive buy signals at this point. The Bollinger Bands, which measure price volatility and potential fluctuations, have maintained a parallel shape. However, they displayed slight convergence, suggesting that ETH may trade within a relatively stable range without substantial price fluctuations.

<p>Due to the absence of demand, ETH did not exhibit significant buy signals. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), a tool used to indicate price momentum and potential trend reversals, showed small green histograms that do not provide conclusive buy signals at this point.</p>
<p>The Bollinger Bands, which measure price volatility and potential fluctuations, have maintained a parallel shape. However, they displayed slight convergence, suggesting that ETH may trade within a relatively stable range without substantial price fluctuations.</p>

<p>To reclaim the $1800 price level, it is crucial for buyers to re-enter the market at the current price level. Their participation is essential for Ethereum to regain strength and potentially push the price higher.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) has failed to hold onto gains over the past few weeks, giving back nearly all price increases shortly after they are made. According to crypto analyst and trader Daan Foppen, this phenomenon can be attributed to the outsized influence of futures markets on Bitcoin’s price action. Foppen notes that Bitcoin’s spot market, where investors buy and sell actual BTC, has been mainly selling recently, as evidenced by the downtrend in spot market prices. In contrast, moves upward in Bitcoin’s price have been driven primarily by activity in futures markets, where traders speculate on the future price of BTC using leverage. Related Reading: Crypto Market Alert: Tether Market Cap Fuel Hopes For Major Rally Bitcoin&#8217;s Downward Spiral Continues “The moves that are made are mostly made with borrowed money, and these kinds of things are not sustainable for a market,” says Foppen. Whether stablecoin-margined or coin-margined, futures markets have been the driving force behind short-term price impulses in Bitcoin recently. However, the buying power used to move prices upward ultimately evaporates, leading to gains to be given back. When futures dominate trading, the underlying spot market struggles to keep up. Price gains outpace actual buy demand for Bitcoin, leaving the market susceptible to abrupt reversals once futures buying power subsidies. This concept has been displayed clearly on Bitcoin price charts over the past month, with initial price spikes evaporating quickly. Furthermore, according to Daan Foppen, recent volatility and price reversals in Bitcoin have been driven largely by leveraged trading and liquidations in futures markets. Foppen argues that the cryptocurrency’s price action over the past several weeks has been characterized by “impulsive moves” upward and downward that seem forceful but lack strength and sustainability. For example, Bitcoin’s move to $27,400 on May 23 was mainly fueled by short liquidations, as overleveraged short positions were wiped out, creating a “snowball effect” upward. The subsequent sharp drop was similarly driven by the liquidation of long positions that had opened during the consolidation period with the expectation of higher prices. BTC’s Increased Leveraged Positions Moreover, Foppen points out that interest in Bitcoin futures has risen, indicating increased leveraged trading activity. However, it is difficult to determine whether new positions are predominantly short or long. Funding rates, which indicate whether longs or shorts are paying interest to balance the market, have been slightly positive recently but remain around the baseline. Still, Foppen believes the ingredients are in place for “a deeper flush downwards” in Bitcoin’s price due to the likelihood that recently opened positions are mainly longs. “What you shouldn&#8217;t do now is blindly click the short button,” he warns.  With highly leveraged and unstable dynamics currently driving Bitcoin’s price action, Foppen cautions that these are “very shaky conditions,” protecting one’s capital should be the top priority for traders. “What you should especially not do is let yourself get chopped up in this market,” he says.  Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Over $40 Billion After Shanghai Upgrade: What It Means For ETH As of this writing, BTC is trading at $26,200, down over 3% in the last 24 hours. However, the largest cryptocurrency in the market may potentially stop its potential continuation of the downtrend at the 200-day Moving Average placed at $24,900, which may serve as a threshold for bulls.  Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Despite lackluster trade volume and price movements in the cryptocurrency market, Tether&#8217;s market cap is rising, nearing its all-time high of $82.9 billion. Tether, also known as USDT, is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, making its value more stable than other cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sell-Side Risk Ratio Nears All-Time Lows, Big Move Soon? USDT&#8217;s Explosive Growth The question remains: why is Tether&#8217;s market cap increasing despite the lack of strong movements in the cryptocurrency market?  According to the research firm Kaiko, one theory is that the imminent end of BUSD, another stablecoin, and Circle’s USDC March de-pegging event caused traders to rotate into USDT. However, data does not show a significant increase in USDT market share relative to other stablecoins in recent months. Another possible reason for Tether&#8217;s market cap increase is Binance&#8217;s promotion of TUSD as an alternative to BUSD. This move may have caused traders to move away from BUSD and towards other stablecoins, including USDT. On decentralized exchanges (DEXs), USDT accounts for just 20% of non-stablecoin swap volume, an increase since the start of the year, but not enough to explain the more than $15 billion increase in market cap over the same period. While the March banking crisis saw a large rotation of capital into USDT, the actual usage of the stablecoin on both centralized and decentralized exchanges suggests that the increase in market cap is “inordinate”, according to Kaiko. Furthermore, one possible explanation for Tether&#8217;s climbing market cap could involve the Tron network. Most of all, USDT, or $46 billion worth, are issued on Tron, compared to just $36 billion on Ethereum. Despite Tron&#8217;s minimal decentralized finance (DeFi) activity and the lack of support from major exchanges like Coinbase, offshore exchanges such as Binance and OKX possess the largest USDT balances on Tron. This suggests that market makers and whales prefer Tron for its low transaction fees. In contrast to Tether&#8217;s market cap, USDC&#8217;s market cap correlates with trade volume. As USDC volume grows, the market cap increases similarly, and vice versa. USDT&#8217;s market cap, however, has little correlation with trade volume, which is questionable given that the primary use case for this stablecoin is trading. Large Tether Movements Raise Questions About Market Stability According to Whale Alert on Twitter, there have been several large movements of Tether&#8217;s stablecoin, USDT, in the cryptocurrency market in the past three hours. These movements suggest a significant transfer of funds, with implications for the broader market. First, an unknown wallet transferred 50 million USDT, or $50 million, to Bitfinex, a popular cryptocurrency exchange. This was followed by Kraken, another leading exchange, transferring 60 million USDT, or $60 million, to Bitfinex. Lastly, Tether Treasury, the issuer of USDT, transferred 60 million USDT to Bitfinex. Additionally, 50 million USDT was transferred from JustLendDAO to an unknown wallet. The movements of these large sums of money suggest that significant trading or investment activity may occur on Bitfinex, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. These transfers may be related to a large purchase of cryptocurrency or a significant investment by a hedge fund or institutional investor. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Over $40 Billion After Shanghai Upgrade: What It Means For ETH Overall, the implications of these movements for the broader cryptocurrency market remain uncertain. However, given the size of the Tether transfers, it is possible that they could impact the market&#8217;s overall stability and could lead to a surge or decline in cryptocurrency prices.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows the Bitcoin sell-side risk ratio has approached all-time lows recently, a sign that a big move could be coming for the coin. Bitcoin Sell-Side Risk Ratio Has Observed A Plunge Recently As pointed out by the lead on-chain analyst at Glassnode in a Tweet, BTC sellers may have become exhausted recently. The &#8220;sell-side risk ratio&#8221; is an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of all profits and losses being realized in the Bitcoin market and the realized cap. The &#8220;realized cap&#8221; here refers to the capitalization model for Bitcoin that calculates a sort of &#8220;true&#8221; value for the cryptocurrency by assuming that each coin in the supply is not worth the same as the current spot price, but the price at which it was last moved. As the profits and losses being harvested in the market are nothing but a measure of the selling pressure in the market, this indicator tells us how the selling pressure (or the sell-side risk) looks like relative to the value of the cryptocurrency (the realized cap). When the value of this indicator is high, it means the investors are participating in a high amount of profit/loss realization right now. Such a market is usually high risk, as the price tends to be more volatile during periods with these values. On the other hand, low values imply the holders are reluctant to sell currently. These conditions generally occur when the market has calmed down and accumulation tends to take place in such periods. Related Reading: Litecoin’s MVRV Has Surged, Why This Is Bearish Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin sell-side risk ratio over the history of the cryptocurrency: Looks like the value of the metric has observed a decline in recent days &#124; Source: @_Checkmatey_ on Twitter As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin sell-side risk ratio has seen a sharp plunge recently, a sign that there is little profit or loss realization going in the market right now. The indicator is now below the &#8220;low value realization&#8221; line that the analytics firm has defined (colored in red in the chart). Historically, whenever the metric has plunged into this zone, the market has built up towards a sizeable move in the price.

Just back in March of this year, the indicator had shown this trend, but the cryptocurrency had followed up with a sharp correction. Breaks into the high value realization zone (that is, the condition where there is a large amount of selling going on), though, have generally always been bearish for Bitcoin. As the indicator has once again dipped into the low value realization area, it&#8217;s possible that a large move in the price may follow soon. Although it&#8217;s uncertain which direction exactly this volatility might go. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,100, down 2% in the last week.

					<description><![CDATA[The Ethereum (ETH) network has reached a significant milestone following the highly-anticipated Shanghai upgrade, as staking activity soars to new heights. According to crypto analytics platform Cryptorank, the Ethereum deposit contract balance has exceeded $40 billion, with users depositing over 4.4 million ETH since April 12 (the date of the Shanghai upgrade launch). This surge in staking activity marks a pivotal moment for ETH and its transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. Staking Frenzy: A Post-Upgrade Milestone The recent data shared by CryptoRank reveals that the ETH deposit contract balance on May 23 stood at 22.6 million ETH, equivalent to $41.1 billion. This substantial increase in deposits can be attributed to the introduction of the latest feature allowing validators to withdraw their staked tokens. The Ethereum network has experienced a surge in interest, with users seizing the opportunity to participate in staking and earn rewards for supporting the network&#8217;s security and consensus mechanism. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Takes A Leap Forward: Here’s What’s On The Horizon Alongside the growth in deposit contract balance, Ethereum has offered attractive staking returns. As of today, the staking annualized rate of return for running an ETH validator stands at 8.66%, providing a meaningful incentive for users to engage in staking. This figure remains significant, further driving the interest in staking among Ethereum investors seeking to maximize their returns. Furthermore, according to recent data from Token Unlocks, since the implementation of unstaking on the Ethereum network, investors have deposited 4.68 million ETH into ETH 2.0 contracts. Simultaneously, approximately 2.83 million ETH has been withdrawn, indicating ongoing investor engagement and confidence in the staking process. The Future Of Ethereum Staking With the Ethereum network surpassing the $40 billion mark in deposit contract balance, the growth in staking activity signifies a strong commitment from the community toward the PoS consensus mechanism. This development also highlights Ethereum&#8217;s transition to Ethereum 2.0, where staking will play a vital role in securing the network and achieving scalability. As ETH continues to evolve, the surge in staking participation not only contributes to the network&#8217;s security but also offers an opportunity for ETH holders to earn passive income through staking rewards. By actively participating in staking, users can contribute to the growth and decentralization of ETH while reaping the benefits of staking returns. Meanwhile, as ETH staking continues to surge, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has warned of potentially overloading the network consensus. In a recently published blog post, Buterin noted “Don&#8217;t overload Ethereum&#8217;s consensus.” Related Reading: Crypto Expert Predicts Ethereum (ETH) To Reach $457,000 – Here’s How The Ethereum founder further added that using Ethereum&#8217;s network consensus for other things could bring “high systemic risks to the ecosystem and should be discouraged and resisted.” However, following the warning, ETH staking hasn&#8217;t seen any decline so far but only an uptick. Over the past 24 hours, ETH has seen a plunge, down by 3.6%. The second-largest crypto asset by market capitalization has dropped from a high of trading slightly above $2,000 in recent weeks to trade below $1,800, at the time of writing. &#160; Featured image from Shutterstock, Chart from TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Polkadot (DOT) is in the red today as the bears seek to regain control over its price. DOT traded at $4.37 on January 1, 2023, and increased to $5.13 on January 11.   It remained within this range before moving to $6.23 on January 20. Also, DOT increased to the $7 price level on February 17 as the bulls seized control of its price. However, a gradual bearish turn between March and April forced it back to $5, where it currently trades today.  Polkadot Price Prediction Today Are The Bears In Control? DOT is trading in a sideways trend forming a red candle on the daily chart. It is below its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), with bearish sentiment in the short and long term. Related Reading: Santiment Explains How Bitcoin Investor Mentality Influenced Recent Price Action The SMA calculates an asset&#8217;s average price over a specified period and helps predict trend direction. If the bears persist, DOT&#8217;s 50-day SMA, which is about to drop below its 200-day SMA, will form a death cross. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 40.73 and in the neutral zone. The RSI is a trend-based indicator. DOT&#8217;s RSI is moving downwards, hinting at further price decline to the oversold region before a trend reversal.  The cryptocurrency&#8217;s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is slightly above its signal line and shows convergence.  Also, the MACD &#8211; a trend momentum indicator that displays the relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) and an asset&#8217;s price, displays a negative value conforming to the bearish trend today. The green histogram bars are fading, indicating a changing trend direction.  DOT&#8217;s technical indicators all hint at the possibility of further price decline for the asset. It is close to the $5.29 support level as the bears at the $5.42 resistance continue to act on its price, forcing a decline. DOT has remained in a sideways trend for the last few days and further price decline remains a possibility. However, if the bulls rally again, the $5.42 resistance level will be a realistic target before the $6 psychological resistance level.   The altcoin will likely enter a downtrend if the bears maintain the pressure today. But one thing that offers the possibility of a bullish reversal is the upcoming &#8216;Polkadot Decoded 2023&#8217; event in June.  Polkadot Decoded 2023 Might Boost DOT’s Performance Polkadot is hosting a community event, &#8216;Polkadot Decoded 2023&#8217;, between June 28-29 in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Since 2021, the crypto trading venue has doubled its efforts to work with Latin American projects.
