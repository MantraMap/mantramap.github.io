										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Venom Foundation – a Web3, fintech, and blockchain company – has <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/venom-to-launch-a-blockchain-hub-with-kenyan-government-2023-05-16">agreed to form a partnership</a> with the government of Kenya in Africa as a means of bringing more blockchain and crypto capabilities to the continent. The company also said it’s hoping to establish more Web3 and blockchain applications in the coming months and years to ensure Kenyans have access to up-to-date technology.</p>
<h2>Kenya Is Getting Access to Blockchain</h2>
<p>Christopher Louis Tsu – CTO for the Venom Foundation – commented in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Africa is already rich in natural resources and human capital. By bringing next generation blockchain technology to the continent, it will empower the people and help not only Kenya, but many other African nations to capitalize on their assets and participate in new global markets competitively.</p></blockquote>
<p>There has been a running theme over the past several years that if any region can benefit from blockchain and crypto, it’s Africa. The continent has long suffered from both political and financial corruption, and it’s long been believed that <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/could-btc-revamp-the-financial-industry-of-africa/">digital currencies can ultimately</a> bring about a new world for many of the continent’s native residents.</p>
<p>There are many entrepreneurs that have worked hard to bring the joys and magic of blockchain and digital currencies to Africa. For example, Jack Dorsey – the former CEO of Twitter – initially announced that <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/jack-dorsey-i-will-bring-btc-to-africa/">he was going to spend</a> several months touring through Africa and doing what he could to ensure the people had proper access to bitcoin and blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Sadly, this was about a year prior to the start of the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/coronavirus/">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, and thus it’s unclear if Dorsey ever fulfilled those plans. In any case, the idea still stands that crypto and blockchain can help Africa in ways no other technology can. Moses Kuria – the Cabinet Secretary for Investments, Trade, and Industry – commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are excited to work together with the Venom Foundation. This collaboration signifies the stance that we are taking towards next-generation technology and financial and technological developments in the world. We believe that the establishment of this blockchain hub will catalyze further innovations in various industries, benefitting our people both nationally and globally.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Trying to Help Africa</h2>
<p>Kenya is a unique country in that at the present time, roughly 84 percent of the people have normal access to banks. This is odd given the number of unbanked souls living in Africa. Thus, Kenya is a little more ahead of the game. However, with the integration of blockchain into the nation’s financial space, further value is likely to be implemented for the people who live there.</p>
<p>They will thus enjoy more opportunities and see their economy boom in ways nobody thought possible. There will also be new trade routes established through blockchain, which analysts believe will lead to a solid, long-term financial plan for the people of Kenya.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) recently engaged in an <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/australian-stock-exchange-says-software-overhaul-wont-involve-blockchain/ar-AA1bondT">ambitious new plan to completely</a> rebuild and revamp itself with <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/blockchain/">blockchain</a> technology, but sadly, those plans have come to a sudden end.</p>
<h2>The ASX &#8220;Breaks Up&#8221; with Blockchain</h2>
<p>A review of the agenda has suggested that for the ASX to be successful in its attempts, it would need to completely rework itself over a seven-year period. Executives behind the exchange say the plan is not feasible, and would thus not only require too much time, but also too much money and other resources to get things done appropriately.</p>
<p>The problem remains, however, that the ASX is still running on software that is approximately 30 years old. Since 1993, the technicals of the exchange haven’t been altered or adapted, but those behind the platform say blockchain is now completely and totally out of the question.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Tim Whiteley – the exchange project director – was asked if the platform would choose to walk a more “conventional route.” He responded with:</p>
<blockquote><p>While we continue to explore all the options, certainly we will need to use a more conventional technology than in the original solution in order to achieve the business outcomes.</p></blockquote>
<p>The announcement has brought about the end of what would likely have been one of the most prominent use cases of blockchain technology ever recorded in the annals of history. For many years, it’s been argued that blockchain technology could only become more mainstream and legitimate granted companies and platforms outside the crypto arena chose to utilize it.</p>
<p>Right now, while the technology has indeed come a long way and has built up a solid reputation for itself, it’s also very saturated, and while there have been instances in the past of blockchain being used in industries such as healthcare or in supply-chain manufacturing, these instances are rare and far from being the norm.</p>
<p>Blockchain is rather revolutionary because it’s widely believed it can prevent all fraud from occurring. Everything recorded to the blockchain is recorded in real-time. This ensures that all transactions are clear and unaltered from third parties. They involve the transactors only, and thus there’s no worries about what will go on behind closed doors.</p>
<p>However, it’s not likely blockchain will reach the breadth of its potential unless outside firms see it for what it is: something that can aid all kinds of companies, not just those in the financial circle. With everything recorded to a distributed ledger, all the information becomes verifiable and provable, thus ensuring illicit activity is kept to a minimum.</p>
<h2>Getting the Right Commentary</h2>
<p>Whiteley said that the ASX has sent out requests for feedback to potential software vendors to see what alternatives exist to blockchain. Several have already gotten back to him, and he commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Feedback has been taken into the implementation planning.</p></blockquote>

<li>Tron price started a fresh increase above the $0.0725 level against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>TRX price is now trading above $0.0750 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a major bullish trend line forming with support near $0.0762 on the 4-hours chart (data feed via Kraken).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to move up if it breaks the $0.0785 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>TRON price started a fresh increase above $0.0750 against the US Dollar, outpacing <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-eyes-more-upsides-above-31250/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. TRX’s price could rise further if it clears the $0.0785 resistance.</em></p>
<h2>Tron Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, Tron price started a steady increase from the $0.0682 support zone against the US Dollar. TRX’s price remained well-bid and was able to climb above the $0.0725 zone.</p>
<p>It traded above the $0.0750 and $0.0765 levels to move further into a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tron-trx-price-analysis-bulls-aim-fresh-move-to-0-082/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">positive zone</a>. Finally, the bears appeared near the $0.0785 level. A high is formed near $0.0783 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is trading well above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $0.0680 swing low to the $0.0783 high.</p>
<p>It is trading above $0.0750 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, TRX is facing resistance near the $0.0785 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.080 level.</p>
<p>A close above $0.080 could send the price toward the $0.0820 resistance zone. Any more gains might send TRX price toward $0.0850, above which the price could even rise toward $0.088. On the downside, initial support is near the $0.0762 level.</p>
<p>There is also a major bullish trend line forming with support near $0.0762 on the 4-hours chart. The next major support is now forming near $0.0750, below which it could test the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $0.0680 swing low to the $0.0783 high.</p>
<p>If there is a downside break below the $0.0732 support, the price might revisit the $0.0720 support. Any more losses might call for a move toward the $0.0682 zone in the near term.</p>

<li>Bitcoin price is trading below the $31,250 zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading above $30,500 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support near $30,300 on the 4-hour chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to rise if it stays above the $30,000 support zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin price is showing positive signs above $30,000 against the US Dollar. BTC might correct lower but dips could be limited below the $29,850 zone.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price started a decent increase above the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-bulls-in-control-above-29500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$29,000 resistance zone</a>. The price remained stable above the $30,000 level and traded in a positive zone.</p>
<p>There was a clear move above the $30,500 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). The price even rallied above the $31,000 resistance zone. However, the price seems to be struggling near the $31,450 zone. A high was formed near $31,445 and the price is now consolidating gains.</p>
<p>The price traded below $30,850 and tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $24,750 swing low to the $31,445 high. The price is now trading above $30,500 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-bulls-aim-fresh-uptrend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>.</p>
<p>Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $31,000 level. The first major resistance is near the $31,250 level, above which the price could rise toward the $32,000 zone.</p>
<p>Any more gains might send the price toward the $32,850 zone. If there is no upside break, the price might start a downside correction below $30,500. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support near $30,300 on the 4-hour chart of the BTC/USD pair.</p>
<p>The next key support is near the $29,200 level. Any more losses might call for a move toward the $28,000 support zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $24,750 swing low to the $31,445 high.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The crypto winter of 2022 may be technically over, but the <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/bitcoin-miami-conference-drop-attendance-crypto-094208644.html">effects are still being</a> felt. This year, the Miami Bitcoin Conference saw a whopping 50 percent dip in its attendance rate.</p>
<h2>The Crypto Winter Is Still a Powerful Enemy</h2>
<p>That means roughly half of last year’s crowd showed up this year, and many are blaming the crypto winter for the drops.</p>
<p>Some analysts believe the number may be lower than what’s being reported. For example, this year, roughly 15,000 people were in attendance. However, there are records suggesting last year’s attendance rate exceeded 35,000.</p>
<p>Despite this, the event still featured some relatively high-ranking individuals, one of which was democratic candidate for the White House Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>
<p>Kennedy is <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/presidential-candidate-robert-kennedy-jr-has-big-plans-for-the-crypto-space/">clearly a bitcoin fanatic</a>. He mentioned he is going to be accepting bitcoin and crypto donations for his campaign, and he also stated that should he become president, the government will never get in the way of investing in and holding digital assets. He commented during a speech:</p>
<blockquote><p>As president, I will make sure that your right to hold and use bitcoin is inviolable. I am an ardent defender and lifelong defender of civil liberties, and bitcoin is both an exercise and a guarantee of those freedoms.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also took serious issue with the situation involving Canadian truckers in 2022. During that time, several of these men took to protesting after their government announced they were required to take the COVID-19 vaccine. When their bank accounts and other <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-fund-set-up-for-canadian-truckers/">financial tools were shut</a> off, they sought to gain access to crypto so they could continue their actions.</p>
<p>From there, the Canadian government got in the way and sought to freeze whatever digital assets they got their hands on. Kennedy said he would make sure the government could take no action like that in the future and commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>None of these lawful and peaceful protestors had violated any law, but suddenly, they found that they could not access their money [or] their bank accounts to pay their mortgages or feed their families. When I witnessed this devastating use of government repression, I realized for the first time how free money is as important as free expression.</p></blockquote>
<h2>So Many Losses</h2>
<p>The crypto winter of 2022 was arguably the worst period for bitcoin and its digital cousins. BTC – the world’s number one digital currency by market cap – was trading at a new all-time high of $68,000 per unit during November of 2021. However, roughly one year later, the asset had lost more than 70 percent of its value and was trading in the mid-$16K range. It was a sad and ugly sight to see.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things didn’t quite stop there, and many cryptocurrencies followed in BTC’s footsteps, thus causing the arena to lose more than $2 trillion in overall value.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former CEO of software giant MicroStrategy Michael Saylor <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/cryptocurrency/news/michael-saylor-bitcoin-miami-thermodynamically-sound">made an appearance at this</a> year’s Miami Bitcoin Conference. He assured all people in attendance that bitcoin is here to stay, and that they shouldn’t worry about the prospects of a currency that, at this stage, has clearly proven itself.</p>
<h2>Michael Saylor Still Loves BTC</h2>
<p>Saylor addressed the 2022 bear market and tried hard to calm the investors in the room. Whether they felt concerned about the future of bitcoin is unclear at this time, but Saylor was quick to address the situation and let them know that the technology behind bitcoin is revolutionary, and that it’s going to secure the currency’s place in the financial spectrum. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The reason that bitcoin is so sound, literally sound, is because it is thermodynamically sound. It’s this masterpiece of engineering because we’ve created a monetary asset where we’ve stripped away all the counterparty risks.</p></blockquote>
<p>He stated that one of the big reasons why bitcoin is so “special” is because it’s simple to use. Currently, individuals only need internet connections and digital wallets to appreciate bitcoin and its altcoin cousins. When one is trying to gain access to standard monetary tools and services, they’re usually stuck answering for their past histories (job histories, financial histories, etc.) The funny thing is bitcoin really doesn’t care about all that.</p>
<p>With a  digital wallet and access to the internet, one can easily start trading, buying, selling, and investing in bitcoin to their heart’s content. Saylor also said that right now, bitcoin’s “safe haven” status is growing given how shady and untrustworthy the entire rest of the industry has become following a long <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/analysts-provide-their-thoughts-on-latest-bitcoin-rally/">string of bank failures</a> that include Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>All of those things, which could be viewed in a negative light, are positive for bitcoin because they’re all accelerating the conclusion of the mainstream investor that bitcoin is special and ethically sound, technically sound, and economically sound. Bitcoin fixes things. Bitcoin can help everybody.</p></blockquote>
<p>He was also very positive about the Lightning Network, which is a service that enables many smaller bitcoin transactions to occur off-chain, thus freeing up space on the network and ensuring transactions move faster.</p>
<p>Saylor is a maximalist that believes bitcoin has a bright future ahead of it despite its many ups and downs of the last couple years. He finished his statements with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin is here to stay. Bitcoin is the future.</p></blockquote>
<h2>So Much Love Led to Trouble</h2>
<p>Saylor is a man who has been investing his company’s <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-microstrategy-bitcoin-bet-is-already-paying-off-big-time/">reserves into bitcoin</a> since late 2020.</p>
<p>While things initially appeared positive, by the middle of 2022, the industry took a nasty turn, yet Saylor <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/michael-saylor-buys-more-btc-despite-ongoing-crash/">continued to invest and ultimately</a> put his company in debt as a result.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Right now, the U.S. government is trapped in <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/us-debt-deal-may-weigh-over-bitcoin-observers-1032342845">a financial fight that</a> has both sides of the political spectrum arguing over the debt ceiling.</p>
<h2>The Debt Ceiling Issue Could Hurt BTC</h2>
<p>Democrats and individuals like Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen want the debt ceiling raised, as they believe the U.S. is about to go bankrupt, while the republicans and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are saying any such hike would result in devastating financial repercussions for the standard American public.</p>
<p>Some analysts are saying that any kind of deal is likely to have a few nasty repercussions for bitcoin and other forms of crypto. One of the things they say will happen is the prices of bond yields will move up. Whenever this happens, bitcoin tends to go down, by contrast.</p>
<p>Giving her thoughts on the matter, Noelle Acheson – former head of research at Genesis Trading and the author of the “Crypto Is Macro Now” newsletter – stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The issuance of debt to top up coffers will have the opposite effect. Money will move out of cash and risk assets into U.S. government bonds, especially as yields on these instruments rise to offset the increase in supply. This could be bad for bitcoin and gold, which in theory fall in price when yields are rising (high yield environments tend to not be great for assets that yield nothing). What&#8217;s more, the issuance of more U.S. government debt would increase public spending, which would be good for the economy, further delaying the likelihood of rate cuts.</p></blockquote>
<p>The fact remains that only assets tied to the true American economy stand to do well should a deal be reached following the debt crisis. Bitcoin and other forms of crypto aren’t tied to anything, suggesting they could suffer in the long run.</p>
<p>It is also widely believed that should the U.S. default, this would ultimately lead to panic selling and a huge desire for cash similar with what was seen during the early days of the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/coronavirus/">COVID-19 pandemic</a>. During that time, the price of bitcoin fell by more than 50 percent.</p>
<h2>What Will Happen?</h2>
<p>Satyakam Gautam – the rates trader at India-based bank ICICI – commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>What it implies is a lack of USD funding in the immediate short term post the successful ceiling negotiation, if any. Corporate bonds markets, as well as private credit, will find it hard to roll over existing maturities, and this will lead to a real crash in either commercial real estate assets funding or plain junk bond issuers. This might be the real deal crash which the U.S. rate markets have been elusively looking for. There might be then a secular fall in long-end rates, as well as massive steepening in U.S. rates. This should augur well for risk haven [forex] like JPY &amp; CHF.</p></blockquote>

<li>ADA price is showing positive signs above the $0.280 zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading above $0.285 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $0.2950 on the 4-hours chart (data feed via Coinbase).</li>
<li>The price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.300 and $0.305 resistance levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cardano price is rising above $0.288 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-bulls-in-control-above-29500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. ADA price could rally if there is a clear move above the $0.305 resistance.</em></p>
<h2>Cardano Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This week, Cardano price started a steady increase above the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cardano-ada-price-analysis-bulls-face-key-hurdle-near-0-305/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$0.275 resistance zone</a> against the US Dollar. The ADA/USD pair gained pace for a move above the $0.280 and $0.285 levels.</p>
<p>Besides, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $0.295 on the 4-hours chart. The bulls were able to pump the price toward the $0.300 resistance. However, the bears appeared near $0.300. A high is formed near $0.300 and the price is now consolidating gains.</p>
<p>It is trading well above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2673 swing low to the $0.30 high. ADA price is still trading above $0.288 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>It is also showing positive signs above the same trend line. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.300 zone. The next major resistance is near the $0.305 zone.</p>
<p>A clear move above the $0.305 resistance might start a strong increase toward $0.332. Any more gains above the $0.332 resistance might send the price toward the $0.350 resistance or even $0.365.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support is near the $0.292 level. The next major support is near the $0.285 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2673 swing low to the $0.30 high. A clear move below the $0.285 level might send the price toward the $0.275 level. Any more losses might send the price toward the $0.262 support.</p>

<h2>Ethereum Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few sessions, Ethereum saw a decent increase above the $1,820 level against the US Dollar. ETH price was able to gain pace for a move above the $1,880 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
