The two nations reportedly want to &#8220;develop and establish a bigger regional market&#8221; while ensuring &#8220;a more stable and robust global supply chain&#8221; in order to &#8220;bring real and tangible benefits to the countries in the region.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>China and Russia to Strengthen Cooperation</h2>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin in Beijing on Wednesday. During their meeting, Xi told the Russian official that China is ready to strengthen cooperation with Russia, Chinese news agency Xinhua reported.</p>
<p>Xi stated that in addition to strengthening cooperation across multilateral platforms, such as the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the BRICS, and the G20, China and Russia should explore “potential” new economic, trade, and investment relations.</p>
<p>The Chinese leader told Mishustin: “We hope that the two sides will continue to take advantage of … the strong momentum of Sino-Russian cooperation, elevate cooperation in various fields … and continuously enrich the content of the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between our two countries in the new era.” He was further quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>China is ready to work with Russia and countries of the Eurasian Economic Union to promote and connect the Belt and Road Initiative with the union in order to develop and establish a bigger regional market, ensure a more stable and robust global supply chain so [we can] bring real and tangible benefits to the countries in the region.</p></blockquote>
<p>Responding to Xi&#8217;s statements, Mishustin said Russia is “ready to work with China to promote multipolarization in the world and consolidate the international order based on international law.”</p>

<p>Xi emphasized China&#8217;s commitment to offer firm support to Russia on matters related to the two nations&#8217; respective core interests and enhance cooperation in multilateral forums. He commended the substantial level of mutual trust and coordination between China and Russia, stating that it “set an example of a new type of international relations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prior to visiting Beijing and meeting Xi, Mishustin attended a Russian-Chinese Business Forum in Shanghai. At the forum, the chairman of Russia’s national economic development institution VEB.RF urged China and Russia to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-russia-urged-to-speed-up-creation-of-cutting-edge-payment-infrastructure-for-brics-and-sco-currencies/">speed up the establishment</a> of a new, “cutting-edge” payment system for SCO and BRICS currencies. Mishustin <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-russia-urged-to-speed-up-creation-of-cutting-edge-payment-infrastructure-for-brics-and-sco-currencies/">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our relations with China keep getting stronger. This longstanding relationship is based on historical roots, mutual respect, and friendship.</p></blockquote>

The billionaire suggested that his companies Tesla and Twitter could partner with an AI firm similar to how Microsoft collaborates with Openai.</strong></p>
<h2>Elon Musk on AI: &#8216;There Should Be a Significant Third Horse in the Race&#8217;</h2>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk discussed a wide range of topics during a virtual appearance at the Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit in London on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) was among the topics the billionaire discussed. He believes that there should be a major competitor to Microsoft and Google in the AI race. The Tesla boss, who recently established an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/musk-hires-new-ceo-for-twitter-she-will-be-starting-in-6-weeks/">AI company</a> called X.AI, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve got Openai and Microsoft, Google Deepmind … I think there should be a significant third horse in the race.</p></blockquote>
<p>Musk noted that his social media platform Twitter and his electric car company Tesla could potentially collaborate with an AI company, drawing a parallel to the partnership between Microsoft and Openai. Musk himself previously contributed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/17/elon-musk-used-to-say-he-put-100m-in-openai-but-now-its-50m-here-are-the-receipts/">millions of dollars</a> to Openai, the company behind the popular chatbot Chatgpt.</p>
<p>“Openai has a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/">relationship</a> with Microsoft that seems to work fairly well &#8230; So it’s possible that X.AI and Twitter, Tesla would have something similar,&#8221; the Tesla executive described.</p>
<p>Musk, who recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/musk-hires-new-ceo-for-twitter-she-will-be-starting-in-6-weeks/">appointed</a> Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of Twitter, also revealed that the social media company is not currently profitable. However, he claimed that it has the potential to achieve positive cash flow as early as next month.</p>

<h2>Musk Reaffirms Support for Dogecoin</h2>
<p>The Tesla billionaire also talked about cryptocurrency investing and his support for the meme crypto dogecoin (DOGE). &#8220;I&#8217;m not advising anyone to buy a crypto, or bet the farm on dogecoin, or anything like that,&#8221; he stressed, adding: &#8220;Maybe you should, but let me advise you that would be perhaps unwise.&#8221; Musk proceeded to reiterate his support for DOGE, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dogecoin is my favorite cryptocurrency because it has the best humor and has dogs.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Tesla CEO has long been a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-confirms-hell-keep-buying-and-supporting-dogecoin/">supporter</a> of dogecoin, calling it &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-real-reason-he-supports-dogecoin-many-people-at-tesla-spacex-own-doge/">the people’s crypto</a>.&#8221; He believes the meme cryptocurrency is best suited for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-bitcoin-store-of-value-dogecoin-transactions-time-names-him-person-of-the-year/">transactions</a>.</p>

This brings back key capital-efficient features such as concentrated liquidity and full range fees compounding, while incorporating significant security enhancements, including a newly audited smart contract, round-the-clock live scanning in collaboration with security partners, and the introduction of an Insurance Fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KyberSwap Elastic will resume with improved smart contracts that have undergone internal audits as well as external audits with ChainSecurity and the community whitehat developer that spotted the smart contract vulnerability earlier in April. Further smart contract audits are being planned with other auditors. The comprehensive audit report by ChainSecurity can be found </span><a href="https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/kyberswap-elastic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to fortified smart contracts, KyberSwap has implemented enhanced security measures of its own. This includes a real-time monitoring page set to launch in Q3 2023 that continuously checks the status and security of the website, smart contracts, and more, providing the team with up-to-the-minute information and eliminating reliance on outdated data. Furthermore, KyberSwap has improved UX controls, expanded user education resources, and enhanced warning notices, empowering users with the knowledge and tools necessary to make informed decisions in the crypto space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To further bolster security, KyberSwap is establishing an official Bug Bounty program to be released in June 2023 with Immunefi, inviting community developers to proactively evaluate the codebase and incentivizing their participation.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our Elastic protocol resumption comes with upgraded smart contracts, a new security audit and coverage from KyberDAO, together with increased incentives, to offer users more rewarding, secure options for their liquidity,” said Victor Tran, KyberSwap Co-Founder and CEO. “KyberSwap returns to chart the path to leading DeFi in volume and protocol revenue, and make real an all-in-one, sustainable platform to help users Trade Smart.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KyberSwap&#8217;s Elastic protocol is scheduled to resume operations on May 25, 2023, alongside the KyberSwap Returns campaign. This campaign brings forth exciting features such as NFT campaigns, the introduction of KyberAI, potential deployment to zkSync, and a multimillion-dollar Liquidity Mining campaign and ecosystem growth funds allocation. Notably, prominent staking and vault protocols, including Lido Finance and QiDao, have confirmed their participation, injecting liquidity into KyberSwap and reinvigorating liquidity mining incentives and other collaborative initiatives with the team.</span></p>

The study says the slowdown is probably temporary, with over half of the purloined funds being reclaimed by hacking victims in Q1 2023.</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Crime Cools: Hacks and Attacks Plummet 70% in Q1 2023</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.trmlabs.com">TRM Labs</a> approximates that close to $400 million was pilfered in Q1 2023 from almost 40 separate crypto infiltrations and attacks. This statistic has plunged by around 70% compared to Q1 2022, as <a href="https://www.trmlabs.com/post/crypto-hacks-down-70-in-q1-2023">per the findings</a> of the blockchain analytics firm. Moreover, this year&#x2019;s first quarter recorded lower figures than any quarter of 2022 since the typical hack amounted to $10.5 million.</p>
<p>In contrast, the mean hack value during Q1 2022 reached over $30 million, experiencing a comparable count of nearly 40 incidents. A notable disparity between this year&#x2019;s and last year&#x2019;s breaches is the substantial amount of recoveries. &#x201C;To date, hacking victims have recovered over half of all stolen funds in Q1 2023,&#x201D; stated TRM Labs in its recent analysis.</p>
<p>TRM Labs investigators clarify that there is no &#x201C;obvious explanation for the lull,&#x201D; but cybercriminals might have been discouraged by two particular events. The first entails the U.S. government&#x2019;s allegations toward <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-authorities-charge-mango-markets-attacker-defendant-arrested-detained-in-puerto-rico/">Avraham Eisenberg</a> in connection with the Mango Markets occurrence last year. The second possible cause for the hiatus mentioned by researchers was the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-government-bans-ethereum-mixer-tornado-cash-platform-added-to-ofacs-sdn-list/">sanctions</a> imposed on ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>) mixer Tornado Cash as a result of last year&#x2019;s U.S. Treasury actions.</p>

<p>The report from TRM Labs highlights that blockchain monitoring tools have advanced and virtual asset service providers (VASPs) have elevated their anti-money laundering (AML) criteria. These elements could have contributed to Q1&#x2019;s deceleration, but experts do not foresee its continuation. &#x201C;Unfortunately, this slowdown is most likely a temporary reprieve rather than a long-term trend,&#x201D; the blockchain intelligence company&#x2019;s Q1 2023 examination concludes.</p>

Moscow and Beijing intend to increase mutual trade beyond the $200-billion target this year, added the head of the Russian government. </strong></p>
<h2>Mishustin: 70% of Settlements Between Russia and China Conducted in National Currencies</h2>
<p>Around 70% of cross-border settlements between the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China are already carried out in national currencies — the ruble and the yuan, according to Russia’s Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.</p>

<p>During talks in Beijing with his Chinese counterpart, Li Qiang, he highlighted the positive trends in the trade relations between the two countries in a number of areas, stating, quoted by the RIA Novosti news agency:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am sure that this year we will not only fulfill the task set by the heads of state to increase mutual trade to $200 billion ahead of schedule, but we will also exceed this milestone.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mishustin emphasized the strategic nature of bilateral cooperation in the energy sector. “Russia ranks first in oil supplies to China, exports of natural gas, coal and electricity are growing,” the official detailed while also noting the expanding work “in the field of peaceful atom.”</p>

<p>The Russian premier also stressed that “in the new geopolitical conditions, the development of transport and logistics routes passing through the Russian-Chinese border is of particular importance,” pointing out that the two nations are accelerating the development of the necessary infrastructure to increase cargo transportation.</p>
<p>Moscow and Beijing have been fostering trade and economic ties amid confrontations with the West on multiple fronts. Considerable efforts have been made towards <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/de-dollarization-has-already-started-says-russias-foreign-minister-lavrov/">de-dollarization</a> of mutual settlements and transition to using national currencies within both the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-to-promote-national-currencies-before-issuing-common-one/">BRICS</a> bloc of emerging economies and the regional Shanghai Cooperation Organization (<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/worlds-largest-regional-organization-to-switch-to-settlements-in-national-currencies/">SCO</a>), of which they are members.</p>

Kwon was detained for providing false identification while boarding a flight to Dubai alongside a companion on March 23, 2023.</strong></p>
<h2>Terraform Labs Co-Founder&#8217;s Bail Request Invalidated by Montenegrin High Court</h2>
<p>For the past 62 days, Do Kwon has remained incarcerated in Montenegro&#8217;s capital after being <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/terraform-labs-co-founder-do-kwon-arrested-in-montenegro-says-interior-minister/">apprehended</a> at Podgorica airport. Kwon, along with his accomplice Han Chong-joon, allegedly attempted to depart from Montenegro for Dubai.</p>
<p>However, their plans were thwarted when Kwon was discovered carrying forged identification documents. Montenegro&#8217;s interior minister, Filip Adzic, confirmed the arrest and subsequent detention of Kwon in Podgorica.</p>
<p>Ever since then, Kwon has found himself trapped within the confines of Montenegro&#8217;s prisons, and jails with <a href="https://www.refworld.org/docid/4da56da5c.html">distressing reports</a> about the treatment of inmates and the dire state of <a href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/313615_MONTENEGRO-2021-HUMAN-RIGHTS-REPORT.pdf">prison infrastructure</a> in the country.</p>
<p>At the start of May, a glimmer of hope emerged as Kwon and Chong-joon were <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/do-kwon-to-be-released-on-e400000-bail-pleads-not-guilty-in-montenegro/">granted permission</a> by the lower court in Montenegro to secure their release by posting bail amounting to $430,500. However, the optimism was short-lived as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-24/crypto-mogul-do-kwon-s-bail-is-revoked-in-montenegro">news surfaced</a> on Wednesday, May 24, 2023, revealing that a higher court had decisively annulled the lower court&#8217;s bail ruling.</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning, Bloomberg reporters received the news directly from Marija Rakovic, a court spokeswoman. Apart from Kwon&#8217;s ongoing legal woes in Podgorica, the co-founder of Terraform Labs also faces extradition requests from both the United States and South Korea. A <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinNewsCom/status/1641554813010817025?s=20">report</a> released in late March revealed that Montenegro had allegedly decided to withhold Kwon&#8217;s extradition until he had undergone a trial and received proper legal proceedings.</p>

<p>“The basic court should now make another decision, taking into account what the high court ruled,” Rakovic informed Bloomberg during their conversation on Wednesday. This development comes in the wake of a Seoul court <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/seoul-court-greenlights-seizure-of-do-kwons-assets-worth-176-million/">granting permission</a> for the confiscation of Kwon&#8217;s assets, valued at $176 million.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/seoul-prosecutors-believe-terra-co-founder-do-kwon-still-in-possession-of-100-million-held-in-swiss-bank-account/">suspicions</a> that the co-founder of Terraform Labs may have stashed away $100 million in a Swiss bank account. Much like <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-a-32-billion-valuation-to-financial-troubles-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rise-and-fall-of-ftx/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, the disgraced co-founder of FTX, Kwon appears to have had ample financial resources to fund his costly legal defenses thus far.</p>

Surpassing 20 alternative blockchain networks, Bitcoin-based NFT sales now secure the second position in the realm of blockchain sales, with only Ethereum reigning supreme. </strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin-Based NFTs Storm the Market, Surpassing 20 Blockchain Competitors</h2>
<p>Amidst the fervor surrounding the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-blockchain-continues-to-see-growth-in-ordinal-inscriptions-and-brc20-tokens/">Ordinal inscription trend</a>, Bitcoin-based NFTs have skyrocketed in popularity. The sales amassed over the past 30 days firmly established the network as the second-largest in terms of sales within this time frame. While Ethereum NFT sales saw $392.23 million, this past month Bitcoin sales tallied up to $173.28 million, up 408.29% from the month prior.</p>

<p>However, there has been a significant 47% decline in the number of buyers for Bitcoin-based NFTs, totaling 6,955 over the course of the past 30 days. Insights from <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/">cryptoslam.io data</a> highlight that the leading NFT collection, in terms of sales during this period, is the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-590141 size-full" title="30-Day Bitcoin NFT Sales Surge to $173 Million, Securing Second Place in Blockchain Market" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/collecss.jpg" alt="30-Day Bitcoin NFT Sales Surge to $173 Million, Securing Second Place in Blockchain Market" width="1280" height="575" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/collecss-300x135.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/collecss-1024x460.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/collecss-768x345.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/collecss.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>The BAYC collection garnered $39,307,853 in sales over the past month, closely followed by the Ordi BRC20 NFTs, which amassed a slightly lower amount at $38,375,984. Noteworthy sales also transpired within other Bitcoin-centric NFT collections, including uncategorized Ordinals, as well as Space Pepes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-590142 size-full" title="30-Day Bitcoin NFT Sales Surge to $173 Million, Securing Second Place in Blockchain Market" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/salesssd.jpg" alt="30-Day Bitcoin NFT Sales Surge to $173 Million, Securing Second Place in Blockchain Market" width="1280" height="230" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/salesssd-300x54.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/salesssd-1024x184.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/salesssd-768x138.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/salesssd.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>Sales from uncategorized Ordinals reached $23,508,299, while Space Pepes accumulated $12,247,480 in sales. Additionally, the Bitcoin Frogs NFT collection hopped its way to $9,849,639, while $NALS NFTs secured around $6,818,592 in sales over the past 30 days. The Bitcoin blockchain took center stage as the birthplace of the top five most expensive NFT transactions during this period.</p>
<p>These included a <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/space-pepes/mint/2c2433f34d6d67cd157f86c2bccb1144fa57b467694aff5be4848456ab654c8fi0">$4.5 million sale</a> of a Space Pepe, as well as three uncategorized Ordinals that fetched prices exceeding a million dollars each. A Bitamigos NFT, for its part, commanded a <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/bitamigos/mint/367c15730877666163f438fc07518b4b28af14fc27a6f8f63b8469e000a0ea41i0">$1.3 million price tag</a>. It is also worth noting that nine out of the top-priced NFTs sold last month were derived from Bitcoin.</p>

<p>As of May 24, 2023, the Bitcoin blockchain has surpassed <a href="https://ordinals.com/inscription/491a3f3f2967948e9ac6662e08bafa923d58643214f0b96f2b7e7fb351808ff5i0">nine million inscriptions</a>, coinciding with the surge in Bitcoin-based NFT sales. This trend has rewarded miners with an estimated value of approximately <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis">1,495 BTC</a> or $40.27 million since the emergence of inscriptions on the chain.</p>
<p>Initially, skepticism surrounded the ability of Bitcoin to generate sufficient NFT activity to rival prominent NFT blockchains such as Solana and Polygon. However, the oldest blockchain network in existence so far has demonstrated its prowess as a formidable competitor.</p>

The decline came as a red wave swept through the crypto market, leading to the global cap falling by 2% at the time of writing. Dogecoin also dropped, hitting a two-week low.</strong></p>
<h2>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>)</h2>
<p>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>) was one of Wednesday&#x2019;s biggest movers, as the token fell by as much as 6% in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>/USD dropped to a bottom of $85.87 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after hitting a high of $91.79.</p>
<p>The decline in price pushed litecoin to its weakest point since May 15, when it last broke out of a floor at $85.00.</p>

<p>From the chart, it appears that today&#x2019;s move transpired as the relative strength index (RSI) fell below a support level of 50.00.</p>
<p>Currently, price strength is now tracking at 46.95, with the next visible floor at the 39.00 mark.</p>
<p>Although <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> has rebounded from an earlier low, and is now trading at $86.61, a breakout below $85.00 remains possible.</p>

<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) was also in the red on Wednesday, as it fell to a multi-week low of its own.</p>
<p>Following a high of $0.07305 on Tuesday, DOGE/USD slipped to a low of $0.07103 in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>This drop in price pushed the meme coin to its lowest point since May 12, which is the last time it traded under $0.07000.</p>

<p>Overall, dogecoin has mostly consolidated between the aforementioned low, and a resistance level at $0.0750 for the past few weeks.</p>
<p>In order to move away from this current threshold, a ceiling of 43.00, or floor at 36.00 will need to be broken.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is at a reading of 37.42.</p>

During that period, the prevailing consensus algorithms for mining were Kadena, Scrypt, and Cuckatoo32. However, the landscape has evolved, and presently, the most profitable consensus algorithms for mining encompass Kheavyhash, Scrypt, and Eaglesong.</strong></p>
<h2>The Evolving Landscape of Profitable Proof-of-Work Algorithms</h2>
<p>While mining <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> remains a profitable venture, it is not the foremost crypto asset for maximizing profitability in 2023. As of May 23, 2023, bitcoin ranks fifth among the most profitable cryptocurrencies to mine this year, while several other digital assets promise higher returns.</p>
<p>At the height of mining profitability stands a lesser-known PoW token named <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kaspa">kaspa (KAS)</a>. Currently, KAS can be mined employing a graphics processing unit (GPU) utilizing the Kheavyhash algorithm. However, Bitmain has developed an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) specifically designed for mining KAS.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020230515160139109i8HPxEdB068C">information</a> provided on Bitmain&#x2019;s website, the availability of Bitmain&#x2019;s KAS Miner KS3 to the general public is scheduled for August and September 2023. <a href="https://archive.ph/thLMx#selection-1293.1-1293.6">Archived data</a> from asicminervalue.com as of May 23 suggests that if the KS3 were accessible at present, it would generate an estimated daily profit of $2,045, assuming electricity costs of $0.12 per kilowatt hour (kWh).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-590014 size-full" title="ASIC Heavyweights: These Are the Most Profitable Proof-of-Work Algorithms in 2023" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kas.jpg" alt="ASIC Heavyweights: These Are the Most Profitable Proof-of-Work Algorithms in 2023" width="1280" height="475" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kas-300x111.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kas-1024x380.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kas-768x285.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kas.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>The KS3 boasts a hashpower of 8,300 gigahash per second (GH/s) or 8.3 terahash per second (TH/s) specifically designed for the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05193.pdf">Kheavyhash algorithm</a>. Upon its release, each unit of the miner will be priced at $49,800, as indicated by Bitmain&#x2019;s shop.</p>
<p>Following KAS, the next noteworthy consensus algorithm in terms of profitability is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02160">Scrypt</a>, which enables individuals to mine cryptocurrencies such as <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DOGE/">dogecoin (DOGE)</a> and <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC/">litecoin (LTC)</a>, along with various other crypto assets, utilizing a Scrypt-compatible ASIC device. Bitmain offers a range of machines that are part of the Antminer L7 series, initially introduced in 2021 and subsequently expanded in 2022.</p>

<p>Among the highly profitable crypto miners, the Antminer K7, an <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3448734.3450882">Eaglesong</a>-compatible ASIC, stands out with hashpower of around 63.5 terahash per second (TH/s). Currently, the <a href="https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020230128113442282ADEsW92K0637">K7 miner</a> is sold out, but it is listed with a price of $4,748 per unit on Bitmain&#x2019;s sold-out filter. This particular Antminer is designed exclusively for mining the relatively lesser-known crypto asset called <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/nervos-network">nervos (CKB)</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-590065 size-full" title="ASIC Heavyweights: These Are the Most Profitable Proof-of-Work Algorithms in 2023" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kda.jpg" alt="ASIC Heavyweights: These Are the Most Profitable Proof-of-Work Algorithms in 2023" width="1280" height="475" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kda-300x111.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kda-1024x380.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kda-768x285.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kda.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>Based on current exchange rates, it is estimated that the K7 miner can generate daily profits of approximately $8.70. Moving forward, the <a href="https://messari.io/asset/kadena/profile">Kadena</a> consensus algorithm is noteworthy, specifically utilized for mining the crypto asset known as kadena (KDA). Once again, Bitmain takes the lead as the manufacturer of the most profitable mining rig for KDA.</p>
<p>With a hashpower of 166 terahash per second (TH/s), the Antminer KA3, compatible with Kadena, is a notable mining device. Considering the current exchange rates for KDA, this machine is projected to generate approximately $6.79 per day in profits. Moving on to the fifth most profitable consensus algorithm for ASIC mining, we have the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/6/3155">SHA256 algorithm</a>.</p>

<p>The Bitmain Antminer S19 XP Hydro model offers hashpower of around 255 TH/s. When factoring in electricity costs of $0.12 per kilowatt hour (kWh) on May 23, the S19 XP Hydro is estimated to yield around $4.79 per day in profits. Currently, it is the most profitable <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> miner on the market, but a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/microbt-unveils-new-whatsminer-bitcoin-mining-rig-with-320-th-s-setting-new-standard-for-hashpower/">rival is on the way</a>. Microbt&#x2019;s Whatsminer M53S++ claims to produce 320 TH/s, which is 65 TH/s greater than Bitmain&#x2019;s Antminer S19 XP Hydro. At the time of writing, the Whatsminer M53S++ is currently not available for purchase.</p>
<p class="p1"></p>
<p>The values of crypto assets are subject to constant fluctuations, and the profitability landscape has undergone substantial changes since our news desk last <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/these-are-the-most-profitable-proof-of-work-algorithms-since-ethereum-moved-to-proof-of-stake/">reported</a> on this subject eight months ago. As previously mentioned, a KDA-compatible KA3 miner currently generates an estimated $6.79 per day in profits. However, 248 days ago, this same machine was yielding a much higher profit of $69.41 per day, assuming electricity costs of $0.12 per kilowatt hour (kWh).</p>
<p>This exemplifies how the profitability of mining rigs can significantly vary over time. By the time Bitmain&#x2019;s KAS Miner KS3 is shipped, the daily profit may be considerably lower than the current estimate. This pattern holds true for all mining rigs ever created, as there have been instances when these machines were highly efficient and profitable, only to be rendered obsolete by either superior machines or volatile crypto prices.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) moved below $27,000 on Wednesday, as markets begin to prepare for the release of the upcoming FOMC minutes report.</p>
<p>Following a high of $27,386.99 on Tuesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD dropped to a low of $26,671.98 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>The move comes following two days of consecutive gains, which pushed bitcoin to a one-week high.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the decline came as the relative strength index (RSI) of 14 days fell below a support point at 42.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, the index is now tracking at 41.356, with a lower floor at 39.00 a possible target for bears.</p>
<p>If successful in reaching this level, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will likely be at the $26,300 mark.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) fell by as much as 2% in today&#x2019;s session, however bulls have so far rejected a breakout below the $1,800 level.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD dropped to an intraday low of $1,811.79 on Wednesday, which comes a day after trading at a peak of $1,869.34.</p>
<p>Similar to bitcoin, today&#x2019;s slippage sees bearish pressure put a stop to a mini-win streak for the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Should this downwards pressure continue to gain momentum, there is a good chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> could move below $1,800 shortly.</p>
<p>Price strength is currently tracking at 46.09, with a floor at 44.00 a potential landing stop in the event of further declines.</p>
<p>Long-term bulls will remain optimistic however, with an upwards crossover of the 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages on the cusp of happening.</p>
