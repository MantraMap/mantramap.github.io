Moreover,  this massive bullish candle breached the long-coming trendline, indicating a high possibility of potential recovery; how far this ongoing recovery may rise?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Polkadot coin shows seven consecutive green candles in the daily time frame chart.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily RSI line has jumped into the overbought region</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Polkadot coin Inu coin is $648 Million, indicating a 285% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/v/VJ1nn3fI.png" alt="Polkadot Coin Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past eight months, the Polkadot coin price showed a classic example of a steady downtrend. A downsloping trendline accentuates this downfall and assists traders in aggressively selling at price rallies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with the recent growth in the crypto market, the Polkadot coin rebounded from the 2022 low support of $4.233. The parabolic rally displayed an aggressive buying of the market, which surged the prices by 42.6%.to reach the current market value of $6.05.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the gradual rise in volume during this rally projected the buyer’s confidence for further rallies. Thus, after breaking several resistances, the DOT prices have breached the falling trend of January 14th. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This bullish breakout reflects an early sign of price recovery, indicating the selling on rallies sentiment has been shifting to buy on tips. If the daily candle closes above the downloading trendline, the buyers could use this trendline to bolster the recovery rally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the post-breakout rally may drive the prices 35% higher to reach and hit the current price of $5.9. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a downfall below the trendline will offset the mentioned bullish  Cmomentiumprioce will undermine the selling thesis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MACD</strong>: the increasing gap between the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a> and signal line accentuates the rising buying pressure in the Polkadot coin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bollinger band:</strong> a  retest to the indicators’ upper band indicated aggressive buying in the market and a need for a price correction.</span></p>

Amid this bullish rally, the Solana price rebounded from the $8 mark and surged 177% within three weeks. Moreover, the prices show another breakout attempt from the $22.5 resistance indicating the buyers are aiming for even higher levels.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish crossover between the 20 and 50 DMA may assist coin buyers in sustaining ongoing recovery.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $27.2 mark stands as a crucial resistance that may stall the rising Solana price.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Solana coin is $445.5 Million, indicating a 85.8% gain</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/g/GkKXYrti.png" alt="Solana Coin price" width="1946" height="1104" /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily time frame chart shows the Solana coin price is nearly following a perpendicular rally, highlighting the aggressive buying activity in the market. Moreover, the gradual rise in volume activity also indicates the strong commitment of buyers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this bull run, the Solana coin price has breached multiple resistance, which now could assist buyers as a potential support to maintain this recovery. In addition, the release of <a href="https://coingape.com/us-cpi-report-time-for-bitcoin-price-shine/">December&#8217;s CPI data</a>, i.e., 6.5%, hints at the easing of US inflation. As a result, the crypto market sustains a sense of bullish recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, Solana&#8217;s price is trading place at $22.8 and shows a break-out attempt from another resistance of $22.5. A Daily candle closing about the mentioned resistance will accelerate the bullish momentum and drive the SOL price 20% higher to the $27.2 mark.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a country note, if the price fails to sustain about the dollar 22.5 mark, a minor pullback is expected in the coming weeks.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MACD:</strong> the increasing gap between the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a> and signal line accentuates the rising buying pressure in the Solana coin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>DMA:</strong> along with the breached horizontal level mentioned above, the SOL price also reclaimed the 20, 50, and 100 DMA. These slopes could offer additional support in times of correction phase.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $22.9</span></li>

According to the lead developer of Terraform Labs, Jared, who made the announcement on his official Twitter account, the rebranded Terra network will be joining a list of other blockchains, including Osmosis, Juno, and SEI, among others, to help steer the network in the right direction.</p>
<h2>LUNC Interchain Station Goes Live</h2>
<p>Jared also mentioned that additional chains will soon be joining the Interchain Station, which includes the likes of SEI, Mars and Pisco. his move will enable different blockchains to communicate with one another in a seamless manner at all times. In addition, the lead developer <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/Jared_TFL/status/1614288469098127360" rel="nofollow">mentioned</a> that within the next few days, more features will be rolled out; with their primary focus on launching the wallet for mobile devices. Currently, the mainnets which are supported by the station are <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/luna-2-0/">Luna</a>, Lunc, Osmosis, Juno, Kujira, Carbon, HuaHua and Cresent.</p>

<p>As reported earlier on CoinGape, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/terra-classic/">price of Terra Classic (LUNC)</a> rose nearly by 3% on January 10 when it was first announced by the TFL staff on Twitter as a &#8220;breakthrough in chain integrations&#8221;. The new development comes after attempts were made by the LUNC community to revive the dwindling project, a blockchain that was spun out of the collapsed Terra ecosystem. With the new station wallet, developers working on the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/">DeFi platform</a> will now have easy access to oracle data from multiple chains via the interchain facility.</p>

<h2>Terra Classic (LUNC) Price Action</h2>
<p>The start of 2023 has not been smooth for the Terra Classic <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/#:~:text=A%20blockchain%20is%20a%20distributed,functions%20to%20become%20a%20chain.">blockchain</a> as received a major blow when crypto exchange KuCoin announced its undelegation of nearly 48 billion LUNC tokens. However, the LUNC community has fought back by approving and implementing new governance proposals that aim towards the overall betterment of the chain. In a bid to stir up on-chain activity, the Terra ecosystem recently has been conducting token burns.</p>
<p>For instance, governance proposal 11242 seeks to do away with the practice of reminting a proportion of the LUNC tokens that have been destroyed. This upgrade, once implemented, will effectively eliminate the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-tokens/">crypto tokens</a> from its circulating supply which could, in theory, have a positive impact on the price of LUNC.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135421" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/14224358/Screenshot-2023-01-14-224346.png" alt="" width="896" height="712" /></p>
<p>As things stand, the Terra Classic (LUNC) price is currently being traded at $0.0001761. This represents an increase of 2.65% on the day, in contrast to the massive gain of 15.50% during the last week, as per CoinGape’s <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> tracker.</p>

This pattern displaces itself as two converging trendlines leading a downtrend until the prices break the overhead trendline. Thus, a bullish breakout could be the early sign that the selling on rallies phase has flipped into buying on dips. The post-breakout rally surged the Gala price 55% higher to reach the current price of $0.05. Will it recover ahead?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from the $0.0455-$0.0475 resistance will set the GALA price for a 15% jump</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 20-and-100-day EMA on the verge of bullish crossover may encourage bolster in the market</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the GALA is $157.5 Million indicating a 447% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/w/w2qalwFl.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The release of <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-market-gives-mixed-reaction-to-december-cpi-inflation-data/">December&#8217;s CPI data</a> indicates the easing of US inflation which bolstered the ongoing recovery in the crypto market. Thus, with the recent recovery rally, the Gala price breached the monthly resistance of $0.0467. This breakout will further intensify the bullish momentum and encourage the resumption of a bullish rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, by the price time, the daily candle has shaped into a Doji-type pattern, indicating the buying order is not sustaining at higher prices. Therefore, a possible consolidation or pullback is required to stabilize the excessive buying of Gala coins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, If the buying pressure stays high in the market, the prices will continue to hover above the breached $0.0467 level. This retest phase could offer an entry opportunity for traders and replenish the bullish momentum for further rally. Moreover, the post-breakout rally may surge the market value by 15% to surpass the $0.057 barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a longer correction to $0.038 or $0.032 is possible if market sentiment tilts on the sellers&#8217; side.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI-</strong> the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily RSI slope</a> wavering at the oversold region indicates the buying activities were high for the given time. Thus, 88% of the indicator increases the possibility for a pullback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the 200-day EMA wavering around the $0.053 mark imposes significant resistance against Gala buyers</span></p>

Bitcoin&#8217;s price, which is now over $20,750, has increased by more than 20% in the first two weeks of this year. Despite this, <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">Bitcoin&#8217;s (BTC) price</a> which reached a high of $65,000 in November 2021, is currently trading around the bottom of a severe <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/">bear market</a>.</p>
<h2>Crypto Market Rally</h2>
<p>Although the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> has turned bullish, a prominent crypto analyst who goes by the pseudonym @CryptoCapo on Twitter, predicts that the market will likely take a U-turn and hit newer lows in the nearby future. Considering a higher timeframe, he points out that the price of Bitcoin is still testing significant resistance. Although a weekly closing will be crucial, there hasn&#8217;t been any bullish confirmation; which is the same for the second-largest <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> Ethereum as well.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/best-telegram-crypto-channels-list/">Check Out The Top Crypto Telegram Channels Of 2023</a></em></p>
<p>He further <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CryptoCapo_/status/1614181428610142209" rel="nofollow">points</a> out that apart from Bitcoin, even <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoins</a> are experiencing erratic price surges; the majority of which are also running into resistance. This pattern has repeated itself with each and every bounce in this bear market and creates the deceptive impression of having reached a market bottom. According to him, the traditional markets are also continuing the downward trend as expected. The SPX is consistently setting lower highs, and the earnings session is anticipated to be unfavorable.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135416" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/14202902/FmazFjgXwAAsyP7.jpg" alt="" width="3282" height="1882" /></p>
<p>He is further quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Invalidations would be clear when new highs are formed on htf and key levels are reclaimed. This has not happened yet.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Bitcoin To Hit Newer Lows?</h2>
<p>When shorter timeframes are considered, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> price is currently rising at an exponential rate. However, there is a difficulty facing the bulls in the market as, according to him, this move has already gone beyond its intended scope. The weak point at the base of the parabola sometimes results in significant losses and complete reversals when the long-term trend that it represents finally breaks. Due to this, he predicts that Bitcoin&#8217;s (BTC) price could possibly retrace back to $12,000.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135417 size-full" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/14205018/Screenshot-2023-01-14-203938.png" alt="Bitcoin (BTC) Price" width="739" height="325" /></p>
<p>While speaking on the current market sentiment, he makes the observation that the bulls are not only euphoric, but they are also acting arrogant. The fact that they feel the need to perpetually celebrate a triumph by ridiculing others demonstrates the lack of strength in their arguments. Therefore, he concludes his analysis by saying that the &#8220;bearish scenario hasn&#8217;t been invalidated&#8221; despite the recent bounce in the price and suggests that securing any kind of profits witnessed in this recent pump would be a wise decision.</p>

Thus, the coin price registered 25% growth over the past two weeks and reached a current price of $20702. This bullish upswing has recently breached a long-coming resistance trendline of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wedge-pattern/">a falling wedge pattern</a>, increasing the possibility of further recovery for coin holders.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bitcoin price has been rising for the past seven consecutive days</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from the long-coming trendline hints at the end of selling on rallies sentiment to buy on the dip.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $16.2 Billion, indicating a 1.5% loss</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/y/YeBG9hdp.png" alt="Bitcoin Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bitcoins 3-day Technical Chart showcases that the second half of 2022 downfall had strictly followed a falling wedge pattern. Thus, under the influence of this pattern, the BTC price marked 2022 low at $15600.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Amid the recent new year recovery in the crypto market and the release of CPI data, the Bitcoin price experienced significant growth within a fortnight. The US Bureau of labor statistics showcased December&#8217;s <a href="https://coingape.com/us-cpi-report-time-for-bitcoin-price-shine/">CPI data to 6.5%</a>, which is down from 7.1% presented in November 2022. Thus, the US inflation easing fueled the ongoing recovery in the crypto market.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On January 12th, the coin price gave a bullish breakout from the overhead trendline, triggering the mentioned bullish pattern. In theory, this pattern’s technical setup will lead a post-breakout rally to the highest swing top, which for Bitcoin is $32000.By the press time, the BTC price currently trades at $20884 and approaches the near resistance of $21500. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, after such a sudden recovery, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">Bitcoin price</a> will likely pull back to stabilize the excess gains. This potential correction may revisit the $19100 to check for price sustainability at the reclaimed high levels. Thus, if the prices witness a pullback, the coin holders should look for a support zone from $19100 to $18400 for entry opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a breakdown below $18400 will weaken the bullish momentum.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/"><strong>RSI</strong>(3-day) slope</a> is on the verge of crossing above the midline, offering additional confirmation of improving market sentiment. Moreover, with the recent price jump, the Bitcoin buyers reclaimed the 20 <strong>EMA</strong> slope, which could provide significant support during the possible pullback.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: 20844</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>

The latest push comes after the <a href="https://coingape.com/us-cpi-report-time-for-bitcoin-price-shine/">U.S. CPI reading</a> came out close to market expectations at 6.5%; which opens up opportunities for asymmetric assets like <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>. However, certain on-chain data is also indicating a growing number of whale activity which is likely acting as a catalyst for BTC&#8217;s positive price swing.</p>
<h2>Massive Whale Accumulation</h2>
<p>On January 14, the price of Bitcoin surpassed $21,000 as investors bet that inflation might have bottomed out or was on the decline. The value of the first <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> in existence, rose by 7.5%, reaching a peak of $21,299. The price hasn&#8217;t been above $20,000 since November 8, and today marked the 11th consecutive day of its growth.</p>
<p>According to a report that was published by Santiment, a behavior analysis platform, the number of Bitcoin (BTC) addresses owning between 100 and 1,000 BTC has been quickly increasing. With the ongoing <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/whale-accumulation/">whale accumulation</a>, the data further states that the price pump will likely have a ripple effect on the wider <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market.</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135396" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/14172200/Screenshot-2023-01-14-172140.png" alt="" width="1279" height="806" /></p>
<p>The chart <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1614096107998707712" rel="nofollow">posted</a> by Santiment reveals that there are over 416 addresses that contain between 100 and 1,000 BTC. This represents an increase of 3.04% in only the last eight weeks. Along with the price increase, BTC’s trading volume has also risen by 38% over the last 24 hours. This has taken the total volume for Bitcoin to roughly $44 billion and a 9.46% increase in <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization/#:~:text=The%20term%20market%20capitalization%20or,coin%20at%20any%20given%20time.">market capitalization</a>, at the time of writing. The price of Bitcoin had been stuck in a narrow range between $16,000 and $17,000 for several weeks prior to the most recent breakthrough.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin (BTC) Price Surge</h2>
<p>According to data obtained from Coinglass, the upward swings have caught shorts off guard with short liquidations exceeding $100 million over the last five days. On January 14th, the highest amount surpassed $296 million. Also, as per IntoTheBlock&#8217;s analytics, exchange flows for Bitcoin and Ethereum have now stabilized. This has been noted as the lowest outflow since the catastrophic <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> crash caused by its founder Sam Bankman-Fried. This shows that concerns about <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/centralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges-cex/">centralized exchanges</a> have also diminished.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135400" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/14173252/Screenshot-2023-01-14-173240.png" alt="" width="901" height="721" /></p>
<p>As things stand, the Bitcoin (BTC) price is currently being traded at $20,739. This represents an increase of 10.23% on the day, in contrast to a gain of 23.12% during the week as per CoinGape’s crypto market tracker. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, had its value increase by as much as 9.7%, while other cryptocurrencies, such as <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cardano/">Cardano</a> and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/dogecoin/">Dogecoin</a>, also saw substantial price hikes.</p>

And they are highly valuable as they were one of the first NFT implementations.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">While the majority of NFTs are images stored on IPFS and recorded on<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/"> blockchain</a>, Cryptopunks are unique in the sense that each of the 10,000 &#8220;punks&#8221; (which are 24×24-pixel images) is coded onto a blockchain.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">Here are some of the amazing facts about the CryptoPunks NFT Collection:</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">1. Cryptopunks, developed by Larva Labs, were given away for free when the project launched in 2017. The sole condition for ownership was an Ethereum wallet.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">2. John Watkinson and Matt Hall are the designers and developers of this NFT collection. The project began as an experiment with the intention of entertaining people, but it rapidly grew into something much larger and more valuable.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135379" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/14160325/Cryptopunks.jpg" alt="Cryptopunks" width="677" height="469" /></p>

<p style="color: #252525">3. Watkinson and Hall modelled the punks on the mid-1970s London punk scene, William Gibson&#8217;s 1984 science fiction novel Neuromancer, the 1982 science fiction film Blade Runner, and the cyberpunk movement ( which originated from the French electronic music duo Daft Punk).</p>
<p style="color: #252525">4. Each of the 10,000 CryptoPunks (6,039 male and 3,840 female) was algorithmically created by computer code, thus no two characters are precisely same, with certain attributes being rarer than others.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135386" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/14161306/cryptopunks-collection.jpg" alt="Cryptopunks " width="684" height="514" /></p>

<p style="color: #252525">5. There are 696 punks wearing hot lipstick and 303 with muttonchops. There are 286 punks wearing 3-D glasses, 128 with rosy cheeks, 94 with pigtails, 78 with buck teeth, and 44 with a beanie.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">6. The majority of the 10,000 cryptopunks are humans; however, there are three special types: zombies (88), apes (24), and aliens (9).</p>
<p style="color: #252525">7. The blockchain developers, working for Larva Labs, gave away 9,000 cryptopunks for free, while they kept 1,000.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">8. Celebrities like Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, and Serena Williams, among others, own CryptoPunks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135384" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/14161105/Cryptopunks-Gogg.jpg" alt="Cryptopunks Snoop Dogg" width="1192" height="625" /></p>
<p style="color: #252525">9. An anonymous user sent CryptoPunk #5364 to the Ukraine government&#8217;s public Ethereum wallet address on March 2, 2022, as a donation to help fund the Ukrainian government&#8217;s defence against the Russian invasion.</p>

Its 24 hour trading volume is up by 195% to stand at $2.76 billion.</p>
<p>The largest cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum prices surged by 10% over the past day. However, the cumulative went on regain the crucial $1 trillion mark.</p>

Up +22% in the past 2 hours alone, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SOL&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$SOL</a> has been fueled by liquidated shorts. <a href="https://t.co/ibrLUL8beD">https://t.co/ibrLUL8beD</a> <a href="https://t.co/58AfM44qPu">pic.twitter.com/58AfM44qPu</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Santiment (@santimentfeed) <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1614088442702618627?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The blockchain intelligence firm Santiment reported that the Solana price printed more than 22% of its 24-hour gains over the previous day in just 2 hours. The tweet continued by saying that a lot of short positions were liquidated, which gave SOL a boost.</p>

<h2>Solana&#8217;s Price Increased by 40%</h2>
<p>Solana’s price at the time of writing is $23.66, with a market capitalization of $ 12.6 B and a 24-hour trading volume up by 167%. Now it stands at $2.5 B. At the same time, the circulating supply is approximately 370,622,178 SOL as per the crypto market tracker CoinMarketCap.</p>

<p>Due to the <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/is-ftx-crash-an-end-of-crypto-how-this-debacle-unfolded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX crisis</a></strong>, the SOL course appears to be significantly undervalued at the moment. Solana is generally regarded as a very volatile cryptocurrency. For instance, the network was occasionally overvalued in 2021. The price currently doesn&#8217;t seem to be in line with what Solana has to offer in terms of potential.</p>
<h3>Binance funding rate</h3>
<p>The chart Santiment included in today&#8217;s tweet demonstrates that traders on Binance have exhibited a bias toward shorting over the past few months. SOL&#8217;s price was able to recover from the bottom it reached $8 about two weeks ago. The tweet claims that the bounce was supported by the liquidated short positions.</p>
<h3>Solana Price Daily Chart</h3>
<p>SOL&#8217;s price is presently trading above both the 20-day and 9-day EMA lines. Additionally, the 9-day EMA line, which is bullishly positioned above the longer 20-day EMA line, is supporting the price of the asset.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Sam Bankman-Fried asked FTX co-founder Gary Wang to create a &#8220;secret&#8221; backdoor that enabled Alameda Research to borrow $65 billion of customers&#8217; money from the defunct crypto exchange, FTX lawyer said.

<p>Gary Wang, who has<a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-alameda-ceo-caroline-ftx-co-founder-plead-guilty-cftc-sec-charges/"> pleaded guilty</a> for his involvement in FTX collapse, was told to create a &#8220;backdoor” for Alameda to borrow from customers on the exchange without permission,&#8221; said FTX lawyer Andrew Dietderich.</p>
<h2>Alameda had backdoor access to FTX customers’ funds</h2>
<p>Andrew Dietderic told bankruptcy court in Delaware that Wang created this backdoor by inserting a single number into millions of lines of code for the exchange, creating a line of credit from FTX to Alameda, without customers’ consent. The limit of that credit line was $65 billion, the lawyer added, as per NYPost <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://nypost.com/2023/01/13/sam-bankman-fried-of-ftx-ordered-secret-backdoor-of-credit/" rel="nofollow">report. </a></p>
<p>Earlier, similar allegations were made by CFTC against the crypto exchange founders. However, the CFTC did not mention how much funds Alameda had access to. At the same time, reports surfaced claiming that SBF moved $10 billion between the two companies, and $2 billion remained unaccounted for.</p>
<p>In his press run later last year, SBF denied all such claims of building a backdoor access in FTX.</p>
<h2>SBF used backdoor accessed funds to spend on luxury</h2>
<p>FTX lawyer further revealed in court that Alameda used those $65 billion back door accessed funds to buy planes, houses, throw parties, and make political donations. Court filings disclose that SBF spent nearly $40 million on hotels, travel, food and luxury items in just nine months. FTX employees in the Bahamas had perks including free travel to anywhere in the world at the FTX office. Millions of dollars were spent on meals and entertainment just a few months before FTX filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>SBF recently filed in a court <a href="https://coingape.com/sbf-seeks-to-block-ftx-debtors-from-taking-robinhood-shares/">seeking to block FTX creditors</a> from taking his Robinhood shares worth $450 million.</p>

Its trading volume is up by 81%, and in the last 7 days, its price surged by 101%. However, the recent price surge is the direct result of the back-to-back updates from the Gala Games.</p>
<p>GALA token has been in the trend due to its recent announcement of a collaboration with &#8220;The Rock&#8221;. Its price registered a massive surge of nearly 70% on Monday, reaching its highest level since September 13 at around $0.05.</p>
<h3>GALA Games Tunning with Spider Tank</h3>
<p>In the most recent update, <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/gala-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GALA Games</a></strong> confirms that they are working with Spider Tanks to make the gameplay and earning easier. There were significant improvements suggested. 2 $Silk can now be transferred per day, increasing the player&#8217;s honor. Any action that raises your honor score will earn you 25% more honor.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some updates on <a href="https://twitter.com/spider_tanks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@spider_tanks</a> from Benefactor! It is now easier to earn in Spider Tanks! Honor is working, so, as promised, we are tuning it. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PlayToEarn?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PlayToEarn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PlayAndEarn?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PlayAndEarn</a> just got a lot easier! Big changes coming to the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GALA&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$GALA</a> ecosystem! <a href="https://t.co/qLdeW8s59b">pic.twitter.com/qLdeW8s59b</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Gala Games (@GoGalaGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/GoGalaGames/status/1613974022697684992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, now every new player will receive 300 honors. These modifications will enhance the game. Following this announcement, GALA prices began to rise.</p>
<h2>GALA Price increases</h2>
<figure id="attachment_135347" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-135347" style="width: 1161px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-135347" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/14121154/GALA_1D_graph_coinmarketcap3.jpg" alt="GALA Price" width="1161" height="500" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-135347" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Coinmarketcap</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gala’s price at the time of writing is $0.04988, with a market capitalization of $ 1.77 B and a 24-hour trading volume up by 81%. Now it stands at $917 million. At the same time, the circulating supply is approximately 6,977,205,436 GALA as per the <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a></strong> tracker CoinMarketCap.</p>
<h3>Earlier Gala Games collaborated with The Rock</h3>
<p>American actors The Rock and Mark Wahlberg have teamed up with The Gala Games to produce a few movies. Twitter was used to announce this partnership.</p>
<p>The new movies are created at GoGalaFilms, which also houses the GoGalaMusic music label. The emergence of GALA as the fuel token for GoGalaFilms and GoGalaMusic was good news for the <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency</a></strong>.  After some time, Gala Games removes the tweet that announced their agreement with the rock.</p>
<p>However, the now-deleted tweet stated,</p>
<blockquote><p>“You’ve seen their work on screen, but I think their presence might be even more powerful off the screen and we are so happy to get the chance to work with them,”.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the technical charts, the Gala prices have experienced a significant uptrend along with higher volume, which suggests that some institutional buyers may have taken long positions. In the upcoming months, expect outperformance as well.</p>
