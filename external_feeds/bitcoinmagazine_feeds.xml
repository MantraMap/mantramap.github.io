VP of Research at Riot Platforms Pierre Rochard <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinPierre/status/1663587667764736001?s=20">expressed gratitude</a> to everyone involved, stating, "Texas will continue to be #Bitcoin country!"</p><p>These legislative outcomes will contribute to the growth and stability of Bitcoin mining operations in Texas. As Brian Morgenstern, head of public policy at Riot Platforms <a href="https://twitter.com/MorgensternNJ/status/1663601172651835425?s=20">reported</a>, SB 1751 did not pass, ensuring the continuation of the state's usage of Bitcoin miners’ flexibility in balancing and stabilizing the power grid. </p><p>In contrast, SB 1929 successfully passed, establishing a registration process for Bitcoin miners to share information with ERCOT, enhancing transparency and grid reliability. Additionally, HB 591 was approved, providing a tax incentive for utilizing gas that would otherwise be flared into the atmosphere for on-site Bitcoin mining, promoting emissions reduction.</p><p>Another significant development was the passing of HB 1666, which introduced a proof-of-reserves regime, positioning Texas as a leader in building confidence within the digital asset ecosystem. These legislative achievements reflect the collaborative efforts of various stakeholders and industry participants, including Riot Platforms, The Texas Blockchain Council and the Chamber of Digital Commerce according to Morgenstern.</p><p>In addition to these developments, public miner stocks also surged on the news that the U.S. debt ceiling deal may be finalized soon, and that it does not include President Joe Biden’s <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/biden-administration-proposes-30-tax-on-energy-used-by-bitcoin-miners">proposed 30% tax</a> on energy used for Bitcoin mining. </p><p>While these successes mark important milestones, advocates acknowledge that their work is far from over. But the Bitcoin community remains optimistic about the future and the continued growth of the industry, with the positive outcomes achieved in Texas during this legislative session setting a favorable precedent for Bitcoin-related policies and innovation in the United States.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg1MDk0MzA2Njg2NjQxNDk3/img_7058.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Paxful Announces Appointment Of Interim CEO Roshan Dharia]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dharia will act as CEO as the exchange continues its transition from previous leadership under Ray Youssef.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/paxful-announces-appointment-of-interim-ceo-roshan-dharia</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/paxful-announces-appointment-of-interim-ceo-roshan-dharia</guid><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[CEO]]></category><category><![CDATA[Paxful]]></category><category><![CDATA[Exchanges]]></category><category><![CDATA[peer to peer]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 20:12:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg4MTEzNjMyOTkzNzQ4ODg1/img_0295.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="http://paxful.com/">Paxful</a>, a global peer-to-peer Bitcoin platform, has announced the appointment of Roshan Dharia as the new Interim Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately.

Just a month ago, The New York Times published a malicious <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html">article</a> on Bitcoin mining’s energy usage. Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts has repeatedly attacked Bitcoin from a variety of angles, going so far as to launch an “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/14/elizabeth-warren-anti-crypto-ftx-00082624">anti-crypto army</a>” targeting Bitcoin as a hazard to consumers, all while misleading the public on the environmental impact of Bitcoin. </p><p>These verbal assaults are not isolated and the examples above represent only a small piece of the uphill climb Bitcoin has to mass adoption. To put it mildly, Bitcoin is disrupting countless industries, making centralized authorities fearful of losing their monopoly on money and the power that accompanies it. Bitcoin essentially “calls the bluff” on corrupt bureaucrats and infinitely-inflatable fiat currencies that further enrich those who own assets while eating away at the purchasing power of those living paycheck to paycheck. Because Bitcoin is location-agnostic and capable of utilizing flexible loads, it naturally increases demand for the cheapest energy sources, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-uses-mostly-sustainable-energy">which are often stranded natural gas or renewables</a>. </p><p>So, why do many elected officials and companies attempt to denigrate and work to outlaw Bitcoin mining? Likely because their egos prevent them from understanding the value proposition of Bitcoin, but the facts speak for themselves. </p><p>Alana Mediavilla is a wife, mother, entrepreneur, business owner, filmmaker and Bitcoiner. She has a hell of a resume and a passion for storytelling. Armed with her knowledge of Bitcoin and skillset, Mediavilla decided to film and produce the documentary “<a href="https://www.dirtycointhemovie.com/">Dirty Coin</a>,” which highlights the value of Bitcoin mining while simultaneously busting the theory that Bitcoin mining is bad for the environment. </p><p>It was a privilege to hear her story and I know you will find her passion for Bitcoin inspiring.</p><p><strong>What is your professional background?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I've been an artist and entrepreneur my whole life. Couldn't help it. Started my production company in Silicon Valley 11 years ago and got recruited to be a video producer at Google Cloud for almost five years while I moonlit still running my creative agency for other big tech folks. In 2021, I parted my full-time ways with Google to focus my efforts on my company and my own IP and films.</p><p><strong>How did you first learn about Bitcoin and what categorically drew you to it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I learned about Bitcoin during my daughter's ballet class in Campbell, California. A friend of mine that also had his daughter in the same class told me to buy as much as I could waste on bitcoin that week. He told me it would go up, so I degened into Bitcoin. That got me paying attention to it and when my Cuban grandfather told me he knew people sending bitcoin to Cuba, I dug into what the heck Bitcoin really was. What I found out blew my mind and continues to do so to this day.</p><p><strong>How do you typically respond to those who are dismissive of Bitcoin, especially those close to you?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I make a feature documentary explaining my position to them XD.</p><p>It's understandable to be against Bitcoin. Crypto is a clown show and many don't see the difference between Bitcoin and shitcoins. Add to that that many people were raised with an energy scarcity mentality so having some crypto "hog all the energy" definitely sounds alarming. The issue is that this is just not the case. Is the industry perfect? Hell no! But are we scrutinizing the energy use of other industries the same way? Are we studied enough to know about the situations where having an energy-hungry industry like Bitcoin mining can be a good thing, as in the cases with flare mitigation or becoming a buyer of last resort in the middle of nowhere?</p><p>Understanding more factual information about the space can't help but create better conversations about Bitcoin.</p><p><strong>In your opinion, why is it important to close the gender gap in Bitcoin interest and adoption?</strong></p><p>Bitcoin is for everyone. Closing the gender gap is bringing diversity of users and advocates into Bitcoin. Women are particularly good at influencing their social circles and communities. More women in the Bitcoin space means more women advocating for Bitcoin in a grassroots way. We need all kinds of people to root for financial sovereignty and that starts with conversations around the dinner table that mothers are very often responsible for leading. Whether a woman is financially independent or supporting her partner who is taking on that responsibility for the family, women understanding the importance of Bitcoin means more support to other women, people in their community, and most importantly, their families.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Becca Bratcher.

In exchange, they are paid after presenting proof of their monster kills to the monarchy. </p><p>It was a fairly overt critique of the military industrial complex, though the deeper theme that I saw was the toxic effects that the media propaganda complex has on a society, reducing peoples’ ability to exercise discernment, and obscuring objective truth. </p><h2>Learn History Or Repeat It</h2><p>I think the reason why “The Sea Beast”<em> </em>had such an impact on me is because at its core, it is a story of what can happen to society when truth becomes obscured by revisionist history and propaganda. In the end, it was up to individuals to exercise discernment, and break the societal trance that had been propagating violence for generations. In the end, the rulers only ever had power because the people had allowed them to.</p><p>American culture and history is rich with individualism and critical thought, such as the idea that taxation without representation is immoral. This ideal <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/no-taxation-without-representation">ultimately led to the Revolutionary War which founded this country</a>. But now, people are afraid to have real and engaging conversations, especially in public, because it might be considered “wrong think” or offensive, ultimately leading to the cancellation of their public lives and digital exile.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/midyreyes/status/1629917053808148486"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>Bitcoin reinvigorates many things, but the most important I think is the discernment of truth.</p><p>Bitcoin is fundamentally an exercise in regaining your power of discernment. One must sift through a slew of propaganda and fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) in order to learn the truth and see true value. The journey that one must take in order to truly understand Bitcoin necessitates discernment and critical thought. And once we reach a critical mass, the intransigent minority becomes entrenched in the culture.</p><p>Furthermore, once you are able to store your hard-earned wealth in a self-sovereign way, the courage to speak freely becomes self evident. No more are the worries of cancellation and debanking. The changes in time preference as well will likely increase your savings rate, making people more financially stable and less fearful of leaving or losing a job that may be holding them back. </p><h2>‘You Can Be A Hero But Still Be Wrong.’</h2><p>I know that many Bitcoiners criticize the military and governments especially. They detest war in all its forms and hope to bring about the end of it with the dawn of a new, hard-money standard. This is, of course, a worthy goal. But I must urge Bitcoiners to separate the service members from the policy decisions they are charged with executing. </p><p>According to analysis from Jordan Peterson that I have seen, one of the main reasons individuals join the military is the desire to find meaning and purpose in life. Peterson argues that young men often lack a clear sense of direction and purpose, and the structure and discipline of military life can provide them with a sense of belonging and fulfillment. Additionally, the military can offer opportunities for personal growth, challenge and adventure, as well as providing a sense of pride and accomplishment.</p><p>Many have died in the pursuit, hence the day of remembrance that we celebrate on Memorial Day. And yet, some much-needed criticism has been quashed in the name of the troops. </p><p>The line, “You can be a hero and still be wrong” from “The Sea Beast” was especially striking in this context. Without the ability to see objective facts, it is difficult to ascertain objective truth. Discernment is a skill, a skill that has atrophied drastically throughout society in the passing years. It is perhaps one of the reasons why cries for the government to protect us have grown so loud.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/mindingottawa/status/1629959701227077633"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>There is no truth without debate and disagreement, characterizations of which have been elevated from being uncomfortable to becoming outright unsafe. And yet, creeping protectionism has its costs as well; the slow erosion of freedoms that we may never get back. The very freedoms that many service members have died to protect, the very service members who we are charged with remembering on Memorial Day. </p><p>If we are to remember and honor those sacrifices, perhaps the best way to do so in the current age is to exercise our discernment. Critical thinking is a skill that can be learned, or relearned in certain cases. Bitcoin helps those seeking to regain responsibility in their lives, and yes, exercise some critical thinking in order to discern fact from fiction, propaganda from news. </p><p>Bitcoin reinvigorates critical thought, critical thought leads to truth. Some have the humility to accept it. Others have to be slapped across the face with it, ultimately experiencing the pain of ego death. Truth is the only way to honor the fallen. Have the courage to choose truth, and live not by lies. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Mickey Koss.

Suddenly, a crisis hits. This could be the rise of an autocratic regime, a democide or an armed conflict. Whatever the circumstances, you will most likely have two pressing problems on your mind. First and foremost, you need to get everyone to safety, preferably abroad. Second, you need to preserve as much of your savings as possible to set up your life elsewhere. Since a safe escape from a disaster-stricken country depends heavily on individual circumstances, this article will focus on a savings preservation strategy that is globally applicable.</p><h2>Preserving Your Savings The Traditional Way</h2><p>Protecting the value of one’s savings while fleeing a country has never been easy. Those fortunate enough to have had any wealth before a crisis strikes may find it difficult to save it when there is a sudden need to leave the country.</p><h3>Real Estate</h3><p>So, you own your house, and chances are that you have benefited greatly from the easy money policies of the past decade as it has grown a lot in value over the years. You may be moderately well off on paper, but how easy is it to actually turn your house into money in a short time frame? The market demand might be heavily impacted by the very crisis that is forcing you to flee — for example in a case of foreign invasion, the demand for houses in the affected region will come to a halt, while the number of homeowners looking to sell will skyrocket. So, unless you foresaw a crisis looming ahead and sold before others, chances are you won’t be able to extract much of your home’s value when you need it the most.</p><h3>Savings In The Bank</h3><p>But let’s say you had good foresight and sold your house in time. Now you have a lot of money in the bank. Again, if the crisis affects the entire country, chances are you won't be able to withdraw or move your money fast enough. There are many examples in history where a "bank holiday" was announced and depositors were denied their money when they needed it the most. One of the more recent examples comes from Lebanon, where <a href="https://apnews.com/article/financial-services-lebanon-business-8ca0f73931d60e36c1dd7d40e77c25de">banks simply shut their doors and ATMs</a> to prevent clients from withdrawing their money in the midst of an ongoing economic crisis. If you think you can protect yourself against a national currency’s devaluation by owning a dollar account, you better think twice: In Lebanon, the dollar accounts were forcefully converted to a Lebanese pound that had <a href="https://apnews.com/article/financial-services-lebanon-business-8ca0f73931d60e36c1dd7d40e77c25de">lost 97% of its value against the dollar since 2019</a>. In fact, bank accounts may not be safe anywhere, as banks around the world operate in fractional-reserve mode, making them vulnerable to runs and subsequent collapses. Recent collapses of a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/03/17/regulators-shut-down-banks-raising-questions-about-neutrality/?sh=ddc2b5b71853">trio of U.S. banks</a> — Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank — have proven this vulnerability.</p><p>However, it's worth noting that there is usually a several days’ delay between an emerging crisis and a full-blown bank holiday. If you suspect that banks might prohibit you from accessing your money soon, you can use this window of opportunity to withdraw your money in the form of cash or quickly convert it into bitcoin while it's still possible.</p><h3>Cash</h3><p>Let’s say you withdrew all of your money and kept it in cash. Hopefully, it’s in dollars or euros, as otherwise it might be hard to find a use for your local currency abroad, especially if the crisis that forced you to leave impacts the exchange rate, as it often does — the Ukrainian hryvnia<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/ukraines-central-bank-devalues-hryvnia-by-25-against-us-dollar-2022-07-21/"> has devalued by 25%</a> since the start of the Russian invasion. </p><p>Traveling with large amounts of dollars or euros also involves risks, though. The first of those is a risk of theft, either by common criminals or corrupt border patrols. The second risk is that, if you’re traveling with cash worth more than $10,000 or the equivalent in euros, you need to declare them when crossing the borders of many countries, <a href="https://help.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-195?language=en_US">including the U.S.</a> Failure to declare can result in the confiscation of the full amount. </p><p>Did you know that the U.S. customs guards confiscate more than $200,000 from travelers <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/dulles-cbp-officers-seize-over-350k-during-14-currency-reporting">on average every day</a>? And if you do in fact declare that you’re traveling with large amounts of cash, you never know where that information might end up — sensitive data that is collected can also leak. For example, in 2020, there was <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2020/03/us-property-records-database.html">a major leak of detailed personal data</a>, including the property records of 200 million Americans. Criminals can use this data for targeted attacks.</p><p>Cash is also getting gradually useless in the western world. In the euro area, cash usage <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2022/html/ecb.pr221220~62a7c988ef.en.html">fell</a> from accounting for 72% of all point-of-sale transactions in 2019 to 59% in 2022, and this trend is encouraged by governments that impose strict cash limits. So, even if you make it abroad with your savings in the form of cash, you’ll likely need to set up a bank account fast, which might not be a straightforward or easy task for a new migrant.</p><h3>Gold</h3><p>Gold used to be the most popular way to transfer value intact in the past, given that it has a worldwide demand and can be sold at relatively little discount (assuming investment-grade coins or bars are being used). Gold is also quite dense in value, as the price of 1 kilogram of gold is <a href="https://www.chards.co.uk/gold-price/weekly-gold-price-usd-per-kilo">around $60,000 at the time of this writing</a>. Otherwise, it faces the same risks as cash as it can be easily stolen along the way. Moreover, gold isn’t accepted as a means of payment and isn’t divisible, so you’d need to exchange your full coins or bars into the local currency after you arrive in your destination country.</p><h3>Stocks And Bonds</h3><p>Stocks and bonds are great fair-weather instruments, but they might become as useless as bank accounts when things get hairy. Local stocks and bonds will likely be worthless abroad and their value might be impacted by the given crisis. International financial instruments (e.g., U.S.-based exchange-traded funds) would fare better, though such instruments aren’t available in most parts of the world. And even if they are available to you, access to these instruments may be affected by newly-imposed sanctions.</p><h2>Does Bitcoin Fix This?</h2><p>You might have noticed that all of the usual instruments for wealth preservation have common traits in the form of limited transferability and/or value tied to a specific location or jurisdiction. Physical instruments such as cash and gold always carry a risk of loss or theft along the way, while intangible instruments such as real estate, bank accounts and stocks are, for the most part, valuable only locally.</p><p>Bitcoin indeed fixes this.</p><p>First, bitcoin is intangible and is therefore very easy to transfer. You can either send bitcoin to anyone globally within minutes, or you can remember the recovery seed and literally carry the bitcoin in your head (though that carries its specific risks as well, as we’ll cover below). Compared to other intangible assets, such as bank or brokerage accounts, there is no counterparty risk — you never need to worry about your money becoming inaccessible due to bank holidays, institutional failures or newly-imposed sanctions.</p><p>Second, bitcoin is a global asset, and as such, its value isn’t linked to any specific jurisdiction. A good example of this fact is the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/latest-china-ban-impacting-bitcoin">2021 bitcoin mining ban in China</a>, which seemed like a big deal at the time, since most bitcoin mining operations were located in China. Nevertheless, bitcoin miners simply moved elsewhere, and there was virtually no impact on the price (on the contrary, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/how-china-ban-improved-bitcoin-in-2021">bitcoin reached new highs several months after the ban</a>). Bitcoin is a global asset, but unlike gold, it can be bought or sold in all kinds of ways — on regulated exchanges, on decentralized exchanges, in ATMs, or from person to person; and the chances are, you will face a minimum spread on your exchanges.</p><p>Bitcoin’s intangibility, zero reliance on third parties and global liquidity makes it a perfect candidate for savings preservation in critical situations.</p><p>So, what are the specific methods for using bitcoin when fleeing a country?</p><h2>Traveling With Bitcoin Safely</h2><p>The main concern when traveling with bitcoin is to eliminate a single point of failure. If you just write down your recovery seed and put it in your back pocket, you undertake a great risk, as anyone who sees, takes or photographs your recovery seed has the ability to steal all your bitcoin. To travel safely with bitcoin, you need to minimize the possibility of loss or theft. Below are some tips on how to tackle this problem.</p><h3>Bitcoin In Your Mind</h3><p>To keep access to your bitcoin, the only thing you need to do is remember your recovery seed i.e., an ordered list of English words that is either 12- or 24-words long. Remembering 12 words is obviously easier than remembering 24 words, so it’s advisable to go for that option (e.g., by generating your seed on a Trezor Model T, which supports this format). Use a memory-enhancement technique such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci">memory palace</a>. If you’re traveling with your family, have all the family members remember the same recovery seed; that way, if someone forgets some of the words, you’ll still be able to reconstruct the full seed.</p><p>After you memorize your seed, try recovering your bitcoin in an offline wallet, preferably a hardware device (on Trezor devices, you can perform a<a href="https://trezor.io/learn/a/test-recovery-seed-on-model-t"> dry run recovery</a> that doesn’t wipe the device). Once you’re certain you have your recovery seed firmly embedded in your memory, wipe the wallet. If you want to carry your hardware wallet with you on your travels, make sure it is wiped, so that if you lose it or someone takes it away from you, there will be no possibility of its misuse.</p><p>On arrival, recover your bitcoin again in the wallet of your choice (make sure you type in your seed in an offline environment though!).</p><p>Don’t rely on your memory for longer periods. Traveling in an adversarial environment is the only situation when relying on your memory might be a good idea, but aim to minimize the time span in which you store your recovery seed in your head. For long-term storage, always write your seed down, or better yet, stamp or engrave it into steel (there are many products for this on the market; before you make a purchase, I recommend checking out <a href="https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/">Jameson Lopp’s stress tests</a>).</p><h3>Relying On Your Web Of Trust</h3><p>Another way to transfer your wealth via bitcoin is to simply send it as a bitcoin transaction to someone you trust. The person doesn’t even have to be in the country you aim to travel to; the important thing is that they will be able to keep your bitcoin safe during your travels, and send it back to you when you’re able to set up your new wallet in a safe environment. The most important factor here is trust. This may be off-putting to some (after all, we all know the mantra of “don’t trust, verify”), but the fact is that for some people this may be the way to go if they don’t want to rely on their memory and are certain that the person on the other side would never betray them. The person you’re sending your bitcoin to needs to be proficient in bitcoin, and ideally should own a well backed-up hardware wallet — after all, you don’t want them to hold your life savings on their mobile phones, right?</p><p>If you want to increase the security of this process, you can do so via a multisig wallet. Let’s say you set up a two-out-of-three multisig wallet and transfer your bitcoin into such a wallet. Now you can send one of the keys to Person A, the second one to Person B and carry the third one with you. Person A and Person B shouldn’t know about each other, so that there is no way to steal the bitcoin that is stored in this way. And if you lose your key during your travels, you will still be able to recover your bitcoin using the keys of Person A and Person B. You can set up your multisig wallet using Electrum, Sparrow or Nunchuk. To distribute the keys, make sure to use a secure, encrypted communicator such as <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318911-How-do-I-know-my-communication-is-private-#:~:text=Signal%20messages%20and%20calls%20cannot,encrypted%2C%20private%2C%20and%20secure.">Signal</a> messenger (do not use Telegram, as it <a href="https://usa.kaspersky.com/blog/telegram-why-nobody-uses-secret-chats/27662/#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20Telegram%20chats%20do,about%20the%20secure%20chat%20option.">isn’t encrypted by default!</a>).</p><p>Alternatively, you can utilize a Shamir backup, a cryptographically-sound method for splitting your recovery seed into multiple shares (use time-tested wallets such as the Trezor Model T to do this safely). Let’s say you do a two-out-of-three Shamir backup — the next steps are the same as we described above with multisigs. It’s advisable to reinforce the security of your Shamir backup by setting up a <a href="https://trezor.io/learn/a/passphrases-and-hidden-wallets">passphrase</a> on top of it.</p><h3>Plausible Deniability</h3><p>Ideally, there should be no indication that you are a Bitcoiner. That means carrying no hardware wallets, having no Bitcoin stickers on your laptop or phone, not carrying any Bitcoin books and deleting any Bitcoin/cryptocurrency apps from your phone. Do not talk about bitcoin with strangers or the border guards. If someone asks a seemingly-innocent question about bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, act ignorant or just say that you think it’s a scam. Simply said, you should look and act as a “normie.”</p><h3>Do Not Rely On Exchanges</h3><p>Some readers might be tempted to use their bitcoin exchange account — after all, you can log into it from anywhere in the world, right? I personally strongly advise against relying on exchanges with any portion of your savings. Aside from frequent exchange failures (just in the last twelve months, we saw the collapses of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">FTX</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy">Celsius</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy">BlockFi</a>, and a <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/gemini-earn-users-lose-savings">freeze on Gemini Earn users</a>), the exchange may block your funds, for example, because of sanctions or logging in from an IP address in a "wrong" country. In short, if you hold your bitcoin on an exchange, you don't really own it.</p><h2>Not Just A Theory Anymore</h2><p>Bitcoin is already used as a means of preserving one's savings in times of crisis. In recent years, we have seen success stories of this kind from countries as diverse as <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-financial-freedom-in-afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/opinion/sunday/venezuela-bitcoin-inflation-cryptocurrencies.html"> Venezuela</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/23/ukrainian-flees-to-poland-with-2000-in-bitcoin-on-usb-drive.html">Ukraine</a>. Due to its global liquidity and direct controllability, bitcoin is proving to be a valuable tool in critical situations. The more knowledgeable you are about the safe transfer of bitcoin, the better prepared you'll be in the event of such a situation arising.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Josef Tětek.

It should be noted that no investor worth their salt would tell you to put your life savings into crypto, but there is plenty of upside potential for those looking to make long-term returns or preserve a portion of their wealth this way.</p><p>Let me just mention a few of these advantages that make this investment in bitcoin worth looking more deeply into:</p><ul><li>Alternative store of value: Bitcoin is as good as it gets when looking for a store of value outside of third-party manipulation. Being decentralized means that it circumvents many of the red-tape aspects and fees that come with leaving your money in the hands of financial institutions. As a result, it is not subject to the same inflationary pressures that are so prevalent with companies operating in the government-controlled fiat currency system.</li><li>Potential for long-term growth: There is no doubt that bitcoin's value is extremely volatile in the short term, but its long-term trend has historically been a fairly bullish affair. The idea of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hodl.asp">HODLing</a> comes into play here, as you will really only be able to see the true value of your investment when ignoring the spikes and holding on for dear life.</li><li>Diversification: As I said before, investing in bitcoin does not mean that you dump all of your hard-earned eggs into the chaotic basket that is crypto, but you can provide some much-needed, future-oriented diversification for your investment portfolio. As <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/30/bitcoins-correlation-with-stocks-is-at-its-lowest-since-2021-as-investors-grapple-with-the-cryptocurrencys-narrative-shift.html">bitcoin's price is increasingly uncorrelated to those of traditional assets</a>, such as stocks and bonds, adding some of these digital coins to your portfolio can help spread out the overall risks that your investments might face from the old guard. In fact, what we have seen over the past few years is that bitcoin has become a new sort of semi-safe-haven asset class which many investors flock to the moment that old-school investment vehicles and fiat currencies come under pressure.</li><li>Accessibility: This goes down two lanes. On the one side, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2023/02/14/how-to-invest-in-bitcoin-for-beginners/?sh=25ed62097697">investing in bitcoin is becoming easier to do</a>, with many platforms and exchanges now offering a simple and secure way to buy and hold your BTC; while at the same time, it has never been easier to liquidate this asset and get fiat cash in hand when the need arises. This scores a massive point over the stock, bond or real estate markets, which are forever plagued by liquidity issues; especially in times of large-scale financial instability.</li></ul><p>In the long run, spending a share of your income on BTC is unlikely to make you poor. On the flip side, not allocating anything to BTC might ruin your prosperity, especially in these uncertain times when <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/what-caused-silicon-valley-banks-failure-2023-03-10/">banks can go bust without warning</a>,<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/09/09/cotw-how-food-and-energy-are-driving-the-global-inflation-surge"> inflation seems to be ever on the rise</a> and several countries <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/as-peso-inflates-argentina-needs-bitcoin">witness their fiat currencies turn into toilet paper.</a></p><h2>Why I Don’t Buy Or Mine BTC</h2><p>In the pursuit of acquiring bitcoin, there are always the obvious channels of hitting up some form of cryptocurrency exchange or peer-to-peer marketplace and just exchanging fiat for BTC. While there is nothing wrong with this approach, and it might be the easiest and perhaps the only option for many people out there, it is, in my humble opinion, not the best way to get your coins for wealth preservation. </p><p>You could instead go the route of the miner and spend a large fortune on buying all the equipment needed to try and get some BTC that way, but in this day and age with the <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/the-cost-of-mining-bitcoin-in-198-different-countries/">average mining cost per coin being over $30,000 in many countries</a>, it is more likely that you will end up with zilch long before you ever mine your first coin.</p><p>So, what would I suggest? Earn it.</p><p>Sure, not everyone can convince their boss to pay them in bitcoin, but these days, many people have a side hustle that can easily be employed in generating some digital dosh. Five years ago, offering your clients the ability to pay in crypto for your services was a nonexistent concept, but <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1290483/crypto-payment-acceptance-by-industry/">today, it is a no-brainer</a>. Right now, a large number of my clients, especially those operating in the online world, are really into paying for services via crypto. While most of them like to use stablecoins such as USDT, you can easily flip these over to BTC and keep padding your Bitcoin wallet.</p><p>One more notable online activity that I partake in to stack some BTC is for the over-18-year-olds only. No, I don’t mean OnlyFans. I do some work in and around the gambling industry and also enjoy a bit of a gamble myself from time to time, but I solely gamble for BTC. </p><p><a href="https://cryptobetting.net/online-gambling-industry-growth-infographic/">Bitcoin betting sites have been gaining traction lately</a>, thanks to their ability to protect privacy, offer deals (e.g., bonuses, commissions, etc.) and general improvements over the annoying bureaucracy inherent in fiat betting sites. Obviously, I don't recommend gambling to anyone, but this is something I enjoy occasionally, such as when my favorite UFC fighter jumps into the octagon, as it adds a bit of excitement while watching the fights, and obviously, the winnings are added to my wealth-preservation BTC fund. </p><h2>My BTC Wealth Preservation Strategy</h2><p>You might be wondering why I am hammering on bitcoin and not paying much heed to the rest of the crypto pack. Frankly, as <a href="https://www.cityam.com/price-of-bitcoin-slips-as-other-cryptocurrencies-follow-suit/">most of the top tokens are following the bitcoin price like a donkey chasing a carrot</a>, I don’t typically diversify things or allocate a share of my crypto investments into other major coins and tokens. Don’t get me wrong, I believe that some of the cryptocurrencies out there are useful, but, as bitcoin is what determines the value of many of the top dogs on the list, sticking with BTC as my investment coin just makes sense. (For those keen on diversifying into other crypto projects, I do have one bit of advice; stay away from meme and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shitcoin.asp">shitcoins</a>.) </p><p>Now, let’s get down to business. Here is my advice for preserving wealth via bitcoin based on my own strategy:</p><ul><li>Plan: Whether you are investing with fiat currencies that you get from working a day job or getting paid directly in crypto via your own projects, make sure to have a well-defined goal. Set certain annual or even quarterly amounts that you would like to reach and try your best to make it happen. </li><li>Don't panic: Always work on increasing your BTC holdings and be ready to HODL until kingdom comes. Don't pay much attention to the fiat value and don't panic sell just because you see some of those crazy price swings that bitcoin is so famous for. It is all good and well to compare exchanges and cryptocurrencies, but do not sit there stressing about where the price of BTC is sitting. Short-term dips are bound to come and go, but if you believe in BTC as much as I do, then you can rest assured that your wealth is being preserved. Keep in mind that there are only 21M BTC available, ever. As this is a finite supply and the <a href="https://www.census.gov/popclock/world">world's population is close to eight billion</a>, with more people being added every day, the value of this asset is sure to increase over time as more governments and people take hold of this new shift in finance. If and when fiat finally goes completely bust and bitcoin takes over as the major currency, an average BTC per capita in the world is going to be around 0.0025, and you most certainly want to be in the top 5% of those holding it.</li><li>Keep it secure: Bitcoin is digital, and hackers are always on the lookout for those who are not keeping a watchful eye on their money. So, to preserve my wealth safely, I keep all of my bitcoin holdings in hardware wallets stashed in a safe place. There are plenty of good exchanges and hot wallets to choose from, but if you are serious about preserving your wealth, keep it cold, keep it offline.</li></ul><h2>Why You Shouldn’t Wait To Diversify</h2><p>Allocating a portion of your wealth to bitcoin can be an effective way to preserve it, and even grow it, but as the saying goes, “the best time to start is yesterday, the second best time is now.” </p><p>Don’t wait for <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/04/23/bitcoin-to-rally-past-50000-due-to-halving-process-say-crypto-analysts/">BTC to hit $50,000</a> before you suddenly wake up and start buying in. Set up a plan today and start diversifying your portfolio in this future-proof asset class, so you know your wealth is safe, no matter how bad your government might be.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Konstantin Riban.

Quickly amassing over 9,000,000 inscriptions, the new protocol allows for arbitrary data to be embedded on the Bitcoin blockchain. In addition to attracting attention from the NFT industry, Ordinals have led to a major increase in the fees required to send bitcoin, eliciting new debate on how Bitcoin should deal with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges">high fee environments</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In a recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine, <a href="https://twitter.com/farokh">Farokh</a>, founder of the Rug Radio platform and a well-known collector within the NFT industry, shared insights into the world of Bitcoin NFTs and his vision for the Bitcoin inscription market’s future. Reflecting on his own Bitcoin and NFT journey, Farokh acknowledged the initial confusion surrounding Bitcoin in 2012, given the lack of development and user-friendly platforms at the time. However, he highlighted the rapid growth and development of NFT platforms in 2021, and how that is reflected now in the context of Bitcoin NFTs’ sudden rise in popularity.</p><p>When discussing the advantages of Ordinals, Farokh emphasized the security aspect of storing art on the Bitcoin blockchain, stating, "Ordinals now enable art to be stored on the most secure blockchain in the world, without keeping this data in external databases where it can be vulnerable to manipulation." He identified this as the biggest benefit of Ordinals over NFTs on other, less secure blockchains, recognizing the need for censorship-resistant and immutable storage solutions.</p><p>Regarding the future of Bitcoin NFTs, Farokh expressed his optimism. He also acknowledged the current challenges, such as high costs and the need for infrastructure development, but believed that with the continuous growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem, improved solutions would emerge.</p><p>Farokh also discussed the entry of luxury brands into the Bitcoin NFT space, mentioning the collaboration between <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bugatti-and-asprey-announce-bitcoin-inscriptions">Asprey and Bugatti</a>. He expressed his curiosity about high-end brands embracing ordinals and leveraging the security and authenticity provided by the Bitcoin blockchain.</p><p>When asked about the reaction of projects transitioning to Bitcoin NFTs, Farokh noted the generally positive response. He drew parallels to the early days of NFTs, where skepticism was common but ultimately proven wrong. He also highlighted the positive reception of projects like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/yuga-labs-introduces-first-bitcoin-ordinals-collection">Yuga Labs’ TwelveFold</a>, indicating that the acceptance of Bitcoin NFTs was gradually gaining momentum.</p><p>Looking ahead, Farokh envisioned a mature Bitcoin NFT market with user-friendly platforms accessible to retail users. He remarked, "Look how much the [NFT] marketplace has evolved ... at first, it was complicated to make a wallet. Now we have proper marketplaces." Farokh's optimistic outlook suggested a future where the Bitcoin NFT market becomes more mainstream and user-friendly, ultimately driving further adoption.</p><p>Overall, Farokh's interview shed light on the growing importance of Bitcoin NFTs, their unique advantages and the evolving landscape of the Ordinals protocol.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgyMDU1MzM1MTk5MDU3MDI3/bitcoin-numbers.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Core Version 25.0 Released Bringing New Features And Transaction Use Cases]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bitcoin Core users should be sure to read through the release notes before updating their software to the latest release version.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-core-version-25-0-released</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-core-version-25-0-released</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin core]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Updates]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technical]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 26 May 2023 16:22:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMjU1NjA1NDIxNTQ5MTIz/technical-bitcoin-development-pixel.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Bitcoin Core version 25.0 has been released, bringing new features, bug fixes and performance improvements to the software. Users can download the latest version from the official <a href="https://bitcoincore.org/">Bitcoin Core</a> website or update their existing installations. The release notes outline the changes and provide instructions on how to upgrade.</p><p>One notable change is the allowance of transactions of non-witness size 65 bytes and above, which opens up new use cases and enhances protections against vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-12842. Another addition is the scanblocks RPC, which allows for fast wallet rescans by returning relevant blockhashes from a set of descriptors.</p><p>In terms of RPC updates, all JSON-RPC methods now accept a new named parameter called "args" for passing positional parameter values conveniently. Additionally, the verifychain RPC will now return false if checks couldn't be completed at the desired depth and level, providing more accurate feedback.</p><p>The release also includes changes to the build system, updated settings and new features. For instance, the shutdownnotify option allows users to specify a command to execute before Bitcoin Core begins its shutdown sequence. In the wallet section, new options like minconf and maxconf have been added to various RPCs, providing greater control over UTXO confirmations.</p><p>Bitcoin Core 25.0 introduces several improvements and optimizations, enhancing the user experience and security of the software. As with any release, users are encouraged to report any bugs they encounter to the official GitHub issue tracker.</p><p>Bitcoin Core is widely supported and tested on major operating systems such as Linux, macOS, and Windows.

    </figure><p>Congressman Brad Sherman's recent tweet attacking Bitcoiners as "tax evaders" is a prime example of how Bitcoin has become a mainstream phenomenon. It's ironic that politicians like Sherman, who have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and the presumption of innocence, are so quick to label Bitcoin supporters as criminals without any evidence. Such remarks undermine the fundamental principles of justice and fairness that underpin our legal system. </p><p>The fact that politicians like Sherman are attacking Bitcoin serves as a signal to those on the fence that there may be something to this "freedom money" that is constantly under attack by those who are corrupt and compromised by legacy systems. In a way, even those who attack Bitcoin may be unwittingly working for its success and adoption.</p><p>And clearly, politicians are expecting Bitcoiners to shoulder some kind of tax burden that they do not impose on anyone else.</p><p>Imagine if a politician tried to tax people for using computational power to do math or use English to express their views. They would be ridiculed and mocked because, on top of that being an insane policy, both of these subjects are essential to a functional society. </p><p>Instead of imposing arbitrary taxes, the government should focus on creating a regulatory environment that supports innovation and economic growth. Unfortunately, in opposition to that seemingly-obvious edict, the Biden administration <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/biden-administration-proposes-30-tax-on-energy-used-by-bitcoin-miners">has proposed a 30% tax on Bitcoin mining</a>, which is not only unfair, but also hypocritical to the values that make the United States great. </p><p>If a market participant has paid for their energy, they should be free to use it as they wish. So, why is Bitcoin mining being targeted when other industries, such as pornography, video games or gambling, also use energy to allow people to indulge in their vices online? I’m not vying for a tax on other industries. I firmly believe that if a market participant has paid for their energy they can do whatever they want with it. My intent is to point out that this proposal seems to be a clear example of government overreach and intervention in the private sector. </p><h2>Reacting To Change</h2><p>And it's not just Bitcoin mining that is being targeted. It is the entire Bitcoin network. When new and innovative ideas challenge the status quo, both humans and technology can exhibit resistance or embrace the change. Technology mimics many things about human biology, including the way we respond to change. Established industries or entities may resist new technologies to protect their own interests, just like how our immune system responds to foreign pathogens to protect our body. However, just as humans can adapt to changing environments, technology can also evolve and adapt to better serve our needs. People can either fight against Bitcoin or embrace it, but either way, this technology is changing the world rapidly.</p><p>It's important to remember that new technology, including Bitcoin, is not inherently bad, but rather a tool that can be used for both good and bad purposes. Instead of fighting against progress, we should embrace the opportunities that new technology provides and work together to shape a better future. Sherman's tweet may not win him any votes, but it shows his lack of understanding and respect for the rights of his constituents.</p><p>The comparison between a technology network and human biology may seem unconventional, but it provides valuable insights into the evolution and growth of new technologies like Bitcoin. Kevin Kelly’s book “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Technology_Wants">What Technology Wants</a>” highlights the importance of this. There are three quotes that really stood out to me:</p><blockquote><p>“Technologies do not exist in isolation, but rather in networks that amplify their power and reach.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Innovation is a team sport, and the best innovations are produced by networks of people working together.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“The more interconnected our technologies become, the more emergent properties they exhibit, and the harder they are to predict or control.”</p></blockquote><p>Technology is always evolving based on human needs. It starts with a small idea and then grows into something larger than anyone could have imagined. This evolution is not always linear, as new technologies often emerge from existing technologies. These networks grow exponentially faster as new technologies enable stuff we never thought possible. FaceTime would seem magical to someone 100 years ago in the same way that a medical device that can regenerate limbs for people would seem magical in the modern day. I assume that type of technology will come someday and with it many more innovations that I could never have hoped to imagine until I saw them.</p><p>But, just like humans, technology has its own set of rules and laws. We have to follow these rules to make the most out of technology’s potential. Imagine if someone called a conference about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">TCP/IP</a> a “conference for gang members.” It would seem ridiculous. Especially from a politician who should be encouraging innovation in their district. </p><p>Attacking people because they enjoy using a protocol is insane. However, if your job was dedicated to maintaining legacy technology and adopting new technology could make you irrelevant, I suppose you wouldn't react favorably toward the new technology either.</p><h2>Embracing The Evolution Of Technology</h2><figure>

    </figure><p>In the end, we are all part of the network of technology, whether we like it or not. We must embrace the evolution of technology, and understand its potential to shape the world for the better. We are at the beginning of all the things that will be built on these new protocols, so it is up to us to harness their power and make the most out of their potential. </p><p>I can’t say I know for a fact that bitcoin is going well above $1 million, but I think it’s pretty damn possible and that, as more network effects get added, both in meatspace and cyberspace, the more likely it becomes.</p><blockquote><p>“When zero reached Europe roughly 300 years later in the High Middle Ages, it was met with strong ideological resistance. Facing opposition from users of the well-established Roman numeral system, zero struggled to gain ground in Europe.”&nbsp;</p><p>–Robert Breedlove, “<a href="https://breedlove22.medium.com/the-number-zero-and-bitcoin-4c193336db5b">The Number Zero And Bitcoin</a>”</p></blockquote><p>Now, the idea of not using zero in math is a non-starter. It seems highly likely Bitcoin will have a similar fate as zero and the idea of not using Bitcoin and all the things built on top of it will be preposterous. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/nostr-and-bitcoin-can-change-social-media">Just look at Nostr, for an example</a>. There is no way the protocol would have thrived had it not been for both Bitcoin and Bitcoiners bringing so much value onto the network.</p><p>I believe a similar effect will take place for more innovations around the world, whether regulators understand Bitcoin or not.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Conor Chepenik.

    </figure><p>To improve on this, the team at Luxor Technologies developed a new method called the “rolling-block method,” which we describe in more detail in <a href="https://hashrateindex.com/blog/difficulty-forecasting-101-for-bitcoin-miners-hosters-lenders-and-hashrate-traders/">a recent report on forecasting Bitcoin mining difficulty.</a></p><p>It’s our hope that the rolling-block method for forecasting Bitcoin difficulty could provide miners, investors and hash rate traders a better tool to plan for difficulty changes</p><h2>Luxor's ‘Rolling Block Method’ For Forecasting Difficulty Adjustments</h2><p>For this report, we developed a new time series forecasting method for upcoming difficulty adjustments, which improves accuracy at the beginning of the epoch compared to the constant block time method. We call this the succinctly-named “rolling-2,015-block, square-root-weighted, epoch-adjusted block time method” (or just “rolling-block method,” “adjusted-block-time method,” or “dual-epoch method”).</p><p>This new method improves upon the constant-block-time method early in the epoch by including block times from the previous 2,015 blocks, instead of just the blocks from the current epoch, which can skew forecasts early in the epoch for lack of data points. To account for the change in network difficulty between epochs, block times in the previous epoch are adjusted by the previous adjustment. And finally, we weight the average block times of the current epoch with the square of the proportion through the epoch. This final step is to diminish the impact of block times from the previous epoch as the current epoch progresses since these values do not actually determine the upcoming adjustment.</p><p>In the chart below, we can see through confidence intervals that the new method performed better than the old model at the beginning of the epoch up to block 650, but it performed slightly more poorly thereafter:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>This forecast, of course, is only for projecting the next difficulty adjustment. What if we wanted to forecast, say, a year into the future?</p><h2>Long-Term Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Forecasting</h2><p><a href="https://hashrateindex.com/blog/the-search-for-a-hashprice-floor-or-downside-resistance/">Luxor has developed models for long-term difficulty forecasting</a>, as well, but these models are obviously much more complex, since they span a longer time frame.</p><p>Our model takes the bitcoin price, transaction fees and block subsidy as inputs on the demand side, and internal data on ASIC production estimates and operating cost distributions across the industry on the supply side. Using these inputs, the model produces an equilibrium hash rate, difficulty and hash price for 18-month periods.</p><p>The model structure reflects reality; hash rate, difficulty and hash price are endogenous to the system, not exogenous determinants of one another. We can conduct sensitivity analyses with the model across all inputs as well. For example, we can forecast an equilibrium hash rate, difficulty, and hash price across a range of bitcoin prices.</p><p>The charts below present projections from our updated hash rate supply and demand model. It provides estimates for flat, bull and bear bitcoin price scenarios.</p><figure>

Your Twitter feed has probably been drowning in threads and tips from AI bros who have discovered 99 ways for you to save 99 hours every week using ChatGPT or some other list of 99 AI apps.</p><p>I’m sick of it too. Trust me, especially considering that most of these AI “experts” were Web3 “experts” last year, NFT “experts” the year before and DeFi or crypto “experts” before that. Trend hopping at its finest.</p><p>That’s not to say there’s no value here to be found here. Somewhere beneath or behind the almost-deafening noise coming from these influencooors there is a possible paradigm shift, and a genuine set of use cases. We’ve seen some already, of course. </p><p>You can chat with these models to reason out a problem, you can summarize thoughts and ideas, find correlations between ideas, search for <em>some</em> information better than you could with Google and, of course, build more linguistically-functional chatbots. Perhaps the best use case thus far are the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/google-jumps-into-the-ai-coding-assistant-fray-with-codey-and-studio-bot/">dev-assistant tools</a>, but I get the sense that we’ve not yet seen the “Uber moment.”</p><p>There is also — somewhere beneath and behind all of the scary talk of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">artificial general intelligence (AGI)</a> and the idiocy being proposed by <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/">bureaucrats and would-be regulators</a> — a more human-centric, human-enhancing use for these tools.</p><p>The idea of a language user interface as the next step from the thumb tapping we’ve become used to over the past decade is fascinating, and what we should be thinking about is how to make these tools new “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ebenbayer/2023/05/15/ai--biotechnology-show-its-time-to-think-past-bicycles-for-the-mind/?sh=2c7868754ea1">bicycles for the mind</a>,” as Steve Jobs said about computers. It’s very important that we push back against doomer narratives that lean the world toward “approved AI” in order to avoid such tools becoming yet another appendage of the State.</p><p>In this short article, I’d like to explore the ideological AI battlefield and its relationship to Bitcoin. Some pretty important battle lines have been drawn, and we must all be aware of them.</p><h2>Bitcoin Remains The Most Important Thing In The World</h2><p>Energy is still the currency of the universe. That’s not changing, and will never change. At the risk of sounding like too much of a hippie: It’s all energy.</p><p>People often forget that, and this recent AI hype cycle is a clear example. Most people you talk with, even otherwise smart people, think that AI is the biggest thing happening in the world today, and that it’s mankind’s most important innovation.</p><p>I think they’re wrong, in a big way. They’re missing something more foundational.</p><p>AI is a tool. When applied well, it’s a very effective tool. But however effective a tool it may be, it needs energy to run. Yes, it can and will enhance how we use and allocate energy, but ultimately, it is an amplifier. A tool. An “engine,” so to speak.</p><p>What is Bitcoin?</p><p>Well, Bitcoin is <em>like</em> energy. <em>Before the Saylor-haters out there screech about that not being literally accurate: I know! It’s a metaphor, and in my opinion, a useful one</em>. It’s useful because, in the same way we can essentially use energy to measure everything else, money is a measure that helps us (implicitly) account for energy, time and material resources. </p><p>If we understand that Bitcoin, on a long enough time scale (generationally speaking, not civilizationally) becomes <em>money</em>, then here’s the truth that AI people are missing:</p><p><strong>Bitcoin benefits from all of it, because Bitcoin is the foundation. Everything that happens, every technology, every tool, every innovation, enlarges the total Bitcoin pie.</strong></p><p>So, don’t get it twisted: AI is big, <em>but Bitcoin remains king.</em></p><p>Of course, in terms of financial returns, VC money and the like, AI companies will probably outpace both bitcoin returns (in the short term) and also Bitcoin company returns, but that’s to be expected in a fiat world where hype prevails over sanity, and we experience abnormal cyclicality.</p><p>AI is also undergoing a sort of renaissance, so there is lots of buzz. This will, in time, stabilize and as bitcoin becomes the unit of account, lo and behold, all of the <em>real</em> value generated from AI will ultimately accrue to bitcoin and bitcoin holders.</p><p>So, don’t stress if you’re feeling FOMO on AI. Don’t worry about changing your entire life around because some ex-crypto-turned-AI-expert guy wrote a viral tweet telling you about some new, generative AI tool that will obsolete some and make others mega rich.</p><p>Slow and steady continues to win the race. Bitcoin continues to be king.</p><h2>AI Is An Amplifier</h2><p>The second thing we need to realize is this: AI is like the computer or any other technology, for that matter.</p><p>It’s an engine. <em>It’s an amplifier.</em></p><p>It will amplify madness, stupidity and lies, or it will amplify soundness, sanity and truth.</p><p>It can be used as a tool of control and stupidification, or it can be used as a tool for liberating oneself from minutia and for enhancing one’s intelligence.</p><p>The direction we wind up ultimately depends on you.</p><p>Which tools are you using? Which do you demand? Which are you building? Which are you supporting?</p><p>Companies like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/19/snapchat-making-ai-chatbot-similar-to-chatgpt-available-to-every-user">Snapchat are building AI tools</a> to infect your mind with nonsense:</p><figure>

This can have two effects. In the worst case, so-called “safety concerns” lead to “approved AI” which ultimately leads to an internet that is accessed through chat filters with approved speech conditions. The alternative is if we push back and build alternatives. Their ignorance becomes our opportunity. While they focus on wokeness, we can build utility and authenticity. </p><p>Which brings me to my final point:</p><h2>We’re In A Global AI Arms Race</h2><p>The race is between two versions of the world:</p><ol><li>On the one hand, we have woke, generalist AIs that everyone is forced to use because newly-formed regulatory bodies deem them “safe” (see the <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/how-china-might-crush-the-west-in?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_campaign=post_embed&amp;utm_medium=web">ridiculously-moronic work being done by Gary Marcus</a> to set up such a global committee).</li><li>On the other, we have a future of distributed, more sovereign tools that people can choose from, that the user evaluates on merits they deem important.</li></ol><p>I know which future I want to see, and instead of sitting on the sidelines complaining, I’m working toward building alternative or parallel solutions.</p><p>In a future article, I’ll lay out what myself and a few really talented individuals have been working on. A beautiful marriage of Bitcoin as the focal point and Ai as the engine. </p><p>In the meantime, know this: <strong>The battle lines have been drawn.</strong></p><p>It’s iris-scanning, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f1de2aee-ee13-45e1-bd61-0a269cd650d3">like World Coin</a> on one end, conveniently run by the same leadership as OpenAI, versus Bitcoin and smaller, more accurate, specialized and open-source language models on the other.</p><figure>

According to the complaint, Upstream holds the patent for a system that powers a blockchain mine at remote oil well sites using stranded gas to generate electricity for cryptocurrency mining. According to the filing, the company has deployed over 350 bitcoin mining systems across the U.S. and Canada, addressing the issue of stranded gas venting and flaring.</p><p>Crusoe, which manufactures and operates cryptocurrency mining systems connected to stranded natural gas sources, is accused of competing with Upstream by selling and operating similar systems. The complaint claims that Crusoe's "Digital Flare Mitigation" systems infringe on Upstream's patented technology. The lawsuit further alleges that Crusoe was aware of Upstream's patented technology during the development of its own products. The lawsuit filing highlights instances where Crusoe identified Upstream as a competitor in blog posts and claims made in patent applications.</p><p>The lawsuit seeks damages and injunctive relief against Crusoe for patent infringement. Upstream argues that Crusoe's actions have caused harm to its business by infringing on its patent rights and creating unfair competition in the market.&nbsp;</p><p>The case will be heard in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, where Crusoe has regular and established places of business according to the filing. Also noted in the lawsuit is a complaint filed against a customer of Upstream in Crusoe Energy Systems LLC v.

The mining process plays a crucial role in confirming new transactions and maintaining the Bitcoin blockchain ledger as an immutable record of transactions. In essence, miners use ASIC hardware to solve complex computational problems, with the first one to find the solution earning a reward of bitcoin before the cycle restarts. </p><p>Though Bitcoin mining can be time-consuming, expensive and can yield inconsistent rewards depending on price volatility, it still holds a strong allure for investors drawn to the idea of earning bitcoin as compensation for their efforts. For tech-savvy individuals and hobbyists, mining can be an intriguing opportunity for many different reasons.</p><p>As opposed to traditional investment assets, such as standard bank deposits, real estate property or stocks, bitcoin can offer much higher returns. It’s an environmentally-conscious business that can prevent energy waste by utilizing excess energy, such as the natural gas that gets burned during oil extraction, idle wind turbines and surplus energy from hydroelectric or nuclear power plants. </p><p>Hiveon’s long-term predictions are that bitcoin’s value will rise after the halving (more on that below), so we’re accumulating coins now to multiply that money into the future. We also believe that, in the future, an alternative global financial system based on blockchain technology like Bitcoin’s will be dominant, and network validators will be able to make money from processing transactions.</p><p>But with mining difficulty and hash rate <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/225359/bitcoin-difficulty-hashrate-miner-revenue">continuously hitting new highs</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-network-overwhelmed-by-390000-unconfirmed-transactions-and-surging-fees/">fees surging</a>, many may wonder if the practice is still worth investing in.</p><h2>Is Mining Bitcoin Worth It?</h2><p>To determine if Bitcoin mining will be “worth it” for them, equipment, prospective miners should conduct cost-benefit analyses to determine their break-even points. Factors to consider include power costs, hardware costs and efficiency, time and the market value of bitcoin. You can choose to factor in the current BTC price ($28,190 at the time of writing) or, attempt to extrapolate where you believe the price of BTC will be in the future.</p><h3>Power Costs</h3><p>At the time of this writing, Bitcoin mining can be profitable for individuals who pay <a href="https://whattomine.com/miners/163-bitmain-antminer-s19j-pro-96th?cost=0.11&amp;cost_currency=USD&amp;button=">$0.10 or less per kilowatt hour (kWh)</a> of power.</p><p>Access to energy at this price, however, can vary significantly across different regions, with some areas offering notably cheaper electricity than others. In terms of <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/263492/electricity-prices-in-selected-countries/">household electricity prices</a>, several Middle Eastern countries would make good homes for Bitcoin miners, including Iran, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, prices in European countries like Denmark, Germany and the U.K., would make Bitcoin mining a difficult proposition.</p><h3>Hardware Costs</h3><p>Acquiring ASIC equipment has become relatively easy, although the price of ASICs ranges from a few hundred dollars to five-figure sums. I recently found a used Antminer S19 for sale in the U.K., listed at £2,700 (or about $3,343.38).</p><h3>Market Value</h3><p>Bitcoin achieved its highest price ever at <a href="https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin/historical-price/">$67,549 in November 2021</a>. During this period, as the 2021 bull market reached its peak, miners’ bitcoin rewards were naturally more valuable in fiat terms than they are at the time of this writing, with the bitcoin price around $27,600. However, with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges">bitcoin transaction fees rising</a> as a result of ongoing experimentations with block space, miners are benefitting.</p><p>A <a href="https://btc.com/tools/mining-calculator">profitability calculator</a> can help potential miners evaluate the cost-benefit ratio of Bitcoin mining. These calculators can vary in complexity and may provide slightly different results. </p><h2>What Are The ‘Other’ Reasons For Bitcoin Mining?</h2><p>But for some Bitcoin miners, a simple cost-benefit analysis may not be the only factor in deciding whether mining is “worth it” or not in 2023.</p><p>Mining is an essential aspect of Bitcoin's decentralized transaction recording and validation process. Bitcoin mining serves a critical purpose by addressing an issue called “double spending,” a problem inherent in any digital currency system. Double spending is the digital equivalent of counterfeiting, which is kept in check in the physical world by middlemen like governments and banks. </p><p>For Bitcoin, this need to trust third parties has been replaced largely because of the computational effort provided by miners. Maintaining that freedom from middlemen, in addition to collecting revenue, may be a motivation to contribute to the mining network for some.</p><h2>Bitcoin Halving Cycles And What to Expect In 2024</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/halving#:~:text=When%20is%20the%20Next%20Bitcoin%20Halving%20Date%3F,to%203.125%20Bitcoin%20per%20block.">next anticipated Bitcoin halving in April 2024</a> will likely have a significant impact on the mining dynamic.</p><p>A Bitcoin halving is an event in which the reward for mining new blocks is reduced by 50%, resulting in miners receiving half as many bitcoin in their reward for solving a block. Scheduled to occur every 210,000 blocks, Bitcoin halvings continue until the maximum supply of 21 million bitcoin has been issued.</p><p>The impact of the next halving on Bitcoin's price remains uncertain. Some analysts predict that the price will follow a similar pattern to previous halvings, rising post-event due to the constrained supply of new coins. However, any price increase will ultimately depend on demand for bitcoin and it should be noted that the market has matured significantly since the 2020 halving, and numerous well-established cryptocurrencies now compete for users.</p><p>Anyone considering whether Bitcoin mining will be profitable in 2023 will likely want to factor the impact of the next Bitcoin halving into their calculus as well.</p><h2>Difficult, But Not Impossible</h2><p>Profitable Bitcoin mining is a challenge, but it’s not impossible. Bitcoin is priced relatively low at the time of writing, yet an Antminer S19 can run profitably at a maximum power cost of $0.10 per kWh. While this rules out areas of the world like the U.K., there are many global locations where power is cheaper. Naturally, renewable sources of energy (solar panels in particular) really help improve profitability and, as the world transitions from oil and gas to renewable sources of energy, it’s hoped that the price of electricity will fall once again.</p><p>Access to cheap electricity, the quickly-evolving nature of Bitcoin and upcoming events like the halving are just some of the many factors to consider when you ask, is Bitcoin mining profitable?</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Keaton Reckard.

According to <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-May/021694.html">a post on the Bitcoin dev mailing list</a>, Ark offers an alternative scaling approach that allows users to send and receive funds without liquidity constraints, making it easier for recipients to get paid without an onboarding setup. Unlike other Layer 2 solutions like Lightning, Ark does not require the opening and closing of channels, reducing the on-chain footprint significantly.</p><figure>

        <figcaption><a href="https://www.arkpill.me/deep-dive"><em>Image source</em></a></figcaption>
    </figure><p>The protocol operates using virtual UTXOs (vTXOs), which are short-lived notes that expire after four weeks. When a payment is made, existing vTXOs are redeemed, and new ones are created. The anonymity of coin ownership is improved by restricting vTXO values to a range of sats values. Users can acquire vTXOs from others or use a process called lifting, which allows them to lift their on-chain UTXOs off the chain for virtual UTXOs.</p><p>The protocol introduces an intermediary called the Ark Service Provider (ASP), which serves as a liquidity provider, CoinJoin coordinator and Lightning service provider. ASPs create rapid, blinded CoinJoin sessions every five seconds, known as pools, which ensure the atomicity of payment schedules. Recipients can claim their funds through a txlock condition that requires the connector outpoint to remain unchanged.</p><p>Ark's integration with the Lightning Network allows users to attach HTLCs (or PTLCs) to a pool transaction, enabling interoperability between the two protocols. Multiple ASPs can be used to pay Lightning invoices from different vTXO sources using multi-part payments. Payments on Ark are credited every five seconds, allowing users to spend their zero-conf vTXOs immediately without waiting for on-chain confirmations.</p><p>The developer behind Ark highlighted the protocol's potential for future extensions and improvements. A hypothetical data manipulation opcode could disincentivize double-spending, and users could forge an ASP's signature to reclaim their vTXOs in case of a double-spend. Overall, Ark offers a promising solution for efficient and secure off-chain transactions on the Bitcoin network.</p><p>For more information on Ark and its technical details, curious users are encouraged to visit <a href="https://arkpill.me/deep-dive">https://arkpill.me/deep-dive</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MjMxNzYxODMwNTUzMDkz/bitcoin-stack.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4MTMzMzIzODEyMzE2MjMy/image1.png" height="304" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Neutronpay And Pouch.ph Partner To Offer Affordable Remittances For Canada And Vietnam Using Lightning]]></title><description><![CDATA[Canadians who want to send money back to the Philippines can now leverage the Lightning Network to do so.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/neutronpay-and-pouch-ph-now-offer-lightning-remittances-for-canada-and-vietnam</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/neutronpay-and-pouch-ph-now-offer-lightning-remittances-for-canada-and-vietnam</guid><category><![CDATA[Philippines]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lightning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Remittances]]></category><category><![CDATA[Canada]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 17:06:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMDI2MTUyOTY3NzA5OTE3/global-hyperbitcoinization.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="https://neutronpay.com/">Neutronpay</a>, a digital payment platform based in Canada, has partnered with <a href="https://pouch.ph/">Pouch.ph</a> to offer fast and affordable remittance services for Filipinos living in Canada and Vietnam.

Although Ordinals’ block space usage had been<a href="https://dune.com/queries/2009834/3326390"> trending down</a> since March 23, 2023, the release of<a href="https://arthodl.net/2023/04/05/bugatti-and-asprey-bringing-high-tech-faberge-style-eggs-to-ordinals/"> notable collections</a> and a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges">burgeoning mania</a> for BRC-20 tokens seems to have reversed that trend. </p><p>Should competition for block space between Ordinals, BRC-20 tokens and purely monetary transactions remain high, so will fees. And, should fees climb sufficiently high, the ghastly shades of the<a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/the-blocksize-war-chapter-1-first-strike/"> blocksize war</a> may rise once more to torment all Bit-kind.</p><h2>The Case Against Ordinals</h2><p>Fees aren't the only flashpoint. While Bitcoin has certainly had its share of negative headlines over the years, the protocol itself has thus far escaped the same level of recrimination. Exchange failures, drug sales, countless scams — these are all things people did <em>with</em> the tech, rather than any intrinsic fault of the tech itself. Not so with, say, Ethereum, where sketchy smart contracts are virtually part of the machine. </p><p>With Ordinals popularizing the integration of Bitcoin's blockchain with all manner of infamous Ethereum innovations (such as NFTs, tokens and, perhaps soon,<a href="https://thebitcoinmanual.com/articles/what-are-brc-721-tokens/"> smart contracts</a>), reputational risk to the Bitcoin protocol grows. How long until a token is issued directly on Bitcoin which passes the<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp"> Howey Test</a> and so falls afoul of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission? </p><p>Further in this regard, Ordinals also greatly lower the barrier to introducing illicit or classified content into Bitcoin's blockchain.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>As for the loss of user funds due to rug pulls, bugs, hacks and takedowns, all of these boxes have already been ticked under Ordinals. Most recently,<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ordinals-finance-has-conducted-a-1m-rug-pull-certik"> Ordinals Finance</a> pulled a $1 million rug, albeit on the Ethereum side of the ledger. Just prior to that,<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/news/coinedition:bd9364062094b:0/"> UniSat</a> fumbled the launch of its BRC-20s marketplace, resulting in costly double-spend attacks and a lengthy market halt. Before <em>that</em>, several major marketplaces bowed to legal pressure from<a href="https://arthodl.net/2023/04/11/magic-eden-market-delists-ape-collections/"> Yuga Labs</a> and delisted ape-related collections. </p><p>Furthermore, all of these "hiccups" occurred against the background of a<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ordinals-community-debates-fix-after-inscription-validation-bug"> bug</a> discovered within Ordinals' all-important indexing system. Finally — and I hate to say this — further problems of this nature are anticipated. Consider that one of the largest<a href="https://dune.com/domo/ordinals-marketplaces"> marketplaces by users and volume</a>, Ordinals Wallet as well as the significant Ordswap marketplace both keep keys in browser<a href="https://snyk.io/blog/is-localstorage-safe-to-use/"> </a>local storage, according to what I’ve heard on Discord, which <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/is-localstorage-safe-to-use/">runs contrary to recommended security practices</a> (to say the least).</p><p>I believe the above paragraphs summarize the case against Ordinals from the perspective of many Bitcoin Maximalists — among whose ranks I myself numbered, at least until the Ordinals<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Purity%20Spiral"> purity spiral</a> went helter-skelter. And while these concerns have merit, there's one particular complaint which I believe deserves to go unmentioned; that Ordinals are a scam. </p><p>When willing buyers and willing sellers exchange goods with informational symmetry, without any claims made as to future price appreciation, well, that's the definition of honest business — and that's the current situation within Ordinals marketplaces. Prove me wrong.</p><h2>In Defense Of Ordinals</h2><p>A point in favor of Ordinals is that <a href="https://decrypt.co/125556/bitcoin-stamps-nfts-are-gaining-on-ordinals">it's possible to prune their content from stored blockchain data</a>. Pruning resolves the blockchain file size bloat issue, which is fairly trivial considering that I expect the bloat to be easily outpaced by the growth of affordable data storage. More importantly, pruning ensures that anyone running a full node can opt out of storing any illegal material (which, to be fair, existed on Bitcoin's blockchain long before Ordinals).</p><p>In regards to the reputational and legislative risks to Bitcoin arising from Ordinals content stored on the blockchain, these can be mitigated — but not eliminated — by proper communication. The point must be hammered home (and not just for the sake of Ordinals) that Bitcoin's uncensorable and permissionless structure has certain unavoidable drawbacks which, on balance, are vastly outweighed by its advantages.</p><p>On the technical front, it's possible that post-traumatic stress from the blocksize war is leading some to view Ordinals as a big-blocker-style assault on Bitcoin's base layer... but as an entirely optional Layer 2, Ordinals have far more in common with the Lightning Network than with Bcash and its ilk. Granted, content insertion into witness data is also occurring, but that process is moderated by fees... </p><p>Fees? Lightning? Let's not jump ahead to the resolution of this Ordinals controversy!</p><p>As for the loss of user funds to cyber bandits or technical gremlins, such losses are likely to remain limited due to the relatively small size of the Ordinals economy. As the<a href="https://www.ordinalhub.com/price-tracking?dateRange=All&amp;page=1"> estimated total value</a> of all Ordinals collection at the time of this writing is currently around 1,628 BTC, worth some $45 million, nothing approaching the scale of the infamous fiascos that have plagued crypto is even possible at this stage:</p><figure>

        <figcaption><a href="https://techmonitor.ai/technology/cybersecurity/biggest-cryptocurrency-hacks-of-all-time"><em>Source</em></a></figcaption>
    </figure><p>So much for playing defense. The fact is that Ordinals are attracting new users, developers, artists and companies to the Bitcoin space. This will surely have multiple benefits beyond the immediate boost to the value and prestige of the entire ecosystem. Onboarding more users of all kinds is the surest path to accelerating hyperbitcoinization. And if Bitcoin succeeds, the world will be liberated from the death grip of central banking — but let's put our ruby-quartz visor back on and refocus.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>While most early Bitcoiners got on board due to technical curiosity or ideological motivation, later adoption waves were likely driven by economic factors. Many of these later entrants stuck around because they realized<a href="https://twitter.com/ChadsBitcoin/status/1258854925884362755"> Bitcoin is a revolution disguised as a get-rich-quick scheme</a>. While we await the next bull cycle, Ordinals are attracting a fresh set of users, composed largely of young creatives. </p><p>Should we really turn these hopefuls away, to wander in the shitcoin swamps?</p><h2>The Solution</h2><p>Ordinals have proven the strong demand for Bitcoin NFTs, tokens and smart contracts. Although such things have been tried on Bitcoin in the past, through whatever confluence of factors, the time is now demonstrably ripe for them. A<a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis"> quick glance</a> at inscription count over time (currently over five million after about five months) is enough to confirm this. The associated impact on fees has been equally obvious:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3OTg3MjYyNDQzNTYyMTQ1/bitcoin-mempool-weight.jpg" height="269" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><a href="https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,all,weight"><em>Source</em></a></figcaption>
    </figure><p>Note that the two previous spikes, around the starts of 2018 and 2021, coincided with the resolution of massive bull markets. From January of this year, the markets have been fairly calm and the latest spike is attributable to Ordinals. This raises the question of how horrifically high fees will get if the current Ordinals volume persists into the climax of another bull cycle... </p><p>In my view, this is the only critical issue presented by Ordinals; a looming problem with the potential to outweigh the benefit of the adoption boost. With <a href="https://decrypt.co/139259/bitcoin-ddos-ordinals-inscriptions-attack">fees hitting the 600-plus sat per virtual byte (vB) nosebleed levels</a> last seen in late 2017 and early 2018, Bitcoin might lose as many (or more) users to other chains as it gains from Ordinals.</p><p>The solution to high fees back in the day was the<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-segwit"> SegWit</a> soft fork, which greatly reduced the size and fees of conforming transactions. SegWit also enabled the launch of the Lightning Network, a layer atop Bitcoin designed to process low-value transactions. One quirk of Bitcoin is its flat fee and data structure, whereby the cost and block space required to send $1 in BTC is equal to those for sending $1 billion in BTC. Offloading low-value transactions to Lightning frees up block space, resulting in lower bitcoin fees. In combination, these two upgrades ensured that when bitcoin pushed to its all-time high in 2021, fees remained reasonable.</p><p><strong>So, why should the solution to high fees arising from Web3 stuff on Bitcoin be any different?</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.rgbfaq.com/">RGB</a>,<a href="https://lightning.engineering/posts/2022-9-28-taro-launch/"> Taro</a>,<a href="https://www.stacks.co/"> Stacks</a> — these are all technologies to shunt Web3 transactions and data from the Bitcoin blockchain and onto Layer 2. While the approach seen in Ordinals and Stamps of writing content directly to the base layer offers unrivaled permanence and immutability, it's also extremely costly. For example, an artist I spoke with recently told me that he spent $3,800 to inscribe a collection. Especially in these tough economic times, that's a lot for a young creative to gamble in an unpredictable market!</p><p>Consider that, as of this writing, 200 of the collections tracked by<a href="https://www.ordinalhub.com/price-tracking?dateRange=All&amp;page=1&amp;sort=volume_btc%3Aasc"> OrdinalHub</a> have seen <em>zero</em> all-time volume, as in no sales at all. This figure barely scratches the surface of market failures. Sorting the 1,000-plus collections on <a href="https://bestinslot.xyz/ordinals/collections/#order=7d_sales_asc&amp;page=35">Best In Slot</a> by inverse weekly sales volume reveals hundreds with zero sales.<a href="https://ordinalswallet.com/collections"> See for yourself</a> how many low-value collections on Ordinals Wallet have had zero volume or sales over the last week. Pending a proper analysis, my intuition is that fewer than one in 100 inscriptions listed on a marketplace will turn a profit.</p><p>The novelty of Ordinals will fade, but the high costs will remain. Given that Layer 2 solutions don't store data on the blockchain, their creation costs will be orders of magnitude lower. High-end collections, like<a href="https://arthodl.net/2023/04/05/bugatti-and-asprey-bringing-high-tech-faberge-style-eggs-to-ordinals/"> Asprey Bugatti Eggs</a>, may still inscribe to Ordinals as the perceived luxury and maximum-permanence option, but the vast majority of creators will opt for the inexpensive alternatives still linked to Bitcoin, even if indirectly.</p><p>Cost isn't the only factor behind the inevitable migration of most users to Layer 2. The size constraints of Bitcoin blocks make bulky content (like high-resolution images or audio, complex code and all but the shortest video clips) unaffordable or even impossible to inscribe. With generative AI making it easy to create high-resolution image content — and soon audio and video content, too — how much longer will the average creator be content to pay a relative fortune to inscribe text and small, static images?</p><h2>Base Layer To Layer 2</h2><p>The way I see things playing out, Ordinals has proven the market demand for Bitcoin-based NFTs, tokens, DeFi, etc. — as unpalatable as some may find that demand. Regardless, the cost and relative slowness of these assets on the base layer should eventually drive most users to Layer 2 solutions, already nearing completion. The base layer will perhaps become the digital equivalent of the Louvre, housing only the most significant works under the tightest security. Layer 2 will host everything else.</p><p>Ordinal antagonists should take note. Twitter screeds denouncing inscribers as attackers for adding monkey JPEGs to the blockchain only incite hilarity and encourage defiance. A $100 or even a $25 inscription fee is a far more effective disincentive, already established and requiring no keyboard bashing. To defuse the looming threat of high fees, the proactive strategy would be to contribute or donate to the development of Layer 2 solutions.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Steven Hay.

This has resulted in questions regarding the network's future and its ability to handle the increasing demand. </p><p>In response to those questions, it can be helpful to consider the intricacies of Bitcoin’s transaction volume through an accounting lens, as the Bitcoin network, at its foundation, is an accounting ledger with its data written to a public chain and recorded forever. Through this lens, we’ll delve into why Bitcoin’s transaction volume matters, how often such surges will occur and whether or not this growth is sustainable.</p><h2>The Accounting Innovation Of Bitcoin</h2><p>As an accounting ledger, Bitcoin represents the first true accounting innovation in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping">more than 700 years</a>, marking a transition from the legacy, stakeholder-controlled, <em>private</em>, double-entry accounting systems to a <em>public</em>, triple-entry system. </p><p>“Triple entry” simply means that two-party transactions (debit and credit) are written to a public, immutable ledger (the third entry). “Public” means that the ledger is accessible at any time by anyone on the Bitcoin network.</p><p>The accounting innovation here is simply the removal of stakeholders (humans) in exchange for machines (aka, servers and nodes) that run difficulty-adjusted proof of work (PoW). Bitcoin uses PoW to substantiate the entries, instead of relying on stakeholders who may be biased or incentivized to commit fraud or manipulate the ledgers. This means that the miners and nodes control the network in an unbiased, free-from-manipulation environment, not humans.</p><p>In contrast, all legacy accounting technologies relied on trusted third parties, known as the “stakeholders.” The fatal problem with a stakeholder-controlled system is that humans are flawed, and the ledgers are subject to human error, fraud, censorship and manipulation.</p><p>Until Bitcoin, every government, every bank, and every corporation on earth has used private, double-entry accounting systems controlled 100% by the stakeholders. This means that the stakeholders can alter the books and records of all of these legacy systems in secret, away from the public eye. In order to catch fraud, corruption or even error, the entire stakeholder-controlled system — including every transaction traced back to its root — would need to be audited. This process is time consuming, complicated and cumbersome, and like all legacy systems, the audits are conducted by humans, further subjecting the audit system to fraud, corruption and error. </p><p>Bitcoin solves this in three ways:</p><ol><li>By turning private ledgers into public ledgers</li><li>By removing stakeholder control and using difficulty-adjusted PoW to record transactions</li><li>By eliminating the need for a human audit as the network self-audits the timechain, every block</li></ol><p>Altogether, this creates the first unalterable ledger in human history.</p><h2>Accounting For The Truth With Bitcoin</h2><p>Accounting can be simply viewed as verifying the truth of the data involved. The role of accounting is to ensure that the data you are being shown is true. And accounting has never been more important in society than it is today, as truth is under constant attack in every arena. All systems rely on accounting, and the massive amount of available information makes discerning the truth difficult.</p><p>Truth is the most important commodity on the planet earth. How do you record the truth, aggregate the truth and then disseminate the truth if all the records are corruptible by humans?</p><p>Because the Bitcoin ledger is public, self-auditing and immutable, it cannot be corrupted or altered by any human. Never before in the history of record keeping could you rely on ledger to be 100% truthful, until the invention of Bitcoin.</p><p>If you are a member of a legacy, stakeholder-dominated business that relies on legacy accounting, and you have been historically able to manipulate the truth via control of the ledgers, a Bitcoin ledger is fatal.</p><p>In terms of who controls the information on ledgers, at the top of the food chain are totalitarian governments that want to control the truth. Bitcoin decimates these systems as the government, as key stakeholders, no longer has control of the information/data. That is why Bitcoin is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-a-trojan-horse-for-freedom">often referred to as a “Trojan horse.”</a> On its face, it's presented as a technology based on money, but diving deeper, Bitcoin represents a new accounting technology that will provide increased freedom to the people within every nations' borders.</p><p>When you give people immutable data that cannot be seized, you give them freedom in the form of property rights, sound/hard money, truth, control and much more.</p><h2>Bitcoin Will Be The Ledger Of Choice For Everything</h2><p>The somewhat abbreviated way of explaining the “why” motivating people to choose Bitcoin to transact on is that the underlying ledger controlling the data is the best ledger system ever invented, free from fraud, control and manipulation, and providing freedom to those who use it. </p><p>Simply put: If you value the data you wish to record, you are incentivized to choose the only ledger in human history that will record it for eternity without being subject to human manipulation.</p><p>If you believe that an immutable unalterable ledger is superior to legacy, alterable, stakeholder ledgers, intuition suggests that all data will eventually be recorded on the Bitcoin network, from wills and trust, to corporate data, to climate data, to vaccine data, to title/ownership data and so on. The list of possibilities is endless. </p><p>All businesses, governments, and banks rely on ledgers. Nearly all industries have made groundbreaking discoveries and inventions since their inception, except for accounting. After 700 years, triple-entry systems have just now been invented (double entry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping">was invented in earnest in the 1400s</a>), and legacy stakeholder hesitance to accept an analog system moving to a digital, unalterable system should be questioned.</p><h2>Ordinals Are Just The Beginning</h2><p>Ordinals and NFTs are important to some people. The beauty of a free system is that everyone has the option to pursue what has value to them. If you believe they have zero value, you do not have to engage with them, but Bitcoin as a free market will not censor certain transactions because others do not value them. The network will always allow for innovation and free choice. Those who want to pay the appropriate fee can record Ordinals or NFT transactions on the Bitcoin network. The Bitcoin mempool in the future will always have a base layer of transactions waiting for the fees to drop low enough to be written on chain.</p><p>Since all data will want to be recorded on this network, this will not be the first or last time there is a wait to record your transaction. For smaller transactions, there are Layer 2 solutions, such as the Lightning Network, that live on top of Bitcoin and can be used immediately. Ordinals and NFTs all might go away in the future, and the transaction volume might wane, but eventually they will be replaced by other projects that similarly want to utilize this ledger, the cycle will repeat no matter what the product or data is.</p><p>Since the Bitcoin innovation is the removal of the requirement to trust the stakeholders, anyone who is advocating to censor the Bitcoin network's content is inherently anti-Bitcoin or does not understand Bitcoin. Those who seek to exploit control and power over the Bitcoin network are the exact problem that Bitcoin solves for.</p><p>As the world realizes that the only way to preserve truth (i.e., data and information) is on the Bitcoin network, the traffic will increase. This increased traffic creates a robust atmosphere for entrepreneurs to build on top of the Bitcoin network and a variety of products and services will emerge that aggregate content and write to the Bitcoin base layer.</p><p>Bitcoin fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) is spread by those who are challenged or fear this technology — understanding this network is no small task, it takes thousands of hours. Anyone who says they understand Bitcoin after a cursory examination is lying or ignorant. Similarly, transaction fee FUD is generated by people arguing both sides, that there are both too few transactions to support the network as well as too many transactions to support the network. </p><p>The truth is that the network is working as intended, and a full mempool that requires free market discovery to price transactions is unavoidable and thus, intended.</p><p>Accounting is the operating system that runs the world. All systems and information need to be honestly recorded, analyzed and then truthfully distributed in order to make sense of the data. Historically, ledgers have been protected by physical human violence, which means whoever has the monopoly on violence (aka, governments) can alter the records and/or its distribution. </p><p>Recording truth on the Bitcoin ledger is the only way to record data that does not rely on human violence to protect or disseminate it, for the first time in history.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Darin Feinstein.

His recent departure from the bank came shortly after <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/what-happened-at-credit-suisse-and-why-did-it-collapse-7369825">it was purchased by UBS in March</a> as an attempt to keep it from collapsing amid <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/recap-of-last-weeks-banking-contagion-and-bitcoin">existential turmoil</a> for banks around the world. On stage at Bitcoin 2023, Pozsar addressed how U.S. banks have been impacted.</p><p>"This is basically an episode where the large banks are largely insulated from the problems," Pozsar said. "It's basically lessons in not being able to run interest rate risk, not knowing how to make a loan that will be weathering a rising interest rate storm.”</p><p>He described the Federal Reserve’s responses to these banking failures as only addressing “half the problem.”</p><p>“I think it's more like foaming the runway for any of the large banks that might be having problems down the road,” he added.</p><p>Pozsar was interviewed on stage by BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, who pressed him on whether he owns any bitcoin.</p><p>“I don't own any,” Pozsar responded. “I'm observing it. I don't like to dabble in things that I don't understand well.”</p><p>Pozsar outlined his pessimism that bitcoin could ever really serve as money, as his historical research has shown him that money has to have a direct link to a government to endure. As a fundamentally decentralized, peer-to-peer network, Bitcoin could not support money that fits his definition.</p><p>“The one thing I will say about bitcoin is that money, if you will, is something that is purely public or a public-private partnership,” Pozsar explained. “When I look at Bitcoin, it’s a purely-private initiative. It’s clearly lacking a state link. But then again, things are evolving, there are a number of countries that have adopted bitcoin as a legal tender, so things are definitely in flux there.”</p><p>In his writing, Pozsar has underscored the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danrunkevicius/2022/03/10/after-this-war-is-over-money-will-never-be-the-same-what-credit-suisses-shocking-prediction-means-for-bitcoin-and-crypto-prices/?sh=2c32f3776c25">evolving role that Bitcoin is playing around the world as institution-backed money like the U.S. dollar becomes weaker</a>. At Bitcoin 2023, he listed several global market trends, including the rising economic power of China, that are threatening its role as the global reserve currency.</p><p>“There’s a number of changes happening that I think we need to keep an eye on because it’s all going to be at the expense of the dollar’s share of commodity finance, trade finance, share of reserve assets and so on,” Pozsar said.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4MDkwMzUyMTI3NjQ4OTU4/zoltan-pozsar-bitcoin-2023.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The World’s Largest Bitcoin Conference Will Take Place In Nashville For 2024]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin Conference will be heading to Music City next year as it brings together Bitcoiners from around the world.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/worlds-largest-bitcoin-conference-will-take-place-in-nashville-for-2024</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/worlds-largest-bitcoin-conference-will-take-place-in-nashville-for-2024</guid><category><![CDATA[Nashville]]></category><category><![CDATA[Industry Events]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[The Bitcoin Conference]]></category><category><![CDATA[Events]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2023 20:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4MDg2MjkwOTY3NjM1MDE2/b24_press_release.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>Disclaimer: The Bitcoin Conference and Bitcoin Magazine are both operated by BTC Inc.</em></p><p><a href="http://b.tc/conference">The Bitcoin Conference</a>, the world's largest and most prestigious gathering of the Bitcoin industry, is set to take place in Nashville, Tennessee, from July 25-27, 2024.

In an interview with Strike’s VP of Product, Manuela Rios, she explained that the app now has an effective reach of 3 billion people. </p><p>“With <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-enables-instant-fiat-transfers-to-africa">Send Globally,</a> the value prop is that you send dollars and receive as a local currency directly in a bank account on the other side … this one’s different — what we found through user research that people on the other side in jurisdictions with weak currencies would say ‘Hey this experience is amazing, but can I have a dollar equivalent?’” </p><p>In regards to purchasing Bitcoin, Rios said that “globally, you don’t see a seamless experience.” So the new Strike app also functions as a Lightning wallet where you can buy and sell bitcoin via dollar equivalent rails. </p><p>At his speech at Bitcoin 2023, Strike CEO Jack Mallers explained the wider vision of the updates, saying "We’re delivering a cash balance that the global south can rely on, and an awesome beautiful punk unconventional black and white brand, as the Fed is driving our own banks insolvent."</p><p>He also highlighted the company’s response to feedback, displaying a set of tweets asking for LNURL support, shortly after announcing that the new app has LNURL support — all <a href="mailto:usernames@strike.me">usernames@strike.me</a> function as a LNURL as of the launch.</p><p>“We made a lot of product changes to support what we hope to become an amazing global money app,” Mallers said. “As a company, we know what we’re fighting for, we know who we are, we changed the way we looked, but we never changed the way we felt.” </p><p>In addition to the new features and access, the app includes a simplified sign-up process in order to make signing up easier. “The end goal for us is to serve 7-8 billion people, and we’ll be stepping our way to make it to the countries that didn’t make it in this MVP,” Rios explained. </p><p>Rios explained the impact of the launch and additional features, saying that “For the Bitcoiners, you can expect a beautiful Lightning wallet and a cost effective way to buy bitcoin, and for the people not yet so familiar with bitcoin, but are familiar with 109% inflation, giving them access to a U.S. dollar equivalent stablecoin is massive — now you can save in something that won’t be so quickly devalued.”&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4MDY0MjU4MzIyMzQzMTAy/dscf3538-1.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘Big Short’ Author Michael Lewis On The Financial Crisis, FTX And Bitcoin’s Freedom From Intermediaries]]></title><description><![CDATA[At Bitcoin 2023, best-selling author and journalist Michael Lewis shared his views on Bitcoin, FTX and the ills of the financial system.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/big-short-author-michael-lewis-on-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/big-short-author-michael-lewis-on-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[Financial crisis]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin 2023]]></category><category><![CDATA[FTX]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sam Bankman-Fried]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter Chawaga]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 21:06:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4MDYzODk3Mjc2NTg5MTI4/bitcoin-2023-michael-lewis.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Best-selling author and journalist Michael Lewis, known for writing “The Big Short,” “Moneyball” and “The Blind Side,” offered his perspective on the current financial landscape and the rapidly-changing world of cryptocurrency on stage today at Bitcoin 2023.</p><p>“When I first encountered the idea of being able to use the blockchain technology to disintermediate financial intermediaries, I thought, ‘thank God,’” Lewis said of his realizations when first researching Bitcoin. “There are lots of unnecessary hands touching money when financial transactions occur. They've just been kind of hard baked into the system.”</p><p>As the author of “The Big Short,” Lewis outlined the fundamental inequalities and short-sighted policies of the contemporary financial system that led to the economic crisis of 2007 and 2008. At Bitcoin 2023, he acknowledged how Bitcoin is designed as an escape from the problems that caused that crisis.</p><p>“If you go back to Satoshi’s original paper, you know, line one, paragraph two, you eliminate the need for a trusted financial intermediary,” Lewis said. “Clearly, the very beginning of the spirit of the enterprise is mistrust of existing financial institutions, well earned mistrust, on the backend of the financial crisis.”</p><p>Across his books and news reporting, Lewis has been praised for his ability to condense complicated financial concepts into digestible prose and demonstrate systemic issues through the experiences of the individuals within them. This skillset makes him uniquely qualified to digest and interpret the emerging cryptocurrency ecosystem, which experienced unprecedented turmoil last year with the implosion of numerous crypto projects, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">most notably FTX</a>. </p><p>At Bitcoin 2023, he discussed his next book and movie project, which will focus on FTX, and described some of the insight he gained from spending time with former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried before and after its collapse.</p><p>"Not in a million years did I think I was going to write about Sam Bankman-Fried," Lewis recalled, adding that he was first asked to meet with Bankman-Fried by a friend on Wall Street, and found himself intrigued by his unique personality. "There's so obviously the potential for a great movie in it... so you want to let people know it's out there."</p><p>Lewis was joined on stage by Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX. Hayes asked Lewis if he owned bitcoin, and Lewis quipped that it was “in the FTX bankruptcy.”</p><p>Hayes and Lewis also touched on the current banking crisis, with Lewis sharing the view that things have not really changed in the institutional system since 2008 — that, if anything, things are worse for retail investors.</p><p>“It seems inherently unstable right now,” he said. “You essentially created a handful of institutions that are too big to fail, and everyone knows their deposits are insured, so no other institution can actually compete in that environment… It’s not going to end until there’s some structural reform.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4MDYzODk3Mjc2NTg5MTI4/bitcoin-2023-michael-lewis.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Speaking At Bitcoin 2023, Tulsi Gabbard Describes How A U.S. CBDC Threatens Freedom]]></title><description><![CDATA[Former congresswoman and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard described how CBDCs threaten freedom at the Bitcoin 2023 event.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/tulsi-gabbard-on-u-s-freedom-at-bitcoin-2023</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/tulsi-gabbard-on-u-s-freedom-at-bitcoin-2023</guid><category><![CDATA[U.s.]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin 2023]]></category><category><![CDATA[cbdc]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter Chawaga]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 20:32:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4MDYzMzM5NDY3NzExNjc4/tulsi-gabbard-bitcoin-2023.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Former congresswoman and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard addressed the audience at Bitcoin 2023 today, focusing on the institutional problems with U.S. politics and elected leaders who seek to consolidate power rather than serve constituents.</p><p>“I served in Congress for eight years and ran for president in 2020, and while we like to have this idea that we have great courageous leaders in Washington … unfortunately, that’s not the case,” Gabbard said. “Ultimately, they’re driven by a fear of losing power and losing control and, at the heart of it, they’re afraid of us. They’re afraid of a free society.”</p><p>In particular, she highlighted the Biden administration’s<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/09/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-innovation-in-digital-assets/"> exploration of a central bank digital currency (CBDC)</a>, underscoring how such a project would be antithetical to the privacy- and freedom-preserving qualities of cash transactions. As outlined in its white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto, “<a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System</a>,” Bitcoin was designed to preserve these qualities in a digital way.</p><p>“The Biden administration’s move toward implementing a central bank digital currency is their latest effort towards exerting control and taking away our freedom,” Gabbard said. “No matter how many flowery words they use to deny that there is ill intent… no matter how many times they say, ‘Hey this is for your own good’... But ultimately, we know this is about their insatiable mission and desire for total control.”</p><p>She also suggested that those in power are combative toward or disinterested in Bitcoin because it cannot be manipulated by any third parties.</p><p>“You would think they would be interested in how Bitcoin is transforming the lives of people around the world, but they don’t actually care about people,” she said.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4MDYzMzM5NDY3NzExNjc4/tulsi-gabbard-bitcoin-2023.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Robert Kennedy Jr. Makes Campaign Debut At Bitcoin 2023: ‘Free Money Is As Important As Free Expression’]]></title><description><![CDATA[Making his first public appearance as a presidential candidate, Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. made his first public appearance as a presidential candidate at the Bitcoin 2023 conference today, sharing his own experiences with Bitcoin, warning about how technology is enabling government totalitarianism around the world and describing how he would protect the rights of Bitcoiners if elected president.</p><p>“As president, I will make sure that your right to hold and use bitcoin is inviolable,” Kennedy said. "I am an ardent defender and lifelong defender of civil liberties and Bitcoin is both an exercise and a guarantee of those freedoms.”</p><p>Kennedy told the crowd that he was first inspired by Bitcoin as a critical freedom technology after learning about how it was used to circumvent financial restrictions <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-fueled-canada-trucker-convoy">during the Canadian trucker protest last year</a>.</p><p>“None of these lawful and peaceful protestors had violated any law… But suddenly, they found that they could not access their money, their bank accounts to pay their mortgages or feed their families,” he recalled. “When I witnessed this … devastating use of government repression, I realized for the first time how free money is as important as free expression.”</p><p>Kennedy has publicly expressed his support for Bitcoin <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1653808786577010697?lang=en">since May 2023</a>, acknowledging its separation from other cryptocurrencies and indicating that legislators should support its development rather than hinder it, as with regulations like the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/biden-administration-proposes-30-tax-on-energy-used-by-bitcoin-miners">Biden administration’s proposed tax on energy used by miners</a>. On stage, he reinforced his distaste for such regulations and he outlined the steps his administration would take to drive Bitcoin innovation in the U.S.</p><p>"First, I will defend the right of self custody of bitcoin and other digital assets," he said. “Second, I will uphold the right to run a node at home… Third, I will defend use-neutral, industry-neutral regulation of energy… Fourth, I will make sure that the United States remains the global hub of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies… I will reverse the government’s growing hostility toward this industry.” </p><p>Finally, he said that he would look closely at “whether individuals like Ross Ulbricht,” the founder of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-from-prison">darknet, bitcoin-based marketplace Silk Road</a> who received a double life sentence in 2013, were prosecuted “for actual crimes, or as a means to crackdown on crypto.”</p><p>“I will consider pardoning them and I will act very quickly to do so,” Kennedy added.</p><p>Kennedy<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/robert-kennedy-jr-launches-long-shot-presidential-bid/story?id=98691944"> launched his Democratic primary bid</a> shortly before <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1653808786577010697?lang=en">signaling support for the Bitcoin industry on Twitter</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/bitcoin-2023-is-robert-f-kennedy-jr-s-first-event-as-presidential-candidate">announcing his Bitcoin 2023 appearance</a>.

As bitcoin allows the transformation of energy into money, bitcoin could be transformative for indonesia”</p><p>He also explained that the country is already on a steady path towards adoption, with more than 12 million cryptocurrency investors, 70% of which are invested in bitcoin. According to Governor Kamil, this number grows by half a million a year. </p><p>In addition, the Governor touched on how bitcoin could bring financial technology to people in his country who currently do not have access to that. “Bitcoin is a solution in my opinion to unbankable parts of my society,” he explained. “40% of my people are unbankable.” </p><p>Another topic touched on was the recent introduction of an Omnibus bill that allows for 100% foreign investment into renewable energy projects above 1 MW. This bill could lead to increased investment and attention in the region. “Come to indonesia, lets have this big reserve of renewable energy dedicated to the bitcoin mining business,” Governor Kamil said. </p><p>Mow touched on the opportunity at hand for Indonesia, saying that “The first [countries] that adopt bitcoin in a meaningful way will have a big advantage.” Afterwards, Governor Kamil inquired about the way that El Salvador’s bitcoin bonds function. Mow replied that “The bonds can finance the buildout of new energy infrastructure … Indonesia could have a volcano bond too.”</p><p>Overall, the talk indicated that Governor Kamil is cautiously optimistic, and that he sees bitcoin as a potential game changer for the economy of his country and the livelihood of his people. As a country with access to major amounts of renewable energy and large portions of the population unbanked, it is seemingly ripe for bitcoin adoption. </p><p>"The new generation is buying Bitcoin as a reserve," Governor Kamil concluded. “Hopefully Indonesia will be a Bitcoin heaven in the future."</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4MDU4MjAxMzQ0NjQ4MjY0/keh_8762.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The World’s Largest Payroll Providers Can Now Use Bitwage To Pay Employees In Bitcoin]]></title><description><![CDATA[Employers using payroll providers like ADP, Paychex and Paycom can now utilize Bitwage to easily pay their employees in their preferred currency.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitwage-announces-payroll-solution-compatible-with-major-providers</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitwage-announces-payroll-solution-compatible-with-major-providers</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitwage]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Paycheck]]></category><category><![CDATA[Payroll]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 15:05:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzODM5Njc4ODI5MzcyOTEy/network-nodes.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="https://www.bitwage.com">Bitwage</a>, a leading provider of Bitcoin payroll and invoicing, has introduced a solution that allows employers to seamlessly connect their payroll providers to Bitwage's service.

Utilizing Lava's loan protocol, users can borrow stablecoins against native bitcoin, eliminating the risks associated with bridge hacks and custodian rehypothecation.</p><p>CEO Shehzan Maredia highlighted the advantages of Lava's borrowing mechanism, stating, "With Lava, people can borrow transparently without rehypothecation risk and without relying on bridges or custodians. Users won't have to trust their counterparty and can borrow using a system that gives users cryptographic assurance that the rules of their contracts will be honored." Lava achieves this through invisible smart contracts called <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/dlcs-on-lightning-and-bitcoin-smart-contracts">discreet log contracts</a> (DLCs), which ensure collateral integrity and enable programmable loan initiation and repayment without the need for intermediaries.</p><p>According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, Lava wallet aims to empower individuals who face challenges with traditional banking, offering innovative security solutions and safety checks to prevent transaction errors. Maredia said that he envisions bitcoin and dollars as the two most crucial assets of the coming decade. Lava's goal, the press release stated, is to create a bitcoin and dollar-centric financial experience that grants users true financial freedom, enabling them to take control of their finances and simplify money management.</p><p>In an interview, Maredia expressed gratitude to his cofounder, team, investors, and supporters, emphasizing that this is only the beginning for Lava. The company said it intends to continue advancing its mission of making finance sovereign and simple.</p><p>Lava's self-custody wallet is currently available on mobile platforms, including iOS and Android, with plans for additional interfaces in the future. </p><p>The company said it intends to differentiate itself from other self-custody wallets through its user-centered financial utility experience including offering borrowing against bitcoin, direct purchases of bitcoin and stablecoins, seamless bank account transfers and simplified transactions. Security is a top priority — Lava stated that there will be future enhancements like collaborative custody and cold wallet integration.</p><p><em>Disclosure: Lava is a portfolio company of BTC Inc., the parent company of Bitcoin Magazine.</em></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxNzU0OTcxNDk3MTEzMjUx/20220819_best-sidechain-recap---shinobi.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cash App, Lighting Labs, Lightspark Executives Discuss Bringing Bitcoin Payments To The World]]></title><description><![CDATA[In a panel discussion at Bitcoin 2023, leaders from some of the largest Bitcoin-focused companies discussed building on the Lightning Network.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/building-lightning-network-companies</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/building-lightning-network-companies</guid><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lightspark]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cash App]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lightning network]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lightning Labs]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin 2023]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter Chawaga]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 16:13:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4MDM2MTQxNTg3MzEwMDE5/fwbgj1mwaaqn5h9.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>In a panel discussion at the Bitcoin 2023 conference moderated by CNBC technology reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/KenzieSigalos">MacKenzie Sigalos</a>, leaders from some of the biggest businesses building services based on the Lightning Network discussed the opportunities and challenges for Bitcoin’s payments-focused second layer protocol.</p><p>The discussion, titled “Building Lightning-Native Companies,” featured <a href="https://twitter.com/starkness">Elizabeth Stark</a>, the CEO of software development firm Lightning Labs; <a href="https://twitter.com/davidmarcus">David Marcus</a>, the CEO of <a href="https://www.lightspark.com/">Lightspark</a>, a firm focused on making Lightning adoption easier and more accessible; and <a href="https://twitter.com/milessuter">Miles Suter</a>, the Bitcoin product lead at <a href="https://cash.app/">Cash App</a>, a mobile payment platform that <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cash-app-enables-bitcoin-lightning-payments-for-40-million-users">introduced Lighting payments to its more than 40 million users in 2022</a>.</p><p>"We've really reached the point right now where Lightning is maturing and we're seeing more and more adoption,” Stark said, summarizing the momentum she has seen since she co-founded Lightning Labs in 2016. “People are adopting the network because it is solving real problems for them."</p><p>By allowing peers to create closed payment channels between themselves, which are only settled on the underlying Bitcoin blockchain when closed, the Lightning Network <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/lightning-network">enables bitcoin payments that can take place in seconds while still benefiting from the security of Bitcoin’s base ledger</a>. But as this second layer is <a href="https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf">relatively young</a>, adoption represents <a href="https://bitcoinvisuals.com/lightning">just a fraction</a> of the larger digital payments volume across the world.</p><p>The panelists highlighted the importance of developing products and services that make Lightning easier to use and solve some of its outstanding issues, like the network’s relatively-low liquidity and limited number of nodes.</p><p>“A channel-based payment network is still very complicated,” Sigalos pointed out. “There’s not a ton of liquidity sitting on the nodes right now” for instance.</p><p>In response, Suter noted that many of the challenges in making Lightning more accessible derive from Bitcoin’s most important qualities.</p><p>"It's hard to develop on Bitcoin,” he explained. “We see that everyday... but it's an intentional decision because we believe that's what allows it to maintain a very minimal attack surface.”</p><p>But the panelists all agreed that when there are significant problems for Lightning to solve, like in countries where it can help people access the dollar or enable more efficient cross-border transactions, adoption is evident. As more of those problems emerge and companies like these continue to build products and services on top of Lightning, they expect adoption to accelerate.</p><p>“Making it easy will drive more adoption,” Marcus said. “Between now and next year when we gather again, we’ll be in a much better place when it comes to Lightning adoption.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4MDM2MTQxNTg3MzEwMDE5/fwbgj1mwaaqn5h9.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Lightning Company Lightspark Introduces Lightspark Wallet SDK]]></title><description><![CDATA[The SDK is designed to offer businesses and platforms an easily accessible Lightning wallet experience.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/lightspark-introduces-lightspark-wallet-sdk</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/lightspark-introduces-lightspark-wallet-sdk</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lightning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lightspark]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNjA3MTM2MjI2NzQ4MTUz/20220926_good-gdog-proof-collaborative-custody-multisig-by-will-schoellkopf_.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Lightspark has announced the launch of the Lightspark Wallet SDK, a tool designed to enable businesses of all sizes the ability to offer their customers a Lightning wallet.

It is called a “moratorium on bitcoin mining.” Its origins <a href="https://www.clayconc.com/_files/ugd/fe4bcd_163aefda66f243cfb4f8c41bd27ebce5.pdf">date back to August 2022 in Clay County</a>, and Buncombe County has mutated it into this newest strain based on broadly construing a North Carolina zoning statute to authorize a development moratorium. </p><p>When properly used, North Carolina’s <a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_160D/GS_160D-107.pdf">development moratorium statute</a> <a href="https://www.sog.unc.edu/resources/legal-summaries/land-use-and-development-moratoria">seeks to ensure that a new type of development does not proceed until changes to regulations or environmental issues are appropriately addressed</a>. This allows for more effective planning and management of growth and development while minimizing potential negative impacts on the community.</p><p>Because a moratorium is a drastic restriction on property rights, the statute imposes conditions that an administrative authority must satisfy to get one. Even then, such a moratorium can only span <a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_160D/GS_160D-107.pdf">a minimum of 61 days</a> and a maximum of one year, as noted by the planning commissioner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3e09Xulteg">during a recent public briefing</a>. </p><p>In this case, Buncombe County commissioners, <a href="https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2023/05/04/buncombe-county-approves-a-1-year-moratorium-on-cryptocurrency-mining/70179529007/">under the direction of Planning Director Nathaniel Pennington</a>, argued that they needed a one-year moratorium on cryptocurrency mining in the unincorporated areas of Buncombe County <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3e09Xulteg">so they could study the industry</a> and “<a href="https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2023/05/04/buncombe-county-approves-a-1-year-moratorium-on-cryptocurrency-mining/70179529007/">craft standards for the newly-defined use.</a>” </p><p>But we already have a workable definition for a bitcoin mine, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/drive-bitcoin-right-through-south-carolina">as confirmed in my last opinion editorial</a>,<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/drive-bitcoin-right-through-south-carolina"> </a>where I referred to a bitcoin mine as a “digital asset data center.” So, let’s just simply define a “bitcoin mining center” as a data center that produces an intangible product. </p><p>That’s now where the rubber meets the road. At the February 2023 commission meeting, armed with the American Planning Association’s “<a href="https://www.planning.org/publications/document/9249180/">Zoning for Data Centers and Cryptocurrency Mining</a>,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3e09Xulteg">Pennington argued</a> that cryptocurrency mining centers don’t meet the definition of a data center under existing North Carolina law. </p><p>The North Carolina statute that enables data mining center tax breaks <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2015/10/01/north-carolina-makes-data-center-tax-breaks-easier-to-get">was enacted in 2015</a>, just six years after the birth of bitcoin. Consequently, most states, including North Carolina, are living with statutes tailored for centralized data center operations and incentives that were carved out to attract corporate data centers built by companies like Google, which include large campuses, consume vast amounts of water and require huge amounts of power. Qualified data centers receive sales tax exemption on electricity. </p><p>As a result, North Carolina’s data mining center laws <em>in practice</em> offer big money for the benefit of a select few tech corporations, but the overarching <em>intent</em> of this legal framework was to promote economic development in North Carolina. Rather than follow the original intent of the data center definition to create opportunities, it’s now the club that is being used to discourage siting digital asset data centers in some western North Carolina counties. </p><p>However, in his rush to pass an ordinance where there were no permit applications pending, the planning director failed to include a “statement of the problems or conditions necessitating the moratorium <em> </em>and [that’s the operative word] what courses of action, alternative to a moratorium, were considered … and why those alternative courses of action were not adequate,” as is required by the <a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_160D/GS_160D-107.pdf">North Carolina General Assembly’s moratoria guidelines</a>.</p><p>So, in my eyes, the planning commission has failed to complete the due diligence legally required to impose a moratorium and appears to be acting with a bias intended to discourage Bitcoin miners from locating in Buncombe County. </p><p>Now that Buncombe County’s overreach has been caught and called out, do we catch and release or seize the opportunity to counter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3e09Xulteg">unfounded claims</a> of e-waste, noise, water consumption and public safety concerns to get this moratorium overturned by the county’s commissioners or the court system?</p><p>This improperly-enacted moratorium is low-hanging fruit and Bitcoiners need to press public officials like those in Buncombe County who don’t do their job properly or exert a bias without doing their homework. Someone should be held accountable and, in this case, all fingers point in the direction of the Buncombe County Planning Commission and the American Planning Association. </p><p>The way in which Bitcoin mining is treated presents a pivotal moment for Buncombe County’s innovation economy. With their hastily and improperly enacted moratorium, Buncombe County’s commissioners failed to rise to the occasion. </p><p>Rather than ban a perfectly-legal activity that they do not fully understand, the commissioners could have created a countywide task force, but that was never presented as an option. A task force could study the pros and cons of digital assets, while planning could have a seat at the table and serve all of their constituents, not just a vocal minority. That should have been the objective. Instead, the adopted policy stifles innovation and advances a false narrative. </p><p>I know this has not gone unnoticed at the state level and the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/north-carolina-house-passes-bill-banning-cbdc-payments">recent <em>unanimous</em> vote to advance an anti-central-bank-digital-currency (CBDC) bill</a> after <a href="https://twitter.com/NC_Blockchain/status/1649571425726898176?s=20">public uproar</a> resulted in revising a prior anti-Bitcoin bill tells me that progress can be made. Education on all levels is still the key. Hopefully, the Buncombe County commissioners will learn to join the cause or miss out on one of the most important emerging tech industries driving adoption of the soundest money ever invented.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Dennis Fassuliotis.

    </figure><h2>Nigeria’s History With Bitcoin Regulation</h2><p>Taking a deep dive into understanding the disposition of the Nigerian government toward blockchain-dependent innovations over the years will paint a clear picture of how crucial and important this recent policy and federal approval is for the Bitcoin space in Nigeria and Africa at large. </p><p>On January 12, 2017, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2021/CCD/Letter%20on%20Crypto.pdf">issued a circular</a> which cautioned financial institutions and the general public about the risks associated with blockchain-dependent technologies, such as Bitcoin. Building on that previous warning and directive, on February 5, 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-will-persist-in-nigeria-but-the-ban-changes-things">officially prohibited banks from facilitating any Bitcoin- and crypto-related transactions</a> by reissuing the circular — a ban that remains unreversed as at the time of writing. </p><p>This restrictive policy come at a time when adoption of Bitcoin and shitcoin-related activities was on the rise in Nigeria, and it was a restriction that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oluwaseunadeyanju/2021/09/14/bitcoin-opportunity-africa-adoption-rate-is-highest-globally/?sh=55d196fb6d57">further fueled the use of Bitcoin and stablecoins</a> as users who are wallowing in the pains of financial restriction increasingly discovered the power of decentralized Bitcoin innovations, like peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces.</p><p>Amid all of these impromptu regulatory measures, CBN was apparently busy creating what it considered an alternative to shitcoins: a government-controlled digital currency called the e-naira, which was <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/out/2021/ccd/enaira%20launch%20press%20release%20%20231021.pdf">officially launched</a> on the October 25, 2021, unequivocally built on a centralized system, not a decentralized blockchain like Bitcoin’s. Meanwhile, Nigeria’s Security And Exchange Commission (SEC) was occupied with <a href="http://forbes.com/sites/oluwaseunadeyanju/2022/05/14/nigeria-issues-crypto-asset-rules-in-a-move-that-could-boost-adoption/?sh=e8c23a212e6d">creating policy frameworks for token-issuance platforms and exchanges</a>.</p><p>All these regulatory changes were not unconnected to the government's awareness of just how thriving the blockchain industry is in Africa’s most populous country.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>What Does This Mean For Bitcoin In Nigeria?</h2><p>At this point, one will naturally ask what another regulatory update in the national blockchain policy means for Bitcoin.</p><p>A quick but detailed response would be: This is definitely a welcomed development for Bitcoin advocates in the country and one of the possibly many steps that we might witness in the right direction.</p><p>From my interpretation, this policy is focused more on giving a direct government overview to relevant regulatory bodies such as the <a href="https://nitda.gov.ng/">National Information Technology Development Agency</a> (NITDA), CBN, SEC, the <a href="https://ncc.gov.ng/">Nigerian Communications Commission</a> (NCC) and the <a href="https://www.nuc.edu.ng/">National Universities Commission</a> (NUC), among many others who are now expected to develop more detailed regulatory frameworks from using blockchain-based innovations like Bitcoin. The government is moving from being totally repelled by or antagonistic about Bitcoin-, blockchain- and crypto-related activities to now accepting them by default and creating a regulatory environment for them to move forward.</p><p>And while altcoins and other development and products dependent on blockchains excluding Bitcoin still stand a chance to remain regulated and subjected to the directives of these incoming regulations, Bitcoin uniquely repels such regulations. </p><p>As a stakeholder in the African Bitcoin space, I must confess that consistent clarity from governments will not only help in driving adoption but will also create an enabling environment for Nigerians to incorporate decentralized blockchain technology, like Bitcoin, into scaling their businesses and ways of life, while opening numerous legal opportunities for everyone.</p><p>As the industry keeps shaping up, keep tabs on the space, as Nigeria President-Elect Bola Tinubu has promised <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/292724">to enable the prudent use of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in the nation's banking and financial sector</a>. My fingers remain crossed until we experience full implementation of Bitcoin-friendly regulations in Nigeria.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Heritage Falodun.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Nozomi Hayase, Ph.D., who has a background in psychology and human development. </em><em>Disclaimer: Bitcoin 2023 and Bitcoin Magazine are both operated by BTC Inc.</em></p><p>With <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/april-inflation-breakdown-where-are-prices-rising-fastest">rising inflation</a> and a <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-regional-bank-crisis-did-not-appear-over-on-thursday-86a51703">growing number of bank failures</a>, the dysfunctional nature of the fiat system becomes more apparent day by day. In the midst of this chaos, Bitcoin enthusiasts are staying calm, even generally hopeful about their futures.</p><p>As public trust in institutions weakens, governments around the world are gearing up for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as a means of reasserting their authority over peoples’ money. </p><p>“Thank God, we have Bitcoin!” </p><p>Those of us who are fortunate to have found it are relieved that Bitcoin exists. As Christine Lagarde, the head of the European Central Bank once <a href="https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1349402076372209664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1349402076372209664%7Ctwgr%5E2ede5541109a2e3ad065ba3608b9dee15335fbe0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinmagazine.com%2Fculture%2Fbitcoiner-optimism-saves-the-world">acknowledged</a>, Bitcoin is an escape hatch from the financial surveillance state.</p><p>Bitcoin, the hardest money ever created, presents a real alternative to both current fiat currencies and CBDCs. Now, those who so choose don’t have to go down the path leading toward a dystopian society. This might make us feel at ease. Some of you might think we can just HODL and maybe orange pill newcomers here and there, and simply wait for hyperbitcoinization. But I say, “Not quite yet. We can’t just sit back and relax.”</p><p>We Bitcoiners have important tasks ahead: Bitcoin's battle against the fraudulent banking system is far from over. It is really only just beginning.</p><h2>The Battle Is Beginning</h2><p>Bitcoin, over the 14 years <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin">since its creation</a>, has been slowly unveiling its revolutionary potential. Bitcoin is a form of “digital gold” that cannot be confiscated. As a saving technology, it provides inflation proofing, allowing us to store value securely. Its core feature of censorship resistance has also helped it to gain popularity, since the importance of having “freedom money” has become clearer to political dissidents and the oppressed the world over.</p><p>Now that the COVID-19 pandemic has wound down, and the emergency has been declared over, global leaders aim to re-engineer the economy. <a href="https://www.weforum.org/great-reset">The initiatives</a> of the Great Reset <a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_CBDC_Technology_Considerations_2021.pdf">plan to use CBDCs</a> as instruments of control, in the process creating a post-human society where human beings, as we have known them, cease to exist.</p><p>Things are moving fast. Commenting on the development of AI and its potential ramifications for humanity, Jordan Peterson, a prominent Canadian psychologist, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh0WQWACCDg">said</a>, “We better get our acts together before the giants show up. They are like knocking at the door right now.”</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qh0WQWACCDg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Peterson has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh0WQWACCDg">talked about</a> how ChatGPT, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">large language model (LLM)</a> and advanced conversational chatbot, is already building an increasingly-intelligent system. He described the process whereby, in the next few years, this AI model could extract a model of the world from the entire corpus of language, and use that to create a fully-rendered, photo-realistic animation indistinguishable from the image of a genuine person. By giving an example of turning a virtual girlfriend into a sex partner, he explained how easily it could falsify the representation of reality so completely that we all become confused about what is real and what is not.</p><p>And this technology is rapidly advancing. In March 2023, ChatGPT4, the most powerful artificial intelligence, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2023/03/28/gpt-4-released-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-your-business/?sh=147d3b612dc6">was released</a>. And Bitcoiners are in a unique position to take Peterson’s warning seriously and start doing something about the issues he has raised. </p><p>Bitcoin is pro-human technology. It provides a tool for us to detect counterfeit reality and which helps us to authenticate and secure truth, backed by our real human experiences.</p><p>Now, digitization of all aspects of society is taking place. From finance to healthcare and education, people are brought to the web to live their lives in a way that disconnects them from their bodies and from the natural environment. This trend leads to “hyper-mechanization,” a term I use to describe the turning point at which machines and robots become dominant in our world, dictating our very experiences. </p><p>This force of digitization, now becoming extreme, is also penetrating into the Bitcoin space. From Twitter to Nostr, and more than we are willing to admit, many of us are hooked to the iPhones and computers that keep us plugged into the matrix, becoming cut off from genuine, heart-to-heart interactions with other human beings.</p><p>As a machine-takeover of the world increasingly threatens the essence of what it means to be human, it is important for us to learn to unplug ourselves and maintain our relationships to ourselves and to nature. We need to collectively practice being offline from time to time, connecting with one another in real life. It is crucial for us to create a resilient human network of proof of work, built on top of the technology that can authenticate reality, based on our truly-felt feelings. </p><h2>Experiencing The Power Of Bitcoin, Firsthand</h2><p>This week, from May 18 to May 20, <a href="https://b.tc/conference/">the biggest Bitcoin conference</a> will take place in Miami Beach, Florida, bringing together Bitcoiners from all over the world. Along with presentations and panels from experts, professionals and leaders in the industry (check the speaker’s list <a href="https://b.tc/conference/speakers">here</a>), this three-day educational event will provide a space for Bitcoiners to gather outside of cyberspace and get to know one another.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/BTCBrunchMiami/status/1617234263501590532"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>From <a href="https://twitter.com/bitcoininmiami/status/1647786228459110400?s=43&amp;t=4-Zdlcfd6SKLkdflZIarcg">brunches</a> to <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/anders-pubby-toxic-happy-hour-pleb-party-miami-brought-to-you-by-swancom-tickets-478687135107?utm_campaign=bitcoin-2023&amp;utm_medium=dot-com&amp;utm_content=bitcoin_week_page">happy-hour pleb parties</a>, there will be plenty of opportunities for Bitcoiners to hang out. Through our exchanges of smiles and hugs, we can have firsthand experiences that demonstrate the power of bitcoin as the currency of love.</p><p>Crucially, the conference will also give us a chance to share our appreciation for artists who have been enriching the Bitcoin space. It will host <a href="https://b.tc/conference/art-gallery">an art gallery</a> displaying the work of more than 60 talented Bitcoin artists.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/Jethroe111/status/1651939821948903427"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/hitomi_matsui/status/1654655957597667329"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/13flr_escalator/status/1648688201668673544"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>There, attendees can meet and interact with these artists in person. Now that AI can whip out sophisticated images in a matter of seconds and mimic our creativity, it becomes vital for us to recognize the value of art created by real human beings who are inspired by their own visions, and engaged in a hard and honest labor of love. </p><p>During the first and second general attendance days of Bitcoin 2023 (on May 19 and 20, 2023), the exuberance of Bitcoin competition will be brought to the main exposition hall to ignite a spirit of collaboration and teamwork. Initiated as a community project, <a href="https://b.tc/conference/bitcoin-games">the Bitcoin Games</a> will provide a fun and joyful contest where local meetups can match their skills and talents to compete. The winning team will bring home the trophy and one full BTC, which can be used to help develop their community (check <a href="https://b.tc/conference/bitcoin-games">here</a> for the details).</p><p>From the <a href="https://b.tc/conference/bazaar">Bitcoin Bazaar</a>, a massive peer-to-peer marketplace, to <a href="https://b.tc/conference/after-party">the official after party</a>, lots of fun things will be happening throughout the week (check the full agenda <a href="https://b.tc/conference/agenda">here</a>). </p><p>Bitcoin is electronic cash backed by human ingenuity. But what powers Bitcoin is our passion and the values that are shared in our hearts. What good is free speech money, if there is no human being who can speak? What is the worth of life, if there is nobody who can feel and experience its fullness?</p><p>At Bitcoin 2023, Bitcoiners around the world can come together to work toward hyperbitcoinization, in order to preserve what defines us uniquely as human beings. It presents a festival of humanity. </p><p>“Tick tock, next block.” </p><p>The countdown has just begun. It’s time to amplify relentless optimism and celebrate the beauty and magnificence that we all are. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Nozomi Hayase.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Robert Hall, a content creator and small business owner.</em></p><p>If you follow U.S. politics, you understand that the country is <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12061031/Where-Biden-Republicans-stand-debt-limit-ahead-Big-Four-meeting.html">on the brink of defaulting on its massive $31 trillion debt</a>. </p><p>At the crux of the issue is that there are<a href="https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/party-breakdown"> </a>Republicans in one corner, who control the House of Representatives <a href="https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/party-breakdown">with a slim 222 to 213 majority.</a> In the other corner, the <a href="https://about.bgov.com/brief/balance-of-power-a-partisan-convergence-in-the-senate/">U.S. Senate</a> and the White House, under Joe Biden, are controlled by Democrats.</p><p>Both parties are diametrically opposed to what the other wants. Republicans want to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gops-debt-ceiling-proposal-where-do-republicans-want-to-cut-spending-366a29b6">significantly cut spending</a> in order to raise the debt limit for a year. Democrats want <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/172376/debt-ceiling-deadline-default-negotiations">a “clean” debt ceiling bill passed without strings attached</a>. As you can see, both parties’ starting positions are nowhere near each other. Ultimately, this has turned into a game of chicken based on who will blink first. It’s all very tiring.</p><p>Is this the way a government should be run? It is absolutely crazy that these leaders would risk defaulting on money that has already been spent. This is like if you or I whipped out a credit card, went crazy buying all kinds of stuff, and did not make the monthly payment at the end of the month.</p><p>The government has been able to run up the debt for a long time because it has had willing participants, such as pension funds, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds and regular joes who lent them money by buying treasury bills because they believed they would be paid back with interest.</p><p>This has been the case for a long time, but now this arrangement is being called into question with the will they, won’t they bull going on in Congress right now. </p><h2>Seriously Broke</h2><p>Are these politicians so detached from reality to think that, once the debt limit is breached and people stop getting paid what is owed to them, people will go right back to loaning them money?</p><p>If they do, they will demand even higher interest rates. The government can’t even afford the rates we have now! What happens if the borrowing cost for the government goes to 10% or 15%? Ain’t nothing getting funded; I can tell you that much.</p><p><a href="https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2023/02/interest-costs-on-the-national-debt-are-on-track-to-reach-a-record-high">Check out this</a>:<a href="https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2023/02/interest-costs-on-the-national-debt-are-on-track-to-reach-a-record-high"> </a>The federal government spent a record $475 billion on interest payments in fiscal year 2022. Interest costs grew 30% last year and are poised to jump another 35% this year, according to the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO’s) own estimate!</p><p>The CBO believes the federal government will spend $640 billion in interest payments this year alone. Is this the<a href="https://jameslavish.substack.com/p/-whats-a-debt-spiral-and-is-the-us"> debt spiral that James Lavish</a> has been talking about lately? It sure as hell seems like it to me.</p><p>We are on a slow-motion collision course with the economic reality that you can’t print and borrow money without consequences. Inflation rears its ugly head first, and then people realize the money they are being paid back with has diminished purchasing power. Once people know they are losing money when they lend it to the federal government, it’s game over.</p><p>This debt-ceiling debate will highlight the dysfunction of the federal government and its inability to keep its promises. This is what surprises me about the politicians on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>Do they really want to show this level of incompetence to the world? It’s like watching your family fight in the front yard. It’s embarrassing as hell and will change the perception that your neighbors have about your family.</p><p>A debt default will change the perception of the U.S. from a trusted payer to a debt junkie unable to pay its debts.</p><h2>How Is Default Good For Bitcoin?</h2><figure>

    </figure><p>The silver lining to this whole debt-ceiling debacle is that it’s going to throw rocket fuel on the price of bitcoin. As people see that their money is no longer “safe” with the federal government, they will seek an alternative to U.S. treasuries. Undoubtedly, some of the dollars that would have been earmarked for treasuries will flow into bitcoin.</p><p>New entrants to bitcoin will see that it is the safe haven asset they were looking for the whole time. There is no counterparty risk, and the supply can’t be diluted.</p><p>During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_United_States_debt-ceiling_crisis#:~:text=It%20began%20in%20January%202013,following%20the%20crisis%20in%202011.">last contentious debate over the debt ceiling</a>, under the Obama administration, the price of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-price-history">bitcoin went from $13 and ended the year at $755.</a> It also reached an all-time high of $1,163 that year. Coincidence? Maybe, but it does make sense for people to protect their wealth during times of potential calamity such as a default. </p><p>So, I say to the politicians running the government right now: Go ahead and keep playing these games. Default or don’t default because, in the end, it doesn’t matter; you still lose. You have led the world to ruin, and it will be up to Bitcoin to save humanity from itself. The debt-ceiling debacle only accelerates the inevitable.</p><p>And to the Bitcoiners: Keep stacking them sats like your lives depend on it, because one day they might. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Robert Hall.
