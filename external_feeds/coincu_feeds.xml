<p>The United States Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Southern District of New York has <strong>made relevant information available about victims of the SBF scam</strong> through its website and <strong>has offered to invite them to cooperate with authorities</strong>.</p>

<p>As mentioned in earlier Coincu News articles, the lawsuits surrounding the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157904-ftx-task-force-recover-victim-assets-formed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX collapse </a>are becoming increasingly complex, making it difficult to compensate victims and determine the responsibility of those involved increasingly tricky.</p>



<p>Previously, the SBF, said to be critical in the collapse of FTX, was charged by U.S. prosecutors with eight counts. But in his most recent trial on January 6, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157878-sam-bankman-fried-pleads-not-guilty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he refused to plead guilty</a>, and his subsequent trial is scheduled for early October. This period seems long enough for him to prepare thoroughly for further arguments.</p>

<p>One witness noted that the majority of the cash came through <strong>Just Lend</strong>, a Tron-based lending business, and was transferred to the wallet via <strong>Binance</strong> before being forwarded to <strong>Huobi</strong>.</p>



<p>This occurs at a critical juncture for <strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/158722-huobi-has-around-60-million-usd-withdrawn/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/158722-huobi-has-around-60-million-usd-withdrawn/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Huobi</a></strong>. <strong>Sun allegedly purchased the exchange through a middleman firm, a claim he rejects, insisting that he is only an advisor</strong>. Nevertheless, there have been many significant developments since then, including layoffs and a requirement that salaries be paid in stablecoins rather than fiat money.</p>



<p>These modifications and concerns that internal communications may have been cut off caused the price of the Huobi token to decline (HT). Over the last 48 hours,<strong> it dropped from a high of $5.39 to a low of $4.33</strong>. Since then, the token has recovered and is at <strong>$4.80</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/157032-ark-bought-160000-coinbase-shares/"><strong>Cathie Wood&#8217;s ARK Fintech</strong></a> Innovation exchange-traded fund sold around <strong>404,000 shares</strong> of Silvergate on Thursday, January 6,<strong> lowering the ETF&#8217;s holdings by more than 99%</strong>. The fund&#8217;s remaining holdings amount fewer than <strong>4,000 shares</strong> worth around <strong>$43,000</strong>, or less than <strong>0.01% of the fund&#8217;s total portfolio</strong>.</p>



<p>Silvergate&#8217;s preliminary fourth-quarter statistics revealed yesterday that the company&#8217;s total customer deposits <strong>decreased from $11.9 billion to $3.8 billion</strong>, forcing it to sell a quarter of its assets at a substantial loss. And <strong>cut 40% of the workforce</strong> (about 200 employees). Yesterday, its <strong>stock price </strong>fell below the issue price of<strong> $12, a decline of more than 45%</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Silvergate shares fell by a record 43%</strong> on Thursday, and they fell by as much as 6.9% further on Friday. The price has been falling for more than a year as the crypto business continues to tank. Since its all-time high of $222.13 in November 2021, the stock has dropped more than 94%, <strong>wiping off about $5.5 billion</strong> in market value.</p>

<p>Wood&#8217;s decision to nearly totally dump her holding is a sharp reversal from only two months ago, when her ARK Fintech Innovation fund purchased more than <strong>200,000 shares </strong>of the bank in a week as<strong> the collapse of Sam Bankman-FTX Fried&#8217;s exchange</strong> heightened fears about crypto businesses&#8217; solvency. She earlier sold over <strong>190,000 shares of Silvergate</strong> in <strong>mid-December</strong>, when the stock was selling at nearly <strong>$19 per share</strong>, <strong>roughly 50%</strong> more than Thursday&#8217;s closing price.</p>



<p>&#8220;The conditions surrounding Silvergate are exceedingly complex, and the near-term outlook is difficult to anticipate,&#8221; Sutton said in a client note. &#8220;It must struggle with the continuation of crypto winter, regulatory inquiries, and possibly legislative action, all of which materially undermine the future growth profile.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Francois Villeroy de Galhau</strong>, the governor of the Bank of France, has begun the process of setting <a href="https://news.coincu.com/158402-paypals-previous-president-believes-decline/">harsher rules</a> for crypto firms operating in France. The <strong>European Union&#8217;s Crypto Asset Market Regulation (MiCA)</strong>, which will serve as a springboard to enable a block-wide licensing regime for cryptocurrency companies and is expected to be voted on in February of this year for implementation<strong> in 2024</strong>, will come before this. MiCA stands for Market Infrastructure for Crypto Assets.</p>



<p>The application for a <strong>Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP)</strong> license in France is now available, although no vendors have been licensed. There are approximately <strong>sixty businesses in France</strong> that &#8220;apply&#8221; to the French market regulator, the AMF, for licenses with looser requirements. The former CEO of Celsius is being sued for fraud by the New York Attorney General, which affects <strong>26,000 customers</strong>.</p>

<p>Given the turmoil that is now occurring in the cryptocurrency market, the <strong>Governor of the Bank of France</strong>, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, stated that there is a need to expedite licensing in France and the bank of France. &#8220;All of the problems that take place in 2022 create a single belief: France intends to go to mandatory DASP license as soon as possible, rather than just registration,&#8221; Villeroy stated. &#8220;<strong>All of the crises that take place in 2022 develop a simple belief.</strong>&#8220;</p>

<p>Recent times have seen <strong>rapid growth</strong> in the overall trading volume of <strong>SHIB,</strong> which is currently being carried out. The primary reason behind this is that when<strong> Shibarium Codes are released on GitHub</strong>, investors discover new ways to make money, which in turn causes fear of missing out (FOMO) among community members.</p>



<p>This token has been steadily climbing back up and making new highs ever since it hit a low of <strong>$0.0000079</strong> on <strong>December 28</strong>. This asset has now marked a string of five &#8220;green&#8221; days in a row, all within the span of one week. In addition, <strong>Ethereum whales</strong> had a role in this price increase. WhaleStats reports that the token is one of the most often purchased cryptocurrencies by whales.</p>

<p>The token that will benefit the most from this meme coin, other than me, will be<strong> </strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/158123-shiba-inu-bone-has-risen-10/"><strong>BONE</strong></a><strong> </strong>because it will be the only token required for paying gas expenses when Shibarium is implemented. BONE has seen a price <strong>increase of 11.76%</strong> in the previous twenty-four hours, and it is <strong>currently trading at $1.12</strong>. Similarly, throughout the course of the previous twenty-four hours, the trading volume of<strong> BONE surged by 105%</strong>.</p>



<p>In addition to the positive catalysts described above, there was also a <strong>33.53% increase </strong>in the amount of<strong> </strong>tokens that were burned. Over the course of the previous twenty-four hours, a<strong> total of 113,660,903 SHIBs</strong> have been burned, and seven transactions have been completed.</p>



<p>In the year 2022, a total of<strong> 83,347,071,504 Shiba Inu</strong> <strong>tokens were consumed</strong>, and there were <strong>6,395 transactions.</strong></p>

<p>Money flow out of Huobi exchange has increased significantly, with more than<strong> $60 million withdrawn</strong> in the last 24 hours, out of a total of <strong>$94.2 million withdrawn</strong> in the previous week. The tokens withdrawn in the last 24 hours are mostly from the <strong>Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Fantom, and Polygon chains</strong>. The spike in outflows raises concerns among consumers regarding Huobi&#8217;s financial soundness.</p>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/157138-justin-sun-transferred-88-million-binance/"><strong>Justin Sun</strong></a>, who was thought to be the mastermind behind the Huobi exchange acquisition shortly after, made moves. Wallets formerly associated with <strong>Justin Sun withdrew 100 million USDC and USDT from Binance</strong>, according to Look On Chain, and the monies were transferred to Huobi.</p>

<p>The exchange has recently become the market&#8217;s focal point. <strong>Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant</strong>, stated <strong>at the beginning of December</strong>, &#8220;<strong>Huobi appears to be highly fragile at the moment.</strong>&#8221; Furthermore, this platform is placed last among the top exchanges by CryptoQuant in terms of clean reserves, or the number of assets maintained on the exchange that is not the exchange&#8217;s token.</p>



<p>Ki Young Ju believes <strong>the plaform&#8217;s Bitcoin reserves have fallen by 90% </strong>in the last year, but Binance&#8217;s have more than doubled. <strong>The active user address has also reduced dramatically</strong>, according to CryptoQuant. In addition to raising concerns about the exchange&#8217;s reserves, Huobi has recently sparked a stir in the crypto industry by listing Pi Network even though the project has yet to build its mainnet.</p>

<p>FTM is expected to rebound after Fantom has obtained governance approval to allocate up to <strong>15% of transaction fees </strong>as revenue to developers developing on Fantom, according to the <strong>newly adopted plan</strong>. The allocation, however, can be increased or decreased in the future via a separate governance vote.</p>



<p>Currently, around<strong> 70% of transaction fees</strong> collected on the Fantom network are distributed to<strong> validators as revenue</strong>, while the <strong>remaining 20% is burned forever</strong>. The Fantom Foundation earlier proposed a gas monetization approach to reduce<strong> the burn rate from 20% to 5%</strong>, with the remainder allocated as a share to motivate developers to build on the ecosystem. dApps that are well-developed will be rewarded.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>As a result, qualifying developers will get about <strong>15% of dApp transaction fees</strong>. In order for decentralized applications (dApps) to qualify for the awards, they need to have been running on the <strong>Fantom Opera network</strong> for at least <strong>three months</strong> and have more than one million transactions that have been finalized. The Fantom Foundation also stated that the qualifying requirements will be adjusted as needed in order to <strong>limit garbage dApps</strong> and misuse of the gas monetization model.</p>

<p>FTM is the native token of this network, which is being looked forward to an increase in price in the future. The Fantom Foundation has high hopes that the new incentive model will <strong>assist maintain the network&#8217;s viability</strong> and the <strong>continued development</strong> of Fantom in the years to come. In addition, the Fantom Foundation expects that it will help <strong>attract and keep outstanding engineers</strong>. The Fantom ecosystem is exhibiting tremendous strides with the current maneuvers and the return of &#8220;<strong>DeFi godfather</strong>&#8221; <strong>Andre Cronje</strong>, and is clearly an environment worth your attention in the near future.</p>
