<p class="MsoNormal">Bitcoin (BTC/USD) moderated early in the Asian session as the pair encountered expanded volatility and then orbited the 26034 area, representing the 38.2% retracement of the appreciating range from 25610 to 26296.78.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stops were elected below the 25872 area during a pullback, representing the 61.8% retracement of the same appreciating range, and bottomed out around the 25814 area before BTC/USD climbed to the 26260.25 area.&nbsp; The recent fresh multi-month low around the 25234.76 area represented a test of a major downside price objective around the 25128.94 area that is associated with selling pressure that increased around the 31862.21 and 30421.29 levels in July.&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Stops were elected below the 27620.46 area during the decline, another downside price objective linked to recent downward pressure around the 30222 and 29665.27 areas.&nbsp; Major Stops were also elected below the 27991.29 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 15460 to 31862.21.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
