The banking institution said it’s introducing new customer protections regarding financial transactions with certain scam-related crypto platforms.</strong></p>
<h2>Australia’s NAB Bank Intervenes in $184 Million Worth of Payments That Raised Scam Concerns</h2>
<p>National Australia Bank, one of the four largest Australian banks, is restricting transfers to certain high-risk crypto exchanges. On Monday, the lender <a href="https://news.nab.com.au/news/scam-strategy-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it’s introducing new blocks on digital asset platforms where scams are more prevalent.</p>
<p>Between March and July of this year, NAB customers abandoned payments for more than $270 million Australian dollars (almost $184 million) after receiving scam alerts from the bank. Nearly half of scam funds reported to the Australian Financial Crimes Exchange in a recent 30-day period were linked to cryptocurrencies, the bank noted.</p>
<p>Chris Sheehan, NAB executive for group investigations and fraud, pointed out that several measures introduced by the bank in the last six months, such as sending payment prompts and taking action on spoofing and stopping the use of links in unexpected text messages, have contributed to protecting the bank’s customers from various scams. He added:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re now also taking action to block some payments to high-risk cryptocurrency exchanges in a further effort to stop scammers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sheehan also highlighted that crypto-related scams are a fast-growing threat with Australians losing more than $221 million Australian dollars (over $150 million) to them in 2022. “These scammers are part of organized, transnational crime groups. Increasingly, we’re seeing them use cryptocurrency platforms to send stolen funds quickly and often overseas,” the executive explained.</p>

<p>NAB’s steps on that front come after the other three major Australian banks — Westpac Banking Corp., Commonwealth Bank, and Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group — introduced similar measures not long ago.</p>
<p>On May 18, Westpac said it had started trialing new customer protections for some crypto-linked payments to reduce “scam losses.” Citing the threat of scams, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Australia’s largest bank, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-bank-in-australia-to-limit-transfers-to-crypto-exchanges/">unveiled</a> in early June its plans to restrict payments to coin trading platforms.</p>
<p>Restrictions imposed by Australian banks and payment providers affected the country’s crypto trading sector. In May,  Australia <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-halts-deposits-and-possibly-withdrawals-for-aussie-users-after-being-cut-off-by-australian-payment-service-provider/">halted</a> Australian dollar (AUD) deposits after Westpac’s announcement and the decision by the local payment gateway Cuscal to discontinue support. It was later revealed that Australian payment provider Payid had quit processing AUD withdrawals for the exchange’s customers.</p>

He stressed that “The Biden administration has taken so many actions to dethrone King Dollar that it would be difficult to rank them all by their destructiveness.”</strong></p>
<h2>Economist Warns Biden Administration’s Actions Threaten U.S. Dollar&#8217;s Reserve Currency Status</h2>
<p>Heritage Foundation economist and research fellow E. J. Antoni sounded the alarm on the potential calamity of the U.S. dollar losing its reserve currency status in an interview with the Daily Caller News Foundation, published Sunday.</p>
<p>“The Biden administration has taken so many actions to dethrone King Dollar that it would be difficult to rank them all by their destructiveness,” the economist stated, warning:</p>
<blockquote><p>Losing reserve currency status … would mean 70 years of deficits flooding back to the U.S., all competing with existing dollars held domestically to buy goods and services. That’s a hyperinflation scenario.</p></blockquote>
<p>“It also means we could no longer export inflation abroad, so we’d bear the full cost of future inflation ourselves,” he opined.</p>
<p>The weakening value of the dollar is further exacerbated by inflation, with economists attributing it to the policies of the Biden administration and the Federal Reserve. In June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 3.0% on an annual basis.</p>

<p>While noting that “It’s difficult to overstate just how calamitous this would be and how quickly it could happen,&#8221; Antoni told the publication:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Biden administration’s spending, borrowing, and printing of trillions of dollars gave us 40-year-high inflation … Such devaluation of the dollar has shaken foreigners’ confidence in the currency’s stability over time.</p></blockquote>
<p>One currency that many expect to challenge the dominance of the U.S. dollar is the proposed BRICS currency. The economic bloc comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Russian news outlet RT recently <a class="sc-hWhWUk dZhDeq" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/">claimed</a> that the BRICS nations are launching a gold-backed currency. Antoni opined: “A gold-backed currency represents a real threat to all fiat monies, including the dollar.”</p>
<p>However, Leslie Maasdorp, vice president and chief financial officer of the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS Bank, has insisted that the BRICS does not have an immediate plan to create a common currency to challenge the dominance of the USD. “The development of anything alternative is indeed a medium to long-term ambition,” he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/">clarified</a>. In addition, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/imf-has-not-seen-specific-proposal-on-brics-currency/">has not seen</a> any specific proposal for a common BRICS currency.</p>

Ripple case regarding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>. &#x201C;The SEC has chosen to communicate and regulate not by clear rule or guidance but by enforcement actions, often politically timed,&#x201D; one congressman described.</strong></p>
<h2>Congressmen Urge SEC to Stop Regulating Crypto by Enforcement</h2>
<p>U.S. Congressman Ritchie Torres (D-NY) wrote a letter to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler on Tuesday regarding how the SEC should regulate crypto following the <a href="https://news-bitcoin-com.webpkgcache.com/doc/-/s/news.bitcoin.com/us-judge-rules-xrp-not-necessarily-a-security-on-its-face-sending-xrp-supporters-into-celebration/">landmark ruling</a> on the SEC v. Ripple case regarding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m writing to inquire if the SEC intends to come to terms with the folly of the Commission&#x2019;s crusade against crypto assets in light of the latest decision by Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York,&#x201D; he began. &#x201C;Needless to say, regulation by enforcement had a dreadful day in court.&#x201D; The lawmaker continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a landmark legal opinion, Judge Torres resoundingly rejected the regulatory overreach of the SEC, which has been indiscriminately declaring all crypto assets, except bitcoin, to be securities.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Judge Torres&#x2019; ruling, which the congressman referred to as the Torres Doctrine, &#x201C;crypto assets are not securities in themselves but can be sold as part of investment contracts, which do qualify as securities under the Howey Test.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Moreover, the congressman noted that Judge Torres faulted the SEC &#x201C;for conspicuously failing to provide fair notice to the crypto industry.&#x201D; He pointed out that under Chair Gensler, &#x201C;the SEC has not issued a single rule on crypto assets,&#x201D; emphasizing that all the securities regulator has done is &#x201C;sent mixed messages, one after the other, not only contradicting the CFTC [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] but often contradicting itself.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He added: &#x201C;When pressed about the status of ether as a security, Chair Gensler has been all over the place: yes, no, maybe so.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The lawmaker stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>The SEC has chosen to communicate and regulate not by clear rule or guidance but by enforcement actions, often politically timed. The endless stream of contradiction and confusion, as well as the arbitrariness of the enforcement actions themselves, is the opposite of fair notice.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#x201C;I hope that the SEC will find itself so chastened by the court&#x2019;s decision that it will concentrate the Commission&#x2019;s enforcement energies where it belongs: on the bonafide bad actors who perpetrate serious transgressions like fraud, market manipulation, and the misappropriation of customer funds,&#x201D; the congressman added, concluding:</p>
<blockquote><p>I look forward to finding out how the SEC will reassess its regulatory assault on crypto assets in light of the Torres Doctrine.</p></blockquote>
<p>The lawmaker further explained that even though the SEC reserves the right to appeal the district court&#x2019;s decision, &#x201C;the chances of an immediate appeal are vanishingly small because there remain issues in the case that have yet to be resolved, and resolving them requires fact-finding (i.e. a trial), which takes time.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Congressman Warren Davidson (R-OH) agreed with Rep. Torres. He tweeted Tuesday: &#x201C;I join my colleague in calling for Gary Gensler to embrace a different approach. The Ripple case should make clear that Congress needs to provide clarity that is lacking for investors, innovators, regulators, and even the courts. I remain hopeful that we can agree on a digital asset market structure bill that will do this appropriately and swiftly.&#x201D;</p>

However, he also raised a number of concerns associated with AI, emphasizing that the regulator is currently developing rules to address AI-related challenges.</strong></p>
<h2>Gary Gensler on AI Benefits and Challenges</h2>
<p>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler discussed AI and the challenges surrounding it, including the impact on financial stability, in his remarks before the National Press Club on Monday.</p>
<p>“Today’s AI-based models provide an increasing ability to make predictions about each of us as individuals,” he described. “Models have been developed to assist in making decisions about who gets jobs, loans, credit, entry to schools, and healthcare, to name a few. This raises a host of issues that are not necessarily new to AI but are accentuated by it.”</p>
<p>Noting that “AI models’ decisions and outcomes often are unexplainable&#8221; and &#8220;the insights that come out of such models by design are inherently challenging to interpret in terms of accessibility to humans,” Gensler detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>AI also may make it more difficult to ensure for fairness. The outcomes of its predictive algorithms may be based on data reflecting historical biases as well as latent features that may inadvertently be proxies for protected characteristics.</p></blockquote>
<p>Moreover, the SEC chair stressed: “If the optimization function in the AI system is taking the interest of the platform into consideration as well as the interest of the customer, this can lead to conflicts of interest. In finance, conflicts may arise to the extent that advisers or brokers are optimizing to place their interests ahead of their investors’ interests.” He revealed:</p>
<blockquote><p>That’s why I’ve asked SEC staff to make recommendations for rule proposals for the Commission’s consideration regarding how best to address such potential conflicts across the range of investor interactions.</p></blockquote>
<h2>AI and Financial Stability Risks</h2>
<p>Gensler also discussed the risks AI poses to financial stability. “The possibility of one or even a small number of AI platforms dominating raises issues with regard to financial stability,” he said.</p>
<p>“AI may heighten financial fragility as it could promote herding with individual actors making similar decisions because they are getting the same signal from a base model or data aggregator,” the SEC chairman cautioned. “This could encourage monocultures. It also could exacerbate the inherent network interconnectedness of the global financial system.”</p>
<p>However, Gensler noted that the current model risk management guidance “will not be sufficient” and “will need to be updated.” He explained that while model risk management tools can help to reduce overall risk, they primarily address firm-level, or micro-prudential, risks. The SEC chair added that many of the challenges to financial stability that AI may pose in the future will require new thinking about system-wide, or macro-prudential, policy interventions.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Gensler emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>While recognizing the challenges, we at the SEC also could benefit from staff making greater use of AI in their market surveillance, disclosure review, exams, enforcement, and economic analysis.</p></blockquote>
<p>“I think AI is going to continue significantly transforming science, technology, and commerce … Given that we’re dealing with automation of human intelligence, the gravity of these challenges is real,” he opined.</p>

Now users can execute bitcoin deposits and withdrawals using the network, taking advantage of lower fees.</strong></p>&#13;
<h2>Binance Completes Integration of Lightning Network</h2>&#13;
<p>Binance recently <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-completes-integration-of-bitcoin-btc-on-lightning-network-opens-deposits-and-withdrawals-eefbfae2c0ae472d9e1e36f1a30bf340" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the completion of its integration of Lightning Network, a scaling layer for the Bitcoin blockchain. The exchange informed about these new capabilities on July 17, explaining that users can now deposit and withdraw bitcoin from Binance using this new option.</p>&#13;
<p>The Lightning Network allows users to accelerate the speed of their transactions to and from the exchange, given that there is no need for waiting for transactions as when using Bitcoin in its base layer. Also, the fees for Lightning Network transactions are cheaper than Layer 1-based transactions. This difference is especially notable in times of high congestion on the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> base layer.</p>&#13;
<p>For deposits, the exchange accepts transactions starting from 0.00001 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> ($0.30) and up to 0.05 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> ($1,510). To withdraw <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, Binance will collect a network fee of 0.000002 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, or less than ten cents per transaction.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h2>A Lightning Journey</h2>&#13;
<p>Binance <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-announces-lightning-network-withdrawal-implementation-amidst-bitcoin-network-congestion-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it was working on including Lightning Network capabilities on its platform in May when the exchange had to <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1655380303383261185?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pause</a> <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> withdrawals in a period of network congestion created by the appearance of the BTC-based protocol known as Ordinals, which allows users to inscribe arbitrary data on the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> blockchain.</p>&#13;
<p>Addressing this situation, Binance <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1655419624962527233?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>To prevent a similar recurrence in the future, our fees have been adjusted. We will continue to monitor on-chain activity and adjust accordingly if needed. Our team has also been working on enabling <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> Lightning Network withdrawals, which will help in such situations.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>In June, Binance <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1671042638592589826?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it was still working on the integration after some users noticed the existence of Lightning nodes associated with the exchange. However, Binance warned there was &#x201C;still more tech work to be done,&#x201D; promising to offer updates when the integration tasks were finished.</p>&#13;
<p>Changpeng Zhao, CEO Of Binance, had stated before that the implementation of the Lightning Network was &#x201C;more complicated&#x201D; than it might appear due to the on-demand generation of invoices featured by the Lightning Network, which is different from having pre-generated addresses.</p>&#13;

Within the realm of cryptocurrencies, there exist two noteworthy tokens backed by gold: pax gold (PAXG) and tether gold (XAUT). Together, these tokens amass a considerable worth of nearly $1 billion. Although the total number of PAXG and XAUT tokens reaches nearly 500,000, their distribution is relatively concentrated, amongst the 31,000 token holders.</strong></p>
<h2>Nearly 500,000 Gold-Backed Tokens in Circulation, Yet 20 Wallets Dominate the Supply</h2>
<p>The two leading gold-pegged crypto assets, PAXG and XAUT, which are backed by a troy ounce of .999 fine gold, still dominate the field of precious metal-based digital currencies. The demand for tokens backed by gold experienced a significant surge in 2022, notably when gold reached its all-time high of $2,074.60 per ounce on March 8th.</p>
<p>An illustrative example is PAXG, which saw its market value soar from <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/demand-for-gold-backed-tokens-brings-premiums-as-precious-metals-value-jumps-higher/">$424 million</a> on February 19, 2022, to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tokenized-gold-market-caps-grew-significantly-last-month-as-fresh-demand-drives-premiums/">$611 million</a> by the end of March. Tether gold also saw growth last year, with its market capitalization increasing from $430 million in February 2022 to $486 million the following March, a rise of more than 13%. Combining the market capitalizations of both PAXG and XAUT on March 23, 2022, amounted to $1.09 billion in value.</p>
<p>Today, the combined market capitalization of both gold-backed tokens has decreased, with PAXG standing at $490 million and XAUT at $487 million. Over the past day, PAXG, issued by Paxos, has recorded approximately $16.38 million in global trade volume, while XAUT has witnessed $4.17 million in trading activity.</p>
<p>Statistics indicate that there are approximately 31,000 holders of PAXG and XAUT combined, with 30,314 wallets specifically holding PAXG. As for tether gold, it is held by only 1,037 unique addresses. Notably, the top ten addresses for XAUT control a significant <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/tethergold/richlist/">98.23%</a> of the total supply. The largest wallet for tether gold contains 93,500 XAUT, while the Tether Treasury possesses 66,679 tokens.</p>
<p>Bitfinex, on the other hand, holds approximately 28,712 XAUT, representing 11.65% of the total supply. Among the 30,000+ PAXG wallets, the top ten addresses account for <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/paxgold/richlist/">34.13%</a> of the entire supply. Binance takes the lead as the largest wallet holder with 20,000 PAXG tokens, followed by the Paxos Treasury, which holds 15,235 PAXG. Furthermore, Binance possesses another wallet within the top ten, containing 5,833 PAXG, while Kraken holds 5,810 PAXG in the wallet just below Binance&#8217;s.</p>
<h2>Gold-Backed Coins Witness Minimal transfers</h2>
<p>Determining the exact availability of these gold tokens for retail traders in the open market is challenging. In previous instances, both PAXG and XAUT have experienced premiums and discounts on exchanges compared to the spot market value of gold. Generally, both coins have closely mirrored the spot value of an ounce of gold since their issuance. Similarly to their physical counterparts, tether gold tokens exhibit minimal transfers.</p>
<p>Since its creation, XAUT has only witnessed a total of 13,654 transfers. On the contrary, PAXG has seen a significantly higher number of transfers, reaching 846,887 since its inception. However, when comparing the transfer activity of PAXG to that of Ethereum and Bitcoin on a daily basis, PAXG&#8217;s transfers appear relatively minor in comparison.</p>

<h2>Crypto Market in Flux</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Throughout this chaotic 24-hour period, leveraged digital asset traders observed a colossal liquidation of <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData">$106.88 million</a>, impacting both short and long positions. Amid the slump on July 18, the crypto asset 1inch (1INCH) surfaced as the most severe casualty, losing nearly 16% of its worth against the U.S. dollar.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-598399 size-full" title="Crypto Turmoil: Market Slump, Heavy Liquidations, and Unexpected Gainers" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/btcusd_2023-07-18_11-10-43.png" alt="Crypto Turmoil: Market Slump, Heavy Liquidations, and Unexpected Gainers" width="1554" height="1158" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/btcusd_2023-07-18_11-10-43-300x224.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/btcusd_2023-07-18_11-10-43-1024x763.png 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/btcusd_2023-07-18_11-10-43-768x572.png 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/btcusd_2023-07-18_11-10-43-1536x1145.png 1536w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/btcusd_2023-07-18_11-10-43.png 1554w" sizes="(max-width: 1554px) 100vw, 1554px">&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Amidst the turmoil, other digital assets encountered sharp declines as well. Terra classic (LUNC) suffered the most, plummeting over 6%, while solana (SOL) didn&#x2019;t fare much better, also losing around 6% of its value. Although numerous coins have seen losses, some have managed to withstand the downturn. For example, bitdao (BIT) has increased more than 2% and chainlink (LINK) has gained 4.65% against the U.S. dollar.&#13;</p>
<p class="p1">
<p>&#13;<br />
Other frontrunners on Tuesday encompass sui (SUI), apecoin (APE), and xdc network (XDC). In terms of liquidations over the past hour, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> lead in liquidated positions. While crypto markets have undergone a widespread decline, this week&#x2019;s <a href="https://blog.bitfinex.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitfinex-Alpha-63.pdf">Bitfinex Alpha Report</a> states that bitcoin investors are &#x201C;behaving more bullishly.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The report highlights that onchain movements in Bitcoin indicate a transfer of supply from long-term holders (LTHs) to short-term holders (STHs), a cycle typically observed in bullish markets.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;This shift hints at new market entrants seeking quick profits and long-term holders cashing in on favourable prices. As this trend plateaus, it signals an early bull market stage where supply change occurs between these two cohorts,&#x201D; the report elaborates.&#13;<br />

The event will focus on the future of Web3, including how blockchain and crypto can empower the next billion people to improve their everyday lives.</p>
<p>The conference will feature over 100 prominent leaders, innovators and influencers as speakers across two stages. People will engage in valuable conversations around Web3 and the latest industry innovations, trends and issues — evoking ideas, facilitating development, making connections, and finding solutions to challenges.</p>
<p>More than 2,000 people are expected to attend from all over the world, with millions more tuning in to the event virtually through <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/live">Binance Live</a>’s stream. A wide range of topics and discussions will be explored, including how to empower new blockchain users and participants, as well as the ways to establish a cooperative future between traditional and decentralized finance. The conference will also host immersive exhibitions and workshops on building businesses, bootstrapping, and creating successful projects on the blockchain.</p>
<p>“We look forward to hosting the global community and innovators at Binance Blockchain Week. Our objective is to continue building the Web3 and blockchain industry together, expanding on its potential to improve financial equity and positively impact society overall,” said Yi He, Co-Founder and Chief Marketing Officer at Binance.</p>

Many supporters and market observers anticipate a price increase prior to the event. According to an anonymous market analyst known as Plan B, bitcoin&#x2019;s price could ascend to between $40,000 and $50,000 in the run-up to the next block reward halving.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Plan B Estimates Bitcoin Could Cross $40K Ahead of Fourth Halving Amidst Market Uncertainties</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Two optimistic events are stirring discussion in recent circles: the potential approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S., and the impending block reward halving. The <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-2024-halving-presents-new-challenges-a-deep-dive-into-the-future-of-mining-rewards/">forthcoming halving</a>, predicted to occur in about nine months, near April 24, 2024, will inevitably halve bitcoin miners&#x2019; revenues. Analysts at JPMorgan foresee financial challenges for bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) miners if the crypto asset&#x2019;s price and transaction costs fail to increase by that date.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;While bitcoin halving is seen as having a positive effect on the bitcoin price given the production cost acted historically as a floor, it poses a challenge for bitcoin miners,&#x201D; JPMorgan&#x2019;s senior analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou explained in a note to clients.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
On July 16, 2023, a<a href="https://youtu.be/vmIlDbTgFYs"> video surfaced</a> from Plan B, an anonymous market analyst famed for creating the <a href="https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25">stock-to-flow (S2F)</a> price model. In this video, he posits that bitcoin&#x2019;s value could elevate to a range of $40,000 to $50,000 by the impending halving. A <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/plan-bs-stock-to-flow-price-model-denounced-by-vitalik-buterin-says-model-can-be-harmful/">wave of criticism</a> crashed over Plan B in 2022 when his S2F forecasts <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-supporters-sift-through-the-graveyard-of-technical-indicators-that-failed-to-predict-bitcoins-bottom/">fell short</a>. However, in this latest video, he employed the 200-week moving average as a tool to predict future price trends.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;The 200-week moving average increases currently at about $500 [per month], so nine times $500 will be $4,500,&#x201D; Plan B explained in the video. &#x201C;Bitcoin&#x2019;s 200-week moving average right now is a little under $28,000, so $28,000 plus $4,000 is well [a] $32,000 dollars (200-week) moving average at the halving approximately.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The anonymous analyst added:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>And bitcoin would be above that right, and usually it would be like 50% above that, which would indicate a range of Bitcoin at the halving between $40,000 and $50,000.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Plan B also sparked intrigue on July 17, 2023, by launching a <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1680948756806549504?s=20">survey</a> that posed the question: &#x201C;Can bitcoin this halving cycle (before April 2024) make a new all time low (ATL, currently $15.5K) and/or a new all time high (ATH, currently $69K)?&#x201D; At the time of writing, the poll has drawn more than 20,000 responses, with 37.9% predicting neither a new ATL nor a new ATH prior to April 2024.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Comparatively, Plan B&#x2019;s pre-halving price forecast is modest. For example, Matrixport <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/matrixports-year-end-2024-prediction-bitcoin-to-reach-125000-as-strong-performance-fuels-bullish-sentiment/">forecasts</a> a halving price of $63,160, fueled by Blackrock&#x2019;s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund filing and a marked rise in institutional interest.&#13;<br />
