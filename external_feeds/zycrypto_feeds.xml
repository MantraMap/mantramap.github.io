<ul>
<li>The partnership is a win for the Ethereum-scaling network, having welcomed a major NFT project from Solana, y00ts.</li>



<li>Polygon’s native MATIC token added 3% in the last 24 hours.</li>
</ul>



<p>Financial services giant Mastercard is collaborating with Polygon to bring together music artists, their fans, and industry mentors through a Web 3 accelerator program. Mastercard Artist Accelerator will launch in spring 2023 with a live-streamed artists showcase &#8211; per the announcement.</p>



<p>The program targets musicians, DJs, and producers with the tools to share their content on Web 3, including minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It includes exclusive access to special events and music releases. For the fans, the MasterCard Artist Accelerator features a limited NFT edition dubbed The MasterCard Music Pass, providing users with exclusive Web3 learning resources.</p>



<p>Commenting about the launch during the Consumer Electronics Show, MasterCard Chief Marketing and Communication Officer Raja Rajammanar termed the partnership as an opportunity to nurture budding artists. &#8220;<em>Music is a universal passion, inspiring, moving, and bringing us together; however, it can feel impossible for budding artists to break in. With the MasterCard Accelerator, we are expanding access and driving connections further with cutting-edge Web3 technology,</em>&#8221; he said.</p>



<h2 id="h-mastercard-artist-accelerator-program-targets-new-crop-of-artists"><strong>Mastercard Artist Accelerator Program Targets New Crop of Artists</strong></h2>



<p>Polygon Studios, the firm behind Polygon blockchain, is optimistic that the program will empower a new generation of artists using blockchain technology &#8211; also educate the public about the technology. &#8221;<em>Web3 has the potential to empower a new type of artists that can grow a fan base, make a living and introduce novel mediums for self-expression and connection on their terms,</em>&#8221; CEO Ryan Wyatt said.</p>



<p>The announcement has boosted the price of Polygon’s native MATIC token, up to an intraday high of $0.8104, according to data shared by CoinMarketCap. The price changed by +3% in the past day and +5.79% in the last week. MATIC ranks tenth among other cryptos, with a market capitalization of more than $7 billion.</p>



<p>Mastercard Artist Accelerator is a win for Polygon, one of the fastest blockchains, onboarding major brands like Starbucks, Nike, and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polygon-nfts-finally-coming-to-over-1-4-billion-instagram-users-matic-primed-for-huge-boost/">Instagram</a>. The blockchain is said to have paid $3m in grants to have Solana NFT projects, y00ts, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-is-losing-its-touch-with-nfts-as-major-projects-announce-departure/">moved</a> to its platform. Together with DeGods, another NFT platform on Solana, y00Ts generated some of the highest NFT sales on Solana, up to 70%.</p>

<ul>
<li>Analysts mirror the development of the market in 2023 in line with the current status and future landmark activities.</li>



<li>The SEC v Ripple case, stablecoin, DeFi regulations, and demystification of the FTX saga, among others, are pivotal in swinging the pendulum.</li>



<li>Network upgrades on Ethereum, Solana and other blockchains rolled out this year will also set the tone for web3 development.</li>
</ul>



<p>The new year has come with new speculations and insights over the market as experts mirror key factors that can shape the growth of web3 over the next 12 months.</p>



<p>The major area analysts have dwelt on is the market&#8217;s bearish trend. Is an end in sight? Last year was chaotic, with several top assets losing as much as 60% in value with no positive roads in sight. Market leader, Bitcoin, slumped over 55% last year and still hangs below $17,000.</p>



<p>On the bright side, inflation is on the decline, and many experts have predicted stocks and other assets to bounce back, so the bear season may soon be over.</p>



<p>The SEC v Ripple (XRP) case is now two years old, and the final decision would be a landmark case for both the SEC and Ripple. On the side of the SEC, a judgment declaring XRP as a security could reshape digital asset regulation in the country.</p>



<p>Some commentators believe that the case would have a wider reach with authorities going after centralized exchanges like Binance US, Coinbase, and Kraken. Lewis Cohen, an attorney specializing in web3 and digital assets, stated that the SEC wants to go all out of its wins against XRP.</p>



<p>“<em>If they got their way, most US token marketplaces could not allow users to buy and sell ‘crypto securities’ without registering as an exchange or getting an exemption,” </em>he added.</p>



<p>A win for Ripple will prevent a draconian push by regulators to describe digital assets as securities. Specifically, it will be a landmark <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-will-triumph-in-sec-battle-and-gary-gensler-will-resign-this-year-pundit-predicts/">moment</a> for the XRP Army, which believes its beloved asset is being held back by the SEC.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-upgrades-for-ethereum"><strong>More upgrades for Ethereum</strong></h2>



<p>After Ethereum’s Merge last year, which <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-merge-goes-live-and-a-new-era-for-ethereum-begins-heres-the-whole-bushel/">transitioned</a> the network to a proof-of-stake model reducing its energy usage by 99%, Vitalik Buterin restated his commitment to continue leading the advancement of web3. The blockchain will implement a Shanghai upgrade in Q1 2023 to enable stakers to withdraw their Ethereum (ETH).</p>



<p>Since staking kicked off on the blockchain, users have staked about $20 billion worth of ETH, including newly generated ETH, and will be available for withdrawal in March. Ethereum is also poised to extend its leadership as the leader in NFTs and other projects as its closest rival, Solana, battles migrating projects and technical issues.</p>

<p>Indonesia is considering setting up a national crypto exchange to keep pace with the fast-changing financial landscape.</p>



<p>Citing a Wednesday report by Bloomberg, the exchange is expected to launch later this year before the country assigns the Financial Services Authority (FSA) control over such assets. Presently, crypto assets in Indonesia are policed by “Bappebti” -the country’s commodities futures trading regulatory agency responsible for regulating commodity contracts.</p>



<p>Confirming the plan on Wednesday, January 4, Bappebti acting head Didid Noordiatmoko noted that the move was part of the country’s broader <a href="https://zycrypto.com/indonesia-set-to-tax-crypto-transactions-and-investments-from-may/">financial sector plan</a>.</p>



<p><em>“The FSA will assume regulatory power over the assets over the next two years, by which time the exchange should be set up,”</em> said Noordiatmoko.</p>



<p>The statement comes even as lawmakers push for a regulation seeking to task the FSA with regulation strengthening supervision and oversight of crypto-assets which have been booming in the South East Asia nation. Lawmakers presented the draft law in September 2022 following the Terra-induced turbulence by cryptocurrencies and the need to tighten the regulation of crypto exchanges.</p>



<p>Despite adopting a strict anti-crypto stance in the past, partially due to local regulations and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/indonesias-islam-council-bans-muslims-from-trading-bitcoin-deems-crypto-as-haram/">Islamic laws,</a> Indonesia has been loosening its noose, opting for progressive regulations as demand for crypto assets continues to soar. According to the country’s trade ministry, as of November 30th 2022, there were 16 million crypto investors compared to 11.2 million at the end of 2021. </p>



<p>Despite the ongoing crypto winter slashing trading volumes globally, statistics provided by the trade ministry showed that Indonesians traded 212 trillion rupiahs ($14.3 billion) worth of crypto in the first half of 2022. Presently 383 crypto assets and 10 local coins can be traded by Indonesians, with another 151 assets and 10 coins under evaluation by the Bappebti.</p>



<p>It is important to note that while trading in digital assets is legal in the country, the use of crypto payments as a form of payment is prohibited in Indonesia after the country imposed a blanket ban on the practice in 2017. That could change if the proposed law on moving crypto assets from the  Bappebti to the FSA is passed. </p>

<p><em>“The Southern District of New York is working around the clock to respond to the implosion of FTX, all hands are on deck. We are launching the SDNY FTX task force to ensure that this urgent work continues, powered by all the SDNY’s resources and expertise until justice is done.”</em></p>



<p>Led by Andrea Griswold, the task force will use asset forfeiture to recover billions owed to FTX users. The task force is made up of experienced and seasoned prosecutors from various SDNY divisions, including the Public Corruption Unit, Commodities Fraud and Transactional Crime Enterprise Unit. </p>



<p>Griswold is also popular among digital asset circles for investigating the collapse of Terra&#8217;s stablecoin UST and LUNA token last year which wiped billions from the market. The FTX implosion has also resulted in huge losses, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) estimating over $8 billion loss for users. </p>



<p>FTX filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection in November, claiming to have 100,000 creditors and liabilities going over $10 billion. </p>



<h2 id="h-sbf-pleads-not-guilty">SBF pleads not guilty&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The creation of the task force comes after Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) pleaded not guilty to all charges of fraud linked to the collapse of FTX. SBF is now scheduled to face trial on Oct 2, with the court granting further bail conditions which prohibit SBF from accessing or transferring FTX assets. </p>



<p>SBF could potentially face <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftxs-sbf-bags-250-million-bail-could-face-up-to-100-years-in-jail-as-close-associates-plead-guilty/">jail time</a> of up to 115 years if he is found guilty of all eight counts of fraud. Last month, former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang pleaded guilty to fraud charges concerning their roles in the collapse of the digital asset exchange.</p>

<p>Ethereum whales are busy amassing Shiba Inu ahead of the anticipated <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-finally-wants-to-drop-the-memecoin-tag-with-the-debut-of-its-own-blockchain-as-adoption-rate-wobbles/">Shibarium launch</a>. Whalestats shows that the meme crypto was among the top ten most purchased tokens among the top 2,000 largest Ethereum investors as of this week.</p>



<p>What is fueling the high whales’ appetite is the much-awaited Shibarium. It is a layer-2 platform expected to improve the performance of Shiba Inu. Speculations were heightened that Shibarium could be launched soon after the ecosystem’s lead developer Shytoshi Kusama remarked on the same. &#8220;<em>Love meeting with the team from UnificationUND about Shibarium. Aligning. Onboarding. Finalizing. Soon. Very Soon,</em>&#8221; Kusama said.</p>



<p>Described as the foundation for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, Shibarium features a decentralized exchange (DEX), blockchain games, and the metaverse &#8211; all of which have been under development. Shiba Inu currently relies on Ethereum, with shortcomings being slow transactions and high gas fees. However, that is bound to change within the layer-2 solution. Shibarium will take most of the transactions off Ethereum while still using the blockchain as a security layer.</p>



<h2 id="h-shibaswap-governance-token-bone-jumps-double-digit"><strong>ShibaSwap Governance Token BONE Jumps Double-Digit</strong></h2>



<p>BONE, a governance and utility token, has gained the most from the sentiment among the five major tokens in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The digital asset, capped at 230,000,000 tokens, has gained 10% in the past week, according to data from CoinGecko. On the other hand, SHIB declined by 0.36% in the same period.</p>



<p>LEASH and TREAT are the other tokens expected to play a key role in the upcoming Shibarium. Both tokens can be staked for rewards in Shiba Inu liquidity pools. Also in the plan is SHI, a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-primed-for-strong-recovery-as-ecosystem-mulls-introducing-stablecoin-before-year-end/">utility stablecoin</a>. The Shibarium developers have also added a token burn mechanism to cut the supply of SHIB.</p>



<p>The latest data from the Shiba Inu burn tracker, Shibburn shows that the number of burned SHIB to date was 410,384,382,996,444 as of the time of writing these lines. The canine-themed token launched with an initial supply of a quadrillion tokens, out of which that in circulation stands at 562,850,341,247,185.</p>

<p>Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau has called for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/france-calls-for-eu-wide-cryptocurrency-regulation/">tougher regulatory requirements</a> for crypto firms even as European Union Nations chart a path forward for an all-around regulation.</p>



<p>According to a Jan 5 Bloomberg report, the governor stressed the need for France to move with urgency in enacting sound rules for the crypto sector when delivering a speech to the financial sector in Paris. Villeroy noted the recent volatility in the sector means France should not wait for European rules to come into effect before it can make licensing for Digital Asset Service Providers (DASPs) compulsory.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“All the disorder in 2022 feeds a simple belief: it is desirable for France to move to an obligatory licensing of DASP as soon as possible, rather than just registration,”</em> said Villeroy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, licensing laws for DASPs are optional. However, persons who provide “crypto trading” and “custody services” on behalf of third parties must register with the AMF. About 60 crypto firms, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-eyes-france-as-spot-for-a-global-headquarters-amid-regulatory-thunderstorms/">including Binance</a>, operate in the country, having received lighter registration from the country’s Financial Markets Authority (FCA). At least 50 others operate in the country without licenses.</p>



<p>France has an eased regime for regulating digital asset providers, a factor that has often challenged its efforts to present itself as the most pro-crypto nation among EU nations.</p>



<p>Mid last month, Herve Maurey, a Senate finance committee member, proposed an amendment, which, if passed, will see the clause allowing crypto firms to operate without a license until 2026 removed. Proposing the amendment, Maurey noted that the FTX collapse had been a game changer, warranting tightening of rules urgently regardless of when the MiCA rules would be passed.</p>



<p><em>“This (FTX) led a number of players within the French system to consider that things needed to be supervised more tightly,”</em> he said.</p>



<p>That said, the amendment could end the option to operate without stringent checks as early as October 2023, with deliberations in the French parliament kicking off this month.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the soon-to-be ratified <a href="https://zycrypto.com/finalized-eu-mica-crypto-regulation-seeks-to-police-nfts-and-algorithmic-stablecoins/">Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA)</a> regulation, which has been pending in the EU parliament, is expected to enter into force in early 2023. First tabled in 2020, the regulation seeks to establish harmonized rules for crypto assets and related services and activities for the EU level and put into place a framework that is intended to avoid Terra or FTX-style collapses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="1200" height="700" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Solana-Ushers-In-Groundbreaking-Payments-Era-Further-Strengthening-SOLs-Market-Position.jpg" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Solana Ushers In Groundbreaking Payments Era, Further Strengthening SOL&#039;s Market Position" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Solana-Ushers-In-Groundbreaking-Payments-Era-Further-Strengthening-SOLs-Market-Position.jpg 1200w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Solana-Ushers-In-Groundbreaking-Payments-Era-Further-Strengthening-SOLs-Market-Position-300x175.jpg 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Solana-Ushers-In-Groundbreaking-Payments-Era-Further-Strengthening-SOLs-Market-Position-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Solana-Ushers-In-Groundbreaking-Payments-Era-Further-Strengthening-SOLs-Market-Position-768x448.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div>
<p>Solana, one of the largest proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies, has been going bonkers, jumping over 40% in the past seven days on the back of BONK, a dog-themed token that recently debuted on the Solana ecosystem.</p>



<p>Launched on Dec. 25, BONK is a meme coin modelled after Shiba Inu and features a dog avatar. BONK is described as “the first Solana dog coin for the people, by the people.” Accordingly, 50% of the token’s supply is said to have been airdropped to the Solana community as a way of compensating them following FTX and Alameda’s collapse, according to a statement on the token’s website.</p>



<p>“<em>The Bonk community were tired of toxic “Alameda” tokenomics and wanted to make a fun meme coin where everyone gets a fair shot,”</em> read the statement.</p>



<p>In the past 24 hours, BONK has surged 42.90%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. This growth has also convinced some Solana traders that the token’s trading volume is potentially driving Solana’s price up, therefore piling into BONK.</p>



<p>Solana’s rebound comes after the cryptocurrency dropped as low as $8.30 on Dec. 29 after being caught up in the loss wave following the implosion of FTX and Alameda Research.</p>



<p>As ZyCrypto reported, Sam Bankman-Fried’s public support for Solana and revelations of Alameda holding a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/despite-solanas-tumble-amid-the-ftx-collapse-the-community-is-keeping-its-hopes-high/">significant chunk</a> of SOL on its balance sheet painted the cryptocurrency in bad light leading to a massive retail dump. Between Nov 7 and Dec 29 2022, SOL lost over 77% of its value, bringing the asset&#8217;s total losses to just over 96%.</p>



<p>Solana also witnessed a massive exodus of projects building on the ecosystem, with Non-fungible token (NFT) firm Dust Labs announcing plans to bridge off two of its top-performing Solana NFT projects, DeGods and y00ts, onto Ethereum and Polygon.</p>



<p>With the dust settling on the FTX saga following the arrest of Sam Bankman-Fried, the Solana community seems to be pulling themselves together with the hope of reviving Solana’s lost glory. In the past three weeks, calls on the community to focus on the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/heres-why-solanas-future-is-still-bright-despite-sol-price-nuking-97-below-ath-vitalik-buterin/">ecosystem’s developments</a> and growth as opposed to sideshows have been rising.</p>



<p>Last week, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressed support for Solana, noting that “the chain has a bright future” after the recent sell-off washed out “the awful opportunistic money people.” He went on to note that he hoped that Solana’s community would get its fair chance to thrive.</p>



<p>SOL was trading at $13.19 after a 1.22% drop in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>Several crypto companies struggled to stay afloat, some were closed, and others filed for bankruptcy. Notable among these were Argo Blockchain, BlockFI, Celsius Network, Compute North, Core Scientific, FTX, Terraform Labs, Three Arrows Capital and Voyager Digital. </p>



<p>2022 also saw most of the major cryptocurrency prices heading southward. The major cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, started trading at around US$47,000 and closed the year at just under US$17,000. Similarly, Ethereum, the major altcoin, started the year trading at around US$3,800 and closed the year at around US$1,200.</p>



<p>Most of the world economies were hit by high inflation in 2022. The annual inflation rate hit a record high of 9.1% for the United States in June 2022. Similarly, consumer price inflation in the Euro Area reached a record high of 10.6% in October 2022. The US Fed, the European Central Bank (ECB) and many other central banks hiked their key interest rates in 2022 to curb rising inflation. Cryptocurrency prices were hit as markets adjusted to higher interest rates.</p>



<p>2022 witnessed several global efforts aimed at regulating the crypto industry. The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation geared towards harmonising crypto asset rules in the EU is expected in early 2023. In the United States (US), several bills on crypto-related regulation were introduced and are awaiting Congress to pass them.</p>



<p>One of the major events of 2022 was the Merge of the Ethereum network, transitioning from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in September. Among the key benefits of this upgrade is the expected reduction in energy consumption of the Ethereum blockchain by over 99%. Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, highlighted the roadmap for further upgrades to the Ethereum network: the Surge, the Scourge, the Verge, the Purge and the Splurge.</p>



<p>The year 2022 is now behind us. 2023 comes with optimism that the challenges of 2022 can only form a stronger foundation for the crypto industry going forwards. Crypto regulation is expected to come hard and fast. Major cryptocurrencies are mostly trading range bound as 2023 kicks off. Lessons learned will have a profound say in how crypto investors and other stakeholders approach 2023 and beyond.</p>

<ul>
<li>Despite the heavy downfall of cryptos, NFTs showed resilience last year.</li>



<li>The positive report has accelerated the price of APE, SAND, and MANA.</li>
</ul>



<p>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)-related cryptocurrencies surged Thursday on the report that the asset class did not perform poorly in 2022, despite the bear run. According to data from DappRadar, NFT sales volumes in 2022 ducked to $25.1 billion from $24.7 billion in the prior year.</p>



<p>The analytics firm reported that the number of trades made last year was 101 million, an improvement from 2021’s 58.6 million, meaning the digital assets fetched a lower value per unit. The decline in dollar terms is tied to the crypto winter, partly caused by macroeconomic factors, the collapse of Terra Luna and its stablecoin, and the contagion around the demise of FTX.</p>



<p>OpenSea ranked top in NFT trades with more than $297 million in December. The marketplace’s sales increased in April with the NFT land plots for Otherside by Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). OpenSea’s trading volumes recorded a sharp decline between May and June from $3.3 billion to $1 billion, showed the report.</p>



<h2 id="h-bayc-was-the-top-performing-nft-in-2022"><strong>BAYC Was the Top-Performing NFT in 2022</strong></h2>



<p>Bored Ape Yacht Club was the top-selling NFT in 2022, according to CryptoSlam, posting estimated sales of $1.6 billion. Most of its sales were made between January and May before the price dropped from a high of $429,000 to a low of $60,000.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, NFT-related tokens are responding positively to the reports. Apecoin&#8217;s APE surged 14% in the past week to peak at $4.18. The jump has increased the market cap of the BAYC&#8217;s token to $1.4 billion. Similarly, Sandbox token SAND rose 10% during the period, while Decentraland (MANA), another blockchain big on NFTs, added an equivalent margin.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Solana continues to suffer from the collapse of FTX. Towards the year&#8217;s close, its major NFT projects, yOOts and DeGods <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-is-losing-its-touch-with-nfts-as-major-projects-announce-departure/">announced</a> their exit from the blockchain. yOOts is planning to move to Polygon, while DeGods will launch on Ethereum this quarter. The outflow deepens Solana&#8217;s woes, considering the two projects accounted for over two-thirds of its NFT sales.</p>

<p>US largest crypto trading platform, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/not-a-single-mention-of-cardano-pretty-low-says-hoskinson-on-coinbases-2023-market-outlook-report/">Coinbase</a>, has agreed to part a total sum of $100 million towards settling its compliance worries with US financial regulators. The sum is reportedly split into two halves, per a New York Times report, with one part as a fine and the other designated as part of commitments to improve internal compliance efforts.</p>



<p>Coinbase was accused of multiple compliances and anti-money laundering violations, including a backlog of necessary scrutiny measures affecting over 100,000 transactions. For a crypto exchange valued at $7.6 billion, the company’s know-your-customer (KYC) practices have been described as rudimentary and porous, with a high risk of allowing lawbreakers and criminals to swindle unsuspecting victims through its platform.</p>



<p>The company had earlier pledged to revamp its compliance team–which the financial regulators describe as too overwhelmed to keep up with over 100 million unique customers–by incorporating external evaluators. But such efforts proved rather ineffective, prompting the opening of a formal investigation last year.</p>



<p>Since obtaining its license in 2017, Coinbase has prided itself as one of the biggest crypto players to establish a foothold in the US. But, the New York-licensed company appeared to have fallen short of the strict regulatory standards peculiar to US markets.</p>



<p>In the US, crypto companies are held to the same compliance standards as commercial banks. Many believe the now-defunct FTX may not have engaged in such fraudulent practices if it was registered in the US instead of the Bahamas. But over the last few years, a trove of donations, nearing billions of dollars, were largely enjoyed by key political officers and decision-makers at the White House–much with little to no suspicion or scrutiny–in the run-up to the 2022 midterm elections.</p>



<p>Worse still, there are still no approved laws for policing operations, despite two congressional recommendations and SEC digital assets report, as crypto innovations spring faster, spreading across one-twelfth of the US total population.</p>



<p>With the current violation, Coinbase will join top exchanges like Kraken and Robinhood, already enlisted in the US regulatory violations list, with a combined fine of $30.3 million. Rumours are ripe about a four-year IRS investigation into Binance compliance misgivings now nearing close. The result, if indicative of Changpeng Zhao’s company, could see Binance give away a considerable grip on its momentous dominance, especially since the fall of embattled Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX.</p>

<p>XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger blockchain network, has notable market divergence metrics pointing to a strong bullish case, according to an analysis by Santiment.</p>



<p>Some of these metrics are pointed out by &#8216;Sanr_King,&#8217; a pseudonymous on-chain analyst on the market analytics platform. The analysis includes whale addresses continuing to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-whales-are-moving-millions-from-binance-as-looming-litigation-causes-record-outflows/">accumulate XRP</a> rapidly and traders continuing to short. It adds that a significant long/short ratio is also on the verge of being crossed.</p>



<p>Sanr explains that over the past six months, the group of XRP holders who own between 1 million and 10 million tokens has been accumulating. This cohort has increased their holding by 25%, bringing their total to 4.09 billion XRP. The trend is significant as it is often seen at market bottoms. The analyst adds that the whales also strongly influence the price of XRP.</p>



<p>The analysis further notes that the funding rate of XRP on Binance is currently slightly negative at -0.026%. While this suggests a bearish sentiment among traders, it is spearheaded by retail traders on Binance, who may not accurately predict short-term price movements.</p>



<p>The metric to look out for is the 30-day MVRV for XRP—a metric that measures the profit or loss of short-term traders. The metric is currently experiencing average losses of -7%. At these levels, short-term traders are likely hesitant to sell their coins at a loss. This could lead to an XRP price surge, the analysis notes.</p>



<p>Similarly, the MVRV Long/Short difference metric indicates growing confidence among long-term investors. The metric measures the average profit or loss of long-term holders versus short-term holders. It&#8217;s trending upwards, although currently at -11.45%, while the price of XRP has remained relatively sideways. The analysis notes that this could also potentially lead to an XRP upswing.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-could-the-bullish-indicators-land-the-xrp-price"><strong>Where could the bullish indicators land the XRP price?</strong></h2>



<p>Amid the bullish metrics, the price of XRP has mostly fluctuated between $0.28 and $0.54 for the past six months. The token trades at around $0.35, up 1.17% in the last 24 hours. </p>



<p>However, the bullish on-chain metrics and anticipation of ecosystem announcements could see XRP break out of this range. Popular XRP community member &#8216;WrathofKahneman&#8217; recently noted that XRP has seen much more utility than it did in the early days and will also roll out more use cases in 2023.</p>



<p>Added to this, market participants expect a conclusion to the SEC&#8217;s case against Ripple to arrive this quarter. A favourable ruling in the case could potentially cause the price of XRP to explode as the token gets <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-boss-bullish-about-2023-being-the-year-regulatory-issues-in-us-gain-breakthrough-clarity/">regulatory clarity</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripples-brad-garlinghouse-tells-where-crypto-market-is-headed-as-xrp-lawsuit-heads-for-conclusion/">Brad Garlinghouse</a>, the CEO of Ripple Labs, has expressed his cautious optimism about regulatory clarity for the crypto industry potentially coming to the United States in 2023.</p>



<h2 id="h-2023-will-usher-in-regulatory-clarity"><strong>2023 Will Usher In Regulatory Clarity</strong></h2>



<p>To commemorate the first day of the 118th Congress, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse voiced his optimism about 2023 being the year the United States achieved regulatory clarity for crypto. In his <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1610352765129338880">Twitter thread</a> on Jan 3, Garlinghouse said support for crypto regulation is “bipartisan and bicameral”.</p>



<p>He then noted that the U.S. would not be starting with a blank slate for regulation, citing bills such as the Securities Clarity Act, the Cryptocurrency Facilitation for Investors and Digital Assets Act (RFIA), and the Clarification for Digital Tokens Act. While no bill has so far been able to satisfy everyone’s expectations, the Ripple chief explained that these would offer a starting point for debate in the new Congress as “the stakes couldn’t be higher”.</p>



<p>For years industry leaders, investors, and builders in the cryptosphere have whined about the uncertain regulatory climate. The hopeful narrative supports that more regulation will usher in more institutional money and buoy prices.</p>



<p>In 2022 there was some progress on the regulatory front for U.S. crypto-based companies — among other things, President Joe Biden <a href="https://zycrypto.com/heres-the-whole-bushel-of-bidens-groundbreaking-executive-order-for-cryptocurrencies/">signed </a>an executive order on crypto — but the year did not bring as much clarity as many expected.</p>



<p>In fact, the big picture only grew more complicated as the Terra network collapsed and wiped out $60 billion in customer funds, followed by the spectacular implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire.</p>



<p>Garlinghouse remarked that the U.S. lags behind Singapore, Brazil, the EU, and Japan regarding crypto regulation and legislation. The lack of a coordinated effort both in the United States and internationally is forcing businesses to move to countries with fewer barriers, sometimes resulting in catastrophic consequences.</p>



<p>Now, it is paramount that the U.S. provides clear, specific directions on what is and what is not permissible. After years of hemming and hawing, lawmakers must specify whether crypto is a security, a utility, a commodity, or a currency.</p>



<p>That being said, they must act to ensure that the U.S. is a leader in this new area of financial technology. Additionally, they must also protect the investing public from <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-ceo-cz-calls-sam-bankman-fried-a-fraudster-reveals-the-real-reason-behind-ftx-crash/">fraudsters like Bankman-Fried</a>.</p>



<p>Whether 2023 turns out to be the defining year for cryptocurrency regulation in the Land of Liberty remains to be seen.</p>

<ul>
<li>Foreigners investing in digital currencies in the U.K. are now exempt from paying taxes.</li>



<li>The new rule is only applicable if foreigners buy virtual currencies using local brokers in the U.K.</li>



<li>The country has hinted that it is keen on transforming itself into a crypto paradise after a torrid relationship with the asset class.</li>
</ul>



<p>Jan 1 heralded a new tax regime for digital assets in the U.K. targeted at foreign investors in digital assets with a focus on transforming the local digital economy.</p>



<p>Foreigners looking to invest in digital assets in the U.K. have been given a tax break starting on Jan 1 in line with the announcement back in December. In order to take advantage of the tax exemption, foreigners will have to purchase their virtual currencies through local brokers in the country.</p>



<p>The move has been hailed as one that could put the U.K. as one of the world’s leading destinations for virtual currency investors. In December, the government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/non-statutory-instrument-secondary-legislation-the-investment-manager-investment-transactions-cryptoassets-regulations-2022">included</a> crypto assets under Investment Manager Exemptions and according to His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the new rule will be extended to all transactions in the new year.</p>



<p><em>“This exemption is an important factor in attracting global investors, meaning foreign investors won’t be brought into U.K. tax simply by appointing U.K.-based investment managers,”</em> said HMRC.</p>



<p>The U.K. has been on the hunt for international investors as part of plans to improve the digital economy of the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“One of the reasons for the U.K. attracting non-resident investors (including hedge funds) is their ability to appoint UK-based investment managers without creating a risk of U.K taxation for themselves,” </em>a government directory pointed out.</p>



<p>Residents in the U.K. have the tax burden of paying capital gains and income tax on virtual currency transactions. The tax requirement arises from buying or selling the asset class, mining, airdrops, and inheritance of virtual currencies.</p>



<h2 id="h-crypto-paradise-is-a-long-winding-road-for-the-u-k">Crypto paradise is a long, winding road for the U.K.</h2>



<p>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s government has unveiled a number of changes for virtual currencies in the U.K. as part of plans to transform the local ecosystem. The U.K. parliament is deliberating the use of stablecoins as a payment mechanism, while MP Andrew Griffith stated that it is time to “tentatively seize” virtual currency opportunities.</p>



<p>However, the actions of the<a href="https://zycrypto.com/uk-advertising-watchdog-censures-coinbase-etoro-papa-johns-over-misleading-crypto-ads/"> Advertising Standards Authority</a> (ASA) have dimmed the hopes of a crypto paradise following the multiple flagging down of ads by industry operators. The ASA has been on a red-hot streak over the last 12 months, with Floki Inu, Arsenal, Papa John’s Pizza, and Crypto.com receiving warnings from the advertising watchdog.</p>

<p>Gemini&#8217;s co-founder Cameron Winklevoss wrote an <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1609913051427524608">open letter</a> Tuesday accusing Barry Silbert, CEO of DCG, the parent company of Genesis trading, of causing the latter&#8217;s collapse. Genesis Global Trading temporarily suspended withdrawals in November due to liquidity issues resulting from the demise of FTX.</p>



<p>Winklevoss is blaming his DCG counterpart for failing to repay Genesis – its fully owned subsidiary &#8211; $1.675 billion. According to the letter, Genesis owes Gemini&#8217;s Earn users and other creditors $900 million. Winklevoss further accused the group of putting the funds in poorly calculated investments.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>You took this money…to fuel greedy share buybacks, illiquid venture investments, and kamikaze Grayscale NAV trades that ballooned the fee-generating AUM of your Trust, all at the expense of creditors and all for your gain,</em>&#8221; the open letter read.</p>



<p>According to Winklevoss, Silbert needs to cooperate with Gemini to find a solution for the repayment of the amount in question, adding that the DCG boss was acting in bad faith. The exchange&#8217;s president is also faulting his counterpart for refusing to have any meaningful engagement for an amicable solution. He further accused Silbert of trying to portray DCG and Genesis as separate entities, which they were not.</p>



<h2 id="h-silbert-denies-the-claims-says-dcg-was-not-indebted-to-genesis"><strong>Silbert Denies The Claims; Says DCG Was Not Indebted to Genesis</strong></h2>



<p>Responding to the open letter, Silbert denied DCG ever borrowing $1.675 billion from Genesis. He added that his company had not defaulted on any interest payment obligation to Genesis, noting that the next loan maturity was due in May 2023. Silbert said that DCG sent a written proposal to Gemini on Dec. 29 and was still waiting for a response.</p>



<p>Gemini, founded in 2015 by Cameroon and Tyler Winklevoss, had collaborated with Genesis for its high-yield Earn service, which offered a return of up to 8% for deposits. After the collapse of FTX in November, the lending platform suspended redemption, citing many requests. Gemini was also forced to follow suit.</p>



<p>The exposure to its parent company, among others, pushed Genesis Trading into a liquidity crunch. The firm was reported to have lost &#8220;<em>a few hundred million dollars</em>&#8221; following the collapse of Three Arrows Capital and Babel Finance. On June 17, Genesis&#8217; CEO Michael Moro said that the company &#8220;<em>mitigated (its) losses with a large counterparty who failed to meet a margin call. We sold collateral, hedged our downside, and moved on.</em>&#8220;</p>
