										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several federal and state government entities, as of late, have worked hard to better understand the crypto industry and implement appropriate <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/regulation/">regulation</a> to ensure safety amongst traders, though not all these attempts have been successful, and in Illinois, a new <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/bill-regulating-cryptocurrency-stalls-possibility-221034148.html">crypto bill has come</a> to a dead standstill and is now facing the possibility of being vetoed later in the year.</p>
<h2>New Illinois Crypto Bill Appears to Be Stuck in the Mud</h2>
<p>Known as House Bill 3479, the document has garnered support from several republican members of the state House of Representatives. However, for some reason, the bill has never made it to the Senate despite being introduced last April. Several backers of the bill say it’s likely to be workshopped over the summer months, though there’s still a good chance the bill could be vetoed this coming October.</p>
<p>One of the congressmen supporting the bill is Mark Walker, a democrat from the Illinois city of Arlington Heights. He commented that the bill has already been worked on over a two-year period, and that the many bankruptcies and crypto fraud witnessed in 2022 really gave it the boost it needed. He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>If we can get stability within these products and these companies, we can add stability to our entire banking system and put them in a situation where they don&#8217;t have to be bailed out.</p></blockquote>
<p>Senator Laura Ellman – a democrat of Naperville – is working hard to get the bill the attention it needs in the Senate, as right now, it hasn’t been fleshed out enough for her constituents to give it appropriate attention. She stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>They have proper accounting, proper reporting and safeguard to the people who have confidence in giving their money in exchange for cryptocurrency.</p></blockquote>
<p>The bill is not getting positive accolades from everyone. Global DCA CEO Gabriella Kusz says that while she’s in full support of regulating digital currency in the United States, she’s against the bill as it’s allegedly too “broad,” and doesn’t get specific enough with certain areas of the industry to guarantee safe trading environments for everyone. She mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think what it is on the pathway to creating a sound, legal, and regulatory environment, but there&#8217;s still a lot of work to be done.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Keeping Traders Safe</h2>
<p>Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias said that the current lawsuit the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-says-it-operated-as-an-exchange-broker/">has against Coinbase</a> should be a primary reason to support crypto regulation in Illinois and throughout the nation. Alexi commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>This action will protect consumers and investors to ensure they can make informed and safe decisions in Illinois and across the nation. Illinoisans who invest their money in Coinbase or any other digital asset trading business deserve both security and transparency, and my office intends to hold crypto companies to the highest standards.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the world’s second largest digital currency by market cap, Ethereum has made quite a name for itself over the last several years, but according to founder Vitalik Buterin, the <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/ethereum-fails-without-3-changes-175119225.html">asset is not going to</a> do well in the future unless it makes a few changes.</p>
<h2>Vitalik Buterin on the Later Success of ETH</h2>
<p>In a blog post called “The Three Transitions,” Buterin said Ethereum is going to need “to evolve around transitions in Layer-2 scaling solutions, a move to smart contract wallets, and greater privacy for fund transfers.” These are common problems in the digital currency industry, and they are usually grouped together to form what has come to be known as the blockchain trilemma.</p>
<p>Usually, a blockchain is considered top of the line if it’s secure, scalable, and decentralized. However, in most cases, a blockchain is usually only able to accomplish two of those three aspects. Buterin says that if Ethereum is to survive, it must learn to do all three.</p>
<p>Adding to his words is CEO of OP Labs and co-founder of Ethereum scaler Optimism Karl Floersch, who stated in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Layer 2s are critical to the success of Ethereum’s vision of the world computer. Without L2s, Ethereum won’t scale. Without scale, Ethereum will never be able to support the world’s compute demand, and until the world’s compute is fully supported, we can’t fully realize Ethereum’s vision… The solution isn&#8217;t simply &#8216;move users off of [the] main net.&#8217; Rather, the solution lies in extending the capabilities of the Ethereum network. This means that instead of thinking about it as a migration from [the] main net, we can think about it as load balancing the demand for Ethereum main net with other highly secure OP chains.</p></blockquote>
<p>Eli Ben-Sasson – co-founder of the Israeli firm Stark Wire, which is highly involved in Layer-2 scaling – was quick to agree, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Having the leadership from Vitalik which both appreciates the excitement of this moment and urges the community to get on board is a big part of what will propel Ethereum’s success.</p></blockquote>
<p>Concluding his blog, Buterin wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Without [privacy], Ethereum fails because having all transactions available publicly for literally anyone to see is far too high a privacy sacrifice for many users.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Many Updates Have Helped</h2>
<p>Ethereum is the biggest competitor to bitcoin, and while it may not even be close in terms of its price, its network has come quite far in that it’s attracted developers from all over the world who are seeking to establish new currencies, tokens, and blockchains with ETH’s technology.</p>
<p>In recent years, the network has grown so much and garnered so much traffic that it’s been subjected to high fees and slow speeds, but there have been several upgrades in recent months (i.e., the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/merge/">Merge</a>, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/shapella/">Shapella</a>, etc.) that have sought to improve these aspects.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The identities of customers affected by last November’s FTX collapse <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/names-of-collapsed-cryptocurrency-ftx-customers-can-remain-secret-bankruptcy-judge-rules/ar-AA1co3jr">can stay hidden</a> per a bankruptcy judge in Delaware. Judge John Dorsey – the man overseeing the case involving the now notorious exchange’s asset liquidation process – says all names of former traders associated with the firm fall under the category of “trade secrets.&#8221;</p>
<h2>FTX Customers Can Stay Out of the Public Eye</h2>
<p>He explained in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s the customers that are the most important issue here. I want to make sure that they are protected, and they don’t fall victim to any types of scams that might be happening out there.</p></blockquote>
<p>He said it’s important to keep their information out of the limelight so that their data isn’t stolen by scammers, and they’re not taken advantage of by illicit actors. Brian Glueckstein – a former legal representative of FTX – seconded this by explaining:</p>
<blockquote><p>The debtors are in a position to realize value from these customer lists.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, Dorsey was quick to say all creditors and equity holders involved with FTX can be named, as doing so will not present any harm to the firms in question. Kate Townsend, a representative of various media outlets, says the collapse of FTX will arguably go down as one of the worst events to ever transpire within the crypto arena. She mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>At this point, we don’t even know where the shock waves, both individually and institutionally, have hit the hardest, and what institutions may have the largest, or no, exposure as a result.</p></blockquote>
<p>The exchange – which first opened in 2019 – rose to prominence three years later to become one of the top five digital currency trading platforms in the world. Its founder and chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried was lauded as a genius by many, and his net worth was in the billions towards the end of 2022.</p>
<h2>A Long and Weak History?</h2>
<p>Sadly, this reputation was short-lived as in mid-November, SBF complained of a liquidity crunch on social media. He said he <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-i-the-fall-of-a-token/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>needed fast cash</strong></a> to keep his business in operation, and he eventually turned to his biggest rival Binance about a possible buyout. While things <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-ii-binance-said-it-would-buy-the-firm/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>appeared to be moving</strong></a> in that direction for some time, Binance eventually backed <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>away from the deal</strong></a>, claiming the problems FTX was facing were simply too big for it to handle.</p>
<p>From there, the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>company filed bankruptcy</strong></a> and SBF resigned from his post. Things would have been bad enough if they had stopped there, but the trash meter kept rising. It was later discovered that SBF had utilized customer funds to invest in luxury Bahamian real estate and to pay off loans taken out by his other company Alameda Research. He <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftxs-disgraced-founder-has-been-arrested/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>was eventually arrested</strong></a> and extradited back to the United States. He has <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/former-ftx-exec-sam-bankman-fried-pleads-not-guilty-to-fraud/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>entered a not guilty plea</strong></a> and is awaiting trial at his <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-to-await-trial-at-his-parents-house/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>parents’ California home</strong></a>.</p>

<li>There is a key contracting triangle forming with resistance near $0.3110 on the 4-hour chart (data feed via Coinbase).</li>
<li>The price could continue to move down if it stays below the $0.325 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cardano price is struggling below $0.320 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-regain-strength-above-this-hurdle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. ADA price could start a fresh increase if it clears the $0.320 and $0.325 resistance levels.</em></p>
<h2>Cardano Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, Cardano price saw a rejection pattern near the $0.332 zone against the US Dollar. The ADA/USD pair declined below the $0.325 and $0.320 support levels.</p>
<p>The price even declined below the $0.305 support and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). It revisited the $0.300 support zone. A low is formed near $0.300 and the price is consolidating losses. It is now trading below $0.320 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cardano-ada-price-analysis-key-uptrend-support-nearby-at-0-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>.</p>
<p>On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.308 zone or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3326 swing high to the $0.300 low.</p>
<p>The first major resistance is near the $0.315 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3326 swing high to the $0.300 low. There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance near $0.3110 on the 4-hour chart.</p>
<p>A clear upside break above the $0.315 level might send Cardano price toward the $0.332 resistance. Any more gains could start a steady increase toward the $0.350 level or even $0.400.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support is near the $0.300 level. The next major support is near the $0.288 level, below which the price may perhaps decline toward the $0.275 support level. Any more losses might call for a test of the $0.250 level.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Ethereum price is declining below $1,900 against the US Dollar. ETH/USD remains at a risk of more downsides below the $1,830 support zone.</em></p>
<h2>Ethereum Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, Ethereum started a fresh decline below<a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-could-resume-increase-above-1950/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $1,950</a> against the US Dollar. ETH price moved into a bearish zone below the $1,920 level.</p>
<p>There was a sharp move below the $1,880 level. A low was formed near $1,832 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is now trading below $1,880 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-aims-fresh-run-to-2000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,880 on the 4-hour chart.</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is now facing resistance near the $1,855 level. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,929 swing high to the $1,832 low.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $1,880 level and the trend line. The 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,929 swing high to the $1,832 low is also near $1,880. A clear move above the $1,880 resistance could send the price toward $1,900.</p>
<p>Any more gains could even send the price toward the $1,930 resistance zone or even $2,000 in the near term. On the downside, initial support is near the $1,830 level.</p>
<p>The next major support is now near the $1,780 level. A break below the $1,780 support could push the price to $1,650. If the bulls fail to protect the $1,650 support, the price might decline toward $1,550.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do the present lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-sec-brings-charges-against-binance-and-coinbase-watch-out-for-three-red-flags-before-investing-in-crypto-1a63e554">raise any red flags</a>? A law professor at Rutgers University named Yuliya Guseva believes they do, and she thinks it’s highly unlikely nations like the U.S. will be able to dole out proper regulation before financial agencies do irreparable damage.</p>
<h2>Yuliya Guseva on the State of Crypto in America</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, Guseva said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The future of crypto-asset regulation in the U.S. is not fully predictable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right now, the crypto industry in the United States appears to be more up in the air than it’s ever been. Besides both <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-says-it-operated-as-an-exchange-broker/">Coinbase</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sec-sues-binance-alleges-selling-of-illegal-securities/">Binance</a>, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has another lawsuit <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-secs-case-against-ripple-could-result-in-a-massive-win-for-the-crypto-company/">with Ripple</a>, one of the world’s leading crypto companies. Stuart Alderoty – chief legal officer for the firm – recently stated in an interview regarding the charges against his firm:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even if true, this only shows that the SEC’s unelected bureaucrats believe they have unchecked power to issue indiscriminate, closed-door edicts under pain of punishment to those who don’t blindly obey. We have crossed from regulation by enforcement to hubris most foul.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a recent blog post, Binance said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The SEC’s real intent here, instead, appears to be to make headlines. All user assets on Binance and Binance-affiliate platforms, including Binance.US, are safe and secure, and we will vigorously defend against any allegations to the contrary.</p></blockquote>
<p>Paul Grewal – the chief legal officer and general counsel for Coinbase – also threw his two cents into the mix, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The SEC’s reliance on an enforcement-only approach in the absence of clear rules for the digital asset industry is hurting America’s economic competitiveness and companies like Coinbase that have a demonstrated commitment to compliance. In the meantime, we’ll continue to operate our business as usual.</p></blockquote>
<p>Guseva says the outcome of the Ripple lawsuit could prove huge for the future of crypto in America. She mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a progression of SEC enforcement actions. The SEC started with primary markets, namely unregistered [initial coin offerings]. Ripple is one of the last cases of this generation. The primary question in these cases is whether crypto assets are securities. The outcome of the Ripple litigation, therefore, will be a major win or loss for the SEC.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brian Armstrong – the CEO of Coinbase – said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I always tell people the same thing. Don’t invest money you are unwilling to lose. This is a new field of technology. It’s one of the most important technological fields in the world, but don’t speculate with assets that you are unwilling to lose.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Customer Funds Are Safe</h2>
<p>However, Oleg Elkhunovich – a partner at Susman Godfrey – says the SEC is not after customers’ funds. He explained that this is primarily against the companies:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Disgorgement is a remedy that goes after improperly [obtained] gains. Those would not be user assets. User assets should be separated.”</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin is a big asset. It’s got legions of fans all over the world, and it appears to be taking a higher level of precedence in U.S. national politics and similar arenas. However, it’s become clear over time that the world’s biggest and most popular digital asset isn’t going to attract positive attention from everyone, and one of its biggest haters – Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the author of the novel “Black Swan” – <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/nicholas-taleb-still-aint-crazy-about-crypto/">has consistently</a> made it clear he’s not a fan.</p>
<h2>Nicholas Taleb Doesn&#8217;t Care for BTC</h2>
<p>Not long ago, Taleb came out <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-is-a-cult-offers-no-refuge-and-doesnt-help-even-the-bad-guys-black-swan-author-nassim-taleb-says/ar-AA1ckig7">to do another interview</a> about how bad and weak he considers bitcoin to be. He stated that not only does it not help anyone accomplish anything good, but it also doesn’t even do much for those with illicit intent. He says it’s not a “safe haven” like everyone thinks, and he doesn’t even think it’s good for money laundering or similar crimes. Taleb stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>I actually have been a critic of bitcoin for reasons like my principal reason. Well, guess what? It&#8217;s not even good for money laundering. It is too traceable. Bitcoin is a book entry somewhere that anyone with basic knowledge and statistics can triangularize. The second one is that it was transformed into a cult. The first time in history, probably, we&#8217;re mixing money and [a] cult. Here&#8217;s a cult with a financial product. These things don&#8217;t go together very well.</p></blockquote>
<p>In past discussions, Taleb has referred to bitcoin as a “tumor.” In other words, he doesn’t think highly of it, and unfortunately, he’s not the only one. Rich men like <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/warren-buffett/">Warren Buffett</a> – the CEO and founder of Berkshire Hathaway, one of America’s largest real estate giants – has commented in the past that he thinks bitcoin is “rat poison squared,” and it’s likely he’ll never get involved in the crypto arena.</p>
<p>Over the past several years, bitcoin has had something of a mixed run. One of the biggest problems surrounding the bitcoin space is the fact that the currency remains as volatile as ever. One can never truly predict when (or where) it’s going to move, and this has become a major issue for skilled, eager investors looking to do well.</p>
<h2>Up and Down, Up and Down</h2>
<p>There have been instances, such as in 2018 and 2022 (the years of two huge crypto crashes), in which investors lose everything they have. Instances like these don’t paint the industry in the cleanest light.</p>
<p>Still, one can make the argument that the arena has come a long way in very little time. When one considers the fact that bitcoin is only 14 years old (it was first mined in January of 2009), it can’t help but be admired, and the technology behind it has given rise to several new financial fads.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coin Dispute Network – a company that claims to help <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/manhattan-da-slams-cryptocurrency-recovery-company-as-fraudulent/ar-AA1ciIPN">customers retrieve their</a> lost or stolen crypto – is currently under investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney’s office run by the allegedly corrupt Alvin Bragg.</p>
<h2>Bragg and Coin Dispute Network Are in a War</h2>
<p>Bragg has said the company is “fraudulent,” and he’s attempting to seize the domain name. The gist of Coin Dispute Network is that customers must pay a fee to get the company involved, which then begins tracing whatever crypto units are gone and reports its findings to law enforcement so they can freeze and retrieve the digital currency.</p>
<p>Granted the money is found and returned, Coin Dispute Network takes a further cut, which seems rather straightforward. However, per a statement issued by Bragg, the company went further than that and not only kept fees, but also stole additional Ethereum units from the wallets of their customers by “making false promises of asset recovery and [generating] inaccurate blockchain tracing reports to victims.”</p>
<p>Bragg has been after the company since November of last year. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>We want victims of the Coin Dispute Network, no matter where you are, to come forward as we work to hold these bad actors accountable and prevent future fraud.</p></blockquote>
<p>From the sound of things, it looks like Bragg is a man who’s doing his job. A person who cares about justice and is worried about the unregulated state of digital currency, but this would be deceiving, and for him to call anything “fraudulent” would be equivalent to a pig calling something “sloppy.” Let’s not forget that this is the same man <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/opinion-crypto-fans-see-joe-biden-for-the-destructive-force-he-is/">who recently indicted</a> President Donald Trump over a non-disclosure agreement from seven years ago while letting committers of domestic violence off the hook.</p>
<p>Trump’s case was examined by larger institutions like the Federal Election Committee (FEC) and the federal government, both of which said no crime had been committed and there was nothing to prosecute. Bragg, however, ran his campaign on the idea that he would bring Trump down, and he’s now taking on a case that’s not even within his jurisdiction.</p>
<p>We’re also well beyond the statute of limitations, so it&#8217;s become clear that Bragg is probably a Biden puppet looking to take the most powerful republican candidate out of the 2024 race before things get too hairy for democrats.</p>
<h2>A Compromised DA?</h2>
<p>Furthermore, Bragg is reportedly funded by American enemy George Soros, so it’s clear this man’s morals may not be intact. He’s got a demon on his shoulder telling him what to do, and so long as that demon exists, ugly things are going to happen.</p>
<p>Many people in law enforcement claim companies like Coin Dispute Network don’t work, and that it’s very hard to recover stolen crypto funds.</p>

<li>Stellar lumen price started a downside correction from the $0.180 zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>XLM price is now trading above $0.1450 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.160 on the 4-hour chart (data feed via Kraken).</li>
<li>The pair could start another increase if it clears the $0.160 and $0.1675 resistance levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Stellar lumen price is trading above $0.150 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-regain-strength-above-this-hurdle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bitcoin</a>. XLM’s price must stay above the $0.145 support to rise again.</em></p>
<h2>Stellar Lumen Price Analysis (XLM to USD)</h2>
<p>After forming a base above the $0.120 level, Stellar lumen price started a fresh increase against the US Dollar. The XLM/USD pair broke the $0.150 resistance zone to move into a positive zone.</p>
<p>The price even cleared the $0.1650 resistance and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/stellar-lumen-xlm-price-could-restart-increase-above-0-142/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. The upward move was such that the price spiked to $0.180 before it corrected lower. There was a drop below the $0.175 support level.</p>
<p>The price is now testing the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1244 swing low to the $0.1807 high. XLM is now trading above $0.1450 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $0.160 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.160 on the 4-hour chart. The next major resistance is near the $0.1675 level. A clear move above the $0.1670 level might send the price toward the $0.1800 level.</p>
<p>Any more gains could lead the price toward the $0.1920 level or even $0.20. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.150 level.</p>
<p>The next major support sits near the $0.1450 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1244 swing low to the $0.1807 high. Any more losses could lead the price toward the $0.1250 level in the near term.</p>
