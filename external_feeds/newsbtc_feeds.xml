					<description><![CDATA[Conflux (CFX) has had a positive run so far in 2023, placing itself amongst the best-performing altcoins in the first half of the year. However, the “Chinese Ethereum” has been trading in the red in the past few days.

As inferred earlier, the Conflux ecosystem has been experiencing steady growth since the turn of the year. Recently, the blockchain disclosed a partnership with dappOS, which promises mutual benefits for both entities. Conflux So Far In 2023 &#8211; Price Overview The price of CFX has been on an upward trajectory for most of the year, recording an 825% increase in the past six months. This price rally is consistent with the expansion and increased adoption of the Conflux ecosystem. During the peak of this rally, Conflux announced several strategic partnerships with some of China’s biggest companies. Notably, the tree-graph consensus algorithm Layer-1 network announced a partnership with China Telecom to develop a blockchain SIM (BSIM) card in February. However, we’ve watched the token’s price trend downward from its height earlier in the year. Since reaching its yearly peak of $0.4613 on March 20, the CFX token has lost more than 55% of its value, trading as low as $0.176 in mid-June. As of this writing, CFX changes hands at $0.204467, according to CoinGecko data. This represents a 1% increase in the last 24 hours. That said, the token&#8217;s price has declined in recent weeks, shedding more than 28% in the past month. CFXUSD trading at $0.205142 &#124; Source: CFXUSD chart from TradingView The Conflux token has a daily trading volume of $44.4 million, representing a 62.6% decline from the past day. A decrease in 24-hour trading volume signals a recent fall in market activity.

					<description><![CDATA[Compound (COMP), the governance token of the Compound protocol, has experienced a remarkable surge in value over the past week, positioning itself as one of the top gainers in the cryptocurrency market. The token&#8217;s price has risen by an impressive 33% within a span of just seven days.  Whale Activity Behind Price Increase The recent surge in COMP&#8217;s price can be attributed to several factors. One significant catalyst is the presence of whale activity and potential institutional investors. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain shed some light on this phenomenon, revealing that a notable wallet identified as &#8216;0x0D5&#8217; has been involved in substantial transactions involving COMP.  Related reading: ENS Rises 10% As Ethereum Name Service Considers Expanding To Layer-2 The wallet transferred 3 million USDT to Binance and extracted 50,000 COMP, equivalent to around $2.26 million, just two days ago.

This also followed the activities of other whales who moved significant volumes of COMP during this period. These significant transfers often indicate bullish behavior and can have an impact on the token&#8217;s supply and demand dynamics, thus influencing its price. COMP Current Price And Future Prospects The recent price surge and increased trading activity indicate growing investor interest in COMP. The token has surpassed multiple resistance levels and is currently trading above $54.68, boasting a market capitalization of $424 million.  Moreover, COMP has added over $200 million to its market cap in recent weeks, surging from less than $200 million to its current valuation.

					<description><![CDATA[In a recent community call, the team behind the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) revealed plans to adopt a Layer-2 platform in light of increasing gas fees on the mainnet. In response to this planned move, ENS prices climbed roughly 10%, floating higher with increasing trading volumes, evident in the daily chart. The Ethereum Name Service ENS is a decentralized naming system on Ethereum. It provides an easy-to-use and human-readable naming system that allows users to rename mainnet addresses, smart contracts, and other resources. This system permits users to create and employ memorable domain names instead of complicated addresses. Related Reading: Stellar (XLM) Takes Investors By Surprise With 23% Rally The team behind the ENS believes their solution makes it easier for everyone to interact with the pioneer smart contracting platform, and is handy, especially in sending and receiving transactions. In this arrangement, the platform maps a user’s domain, the human-readable address, with their original address or deployed smart contract on the Ethereum mainnet.  However, since ENS maps all addresses on the Ethereum mainnet, transaction fees apply, a concern considering the fluctuating gas fees on Ethereum. In Ethereum, all transactions, including transfers or smart contract deployment, must be paid for. The amount paid depends on the level of demand in the network, and the value tends to be volatile. Over the past few weeks, Ethereum gas fees have been rising.  Fluctuating Gas Fees  According to YCharts data on June 30, the average gas fee for sending a transaction stood at $34.62, down from $42.77 recorded on June 5. As of May 12, it stood at $77.88. The only time gas fees on Ethereum fell was on June 25, when it was at $16.58. At this level, the gas fee is relatively high compared to other networks. For example, the average transaction fee in Bitcoin was $2.383 on June 30, down from $9.018 on May 12. Meanwhile, in layer-2 platforms, transaction fees and smart contract deployment costs are relatively lower, according to trackers. As an illustration, gas fees on Optimism, a popular Ethereum layer-2, is $0.03 as of July 2. Related Reading: Polygon 2.0 Upgrade – Potential Bullish Implications For MATIC Price? Considering the high gas fees on Ethereum, ENS, via two improvement proposals, ENSIP-10 and EIP-3668, will further expand to a Layer-2 platform as a relief for users sensitive to high gas fees on Ethereum as part enhancing interoperability. During the call, the team said this would scale the platform and open the service to more people. In response, ENS prices are up 10% on the last trading day, changing hands at $9.42 at the back of increasing trading volumes. Still, it remains to be seen whether prices will continue edging higher once the platform migrates to a Layer-2 platform. For now, ENS has registered over 2.73 million names owned by more than 697,000 entities. Featured image from Canva, chart from TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It appears that the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, doesn’t trust the security of infrastructure allowing ETH staking. Consequently, in a recent interview, Buterin stated that he would only stake a limited amount of coins to ensure the network is distributed and remain robust against malicious agents who might try to take over the platform, reversing transactions. Vitalik Buterin Has Doubts On Ethereum Staking Buterin has raised concerns about the potential risks of ETH staking through third-party infrastructure, specifically regarding the exposure of private keys and the danger it poses to his entire stake. He believes that implementing a multi-signature system could provide better protection. However, the current process is more difficult to set up, leading to his increased caution. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Up 55% Following BlackRock’s ETF Application, EDX Markets Launch In a multi-sig system, users have their private key to sign transactions. A specific number of signatures must be provided to approve a transaction, which varies based on the Ethereum wallet&#8217;s configuration. This setup boosts security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access to funds. During the Bankless Podcast, the co-founder explains: Probably the biggest reason why I personally am not just staking all of my ETH, that I’m instead staking a fairly small portion, is because if you stake your ETH, it has to be all out, like the keys that access it have to be public on some system that’s online, and for safety, it has to be a multi-sig, and multi-sigs for staking are still fairly difficult to set up, and it gets complicated in a bunch of ways. ETH Prices Stable Below $2,000 His remarks have generated a lot of discussion. Most critics are concerned about the entire security framework of Ethereum. After shifting from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake system, Ethereum relies on a network of validators who have to stake at least 32 ETH for a chance to approve a block of transactions and earn block rewards and transaction fees. These validators are also needed to secure the network; without them, the blockchain will be susceptible to attacks. Related Reading: Binance CEO Goes Bullish On Bitcoin – What’s The Inside Scoop? According to on-chain data, there are over 643,000 validators spread across the globe who have staked over 20.5 million ETH. On average, each validator has staked 32.17 ETH. Notably, the validator count has steadily risen over the years, and the number of ETH staked has sharply increased despite the recent upgrade permitting stakers to unlock their coins. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano and one of the original co-founders of Ethereum, said he was “lost for words,” clarifying that all their ADA is staked as expected in a “properly designed proof-of-stake system.” At the time of writing, ETH prices remain firm and weren’t affected by Buterin’s comments. However, the coin is yet to breach $2,000 and trends below April 2023 highs in early July 2023. Featured image from Canva, chart from TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In a recent tweet, Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao, the CEO of Binance, drew attention to the dynamic nature of Bitcoin&#8217;s price and its increasing practicality. The tweet was timely, aligning with Bitcoin&#8217;s ascent above $31,450, marking its highest value since June 2022. This surge was primarily attributed to the US Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s endorsement of the Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF, referred to as BITX, thereby establishing it as the inaugural leveraged bitcoin futures ETF in the United States. Furthermore, the positive sentiment expressed by BlackRock contributed to the overall strength of the cryptocurrency market. Controversies Surrounding Binance And Its CEO Bitcoin has witnessed a progressive expansion in its practicality as an increasing number of merchants and service providers have embraced it as a viable payment option. The realm of Bitcoin has seen a surge in the availability of futures and options, lending platforms, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Amidst these positive advancements, a series of allegations have surfaced regarding Binance and its CEO, concerning the alleged employment of a &#8220;liquidation waterfall&#8221; strategy in the sale of spot Bitcoin. Zhao has refuted these claims. Related Reading: The CEO of Binance Accuses the SEC – Where to Diversify Your Portfolio? Binance&#8217;s Integration Of Bitcoin Lightning Network Binance has recently announced noteworthy progress in integrating the Bitcoin Lightning Network, aiming to enhance the speed of deposits and withdrawals. Binance is currently in the process of integrating the network, with some technical aspects still pending completion. They recently shared their progress on Twitter, acknowledging that observant users had spotted their new lightning nodes. This confirms Binance&#8217;s active involvement in leveraging the Lightning Network to facilitate faster and more scalable Bitcoin transactions, ultimately enhancing user experience. The community eagerly awaits updates on Binance&#8217;s full integration of the Lightning Network. Related Reading: BNB Market Cap Down By 25% In June Amidst Binance Regulatory Pressure In a tweet, Zhao reaffirmed the exchange&#8217;s commitment to continuous growth, expressing their dedication to ongoing development. He stated, &#8220;Slowly, but we keep building&#8230;&#8221; The integration of the Bitcoin Lightning Network aims to bring several advantages for users, including reduced transaction costs and faster settlement times. These improvements contribute to enhanced overall efficiency and convenience. The surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s value and utility has led to a significant milestone. The number of active Bitcoin addresses, excluding those with zero balances, has reached an unprecedented high of 44 million. A Closer Look At Recent Trends And Future Implications After experiencing a surge to over $31,000 following Fidelity&#8217;s application for Spot ETF, Bitcoin has now settled at $30,424, accompanied by a 24-hour trading volume of $23,666B. While Bitcoin&#8217;s volatility continues to capture attention, another significant event looms on the horizon &#8211; the forthcoming Bitcoin halving. Anticipated to take place between April and May 2024, this 4th halving will bring about a reduction in block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC at the 840,000 block height.

<p>Furthermore, the positive sentiment expressed by <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/when-blackrock-bitcoin-etf-timeline-implications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">BlackRock</a> contributed to the overall strength of the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<h2><strong>Controversies Surrounding Binance And Its CEO</strong></h2>
<p>Bitcoin has witnessed a progressive expansion in its practicality as an increasing number of merchants and service providers have embraced it as a viable payment option. The realm of Bitcoin has seen a surge in the availability of futures and options, lending platforms, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.</p>
<p>Amidst these positive advancements, a series of allegations have surfaced regarding <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/05/sec-sues-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao-for-us-securities-violations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Binance and its CEO</a>, concerning the alleged employment of a &#8220;liquidation waterfall&#8221; strategy in the sale of spot Bitcoin. Zhao has refuted these claims.</p>

<h2><strong>Binance&#8217;s Integration Of Bitcoin Lightning Network</strong></h2>
<p>Binance has recently announced noteworthy progress in integrating the Bitcoin Lightning Network, aiming to enhance the speed of deposits and withdrawals.</p>
<p>Binance is currently in the process of integrating the network, with some technical aspects still pending completion. They recently shared their progress on Twitter, acknowledging that observant users had spotted their new lightning nodes.</p>
<p>This confirms Binance&#8217;s active involvement in leveraging the Lightning Network to facilitate faster and more scalable Bitcoin transactions, ultimately enhancing user experience. The community eagerly awaits updates on Binance&#8217;s full integration of the Lightning Network.</p>

<p>In a tweet, Zhao reaffirmed the exchange&#8217;s commitment to continuous growth, expressing their dedication to ongoing development. He stated, &#8220;Slowly, but we keep building&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The integration of the Bitcoin Lightning Network aims to bring several advantages for users, including reduced transaction costs and faster settlement times. These improvements contribute to enhanced overall efficiency and convenience.</p>
<p>The surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s value and utility has led to a significant milestone. The number of active Bitcoin addresses, excluding those with zero balances, has reached an unprecedented high of 44 million.</p>
<strong>A Closer Look At Recent Trends And Future Implications</strong>
<p>After experiencing a surge to over $31,000 following Fidelity&#8217;s application for Spot ETF, Bitcoin has now settled at $30,424, accompanied by a 24-hour trading volume of $23,666B.</p>

<p>While Bitcoin&#8217;s volatility continues to capture attention, another significant event looms on the horizon &#8211; the forthcoming Bitcoin halving.</p>
<p>Anticipated to take place between April and May 2024, this 4th <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/crypto-analyst-says-bitcoin-has-already-bottomed-sets-halving-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">halving</a> will bring about a reduction in block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC at the 840,000 block height.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has experienced a remarkable upswing, with its value soaring by 55% in the past week. This surge can be attributed to two key factors: BlackRock&#8217;s recent application for a Bitcoin spot ETF with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the launch of EDX Markets. BlackRock&#8217;s move to seek SEC approval for a Bitcoin spot ETF has sparked a wave of similar applications, generating a bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. This sentiment has had a particularly positive impact on Bitcoin and related projects, including Bitcoin Cash. Nonetheless, the introduction of EDX Markets, a platform catering to institutional investors, appears to be the primary catalyst behind Bitcoin Cash&#8217;s recent price surge. EDX Markets, backed by industry giants Fidelity, Schwab, and Citadel Securities, carries significant weight despite not being registered with the SEC. Jamil Nazarali, CEO of EDX Markets, expressed confidence in the compliance of the four listed crypto tokens (Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin) with the SEC. The platform&#8217;s selective listing of cryptocurrencies, which includes Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash, has been interpreted as a vote of confidence, specifically in Bitcoin Cash.  The listing of BCH on the EDX Markets exchange is an indication of the token&#8217;s regulatory clearance. This interpretation gains significance as the SEC scrutinizes other blockchain projects. Related reading: Here’s What Caused Bitcoin’s Flash Crash To $29,000 Bitcoin Cash Uptrend Fueled By Volume Spike On Upbit A major factor that could have influenced the recent uptrend in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the short squeeze and an unexpected surge in trading volume on the South Korean exchange, Upbit. A short squeeze occurs when the price of an asset rises, leading traders who had bet against the asset&#8217;s price to cover their positions at a loss or face forced liquidation.  The volatility in BCH&#8217;s price resulted in approximately $19 million in liquidations within the past 24 hours, with short orders accounting for 77% of the total amount. These liquidation levels represent the highest recorded in June 2023, according to data from Coinglass. BCH&#8217;s price remained heavily suppressed throughout the year, fluctuating between $100 and $150. However, its value experienced a significant vertical rise after being listed on EDX Markets. Currently, BCH is trading at $308.72, reaching levels last seen 14 months ago in May 2022. According to crypto research outlet The Tie, BCH trading volumes on Binance have reached levels not witnessed in two years. This indicates a resurgence of BCH&#8217;s trading interest following its EDX Markets listing. This renewed interest highlights a positive shift in the trading dynamics surrounding Bitcoin Cash. BCH is trading at $280.7 at press time, with a 5% decline in the past 24 hours. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.

					<description><![CDATA[Stellar (XLM), the decentralized blockchain platform aiming to revolutionize the world of cross-border transactions and digital asset transfers, has emerged as one of the most promising cryptocurrencies in today&#8217;s market.  With its recent surge, Stellar has garnered significant attention and is rapidly becoming one of the biggest gainers of the day.

Source: CoinMarketCap Looking ahead, if XLM experiences a dip in the coming days, the $0.1 level could potentially serve as a support level for the cryptocurrency. This implies that if the price retraces, there may be a higher chance of finding support around the $0.1 mark, offering some stability to XLM&#8217;s price action. Correlation Between Bitcoin And Altcoins Historically, Bitcoin has exhibited a positive correlation with many altcoins. This means that when Bitcoin&#8217;s price surges, altcoins tend to follow suit, amplifying the overall bullish sentiment in the market. The recent rally in Bitcoin has likely created a favorable environment for altcoins, including XLM, leading to their upward price movements. XLM market cap currently at $3 billion on the weekly chart: TradingView.com However, it&#8217;s essential to note that while altcoins often experience a positive correlation with Bitcoin during bullish phases, their performance can vary. Some altcoins may outperform Bitcoin, while others may underperform.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stellar (XLM), the decentralized blockchain platform aiming to revolutionize the world of cross-border transactions and digital asset transfers, has emerged as one of the most promising cryptocurrencies in today&#8217;s market. </p>
<p>With its recent surge, Stellar has garnered significant attention and is rapidly becoming one of the biggest gainers of the day. As Bitcoin&#8217;s price continues to climb, it has sparked renewed interest and enthusiasm in the overall cryptocurrency market, benefiting altcoins like Stellar.</p>

<p>This bullish momentum is not only a testament to the platform&#8217;s technological advancements but also to the growing recognition of its potential to disrupt traditional financial systems.</p>
<h2><strong>XLM Shows Strong Rally, But Traders Should Watch Out</strong></h2>
<p>XLM has recently witnessed a notable rally of 4.6% within a 24-hour period, propelling its price to $0.109, as reported by <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/stellar" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CoinGecko</a>. Moreover, over the past seven days, XLM has demonstrated a significant surge of 22.6%. These positive price movements have captured the attention of investors and traders alike, signaling a bullish sentiment in the market.</p>

<p>Despite the encouraging rally, a new <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/xlm-turns-bullish-gains-41-in-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">XLM price report</a> advises higher timeframe traders to remain prepared for a possible range rather than a breakout beyond a crucial resistance level. On the 1-day price chart, the $0.0935 level represents the previous lower high for XLM.</p>

<p>However, on June 27, the price successfully broke past this resistance level with substantial trading volume. This breakout was followed by consecutive days of upward movement, without any significant retracement, indicating a strong bullish trend in the market.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, if XLM experiences a dip in the coming days, the $0.1 level could potentially serve as a support level for the cryptocurrency. This implies that if the price retraces, there may be a higher chance of finding support around the $0.1 mark, offering some stability to XLM&#8217;s price action.</p>
<h2><strong>Correlation Between Bitcoin And Altcoins</strong></h2>
<p>Historically, Bitcoin has exhibited a positive correlation with many altcoins. This means that when <a href="https://www.afr.com/markets/currencies/blackrock-s-bitcoin-ambitions-driving-price-higher-20230629-p5dke2" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bitcoin&#8217;s price surges</a>, altcoins tend to follow suit, amplifying the overall bullish sentiment in the market. The recent rally in Bitcoin has likely created a favorable environment for altcoins, including XLM, leading to their upward price movements.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/4044QwWl/" width="2315" height="1109"/></p>

<p>However, it&#8217;s essential to note that while altcoins often experience a positive correlation with Bitcoin during bullish phases, their performance can vary. Some altcoins may outperform Bitcoin, while others may underperform. Therefore, it&#8217;s crucial for investors and traders to conduct thorough research and analyze the specific factors influencing each altcoin&#8217;s price trajectory.</p>
