Bitcoin struggled to clear the $21,500 resistance zone and corrected lower. The price is trading below $21,000 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $21,150 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down below the $20,650 and $20,500 support levels. Bitcoin Price Starts Downside Correction Bitcoin price failed to clear the key hurdle near the $21,500 resistance zone. BTC started a downside correction from the $21,639 swing high. It traded below the $21,500 and $21,250 levels. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $21,150 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The price even broke the $20,800 support zone. A low is formed near $20,395 and the price is now showing a few bearish signs. Bitcoin price is now trading below $21,000 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It is consolidating above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $21,639 swing high to $20,395 low. An immediate resistance is near the $20,850 level. The next major resistance is near the $21,080 zone. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $21,639 swing high to $20,395 low, above which the price might gain bullish momentum. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com In the stated case, the price may perhaps rise towards the $21,500 level. Any more gains might send btc price towards the $22,000 level. More Losses in BTC? If bitcoin price fails to clear the $21,080 resistance, it could continue to move down. An immediate support on the downside is near the $20,600 zone. The next major support is near the $20,500 zone, below which the price might accelerate lower towards $20,000. Any more losses might send the price to $19,500, where the bulls may possibly take a stand. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bearish zone.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin has done well in the last week with multiple rallies that have brought the digital asset’s price back to early November 2022 levels. However, while investor sentiment looks to have significantly recovered, not everyone is expecting BTC to continue to do well. The Coinmarketcap Price Estimates feature reveals that a large number of investors are expecting the price of the cryptocurrency to fall over the next two weeks. 12% Decline For Bitcoin The Coinmarketcap Price Estimates feature allows users to input their forecasts for the price of any digital asset and then produces an average price based on everyone’s predictions. This can help to give a good feel of the community and how they are looking for an asset. Related Reading: Liquidations Cross $200 Million Following Bitcoin’s Rise Above $19,000 For bitcoin, it seems not a lot of investors expect the pioneer cryptocurrency to continue on this recovery trend. With over 19,000 price estimates submitted, the median came out to an expected 12% decrease in bitcoin’s price in the coming two weeks. Such a decline would actually see the price of BTC fall as low as $18,634, losing more than $2,500 of its current value.  This bearish sentiment does not stop at the end of the month of January but carries into the following months. The median estimated price for the month of February was $18,981, which is an over 10% decline from the current price, and the outlook for March was almost identical in this regard. The expected declines stretch out over the next six months with price medians getting progressively lower. Estimates came out to a between 14-18% decline for the month of April, June, and July, respectively. Bearish outlook for BTC in the next six months &#124; Source: Coinmarketcap Will BTC Succumb To Bearish Pressure? Over the last week, the bitcoin price has been able to clear multiple important levels. These include the 50 and 100-day moving averages, solidifying the bullish trend in the short term. However, while the digital asset is still bullish for the short term, there could be more bad news over the long term. Related Reading: XRP Tops List Of Gainers As Whale Interest Spikes One important technical level that BTC is yet to clear is the 200-day moving average. This is perhaps one of the most important indicators if the digital asset is to continue its upward rally into the next few months. It is currently sitting at $22,738, which means another 5% move upward from its current price could bring BTC toe to toe with this indicator. If bitcoin clears this, selling pressure will likely decline as more investors try to get into the asset. This would lead to a test of the $22,400 resistance level, one that would be easily beaten as long as there is no slowdown in decline. In the end, bitcoin’s performance over the long term will depend on its ability to move enough to beat the 200-day MA. BTC&#8217;s price is now trailing above $21,100 after failing to beat the $21,500 resistance level.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price is showing signs of getting overheated on daily timeframes using the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The tool, typically used to spot overbought conditions, is at one of its highest levels ever historically. However, an elevated RSI reading in BTCUSD is deceiving, leading to some of the most dramatic moves ever on the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price chart. Here is a closer look at what happens when Bitcoin price action gets this hot. Bitcoin RSI Reaches Highest Level Since Early 2021 After breaching above $20,000, onlookers are wondering if a possible bottom is in for Bitcoin, but remain skeptical after such a long, arduous downtrend. Bears have good reason to expect a pullback: Bitcoin has become extremely overbought according to the Relative Strength Index. In fact, the top cryptocurrency is more overbought than at any other point during the entire bear trend. Related Reading: Why A Morning Star Reversal Could Awaken A Monster Bitcoin Rally Bulls, on the other hand, could be ready to push prices higher. In the past, the RSI has only reached such an elevated level – a reading of 90 or above – during the most intense bullish movements of recent years. Elevated RSI tends to only happen during bull markets &#124; BTCUSD on TradingView.com Why Crypto Could Be Ready To Rip Higher Once Again Bearish investors and traders might be quick to claim that this time is different, considering the Fed raising interest rates, the backdrop of war and recession, and more. But bulls have much more data on their side, and momentum at their backs. In fact, bulls have the entire history of BTCUSD price action to prove that the Relative Strength Index reaching such highs have led to the greatest sustained gains in crypto. Bull markets are characterized by recurring phases of extreme RSI readings. Bull markets also end at such extremes, but typically only after at least a series of three waves. Bear market peaks, throughout the entire lifetime of BTCUSD price action, always fail to reach such highly elevated RSI. The Relative Strength Index was created by developed by J. Welles Wilder – who also developed the Parabolic SAR, Average Directional Index, and Average True. The technical tool measures the speed of the change of price movements. Related Reading: “Parabolic” Signal That Triggered Past Bitcoin Bull Runs Reappears Although readings above 70 and below 30 typically represent overbought or oversold conditions, a reading of 90 only occurs with an extremely fast and strong move. Such fast and strong moves tend to appear more often in a bull market than a bear market. Cryptocurrencies can remain notoriously overbought during periods of FOMO. Is that exactly what we&#8217;ve seen in Bitcoin recently? And will the number one cryptocurrency by market cap rip higher, or ultimately see a rejection here due to such overbought conditions?

<p>Although readings above 70 and below 30 typically represent overbought or oversold conditions, a reading of 90 only occurs with an extremely fast and strong move. Such fast and strong moves tend to appear more often in a bull market than a bear market.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies can remain notoriously overbought during periods of FOMO. Is that exactly what we&#8217;ve seen in Bitcoin recently? And will the number one cryptocurrency by market cap rip higher, or ultimately see a rejection here due to such overbought conditions?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Data shows most of Bitcoin&#8217;s recent gains since November 27 have been observed during Asian trading hours, according to a report. Bitcoin Saw The Most Returns During Asian Trading Hours As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, Asian trading hours saw positive cumulative BTC returns of around 16% between November 27 and January 15. The report defines the three principal trading hours: between 0 to 8 Central European Time (CET) for Asian hours, 8-16 CET for European, and 16-24 for the US.

This would suggest that traders in Asia have been participating in net buying throughout this period.

BTC&#8217;s returns were also negative at the end of the year during these hours, while they always remained positive during Asian hours. There was one exception. However, the market reacted strongly to the CPI news last week, and BTC observed gains. Bitcoin&#8217;s cumulative returns stand at 10% in the green during US hours, while they stand at 16% for Asian hours. European hours also mostly saw sideways movement, with BTC remaining at slight negative returns through most of the period, until the recent surge, which also saw buying during this time zone.

					<description><![CDATA[The global cryptocurrency market cap is currently down by 1.61%, but LINK holds its gains on the weekly chart. With institutional investors and whales engaged in trading activities, the crypto market is experiencing a revival.  Chainlink has enjoyed a resurgence this week with an increase in its price and trading volume. The network has also recorded a massive increase in trading volume today at 30.64%. The coin is now ranked number 21 on the list of cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Ethereum-Based Frax Finance (FXS) Is Up 64%, Is There Still Opportunity? What Is Behind The Rally? The Chainlink network has added some notable projects to its catalog. The total value of transactions, its oracle service, exceeded $6.9 trillion. Also, the network provided users with data feeds that extend across new blockchains and layer 2. Another innovation driving the price is the Chainlink proof of reserve. The collapse of FTX created distrust in the industry. This distrust prompted the increased demand for Proof of Reserves. Chainlink&#8217;s Proof of Reserve has become popular among stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide their customers with transparency. The adoption has also aided the LINK price increase. Also, the launch of Web3 solution Chainlink Economics 2.0 has created a framework for the network&#8217;s core interests; Chainlink BUILD, SCALE, and Staking. Chainlink’s BUILD and SCALE enable users to build Web3 dApps. Sergey Nazarov, Chainlink&#8217;s co-founder, stated that the crisis in traditional finance creates opportunities for blockchain technology to fortify crypto as an alternative financial system. Chainlink Price Prediction Chainlink LINK has enjoyed a positive rally in the past week. The asset is currently trading at $6.50 as it approaches the $7 mark. The support levels are $6.27, $6.44, and $6.64, while the resistance levels are $7.01, $7.18, and $7.37. LINK is close to its first resistance level, but the uptrend might pull back as the bearish candles begin to form on the chart. The asset is currently above its 50-day Simple Moving average and approaching its 200-day SMA. This suggests bullish momentum for LINK in the short term. However, expect a pullback before it continues its surge.  The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 65.73 is slightly into the buy zone but not in the overbought region. It reflects the current market condition as the bears struggle to push down the asset&#8217;s price. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is above its signal line and shows divergence, which is a bullish signal.

<b>Chainlink Price Prediction</b>
<p>Chainlink LINK has enjoyed a positive rally in the past week. The asset is currently <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chainlink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">trading at $6.50</a> as it approaches the $7 mark. The support levels are $6.27, $6.44, and $6.64, while the resistance levels are $7.01, $7.18, and $7.37. LINK is close to its first resistance level, but the uptrend might pull back as the bearish candles begin to form on the chart.</p>
<p>The asset is currently above its 50-day Simple Moving average and approaching its 200-day SMA. This suggests bullish momentum for LINK in the short term. However, expect a pullback before it continues its surge. </p>
<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 65.73 is slightly into the buy zone but not in the overbought region. It reflects the current market condition as the bears struggle to push down the asset&#8217;s price. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is above its signal line and shows divergence, which is a bullish signal.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Solana has been one of the top performers in the cryptocurrency market, with gains of over 89% in 30 days, 131% in 14 days, and 63% in 7 days. In the face of claims that the SOL network is failing, the token&#8217;s price needs a slight upward boost to gain back the support of investors. After dropping to a low of $8.01 in December, its price has increased dramatically in recent weeks and is now trading above the $20.00 level.  Solana Surge After Months When Solana&#8217;s native token SOL hit a 52-week low of $8.14 on December 29, the cryptocurrency was on the edge of collapse before the end of 2022. However, the market has since turned around and is currently in its favor. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Continues To Shine With 43% Gains In Last Week The release of the first meme coin, BONK, on the blockchain in late December also contributed to the Solana price increase. The meme coin&#8217;s market cap skyrocketed to $200 million as word spread but faded to $55 million at press time. But SOL has not slowed down. SOL has to close higher than the 200-day simple moving average of $27.59 and exponential moving average of $30.25 to confirm this trend change. However, this close could signal continued positive momentum and set the stage for higher prices. Although the RSI has moved into the bullish momentum at 73, the MACD is still well above its optimum values. So, it lends credence to the idea that another surge is possible. The on-balance volume (OBV) has also increased dramatically since the January rally began, reaching a high not seen since July-August 2022. The OBV going up before a breakout is standard, but all other indicators must still hold steady. According to CoinMarketCap, the market valuation for SOL was $8.62 billion as of 18 January, when it was trading at $23.25 on a 24-hour volume of $902 million. The price of SOL has risen by more than 200% from its low point on December 18.  Solana Catching The Positive Trend To establish this trend change, SOL has to close above the $27.59 and $30.25 200-day Simple and Exponential Moving Averages. However, with such a close, positive momentum appears bullish, which might lead to more price appreciation. According to Coincodex&#8217;s technical analysis, the price of SOL will drop during the next few days, hitting $18.29 on February 1st. It would represent a 20% reduction from current levels.

					<description><![CDATA[Based on a discovery from a new stablecoin test of Cardano, Rick McCracken has predicted a close launch date for Djed mainnet. Rick McCracken, the owner of the ADA staking pool, DIGI, and also a Cardano supporter, did not hesitate to make his findings and prediction known via his Twitter handle. Recall there was an announcement earlier on Djed’s official Twitter handle on January 14, affirming that the stablecoin’s launch this month remains on track. Furthermore, as per COTI Network’s announcement on January 5, the soon-to-launch stablecoin bagged a new partnership with Yepple Incorporated. Related Reading: Optimism Sees Spike In USDC And USDT Transactions Eclipsing $1 Billion The partnership aims to ensure optimal usage of Djed in the Cardano ecosystem. It would also promote the integration of the payment for NFT transactions using Djed. Djed To Go Live Along With New Stablecoin Payment App, DjedPay Djed is Cardano’s first ADA-backed stablecoin powered by COTI Network. It is an over-centralized stablecoin with a collateral rate between 400-800%, according to the description on adapulse.io. According to the CEO of the COTI Network, Shahaf Bar-Geffen, in addition to ADA backing, Djed will also have another token to protect it against exposure to ADA&#8217;s volatility. SHEN would act as the stablecoin’s reserve currency, maintaining its price stability to ensure the 400-800% collateral guarantee against price fluctuations. The stablecoin’s testnet version was initially launched in December 2022. Djed&#8217;s official website revealed that its value is currently 2.94 ADA, with a supply of 676,496 tokens. McCracken&#8217;s prediction of the mainnet launch goes in line with the developers&#8217; initial announcement. According to them, Djed would go live on the mainnet later in January. McCracken also revealed the new Djed stablecoin is now worth $1.019 on the test network. In addition to the mainnet launch, a payment platform for Djed called DjedPay would launch at the same time. According to the official Twitter announcement, DjedPay is a platform that would offer Djed-powered payments by traders and organizations. However, COTI is still trying to secure more partnerships to scale the stablecoins algorithmic adoption. Related Reading: Why Are Liquid Staking Cryptocurrencies Seeing Double-Digit Gains? Meanwhile, news of this development, among others, pushed ADA prices over the past few days. According to data from TradingView, ADA has added over 38% in the last 14 days and 11.1% in the past seven days. The cryptocurrency trades at $0.035235, with a 24-hour price gain of 1.3%. Cardano Releases New ADA Wallet Update In another development, the ADA community recently saw a new upgrade in Cardano’s Daedalus wallet, Daedalus 5.2.0. Input Output Global (IOG), the company behind Cardano, announced the launch of Daedalus 5.2.0 via a tweet on January 16. Daedalus wallet is the official desktop wallet for ADA developed by IOG. The new wallet version is compatible with Cardano node version 1.35.4 and wallet version 2022.12.14. The release of Daedalus 5.2.0 automatically updates the ProjectCatalyst API URL to a new URL. Also, the upgrade included Bryon Wallet tracking capability and aggregates of similar RAM sizes to allow for swift data analysis. Furthermore, Cardano’s Bryon era (the first phase on the Cardano Roadmap) received a delivery of the Daedalus wallet and Yoroi wallet. Yoroi is a light wallet designed by Emurgo, IOG’s sister company, that offers users access to ADA quick day-to-day transactions on their mobile phones.

					<description><![CDATA[The amount of bitcoin (BTC) being held on exchanges has been on a steady decline since the bear market began in 2022, but the rate at which investors were pulling their cryptocurrencies off exchanges has accelerated in the last couple of months. This has resulted in one of the sharpest drops in the percent of BTC supply left on centralized exchanges. Bitco In a new report by on-chain data aggregator Santiment, the bitcoin held on exchanges has witnessed one of the sharpest declines in history. In January 2022, the BTC held on exchanges accounted for around 11.85% of the total supply, but now, a year later, it has dropped to just 6.65% of the supply left on exchanges. Related Reading: XRP Tops List Of Gainers As Whale Interest Spikes This is a result of the increasing distrust of centralized exchanges following the collapse of FTX, one of the largest crypto exchanges at the time. Self-custody gained more prominence when the exchange filed for bankruptcy, prompting more supply than normal to flow out of exchanges. Over time, some exchanges have been hit harder than others when it comes to withdrawals. A lot of this depends on the amount of distrust circulating around different exchanges, with some like Kraken seeing 59% of total BTC held on the exchange flowing out in a one-year period.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">The amount of bitcoin (BTC) being held on exchanges has been on a steady decline since the bear market began in 2022, but the rate at which investors were pulling their cryptocurrencies off exchanges has accelerated in the last couple of months. This has resulted in one of the sharpest drops in the percent of BTC supply left on centralized exchanges.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Bitco</h2>
<p class="p2">In a new report by on-chain data aggregator <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1615590094257127424?s=20&amp;t=8o3qbm4EdlST3ySovQ5PsQ" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Santiment</a>, the bitcoin held on exchanges has witnessed one of the sharpest declines in history. In January 2022, the BTC held on exchanges accounted for around 11.85% of the total supply, but now, a year later, it has dropped to just 6.65% of the supply left on exchanges.</p>

<p class="p2">This is a result of the increasing distrust of centralized exchanges following the collapse of FTX, one of the largest crypto exchanges at the time. Self-custody gained more prominence when the exchange filed for bankruptcy, prompting more supply than normal to flow out of exchanges.</p>
<p class="p2">Over time, some exchanges have been hit harder than others when it comes to withdrawals. A lot of this depends on the amount of distrust circulating around different exchanges, with some like Kraken seeing 59% of total BTC held on the exchange flowing out in a one-year period.</p>
<p class="p2">Coinbase and Bitfinex emerged as some of the hardest-hit exchanges with outflows of 33% and 32%, respectively. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-bitcoin-holdings-flips-coinbase-amid-insolvency-rumors/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Coinbase’s outflows came amid insolvency rumors</a> which have since been debunked by the exchange.</p>
<p class="p2">Other exchanges include KuCoin seeing 32% of BTC holdings flow out, as well as Binance which is currently holding 25% less BTC than it did a year ago. Bitstamp was the lowest among the large exchanges, holding about 23% less BTC than it did in early 2022.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin rally continues as the cryptocurrency smashes all resistance levels and seems ready to reclaim more ground. The number one crypto by market capitalization has seen a double-digit gain over the previous week leading the top performers in the sector. Related Reading: Ethereum-Based Frax Finance (FXS) Is Up 64%, Is There Still Opportunity? As of this writing, Bitcoin traded at $21,400 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. The BTC price records a 23% rally in the previous seven days. Other cryptocurrencies in the top 10 record similar price action with Ethereum (19%) and Polygon (18%). The crypto has seen some losses but could recover during today&#8217;s trading session. Bitcoin Shorts Are Wipeout, Bear Market Over? Any “good” price rally must be a “hated” rally; Bitcoin follows this rule. As the cryptocurrency trended to the upside from its yearly lows, crypto traders began shorting it with overleverage positions. When Bitcoin was about to breach $17,500, the price action went sideways, allowing overleverage shorts to take positions; these traders were expecting BTC to fail the re-test of this resistance level. Their positions provided liquidity to the upside and the fuel to send Bitcoin to its current levels. According to a report from Bitfinex, $450 million were recorded in short liquidations as BTC began its ascend. This data represents the most significant short squeeze since July 2021 across the crypto market, as seen in the chart below. The BTC price action is displaying a similar behavior; it’s moving sideways as shorts pile in, expecting to profit from another crash. Their positions could still provide fuel for this rally, but the report warns about long traders going greedy, expecting further appreciation: It is typical for bear markets to have a complete wipeout of shorts (…). even with the leg up, the market remains highly illiquid, and with the sharp fall in Open Interest over the weekend, a pullback might be expected with a cautious approach from bulls. Some Room To Run Additional data from a pseudonym analyst indicates that Open Interest, the number of total positions for the derivatives sector, is still skewed to the short side. Thus, traders could see more short-term appreciation before Bitcoin and Ethereum record a pullback.

In other words, these levels should operate as critical support if BTC begins retracing its gains. As seen in the chart above, $19,600 is crucial if Bitcoin continues to crash.]]></description>
