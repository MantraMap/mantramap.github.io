<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>European Union regulators have expressed concerns that Binance may be engaging in illicit activities such as money laundering and tax evasion. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta.jpeg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="575" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta-1024x575.jpeg" alt="Binance Faces Accusations of False Reporting in Ireland and Malta" class="wp-image-198357" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta-1024x575.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta-768x431.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta-750x421.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta-1140x640.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Faces Accusations of False Reporting In Ireland and Malta 1"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>These concerns have been raised due to its operations within Ireland and Malta being particularly difficult to track, despite claiming to employ dozens of employees. Revenue streams are unexplained or explained by “consultancy services” according to official records, and the companies don’t have an active and operational space other than their registered address — which are shared with other companies. In some cases, officials believe BNB is inflating registered employee headcounts by conflating the figure with contractual services to freelancers, whose job is mainly of a promotional nature.</p>



<p>Binance has been accused of commingling funds from revenue streams of different countries to avoid raising the eyebrows of regulators and tax authorities. European investigators have stated that BNB may be faking its accounts and operations in several EU jurisdictions. There are concerns that Binance is obfuscating illicit activity, which is why financial regulators in several EU jurisdictions received requests for information on BNB by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) even before the agency charged the crypto exchange earlier this month.</p>

<p>Despite BNB&#8217;s claims to be operating in various countries in Europe, including in France, Ireland, Malta, Italy, Spain, Cyprus, and Lithuania, several European countries are conducting their own investigations into BNB on suspicions of local wrongdoing. In 2018, Binance announced that it was to set up its European headquarters in Malta and set up two companies. Then it changed track and set up three other companies in Ireland, announcing its European headquarters would be there. Eventually, it settled on Paris, France for its EU HQ and received a license to act as a digital asset provider in the country.</p>



<p>Binance&#8217;s headquarters in Paris was recently raided by police in a European-wide investigation over aggravated money laundering. In addition, Belgium’s financial regulator ordered Binance to stop its services in the country. As a result, Binance is expected to face more legal challenges with other EU countries in the coming months.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[FTX has filed a lawsuit against a former regulatory and compliance officer at the exchange, Dan Friedberg.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>FTX sues former officer Friedberg over bribery allegations.</em></li>



<li><em>Friedberg, known for past poker scandals, was implicated in FTX deception.</em></li>



<li><em>FTX CEO investigates and seeks to recover funds; report points to his role.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>FTX has <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/ExternalCall-DownloadPDF?id1=MTU0MDA0Mw==&amp;id2=0&amp;cid=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a lawsuit against a former regulatory and compliance officer at the exchange, Dan Friedberg, saying he conducted a series of bribes to keep employees from reporting difficulties at the exchange.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2036.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="980" height="551" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2036.png" alt="Former FTX Compliance Officer Dan Friedberg Accused Of Bribes: Report" class="wp-image-198348" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2036.png 980w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2036-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2036-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2036-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" title="Former FTX Compliance Officer Dan Friedberg Accused Of Bribes: Report 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>Lawyer Friedberg, whose image was tainted by the greatest online poker scam a decade ago, may also be involved in deceptions perpetrated by collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Friedberg worked at UltimateBet during the company&#8217;s super-user cheating scandal and subsequent downfall, and he was captured on film supporting Russ Hamilton in his efforts to rescue the situation. Until recently, he was the Compliance Officer for FTX US and the general counsel for Alameda Research, a link that only became widely known in the poker community when the firm filed for bankruptcy in November 2021.</p>



<p>FTX filed a lawsuit against Daniel Friedberg on June 27. According to the lawsuit, Friedberg worked as a fixer for the exchange&#8217;s co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, making hush money payments to two possible whistleblowers to prevent them from releasing information regarding regulatory difficulties, and FTX&#8217;s claimed strong relationships with Alameda Research.</p>

<p>As Bankman-Fried awaits trial on allegations of fraud and other offenses, the company&#8217;s new CEO, John J. Ray III, is heading an inquiry and seeking to retrieve as much investor money as possible. Ray&#8217;s most recent interim report, released on June 26, exposes the role of &#8220;a top FTX Group attorney&#8221; in alleged deceptions by the company&#8217;s leadership.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The FTX Senior Executives did not commingle and misuse customer deposits by accident. Commingling and misuse occurred at their direction, and by their design. Bankman- Fried, with the assistance of a senior FTX Group attorney (“Attorney-1”) and others, lied to banks and auditors, executed false documents, and moved the FTX Group from jurisdiction to jurisdiction… to enable and avoid detection of their wrongdoing,&#8221; the report wrote.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/senior-attorney-helped-ftx-founder-misuse-customer-funds-report-says-7180ae25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> that &#8220;Attorney-1&#8221; is Friedberg, citing people familiar with the situation. The report, for example, mentions Attorney-1 sending a $1 million incentive to a lawyer and former government official in the Bahamas. According to the <em>WSJ</em>&#8216;s source, Friedberg paid this payment.</p>



<p>FTX issued 11 civil allegations in the 40-page petition, alleging, among other things, that Friedberg disregarded his legal obligations and facilitated a series of fraudulent transfers and loans to other former FTX executives.</p>



<p>Friedberg allegedly received a $300,000 salary, a $1.4 million signing bonus, and 8% stock in FTX US during his 22-month tenure at the exchange, all of which FTX is attempting to recoup, according to the lawsuit.</p>



<p>According to the <em>Financial Times</em>, the creators of cryptocasino Stake <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2490279b-9c94-49a8-beff-cbd7c3307586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talked</a> with Friedberg about their concept. Stake, on the other hand, has denied any link to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really crazy that Apple will unilaterally block you from running the software you want on your own device. One of the most disrespectful parts of their culture, and it&#8217;s damaging to their brand.&#8221; CEO Brian Armstrong commented on Twitter.</p>



<p>Yesterday, William Casarin, founder of Damus, an open social app based on the Nostr protocol, tweeted that Damus will be removed from the App Store on Tuesday for violating Apple&#8217;s in-app purchase rules.</p>



<p>He said that while we&#8217;ve updated the app and clarified that users won&#8217;t unlock any digital content after paying, it will still be removed from the App Store.</p>



<p>The app said it would appeal because the rule had been abused and misapplied. Damus was launched on the App Store earlier this year but was ordered by Apple to be removed from the shelves on June 13 because of its &#8220;zaps&#8221; function (a unique function of Damus that allows users to send small amounts of bitcoin to content creators through the Lightning Network, similar to tweets).</p>

<p>Apple says it doesn&#8217;t allow zaps on its platform because they &#8220;may&#8221; be used by content creators to sell digital content. Apple then said it spoke with Damus and agreed on how Damus&#8217; hits will survive on the platform.</p>



<p>Damus is a decentralized social media platform running on the Nostr protocol, which is quite popular with bitcoins. One of the reasons for its popularity is that most Nostr implementations support payments over the blockchain&#8217;s Lightning Network. Lightning is Bitcoin&#8217;s second-layer payment network allowing faster transactions and lower transaction fees.</p>

<p>This morning, the Manta Network project announced an ongoing airdrop in cooperation with Binance Labs on its official Twitter account and asked users that the $MANTA token is launching today and is currently FREE to claim.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>However, right below the comment section of the article, many warnings were being given that Manta&#8217;s account was compromised, there was no airdrop going on, and asked users not to click on any link.</p>



<p>Only in the first 2 months of 2023, the Crypto market has become extremely exciting when continuously receiving strong growth from tokens according to AI, LSD, and the upcoming ZK narrative. Manta Network is also one of the Layer 1 blockchains using ZK technology.</p>



<p>Manta is a Layer 1 blockchain built on top of Polkadot&#8217;s Substrate frameworks. Manta uses zkSNARK to provide complete end-to-end anonymity, high throughput, and cross-chain interoperability.</p>

<p>The project received a lot of attention after Binance Labs announced its strategic investment in Manta Network for Web3 Privacy on February 17.</p>



<p>Binance Labs will support Manta&#8217;s efforts as they continue to build innovative products, services, and technologies that enable security on a decentralized chain. Manta&#8217;s Dolphin pilot network features will be rolled out on the Calamari Network first in a service called MariPay. At launch, MariPay will be able to privatize various parachain assets on Kusama, including KSM and Calamari&#8217;s native asset, KMA.</p>



<p>Manta is currently working with various parachains to achieve interoperability to privatize the assets of their projects.</p>

<p>The entire Azuki brand NFT series witnessed a sharp decline, with the floor price dropping to 10 ETH, marking a staggering 24-hour decrease of 31%. This disappointing turn of events has raised concerns within the digital collectibles community.</p>



<p>One of Azuki&#8217;s co-founders acknowledged the failure of the minting experience, stating that it did not meet the expected standard. This admission highlights the challenges faced by the team in delivering a satisfactory user experience and meeting the high expectations of collectors and investors.</p>

<p>Despite the decline in prices and the admission of failure, the Azuki official team (0x3A…6305) managed to generate substantial revenue through the sale of Azuki Elementals. They received 20,000 ETH, which amounts to approximately $37 million. Shortly after, the funds were transferred to the Azuki team&#8217;s multi-signature address (0x2a…60AA). This transfer of funds signals the team&#8217;s continued commitment to navigating the challenges and striving for future success.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The Nevada regulator that applied to take over the Prime Trust is facing default.</em></li>



<li><em>The filing says Prime Trust is also running with an equity shortfall of $12 million due partly to an inability to access old wallets.</em></li>



<li><em>The regulator said the crypto asset manager has failed and owes millions to its customers.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Coindesk, the Nevada Department of Financial Institutions (FDI) announced on Tuesday that it has applied to take over cryptocurrency custodian <a href="https://coincu.com/198262-prime-trust-faces-receivership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prime Trust</a> and freeze its activities.</strong></h5>

<p>FDI has petitioned the Nevada District Court to appoint a person to take over the day-to-day operations of the Prime Trust and &#8220;thoroughly examine all of the company&#8217;s financial affairs to determine what is in the best interest of the company.&#8221; Prime customers, or to remedy and return the company to private management, or liquidate it&#8221;.</p>



<p>An attachment to the application document shows that Prime&#8217;s management has agreed to take over. According to previous news, FDI stated that Prime Trust lost access to old wallets in early 2021 and used customer assets to buy back cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Prime Trust entered into an agreement with Fireblocks for a second company to manage its crypto assets. The deal was completed in 2020. In 2021, after Prime Trust had new management, it had already signed up. Set up &#8220;old wallet forwarding&#8221; for wallets on Fireblocks&#8217; platform, or set up to forward to wallets on Fireblocks&#8217; platform, the filing said.</p>

<p>However, in December 2021, Prime Trust &#8220;discovered that it could not access&#8221; the old wallets or the cryptocurrencies held in those wallets. Fireblocks head of communications Gaby Hui told CoinDesk that Prime and Fireblocks control all legacy wallets and hold no funds.</p>



<p>Prime Trust owes customers $85.67 million in fiat and $69.509 million in crypto but currently holds just $2,904 million in fiat and $68,648 million in crypto.</p>



<p>The Nevada Division of Financial Institutions said last week that the company could not accommodate all customer withdrawals. The notice said the company is operating in an unsafe condition and has been insolvent since June 21.</p>

<p>In a recent statement, Matt Huang, the founder of Paradigm, expressed unwavering dedication to the world of cryptocurrency. Five years ago, when Paradigm was established, there was no grand blueprint but rather a shared passion for the future and a deep belief in the potential of crypto. Today, that conviction remains stronger than ever.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Paradigm has never been more dedicated to crypto.<br><br>When Fred and I started Paradigm five years ago, there was no master plan. What we had was a shared curiosity for the future, deep conviction in crypto, and a desire to advance the frontier of what’s possible.<br><br>Our best decision…</p>&mdash; Matt Huang (@matthuang) <a href="https://twitter.com/matthuang/status/1673786399252955137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 27, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>One of its most significant early decisions was to create the position of &#8220;research partner,&#8221; an innovative role aimed at attracting exceptional talent like Dan Robinson, a coder and lawyer with a keen interest in research. This move, along with the contributions of Charlie Noyes, laid the groundwork for Paradigm&#8217;s research-driven approach, which continues to define the company today.</p>



<p>Over the years, Paradigm has evolved, integrating investing and research into a cohesive and symbiotic relationship. By embracing a research-driven philosophy, the team has honed their investment acumen, while their investments have provided valuable insights and perspectives for their research endeavors.</p>



<p>At Paradigm, the emphasis is on nurturing a team of inquisitive individuals who are encouraged to follow their instincts. This experimental approach has solidified their identity as a research-driven organization, a concept now prominently reflected on their website.</p>



<p>While Paradigm&#8217;s primary focus remains on the crypto landscape, the team also recognizes the captivating advancements in the field of artificial intelligence. Rather than viewing crypto and AI as competing forces, the firm sees significant potential for collaboration and overlap between the two. As such, they are committed to exploring both realms with equal enthusiasm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>FTX has stopped the sale of its stake in Anthropic, a highly sought-after AI startup valued at $4.6 billion.</em></li>



<li><em>Multiple potential buyers have shown interest in the stake over the past few months, requiring NDA agreements to access private information.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>FTX has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-27/bankman-fried-s-ftx-said-to-halt-sale-of-its-stake-in-ai-startup-anthropic?sref=3REHEaVI#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-27/bankman-fried-s-ftx-said-to-halt-sale-of-its-stake-in-ai-startup-anthropic?sref=3REHEaVI#xj4y7vzkg" rel="noreferrer noopener">halted </a>the sale of its stake in AI startup Anthropic.

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2025.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="620" height="349" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2025.png" alt="FTX Halts Sale Of $500 Million Stake In Anthropic AI Startup: Report" class="wp-image-198290" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2025.png 620w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2025-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" title="FTX Halts Sale Of $500 Million Stake In Anthropic AI Startup: Report 16"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>At the heart of the AI boom, Anthropic, a startup founded by former OpenAI employees, has become one of the most sought-after companies in the field. The startup recently raised $450 million to support the development of its AI bot, dubbed Claude, and is now valued at an impressive $4.6 billion, according to Semafor’s June <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/06/06/2023/ftxs-big-ai-bet-could-help-bail-out-customers" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.semafor.com/article/06/06/2023/ftxs-big-ai-bet-could-help-bail-out-customers" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>.</p>



<p>As a result, buyers in the secondary market for shares in private companies have been actively seeking opportunities to acquire stakes in Anthropic, including at a premium. This trend did not go unnoticed by Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX and Alameda, who made a $500 million investment in the startup, according to an internal document circulated before last November’s bankruptcy filing and reviewed by Bloomberg News.</p>



<p>However, the now-bankrupt crypto exchange has halted the sale of its Anthropic stake, which represents one of the biggest bets made by FTX, behind its $1.5 billion investment in crypto miner Genesis Digital. Boutique investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners, an adviser to FTX, informed bidders about the pause, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named discussing confidential information.</p>



<p>The halt came after several months, when multiple potential buyers assessed private information about the Anthropic stake. Perella had asked potential bidders to sign non-disclosure agreements before accessing private information about the target’s finances, which is standard practice in the industry.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Revolut is reducing cryptocurrency trading costs for both standard and premium users.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Key Points:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Revolut is reducing cryptocurrency trading costs for both standard and premium users.</em></li>



<li><em>The changes will see fees drop from 1.99% to 1.49% for standard and plus customers and from 1.49% to 0.99% for premium and metal account holders.</em></li>



<li><em>The move was made in response to customer feedback and demonstrated the company&#8217;s commitment to competitive pricing in the cryptocurrency market.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Revolut, a British neobank and financial technology company, said on Tuesday that it is lowering some of its cryptocurrency trading costs.</strong></h5>

<p>Trading costs for both ordinary and premium users would be reduced under the new arrangement. Crypto trading costs will be reduced from 1.99% to 1.49% for Standard and Plus users and from 1.49% to 0.99% for Premium and Metal customers.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We&#8217;ve been listening to your feedback, and have decided to update our fee structure. So, we&#8217;re happy to announce a reduction to some of our crypto trading fees,&#8221; the company said in the email sent to users.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2021.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2021.png" alt="Exciting: Revolut Slashes 0.5% Crypto Trading Fees" class="wp-image-198280" width="764" height="642" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2021.png 764w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2021-300x252.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2021-750x630.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 764px) 100vw, 764px" title="Exciting: Revolut Slashes 0.5% Crypto Trading Fees 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>The move was made in response to consumer input, and it demonstrates the company&#8217;s dedication to providing competitive cryptocurrency market prices.</p>



<p>Since November 2017, Revolut, well-known for its banking, investing, and currency exchange services, has enabled cryptocurrency trading on its site. At the last reported fundraising round in 2021, Revolut was valued at roughly $33 billion, making it Britain&#8217;s most valuable firm.</p>



<p>Revolut offered users the opportunity to earn cryptocurrency incentives by allowing the lender to &#8220;stake&#8221; their coins to verify blockchain transactions earlier this year.</p>

<p>As part of Revolut&#8217;s ambition to extend its crypto-related services, the functionality was made accessible to users in the United Kingdom and roughly 30 additional European nations. Customers might earn up to 11.65% yearly percentage return depending on the token invested and the consumer.</p>



<p>Revolut made its first push into South America last month, with a live debut in Brazil. The company has topped 25 million subscribers globally, as part of a global expansion plan that will see the super app debut in India, Mexico, and New Zealand in the near future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Nevada FID has filed a petition to put Prime Trust under receivership due to financial difficulties.</em></li>



<li><em>The company owes its customers $85,670,000 in fiat cash but only has $2,904,000, and owes $69,509,000 in digital money but only possesses $68,648,000, according to research.</em></li>



<li><em>The appointment of a receiver will safeguard Prime Trust&#8217;s consumers and assets, who will take over the administration, stabilize operations and determine the best course of action.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Nevada FID (<strong>Industry&#8217;s Financial Institutions Division</strong>) has <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/Q5WNMMS/prime-core-technologies-et-al-petition-pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a petition to put Prime Trust under receivership, which means that a court-appointed receiver takes control of the company&#8217;s assets and activities to safeguard creditors and other stakeholders&#8217; interests.</strong></h5>

<p>The petition will be heard, and the trustee submitting the petition is required under NRS 155.010 to notify all people entitled to notice. The hearing will evaluate whether Prime Trust should be put under receivership and who should be chosen as the receiver.</p>



<p>In 2021, the Nevada FID Prime Trust lost access to old wallets and spent client money to purchase back cryptocurrency. Prime Trust owes clients $85,670,000 in fiat cash but only has $2,904,000, according to the research.

<p>When the Nevada FID files a petition to put Prime Trust into receivership, they are requesting that a court appoint a receiver to take control of the company. This often occurs when a financial institution is in considerable problems, such as when they are unable to satisfy their financial commitments or are in breach of certain laws or regulations.</p>



<p>In this situation, it seems that Prime Trust, a crypto custodian, has been experiencing some difficulties. According to some sources, they have been unable to fulfill consumer withdrawals, resulting in a &#8220;shortfall of customer funds.&#8221; The Nevada FID has even given them a cease-and-desist order.</p>



<p>The Nevada FID is attempting to safeguard the company&#8217;s consumers and assets by putting the company under receivership. The receiver would take over Prime Trust&#8217;s administration, attempt to stabilize its operations and determine the best course of action.</p>
