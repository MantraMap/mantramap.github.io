However, she agrees that </strong><strong>the commercial real estate market is &#8220;going to be a bit of a bloodbath before it gets better.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Elon Musk&#8217;s Real Estate Market Warnings</h2>
<p>Tesla and Spacex CEO Elon Musk warned about real estate markets in a tweet Monday. The billionaire cautioned that the commercial real estate market is “melting down fast,” predicting that home values will be next.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-591359 aligncenter" title="Elon Musk Warns Commercial Real Estate 'Melting Down Fast' — Predicts 'Home Values Next'" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/musk-commercial-real-estate-tweet.jpg" alt="Elon Musk Warns Commercial Real Estate 'Melting Down Fast' — Predicts 'Home Values Next'" width="907" height="211" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/musk-commercial-real-estate-tweet-300x70.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/musk-commercial-real-estate-tweet-768x179.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/musk-commercial-real-estate-tweet.jpg 907w" sizes="(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px" /></p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s tweet was in reply to venture capitalist David Sacks, founder and partner of Craft Ventures, who extensively discussed the challenges faced by the commercial real estate market through a series of tweets over the past few days.</p>
<p>Sacks highlighted the effects of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates from near 0% to about 5% in the past year, stating that they correspond to the “3 stages of the financial crisis we’re in.” Noting that the first stage is the banking crisis, the second is the commercial real estate crisis, and the third is the government debt crisis, the VC stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re seeing the first stage play out now. The second and third stages are yet to come.</p></blockquote>
<p>Multiple people have warned about the impending collapse of the commercial real estate market, including Shark Tank star Barbara Corcoran. The veteran real estate investor said Wednesday that the commercial market is “in trouble,” stating that &#8220;no one has the confidence to buy now&#8221; and &#8220;no one really believes it&#8217;s going to turn the corner.&#8221; She opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t see that turning around. I think it&#8217;s going to be a bit of a bloodbath before it gets better.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Experts Disagree With Musk on Residential Real Estate Market</h2>
<p>While Musk warned about a potential decline in home values, some people disagreed. Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman stated on Wednesday that home prices have been &#8220;leveling out recently, which has implications for our fight to lower inflation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corcoran similarly told Fox Business Wednesday that the residential real estate sector is beginning to rebound, emphasizing that Musk is wrong. &#8220;So you get a Mexican standoff going on, but things are changing,&#8221; the Shark Tank star detailed. &#8220;The people who are going out there and buying are finding they&#8217;re overbuilding. They&#8217;re having a hard time getting their hands on the house. And right now, what everybody&#8217;s afraid of is the high-interest rates. But the minute those interest rates come down, all hell is going to break loose and prices are going to go through the roof.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glenn Kelman, the CEO of residential real estate brokerage operator Redfin, also disagreed with Musk. Responding to the Tesla CEO&#8217;s tweet, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The loss in demand for commercial real estate is what&#8217;s driving demand for residential real estate. People who work from home need more space at home. Sales volume is down because inventory is down. Today, home prices increased for a second straight month.</p></blockquote>

He predicted that with the new debt ceiling deal, &#8220;reckless government spending and borrowing will continue until a sovereign debt and U.S. dollar crisis bring it to a catastrophic end.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Peter Schiff’s Latest Economic, Dollar Crisis Warnings</h2>
<p>Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff has taken to Twitter to voice concerns about the U.S. economy and the impending U.S. dollar crisis. His warnings followed the recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biden-republicans-strike-tentative-deal-to-raise-us-debt-ceiling/">debt ceiling deal</a> reached to prevent the U.S. from potentially <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-revises-debt-default-date-us-government-could-exhaust-funds-by-june-5/">defaulting</a> on its debt obligations.</p>
<p>“Now that the fake debt ceiling crisis is behind us, we can focus on the real crisis that lies ahead,&#8221; Schiff tweeted Wednesday, emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Suspending the debt ceiling yet again means that reckless government spending and borrowing will continue until a sovereign debt and U.S. dollar crisis brings it to a catastrophic end.</p></blockquote>
<p>“The $1.5 trillion the debt ceiling deal purports to save over 10 years amounts to less than 5% of what the deficit will be over that decade. But that&#8217;s only if the unrealistic rosy economic assumption comes true. More realistic assumptions result in a surge in the deficit instead,” the economist stressed.</p>
<p>He previously warned that “without any substantive cuts to government spending,” raising the debt ceiling “makes a real sovereign debt and U.S. dollar crisis inevitable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Schiff has also cautioned about the U.S. national debt. “Now that a bogus debt ceiling deal has been reached, it should be apparent that Congress will never rein in excessive government spending or deficits,&#8221; he tweeted Tuesday, predicting:</p>
<blockquote><p>The national debt will spiral out of control, with a sovereign debt and dollar crisis all but guaranteed.</p></blockquote>
<p>The gold bug has argued that the U.S. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-us-will-default-on-its-debt-raising-debt-ceiling-will-make-problem-worse/">will default</a> on its debt and raising the debt ceiling will only make the problem worse. He previously explained that the U.S. could default on its debt obligations in two forms. The first is “an honest default where the government just doesn’t pay back bondholders” and the second is “a dishonest default where we pay with inflation.”</p>
<p>In recent months, Schiff has warned about a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/peter-schiff-says-banking-crisis-not-over-much-worse-financial-crisis-incoming-warns-of-massive-recession/">much worse financial crisis</a> than the banking crisis, a &#8220;massive&#8221; recession, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-says-nobodys-money-is-safe-in-any-bank-warns-of-financial-crises-depressions/">depressions</a>. He also sounded the alarm about the U.S. dollar devaluation and the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-of-us-dollar-devaluation-and-biggest-economic-disaster-in-history/">biggest economic disaster</a> in history. He predicted that a &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-death-blow-coming-for-us-dollar-usd-to-lose-reserve-currency-status/">death blow</a>&#8221; is coming for the U.S. dollar and the USD will lose its reserve currency status, advising people to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-advises-get-rid-of-your-us-dollars-now-warns-usds-reserve-currency-status-in-jeopardy/">get rid of their U.S. dollars now</a>.</p>

With the rallying cry of &#8216;Bringing Back Trust into Web3&#8217;, this summit is poised to be a hotbed of innovation, collaboration, and transformation.</i></p>
<p>This inaugural edition of Proof of Talk is set to be a star-studded affair, featuring luminaries such as Charles Hoskinson, Co-Founder of Cardano, Pascal Gauthier, CEO of Ledger, Stani Kulechov, Founder &amp; CEO of Aave, Justin Sun, Founder of Tron, Staci Warden, CEO of Algorand Foundation, and Marieke Flament, CEO of NEAR Foundation, and Sandeep Nailwal, Co-Founder of Polygon Technologies. This is your chance to rub shoulders with the brightest minds shaping the future of Web3.</p>
<p>But the guest list doesn&#8217;t stop there. High-potential startups, government officials, and regulatory authorities from European powerhouses like the UK, Germany, and France will also be in attendance. Adding to this impressive roster are senior representatives from the World Economic Forum, OECD, and the European Commission, ensuring that Proof of Talk will be a melting pot of cross-border interactions and collaborations.</p>
<p>On behalf of the event’s organizers—i.e., the German investment fund, <a href="https://www.xventures.de/">X Ventures</a>—Zohair Dehnadi thus says: “<i>We are incredibly proud to host an event which promises to bring together the brightest minds and top CEOs from the world’s most influential blockchain companies. We are inviting C-level executives, founders, influencers, legal experts and regulatory authorities to this unparalleled event.</i>”</p>
<p>Despite its massive scope, though, <i>Proof of Talk</i> will promote signal over noise by limiting the number of participants to less than 1000. The original plan was to host an invite-only event. But due to high public demand created through word-of-mouth, X Ventures decided to release limited tickets for the summit. Grab yours for an insider’s experience—don&#8217;t miss this opportunity to be part of the conversation that’s shaping the future of Web3.</p>
<p><strong>Bringing Back Trust into Web3</strong></p>
<p>Web3 is only about a decade old; it’s still having growth pains. But that’s what <i>Proof of Talk</i>, for one, aims to heal.</p>
<p>Several undesirable incidents—from hacks to scams like rug pulls and fake NFTs—has marred Web3’s repuation over the years. Many people see privacy-preserving cryptoassets as a haven for criminals and tax evaders. Regulators thus impose blanket prohibitions on this asset class, obstructing innovation. And with multiple Web3 projects behaving like giant Ponzi schemes, there’s merit to such negative attitudes.</p>
<p>On Day 1, i.e., June 14, <i>Proof of Talk</i> will engage various forums and panels in discussions around the ways to restore trust in Web3. It features a distinguished lineup of over 85 industry leaders. More than 80% of them are CEOs and Founders, leading a total market cap of $150+ billion. This is the biggest senior leadership attendance for any Web3 event this year.</p>
<p><i>Proof of Talk will</i> provide a safe platform for changemakers to focus on past lessons, and thereby communicate their views about the industry’s most pressing issues. And this in turn will pave the path for making the ongoing decentralized revolution reliable and relatable for everyone.</p>
<p>Zohair says: “<i>We acknowledge that the Web3 industry needs a reset after experiencing challenges with scams and rug pulls, unprofessionalism and short-sighted greed. We are determined to initiate critical conversations around re-establishing trust because we firmly believe the decentralisation movement offers a chance to change the world for the better.</i>”</p>
<p><strong>Showcasing an Innovation-Driven Future</strong></p>
<p><i>Proof of Talk</i> isn’t only about knowledge-sharing and networking. It’s also an opportunity for promising projects to showcase their work to the people who matter: mentors, patrons, partners, and investors.</p>
<p>On Day 2, i.e., June 15, <i>Proof of Talk</i> will reserve the stage—a massive hall, in fact—for some of the most prospective innovations in Web3 right now. This pre-selected and vetted cohort of startups, who’ve collectively raised over $500 million in various funding rounds previously, can engage and interact with esteemed investors like Softbank, The Spartan Group, Fabric Ventures, Shima Capital, and Animoca Brands. Notably, the VCs participating in <i>Proof of Talk</i> have more than 2000 projects in their portfolio altogether.</p>
<p>Inspiring creativity while helping founders and investors to connect, collaborate, and build are the main agendas for Day 2. This will also create the avenues for putting into action the insights gained on Day 1. And it’ll provide a glimpse of the practical state of innovation in Web3 and an image of the future.</p>
<p>Like Day 1, Day 2 will also have exciting panel discussions, breakout sessions, keynotes, fireside chats, and open Q&amp;A sessions. Participants can additionally mingle with prominent and budding journalists, content creators, and other creatives representing prominent Web3 media platforms like Bitcoin.com, CoinMarketCap, Decrypt, Cointelegraph, BeInCrypto, theBlock and more.</p>
<p><strong>At First Glance: Fostering Artistic Creativity</strong></p>
<p><i>Proof of Talk</i> shall do complete justice to its prestigious location—The Louvre Palace. The summit strives to spark genuine interest towards the emerging trends in digital art. It addresses the need to facilitate proper art appreciation in the face of media-fuelled instant gratification and information overload.</p>
<p>Luisa Ausenda, Founder of Studio Leggero, has thus curated ‘<i>At first glance &#8211; À première vue’</i> as a part of <i>Proof of Talk</i>. The exhibition will showcase twelve distinctive global artists: Addie Wagenknecht, Andrea Bonaceto, Andrés Reisinger, Auriea Harvey, Benoit Challand, Hermine Bourdin, Rafaël Rozendaal, Sarah Meyohas, Skygolpe, Sofia Crespo, Trevor Jones &amp; Wonderkatzi.</p>
<p>‘<i>At first glance &#8211; À première vue</i>’ is a thought-provoking experience demanding active engagement from the audience. It features work that deepens the viewer’s journey by encouraging them to look deeper and beyond what’s visible at first glance. The exhibits are highly conceptual or remarkably innovative in using technology, besides covering diverse themes like gender, equality, and speculation.</p>
<p>Similar to the talks and panel discussions, the art exibition will initiate dialogues and reflections among artists and art enthusiasts. Besides transforming viewers, <i>‘At first glance &#8211; À première vue’</i> will thus foster futuristic creativity, ensuring the holistic growth of Web3.</p>
<p><strong>Missing Out Isn’t an Option</strong></p>
<p>Missing out on something this important and exciting is a total loss. Book your spot via the official <i>Proof of Talk </i>website. Tickets are on sale now but won’t last long. There are only 1000 of them, remember? So you know the drill.</p>

Their proposals, including on the use of cryptocurrencies in foreign trade settlements, have been included in a report to Russia’s head of state.</strong></p>
<h2>Companies Urge President Putin to Support Legalization of Crypto Payments</h2>
<p>Russian businesses are seeking help from the Kremlin in efforts to legalize decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Their request has been included in the annual report of Russia’s Business Ombudsman, Boris Titov, to president Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>The recommendations were laid out in a paper titled “Key Business Problems under Sanctions and Structural Transformation in 2023” produced by the Institute of the Commissioner for the Protection of Rights of Entrepreneurs under the President of the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>Among other suggestions, the authors urge for allowing the use of cryptocurrencies in international settlements. More specifically, they propose to legalize cross-border crypto payments with a dedicated bill so that cryptocurrencies can be used in dealings with partners abroad. To achieve that, the status of such transactions needs to be determined in Russian law, they insist.</p>

<p>Another of their initiatives concerns the operators of trading platforms for digital assets, RBC Crypto reported. It envisages the establishment of a system for mutual settlements or clearing as well as the issuance of special digital currencies for these purposes.</p>
<p>Pressed by financial restrictions and other penalties imposed by the West over the invasion of Ukraine, Russian government authorities and businesses have been exploring ways to circumvent sanctions. The idea to legalize the use of cryptocurrencies for payments outside Russia has been gaining support.</p>
<p>Several crypto-related bills are currently under review in the State Duma, the lower house of Russian parliament, but officials in Moscow recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-companies-are-using-crypto-in-trade-despite-lack-of-regulation-officials-admit/">admitted</a> that Russian companies are already employing crypto in foreign trade despite the absence of regulation.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Russian companies lobby for crypto legalization. In late 2022, IT firms from the association of Russian software developers, <a href="https://russoft.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russoft</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-it-firms-lobby-for-crypto-payments-in-software-exports/">asked</a> to be allowed to make and accept payments in cryptocurrency when working for foreign clients.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you think the Russian government will legalize international crypto payments in the near future? Tell us in the comments section below. </strong></em></p>

The purchase is expected to raise Cleanspark&#8217;s hashrate by an extra 1.76 exahash per second (EH/s).</strong></p>
<h2>Acquisition to Boost Cleanspark’s Hashpower by 1.76 EH/s</h2>
<p>Throughout 2023, <a href="https://www.cleanspark.com">Cleanspark</a> (Nasdaq: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-CLSK/">CLSK</a>) has secured a considerable number of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) bitcoin miners. In February, the company <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cleanspark-boosts-bitcoin-mining-capacity-with-acquisition-of-20000-bitmain-rigs/">procured</a> 20,000 new Bitmain mining rigs for $43.6 million, and in mid-April, it <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cleanspark-purchases-45000-bitcoin-mining-devices-adding-6-3-eh-s-to-current-fleet/">bought</a> 45,000 Antminer S19 XP units. The firm&#8217;s most recent acquisition involved 12,500 Antminer S19 XP bitcoin miners at a cost of $40.5 million.</p>
<p>Cleanspark reveals that the expense stood at approximately $23 per terahash ($/TH), which is less than the current market value. The firm disclosed that 6,000 machines would arrive in June, while the remaining units would be delivered in August. These ASIC bitcoin mining machines will be stationed across Cleanspark&#8217;s data centers. The company claims that &#8220;low-carbon energy sources&#8221; account for 90% of the bitcoin miner&#8217;s power supply.</p>
<p>Zach Bradford, Cleanspark CEO, said in a statement that “this purchase ensures that we are prepared to meet and potentially exceed our year-end target of 16 EH/s and also positions us to be one of the most power-efficient miners on an energy-per- hashrate basis.” He also mentioned that “this additional machine purchase also gives us substantial optionality to replace the units in our existing fleet that consume more than 30 joules per terahash while allowing us to maintain less efficient machines only if the economics support doing so.”</p>
<p>Cleanspark&#8217;s announcement comes on the heels of a challenging crypto bear market endured by bitcoin miners during the latter part of 2022. Additionally, numerous other mining firms have also experienced expansion in recent times. For instance, Stronghold Digital <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/stronghold-digital-partners-with-canaan-subsidiary-to-boost-bitcoin-mining-capacity-by-400-ph-s/">partnered</a> with Cantaloupe Digital LLC, a subsidiary of ASIC bitcoin miner producer Canaan. This deal elevated Stronghold&#8217;s hashrate by 400 petahash per second (PH/s), and on May 30, Stronghold <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/05/30/2678237/0/en/Stronghold-Digital-Mining-Reaches-Hash-Rate-Milestone-of-3-0-EH-s.html">unveiled</a> that it had reached 3 EH/s concerning the company&#8217;s total hashpower.</p>

<p>Amid the crypto bear market, Cleanspark has discovered various opportunities. Gary A. Vecchiarelli, Cleanspark&#8217;s CFO, stated, “we continue to make use of opportunities created by the current market conditions to prepare for next year’s bitcoin halving.” He continued, “this order of XPs not only adds to our hashrate, but the efficiency of these machines also results in less power consumed per bitcoin mined compared to older generation miners, which should translate to higher margins.”</p>

Apple Reality Pro and Apple Glasses are the products in question, and they could be announced by Apple as early as June. If the release does happen, <a href="https://www.overthereality.ai/">Over the Reality</a> (OVER) has plans of integrating this technology to help further its position as a pioneer in the field of AR.</p>
<p>OVER empowers users to immerse themselves in a new digital era by fully utilizing Apple&#8217;s AR capabilities, bridging the gap between virtual and physical realms through photorealistic avatars.</p>
<p><b>Pushing the boundaries of AR</b></p>
<p>Apple has gained a reputation for revolutionizing the digital sector in the past, and if the aforementioned products are any indication, this trend will likely continue. As both AR and VR (Virtual Reality) are becoming increasingly popular and mainstream, it makes sense to launch these types of products in such a digitally embedded society. Keep in mind that the Apple Glasses have not yet been officially announced and is just a rumor at this point in time.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the upcoming launch of Apple Reality Pro at the annual WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference) in June of this year has generated significant excitement and anticipation. Although still based on speculation, the Apple Glasses have nonetheless captured everyone’ attention as these wearables are reminiscent of Ray-Ban sunglasses but with AR capabilities which could bridge the gap between the virtual and physical realms.</p>
<p><b>How does OVER benefit?</b></p>
<p>Put simply, OVER aims to be at the forefront of AR development and implementation.

Ackman claims that the current president Joe Biden is “extremely weak and in cognitive decline,” and argues that Dimon could defeat both Biden and Trump in the general election should he pursue a political career.</strong></p>
<h2>From Wall Street to White House: Bill Ackman’s Case for Jamie Dimon as President</h2>
<p>American financier <a href="https://twitter.com/BillAckman">Bill Ackman</a> is known for his <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/billionaire-bill-ackman-on-us-banking-crisis-we-are-running-out-of-time-to-fix-this-problem/">outspoken viewpoints</a>, even if they defy convention. On Wednesday, Ackman delved into politics, discussing the forthcoming U.S. 2024 election and suggesting that JPMorgan&#8217;s leader <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-boss-warns-everyone-should-be-prepared-for-interest-rates-going-higher-from-here/">Jamie Dimon</a> would make an excellent president. Ackman also pointed to an <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dimon-hints-life-jpmorgan-says-053655970.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACHg-sYxeGFVOG8JKG7eK_YKwmKC_qeIJgeLGkKKnsBdjKzBnrccSRAU6PDfSNpUQdrA0XpSw9zAVSYIxr8DoQ4cNTX3XVTE3wNs7T0E9ELcPpoth8jB4yVSgGLDPfGYpU2ZHDkXCQ6REE-406dR1IubtTdV2b5xDbudg4D1DHYv">article</a> indicating that Dimon has contemplated seeking public office upon leaving his position at the country&#8217;s largest bank.</p>
<p>“Jamie Dimon is one of the world&#8217;s most respected business leaders. Politically he is a centrist,” Ackman tweeted. “He is pro-business and pro-free enterprise, but also supportive of well-designed social programs and rational tax policies that can help the less fortunate.” The billionaire investor added:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Dimon] is extremely smart, thoughtful, and pragmatic, and he knows how to bring opposing parties together. He is highly respected by the Right, the Left, and the Center.</p></blockquote>
<p>Concerning the United States presidency, Ackman argues that the nation requires someone like Dimon in charge. He outlines how Dimon oversees nearly a quarter million employees and successfully managed JPMorgan through &#8220;every crisis,&#8221; building &#8220;the world&#8217;s best, large, global financial institution.&#8221; Ackman emphasizes that &#8220;there is only one better job for Jamie than CEO of JPM, and that&#8217;s POTUS.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ackman proceeds to critique both president Joe Biden and his predecessor, Donald Trump – each of whom plans to campaign for office in 2024 amidst numerous <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/clash-of-presidential-contenders-bitcoin-gains-prominence-as-2024-us-election-approaches/">other contenders</a> from diverse political backgrounds. In Ackman&#8217;s view, JPM&#8217;s Dimon possesses the capability to outshine both Trump and Biden in next year&#8217;s presidential competition. Moreover, he believes representatives from both major parties would back the JPM CEO.</p>
<p>“[POTUS] is extremely weak and in cognitive decline. 70% of Democrats don&#8217;t want him to run. Biden&#8217;s weakness sets up a large opening for a qualified outsider to run as a Democrat,” Ackman penned. “Jamie can beat Biden in the primary and [Trump] in the general election, but he needs to start now and build name recognition among the broad electorate. He will easily raise billions of dollars from Democrats and Republicans to fund his campaign, and he knows how to build support,” he continued.</p>

<p>Concluding his remarks, the Pershing Square CEO posited that Dimon merely needs encouragement from prominent figures and the general public. Ackman urged individuals to contact Dimon if they consider him an ideal candidate for POTUS, and requested retweets for increased visibility. “This will be one of the most important elections in our country&#8217;s history,” Ackman opined. “Jamie is more likely to run if we build a groundswell of support for him. Let&#8217;s do our civic duty and make it happen.”</p>

The move came following several attempts over several weeks, with bulls finally breaking through. Polygon was also higher, ending a recent losing streak. </strong></p>
<h2>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>)</h2>
<p>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>) was one of Thursday&#x2019;s notable gainers, as prices moved past a key resistance level.</p>
<p>Following a low of $88.35 on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>/USD rose to an intraday peak at $94.21 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>As a result of today&#x2019;s rally, litecoin broke out of its recent ceiling at $93.00, hitting a two-week high in the process.</p>

<p>From the chart, it appears that Thursday&#x2019;s surge came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 58.00.</p>
<p>Since the breakout, the index has continued to climb, and as of writing this is currently tracking at 59.76.</p>
<p>In the event momentum continues in this direction, there is a strong chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> will move above $95.00.</p>

<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) snapped a three-day losing streak on Thursday, following a crossover of moving averages (MA).</p>
<p>The 10-day (red) MA crossed its 25-day (blue) counterpart in today&#x2019;s session, sending the price to a peak of $0.8974.</p>
<p>This comes following Wednesday&#x2019;s low at $0.8787, which saw MATIC hit its weakest point since May 25.</p>

<p>Overall, market volatility in polygon remains significantly high, with earlier gains almost fading.</p>
<p>As of writing, MATIC is trading at $0.8934, with the RSI at a reading of 46.03, which is close to a ceiling of 48.00.</p>
<p>Should this aforementioned point of resistance be broken, bulls could force a move toward $0.9000.</p>

The previous peak in market cap happened just before Terra&#x2019;s formerly stable coin UST lost its peg on May 9, 2023. On that day, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>&#x2019;s market cap stood at $83.2 billion, but by June 1, 2022, it had decreased to $72 billion. Following FTX&#x2019;s collapse, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>&#x2019;s market valuation had dipped to $65.43 billion by the close of November 2022.</p>

<p>Since then, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>&#x2019;s market cap has grown in tandem with the number of tether tokens circulating. Over the past six months, the supply of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> expanded, pushing its market valuation up by 27.15% or approximately $17.8 billion. Concurrently, top stablecoins like USDC, BUSD, DAI, and others experienced significant declines in their supplies. The entire stablecoin economy&#x2019;s total market capitalization is currently at its <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/stablecoin-economy-reaches-20-month-low-as-busd-redemptions-surpass-10-billion-tokens-in-3-months/">lowest level </a>since September 2021.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Today&#x2019;s numbers demonstrate that people want access to financial freedom, and when given that access, they will make use of it,&#x201D; <a href="https://twitter.com/paoloardoino">Paolo Ardoino</a>, the CTO of Tether told Bitcoin.com News in an emailed statement. &#x201C;Tether tokens offer a safe harbor for the unbanked and allow people in emerging markets to keep their buying power, even when their national currency is being devalued.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The latest news comes after Tether <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tether-expands-stablecoin-issuer-announces-sustainable-bitcoin-mining-project-in-uruguay/">launched</a> a sustainable bitcoin mining operation after the company <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/stablecoin-issuer-tether-reveals-plan-to-allocate-profits-into-bitcoin/">declared</a> in mid-May that 15% of the company&#x2019;s profits would be invested in bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>). On May 31, Tether <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-expands-its-presence-in-georgia-with-investment-in-citypayio/">revealed</a> its investment in Georgia-based payment processing company Citypay.io. Moreover, Tether and African fintech firm Yellow Card have recently concluded Phase 1 of their <a href="https://yellowcard.io/blog/yellow-card-second-phase-of-financial-literacy-tour/">Financial Literacy Tours</a>. According to the announcement, &#x201C;over 10,000 young people were reached&#x201D; in African countries such as Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana.</p>

The latest decline comes ahead of tomorrow&#x2019;s non-farm payrolls (NFP) report from the United States. Despite today&#x2019;s weakness, ethereum remained above $1,800.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p><a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> moved below the $27,000 level in today&#x2019;s session, ahead of Friday&#x2019;s non-farm payrolls report.</p>
<p>It is expected that the number of jobs added to the U.S. economy will come in at 190,000, less than the 253,000 sum the month prior.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD fell to a low of $26,671.72 earlier in the day, which comes following a peak at $27,346.11 the day before.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, this latest decline occurred as a result of the relative strength index (RSI) falling below a floor of 46.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, the index is now tracking at 44.58, with a support point of 43.00 as a possible target.</p>
<p>Should this level be hit, there is a strong possibility that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will hit a floor of its own around $26,300.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p><a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> was marginally lower today, however, it managed to remain above the $1,800 level.</p>
<p>Following a high of $1,887.71 on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD declined to an intraday bottom at $1,846.23 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The move saw ethereum edge towards a key price floor at $1,830, however, bulls have so far resisted this collision.</p>

<p>Similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> has now fallen for a fourth straight day, with the catalyst being a failed break out of a ceiling at $1,930.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the RSI is now at a reading of 51.54, after failing to move past its own resistance at 59.00.</p>
<p>Overall, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> has now rebounded from its previous low, and is now trading at $1,862.93.</p>
