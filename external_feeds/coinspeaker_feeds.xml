<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ripple-dubai-ceo-garlinghouse/">Ripple to Expand to Dubai, Says CEO Brad Garlinghouse</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ripple-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple</a>, one of the most popular cryptocurrency firms, has <a href="https://www.zawya.com/en/press-release/companies-news/ripple-expands-in-the-middle-east-bgtht7bi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> its expansion in other countries. The company is all set to expand to Dubai, according to Chief Executive Officer <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/brad-garlinghouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brad Garlinghouse</a>.</p>
<p>Garlinghouse also disclosed the development at the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/events/dubai-fintech-summit-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dubai Fintech Summit</a> that is happening today and talked passionately about the customer base in the Middle East. According to him, the regulatory operations have made the country a good choice for setting up offices. Most importantly, he said that Dubai is rising to become the new international financial center for crypto innovation.</p>
<p>In the United States, things have not been very friendly for the popular crypto solutions firm. Ripple was caught up in a two-year legal conflict with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>). In addition to that, legal procedures have been in the media for a while regarding the security definition of virtual assets. This debate has played an important role in the regulatory perspective of the industry.</p>
<p>Ripple, which is a leader in enterprise blockchain and crypto solutions, is opening an office in the heart of Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) and acquiring Swell Global 2023. Ripple has majorly looked at serving customers around the world with more than 90% of the firm&#8217;s clientele from outside the United States. Around fifty percent of Ripple&#8217;s Middle-East and North Africa (MENA) payment volume comprises cross-border payments like remittances from the UAE, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia to India.</p>
<p>In late 2021, Ripple announced the launch of its first-ever On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) deployment in the Middle East, with Pyypl, the international blockchain-based financial services technology firm in the Middle East and Africa. ODL was introduced to use virtual asset <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP</a> and support instant and low-cost cross-border payments. With the help of ODL, financial enterprises, and small/medium-sized firms can utilize initially entrapped, pre-funded capital to develop and scale their companies.</p>
<p>The news of Ripple entering Dubai comes amid the company suffering a legal battle with SEC that cost it more than $200 million. Moreover, since regulation is yet to be figured out by the regulatory authorities in the United States, it is only fitting for firms to look for better and more habitable environments to develop as companies.</p>
<p>According to Navin Gupta, the Managing Director of South Asia &amp; MENA, in a hyper-global connected world, the requirement for cross-border payments is on the rise, with around $156T worth of cross-border payment flows in 2022 alone. As Dubai is slowly becoming a region containing several significant remittance markets and corridors, the Middle East&#8217;s financial organizations are targeting making payments quicker, inexpensive, and more useful for the people who require it the most.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/immutable-blockchain-digital-goods/">Immutable Launches Decentralized Blockchain Payment Solution for Digital Goods</a></p>
<p>Immutable has introduced a new payment solution for decentralized games and the Web3 marketplace. Reports state that the blockchain gaming firm&#8217;s new scheme promises to make payments more seamless and straightforward. The consensus is that the solution, called Immutable Checkout, will also revolutionize online transactions involving digital goods. This will happen because the Immutable payment solution&#8217;s decentralized infrastructure can manage all payment processes driven by blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Immutable Checkout caters to selling and purchasing digital products like in-game items and non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a>). The payment process system deploys smart contracts to automatically execute payments, thereby eliminating the need for intermediaries such as banks.</p>
<h2>The Wide-Scale Appeal of Immutable&#8217;s New Payment Solution</h2>
<p>As an all-in-one transaction infrastructure, Immutable Checkout enables users to add funds and instantly purchase or swap assets. In addition, the complete payment solution also facilitates the integration of multiple payment methods to increase user conversions. According to its <a href="https://www.immutable.com/products/checkout" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">official website</a>, Immutable Checkout ensures that its coverage community is always transaction-ready. The decentralized payment solution boasts a simple integration and configurable interface that enables users to launch games or marketplaces faster.</p>
<p>Immutable already has <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/polygon-immutable-web3-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategic alliances</a> with leading blockchain, gaming, and NFT players. These include broad-based network <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/matic-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polygon</a>, leading NFT marketplace OpenSea, and mainstream gaming developers Square Enix, Unity, and GameStop. With the advent of Immutable Checkout, the general assumption is that the solution will enhance these partners&#8217; customer experiences and payment procedures.</p>
<p>However, Immutable Checkout is not exclusively for the mainstream and decentralized gaming industry. According to reports, other digital marketplaces or platforms can leverage the innovative system amid the evolution of blockchain technology. Furthermore, observers believe that Immutable Checkout is en route to becoming more entrenched in the e-commerce world.</p>
<h2>Immutable Offerings</h2>
<p>Besides its new payment solution, Immutable has several other themed decentralized products and services. These include &#8216;Passport&#8217;, a non-custodial wallet and authentication solution that facilitates user onboarding via seamless sign-on, and &#8216;Mint&#8217;, an NFT-minting service. Immutable also offers &#8216;Trade&#8217;, a reliable NFT-trading facilitator, and &#8216;Blockchain Data APIs&#8217; that assist developers in building appealing Web3 games. The Immutable Blockchain Data APIs are robust and scalable, equipping these developers with the requisite resources to create the games.</p>
<p>Immutable also sports two foundations, namely SDKs and Developer Hub. The company claims its SDKs allow access to its APIs and smart contracts to leverage its Web3 infrastructure seamlessly from custom development environments. On its Developer Hub foundation, a product description on the website reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Immutable DevHub empowers you to launch and manage your projects in one easy place. From launching collections to performance analytics, from access management to personalized guides, the DevHub puts you in control.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Lastly, Immutable offers a pair of rollups: Immutable zkEVM (EVM ZK-rollup for games) and Immutable X (Optimized game-specific ZK-rollup). Immutable zkEVM is a first-of-its-kind chain that offers EVM compatibility, massive scale, low cost, and Ethereum security. Meanwhile, Immutable X caters to games prioritizing Ethereum-based high performance and lower cost over advanced Web3 game mechanics.</p>

<p>Regional banks are financial institutions that operate in specific geographic areas of the country and often provide a variety of banking services such as deposit accounts, loans, and other financial goods.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/pacwest-dividend-regional-banks/">PacWest Cuts Dividend as Regional Banks Recovery Deepens</a></p>
<p>PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ: PACW), an American regional bank with headquarters in Beverly Hills, California has reduced its shareholder&#8217;s dividends amid the current banking crisis. This bold gesture has helped ticked the sheer recovery in the shares of the regional bank.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/08/regional-banks-rebound-for-a-second-day-as-pacwest-cuts-dividend-says-business-fundamentally-sound.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> by CNBC, the business announced a dividend drop from 25 cents in the prior quarter to 1 cent per share. Following the announcement, PacWest stock rose 39% in premarket trade Monday, adding to a nearly 82% gain on Friday. The stock’s growth has been tapered down and is now up 20% to $6.92.</p>
<p>While dividend cuts might indicate to investors that a firm is having financial troubles or that its profitability is deteriorating, PacWest CEO Paul Taylor told investors that the bank&#8217;s operations are “fundamentally sound”.</p>
<p>Additionally, Taylor stated that the Corporation believed that cutting the dividend is a reasonable measure to accelerate the company’s capital-building efforts amid current economic uncertainty and recent volatility in the banking sector.</p>
<p>Interestingly, other regional banks recovered for a second day as well. Notably, Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE: WAL) surged 10% in Pre-market trading on Monday after rising 49% in the prior trading session. Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ: ZION) jumped by 6%. Furthermore, the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) advanced 2.3% in premarket trading, following a 6.3% gain on Friday.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the statement came just days after PacWest shares had <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/pacwest-shares-western-alliance-collapse/">dropped by 50%</a> due to investor skepticism following the failure of numerous US regional banks. At the time, the CEO highlighted that management was taking rapid steps to maximize liquidity, including the investigation of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/pacwest-sale-stock-drawdown/">strategic asset sales</a>.</p>
<p>Regional banks are financial institutions that operate in specific geographic areas of the country and often provide a variety of banking services such as deposit accounts, loans, and other financial goods. Over the past few weeks, many regional banks have met their Waterloo including Silicon Valley Bank and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/first-republic-bank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Republic Bank</a> (OTCMKTS: FRCB).</p>
<h2>Impact of Banks’ Collapse on Regional Banks</h2>
<p>When any major bank fails, it can have far-reaching consequences for the rest of the financial system, including the operational viability of regional banks. However, the effect on regional banks will vary depending on a number of variables, including the size and interconnectedness of the failing bank, the extent of their exposure to it, and the health of the overall economy.</p>
<p>Remarkably, PacWest shares are down more than 40% in May and 75% year to date as of Friday. This comes as economists predict that the 2023 banking crisis will be significantly worse than the 2008 debacle. Similarly, the shares of SPDR Regional Banking ETF are down 10% in May and 35% year to date as of Friday.</p>
<p>Notably, several regional US banks including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/biden-congress-svb-signature-bank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Signature and Silvergate Bank</a> have already failed. Also, the failure of Credit Suisse earlier this year has had an impact on the global scene as well.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is clear that a constricting economy can have serious consequences for regional banks, and vigilant monitoring of the broader financial system is required to limit these risks, a responsibility being assumed by the Federal Reserve with its latest 25 basis point <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-fed-25-basis-point-rate-hike/">interest rate hike</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ripple-garlinghouse-legal-cost-sec/">Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Reveals Legal Cost of Fighting SEC at Dubai Fintech Summit</a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a> vs <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ripple-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple Labs</a> lawsuit is slated to be one of the largest legal fights for blockchain and cryptocurrency development in the United States for the next decades. Already, hundreds of projects on <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> using the ERC-20 standard, and other Layer One blockchains that undertook initial coin offerings (ICO) in the United States are eagerly waiting for the final ruling by Manhattan District Judge Analisa Torres.</p>
<p>From the regulatory perspective, the US SEC has nothing to lose if the Judge sides with the blockchain payment company. Moreover, the SEC as a Federal agency depends on the United States taxpayers to file the motions in court.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ripple will be counting losses if the Judge sides with the SEC in the ongoing lawsuit. If the Judge argues Ripple sold XRP as unregistered securities, a fine is expected to be announced by the SEC. From another perspective, if the Judge deems XRP as unregistered securities in its entirety, Garlinghouse has threatened to leave the United States market, although the company will have a chance to appeal.</p>
<h2>Ripple Spends Millions in Fighting the SEC</h2>
<p>From the beginning, Ripple knew it had to choose the best legal team to represent the firm against the SEC. The best legal team meant higher pay per hour. In this regard, Garlinghouse revealed that Ripple has spent about $200 million in legal fees while fighting the SEC. Previously, Ripple had announced that the company had spent close to $100 million in paying legal expenses. Notably, the company’s legal team is led by Stuart Alderoty, the chief legal officer.</p>
<h2>Globalization</h2>
<p>However, as the company <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/defending-against-sec-to-cost-ripple-200m-ceo-brad-garlinghouse-says" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a> the United States is lagging in formulating clear crypto regulations, Alderoty has been moving around the world selling Ripple products globally. For instance, as SEC chair Gary Gensler requested more than $2.4 billion earlier last month, Alderoty noted that he spent his time with United Kingdom’s officials expanding its core business of cross-border payments.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Missed all the excitement yesterday on the Gensler hearing. I am in London, spending time with our team focused on growing our business. Can&#39;t tell you how inept the SEC looks from this side of the pond.</p>
<p>&mdash; Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) <a href="https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1648697044825956353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">April 19, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Ripple has also taken huge advantage of the pro-crypto regulations in Europe including the recently passed bill, Markets in Crypto-Assets (MICA). Moreover, other crypto firms from the United States including Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ: COIN) have begun diversifying into international markets for their future growth prospects.</p>
<h2>Price Action</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP</a> price has significantly been suppressed by the ongoing SEC vs Ripple case. Furthermore, several centralized exchanges including Coinbase Global delisted the asset after the SEC filed the lawsuit two years ago. Nevertheless, the XRP global community has continued supporting the Ripple course as more institutions adopt the On Demand Liquidity and RippleNet products.</p>
<p>Trading around $0.435, XRP price is up approximately 28 percent YTD.</p>

<p>Satellite TV provider DISH fell short of EPS and revenue expectations for Q1 2023 amid its sustained stock devaluation troubles. </p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/dish-q1-2023-results/">DISH Q1 2023 Results Sees Company Miss Estimates on Earnings &#038; Revenue</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/dish-q1-2023-results/">DISH Q1 2023 Results Sees Company Miss Estimates on Earnings &#038; Revenue</a></p>
<p>DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ: DISH) has published Q1 2023 numbers that missed earnings per share (EPS) and revenue estimates. The satellite television and telecommunications company&#8217;s reported EPS for the first quarter was $0.35 compared to the consensus estimate of $0.36. Also, DISH&#8217;s revenue came in at $3.96 billion versus the $4.06 billion analysts expected for the same period. The company&#8217;s latest revenue haul is lower than the $4.33 billion it generated in the corresponding period last year.</p>
<p>For Q1 2023, DISH Network reported a net income of $223 million versus the $433 million realized in Q1 2022. Meanwhile, the Colorado-based television provider&#8217;s diluted earnings per share of $0.35 paled compared to its Q1 2022 figure of $0.68.</p>
<p>For the period ended March 31st, DISH&#8217;s net pay-TV subscribership sank by roughly 552,000. This marked a decrease of almost 100,000 subscribers from the 462,000 subscribers decline recorded in the first quarter of last year. However, the company ended Q1 2023 with 9.20 million pay-TV subscribers, which comprised 7.10 million DISH TV subscribers and 2.10 million SLING TV subscribers.</p>
<p>In this year&#8217;s first quarter, there was also a decrease in retail wireless subscribers by approximately 81,000. However, this drawdown outperformed the much sizable 343,000 retail wireless net subscription decrease sustained in Q1 2022. DISH reported closing the first three months of 2023 with a retail wireless subscriber base of 7.91 million.</p>
<p>Following its latest quarterly results, DISH is scheduled to hold its conference call today at 10 a.m. ET.</p>
<h2>Other Developments Outside of DISH Q1 2023 News</h2>
<p>Wall Street downgraded DISH&#8217;s stock in late March following its massive 71% drawdown over the past 12 months. At the time, UBS financial analysts reacted to DISH&#8217;s plunging value, giving it a &#8220;Neutral&#8221; rating from its previous &#8220;Buy&#8221;. Meanwhile, financial analysts at BofA Global Research had written to DISH investors in late February, also intimating a stock downgrade. The note read:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In light of recent events, performance, and market realities, we are downgrading our rating to &#8216;Underperform&#8217;.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time, the reasons cited for a DISH downgrade included the company&#8217;s ongoing recovery from a debilitating <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g-and-beyond/dishs-remarkable-internal-outage-stretches-into-second-day/d/d-id/783447" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cybersecurity incident.</a> The incident occurred in February, around the time that DISH announced its Q4 2022 results. The company&#8217;s corporate computer systems remained entirely offline, with President and Chief Executive Officer W. Erik Carlson addressing the incident in an earnings call. At the time, Carlson explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We experienced an internal outage that&#8217;s continuing to affect our internal servers and IT telephony. Our DISH and Sling services and our wireless and data networks continue to operate normally, [and] are up and running. However, some of our internal communications, customer care functions, and Internet sites were affected and are currently down.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The CEO added that DISH was &#8220;analyzing the root causes and any consequences of the outage&#8221;. Lastly, Carlson pointed out that the satellite company worked to restore the affected systems as swiftly as possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-ceo-exchange-scrutiny/">Coinbase CEO Says Exchange Would No Longer Exit US amid Regulatory Scrutiny</a></p>
<p>The CEO of top American cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/brian-armstrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Armstrong</a> has hinted that the exchange will not bow to pressure from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>). Armstrong, who has been openly critical of SEC and its chair Gary Gensler, made more accusations on Monday.</p>
<p>In a bare-it-all interview with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/08/coinbase-ceo-on-us-crypto-regulation-sec-lawsuit-international-plans.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a> on Monday, Armstrong suggested that Gensler leads some form of personal campaign against crypto. He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>“There’s kind of a lone crusade, if you will, with Gary Gensler, the chair there, and he has taken a more anti-crypto view for some reason.”</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the CEO, the SEC, under the leadership of Gensler, might be more interested in curtailing the crypto industry rather than regulating it. To this end, the SEC served <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> with a <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sec-enforcement-action-coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wells Notice</a> in March to signal an upcoming enforcement action against the exchange.</p>
<p>It might be worth mentioning that Coinbase had been having a back-and-forth with the regulator even before the March notice.  The SEC alleges that Coinbase is selling unregistered securities to investors. The exchange, on the other hand, disputes the claims.</p>
<p>Armstrong, however, now believes that there might be some good to gain from the whole situation after all. He says the constant scrutiny may have now put the exchange in a good position to get the much-needed clarity from the courts. And according to him, this will not only benefit the firm but the crypto industry at large.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Exchange Not Leaving US, Says CEO</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Armstrong also went back on the statement he made last month during a fintech conference in London. At the time, the CEO suggested that the exchange was contemplating moving its headquarters to an environment more conducive to its business. But it appears he has already had a change of heart. Speaking to CNBC earlier, Armstrong stated that Coinbase would not relocate overseas anymore. However, he admits that the US is behind in terms of its regulatory approach, unlike the UK Armstrong said partly:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’re always going to have a US presence &#8230; But the US is a little bit behind right now.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly,  Coinbase continues its quest for global expansion and is currently looking to invest in the United Arab Emirates. This was confirmed by Armstrong in the Monday interview.</p>

<p>Rep. Kim Nam-kuk of the Democratic Party of Korea has allegedly withdrawn a massive 800,000 WEMIX tokens in the period between late February to early March 2022, just before the introduction of the global standard-setter FATF's travel rule on March 25, 2022.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/south-korean-lawmaker-crypto-transfers/">South Korean Lawmaker Under Scrutiny over Suspicious Crypto Transfers</a></p>
<p>In the latest development, South Korean authorities have reported local authorities regarding a series of crypto transfers by opposition party lawmakers, sparking domestic outrage and a potential conflict of interest.</p>
<p>As per the details, Rep. Kim Nam-kuk of the Democratic Party of Korea has allegedly withdrawn a massive 800,000 WEMIX tokens in the period between late February to early March 2022. In the period between January and February 2022, Kim&#8217;s WEMIX holdings stood at 6 billion won ($4.5 million). All these crypto transfers have now been reported to the Financial Services Commission&#8217;s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).</p>
<p>Thus, the FIU has classified all these withdrawals as suspicious transactions while reporting them further to the prosecutor&#8217;s office. South Korea has been one of the most active market when it comes to crypto trading. Thus, it has kept South Korean lawmakers vigilant and working on crypto regulations for a while.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the South Korean law firm Yulchon was working with the government to help them “tighten oversight of the country’s exuberant crypto sector&#8221;. As said, South Korean citizens have heavy exposure to crypto assets. As per statistics, a staggering 13% of the global Bitcoin trading volume comes from the Korean Won. However, the sad part is that the South Korean market has witnessed a large number of crypto scams taking place over the past few years.</p>
<p>South Korea’s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/do-kwon-funds-law-firm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Do Kwon</a>, the founder of the Terra LUNA project, was among the ones to trigger the crypto winter of 2022.</p>
<h2>South Korea&#8217;s FATF Rules</h2>
<p>Soon after Kim made withdrawals for the WEMIX tokens, South Korea implemented the global standard-setter FATF&#8217;s travel rule on March 25, 2022. This rule requires exchanges to collect personal information on transactions and report them further to authorities whenever they exceed a certain threshold.</p>
<p>However, Kim states that he hasn&#8217;t cashed out his tokens and didn&#8217;t violate any laws, as per the <a href="https://www.coindeskkorea.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=91261" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> from CoinDesk Korea. Also, as per South Korea&#8217;s Public Service Ethics Act, there&#8217;s no reporting required for virtual assets.</p>
<p>Over the last year, some of the major South Korean exchanges have delisted WEMIX for allegedly reporting inaccurate circulation supply figures. Interestingly, WEMIX&#8217;s issuing company WeMade made an unsuccessful attempt in challenging the delisting in court.</p>
<p>The South Korean crypto community still awaits clarity on the taxation of crypto income as lawmakers postpone it to 2025.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/qualcomm-autotalks-350-400m/">Qualcomm Acquiring V2X Chip Maker Autotalks for $350-400M</a></p>
<p>American multination tech giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/qualcomm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qualcomm Inc</a> (NASDAQ: QCOM) is looking at expanding its footprint in the automotive business through the acquisition of Autotalks, an Israeli firm that specializes in producing chips used in vehicle crash prevention technologies.</p>
<p>Qualcomm <a href="https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/auto-components/qualcomm-to-acquire-israeli-auto-chip-maker-autotalks/100068189" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> on Monday that it would include Autotalks&#8217; solutions in its Snapdragon Digital Chassis product portfolio. Notably, the Snapdragon Digital Chassis can be used to enable in-car infotainment and cloud connectivity.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/qualcomm-q3-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>, Qualcomm stated last year that its automotive business &#8220;pipeline&#8221; has grown to $30 billion, recording an increase of more than $10 billion since a late July disclosure.</p>
<p>Qualcomm is a multinational technological business that creates semiconductors, software, and other related products. In addition to its focus on mobile technologies, Qualcomm also has a significant presence in the automotive and networking industries, providing solutions for areas such as connected cars, artificial intelligence, and 5G networks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Autotalks specializes in developing communication chips and software designed specifically for the automotive industry. The company&#8217;s technology is primarily used in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication systems that allow cars to communicate with each other and with roadside infrastructure in real time.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this acquisition would allow Qualcomm to provide a broader choice of solutions to automakers and boost its competitiveness in the expanding market for connected and autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>“We have been investing in V2X research, development and deployment since 2017 and believe that as the automotive market matures, a standalone V2X safety architecture will be needed for enhanced road user safety, as well as smart transportation systems,” said Nakul Duggal, senior vice president &amp; GM, automotive, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. “We share Autotalks’ decades-long experience and commitment to build V2X technologies and products with a focus on solving real-world road user safety challenges,” added he.</p>
<h2>Qualcomm Autotalks Acquisition: New Focus for Chip Makers</h2>
<p>The automobile industry is becoming an increasingly important market for chipmakers such as Qualcomm as the number of electric vehicles and cars equipped with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) grows.</p>
<p>Markedly, these systems rely significantly on electronic components such as semiconductors and microchips, which power sensors, and cameras in the vehicle. As a result, automakers are investing more in electronic and digital technology to remain competitive and fulfill changing customer demands, resulting in an increase in chip demand.</p>
<p>Additionally, the rise of electric and self-driving vehicles has opened up new opportunities for chipmakers to deliver solutions in important areas like battery management, power electronics, and connectivity.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/how-the-internet-of-things-iot-industry-will-look-like-in-2018-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forecasts</a>, the industry is expected to grow more in the coming years as the trend toward electrification and automation accelerates. This projected growth has been cited as yet another positive point in the acquisition deal between Qualcomm and Autotalks.</p>
<p>Qualcomm shares pared off some losses following the announcement, they are down 0.13% in the pre-market to $108.64</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/baidu-smartphone-market/">Baidu to Make Its First Entry into Smartphone Market Next Week</a></p>
<p>Beijing-based internet company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/baidu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baidu</a> might be only a week away from launching the brand’s first-ever smartphone. According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-08/baidu-to-unveil-own-smartphone-next-week-in-surprise-ai-move" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>, the smartphone represents another addition to Baidu’s growing portfolio of smart gadgets.</p>
<p>However, the move appears to signal the intent of Baidu to create a hardware ecosystem that will complement its already prominent internet services.</p>
<p>In a similar manner to Google and Amazon, the firm had recently developed smart speakers and displays for the home. And now, the smartphone would be the latest hardware addition. According to a company spokesperson, the smartphone is expected to be unveiled within the next week.</p>
<h2>Here&#8217;s What to Expect</h2>
<p>At the moment, it remains unclear what might be the ultimate aims of Baidu with the smartphone introduction. However, for a couple of reasons, it might be safe to say that the internet giant will not go all into the business.</p>
<p>Shawn Yang, Managing Director at Blue Lotus Capital Advisors, shares a similar opinion in that Baidu might soft-pedal on its newfound smartphone interest. Admitting that the smartphone market is very mature, Yang says:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s tough to make an impact just from a software angle.”</p></blockquote>
<p>For all intents and purposes, the mobile phone market is fully congested and hardly doing any good numbers at the moment. For example, the smartphone market suffered a double-digit loss in 2022 with only Apple and Samsung sharing the spoils of the year between themselves. Whereas, the same year left other companies scrambling for various means to at least, recoup the costs they incurred from partnership deals and software acquisitions.</p>
<h2>Baidu Remains Focused on AI</h2>
<p>Despite the uncertainties around its upcoming business venture, Baidu remains committed to innovative technology, especially artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>Recall that the firm was one of the first Chinese companies to provide an alternative to OpenAI’s ChatGPT.  In March, Baidu <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/baidu-chatgpt-ernie-bot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> its Ernie Bot, having invested vigorously in AI for many years. More so, the company also maintains that it plans to embed its AI tools into all its smart gadgets, search, autonomous driving, and many more of its product offerings.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/smart-contract-laws-defi/">European Lawmakers to Review Smart Contract Laws that Threaten to Kill DeFi</a></p>
<p>As Europe embarks on its journey to bring clear crypto regulations in place, the blockchain industry is making a final push in preventing laws that would crush the smart contracts underpinning the decentralized finance (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeFi</a>) protocols.</p>
<p>The lawmakers are currently having negotiations over the Data Act, which will be concluded by the end of June. This Data Act seeks to regulate data shared across smart devices using IoT networks. However, the text of the Data Act has an article dedicated to regulating the smart contracts underpinning the DeFi sector.</p>
<p>Advocates of crypto such as the European Crypto Initiative asked policymakers to consider the spillover of such an act to other blockchain developers. The crypto proponents argue that this spillover could kill the use of DeFi in the bloc. Speaking to DL News, Marina Markezic, executive director of the European Crypto Initiative <a href="https://www.dlnews.com/articles/regulation/europe-defi-threatened-by-data-act-smart-contract-laws/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The worst-case scenario is whether we would even be able to use public blockchains for using smart contracts while complying with the Data Act requirements.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Europe shouldn’t “shoot itself in the foot by inadvertently damaging innovation and technological development in the broader blockchain industry”, wrote the trading association.</p>
<h2>EU Gives Mixed Signals</h2>
<p>One of the sources closer to the negotiations noted that several European institutions considered promoting the use of smart contracts through the Data Act, instead of regulating the ledger technology. The sources said that the regulators will address the industry concerns during their negotiations in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>However, a spokesperson for the European Commission stated that the controversial article on smart contracts regulation takes a neutral stand on technology. “It sets high-level requirements for smart contracts, whether or not they are based on blockchain technology or a more traditional database,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>To decide the final outcome of the legislative process, the three European institutions that lead the negotiations have reached their own stance on the Data Act. Back on March 14, 2023, the European Parliament passed a vote on its adoption. Now, along with the European Commission and the European Council, regulators need to reach a final agreement.</p>
<p>In a meeting ahead this month on May 23, the three players will aim to solve the outlying issues with the Data Act text. Another meeting shall happen by the end of June next month. Markezic said this is the “biggest organized effort so far”, and the group hopes that “any future plans for data sharing will take into consideration the inherently different nature of smart contracts”.</p>
