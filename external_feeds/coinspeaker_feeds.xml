<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binances-denies-chinese-users-90b/">Binance Denies that Chinese Users Traded $90 Billion Despite China&#8217;s Ban</a></p>
<p>On August 2nd, The Wall Street Journal published a report indicating that current and former employees of Binance observed internal transactions confirming that Chinese users traded around $90 billion in cryptocurrencies on the exchange for a month.</p>
<p>However, Binance denied the claims <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-is-illegal-in-china-binance-does-90-billion-of-business-there-anyway-2a0af975?mod=latest_headlines" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">published</a> by The Wall Street Journal during an <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-denies-reports-of-billions-in-crypto-trades-in-china" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with Cointelegraph, stating that the exchange had not allowed the platform to be used for the exchange of billions of dollars as claimed by WSJ.</p>
<p>Binance explained that even due to China&#8217;s cryptocurrency bans, the exchange has refused to conduct business in the Asian country. A Binance representative told Cointelegraph, &#8220;The Binance.com website is blocked in China and not accessible to Chinese users.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Binance Faces Global Regulatory Scrutiny</h2>
<p>Since March, Binance has been under <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilnd.431767/gov.uscourts.ilnd.431767.1.0_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investigation</a> in the United States for allegedly allowing its employees to assist Chinese clients in evading KYC (Know Your Customer) controls. However, the investigation is still ongoing, and the exchange has not officially denied the accusations thus far.</p>
<p>Last week, Binance encountered obstacles in entering the German market due to regulatory scrutiny, leading them to &#8220;temporarily&#8221; withdraw their cryptocurrency license in the country. Apparently, the German financial regulatory authority, BaFin, had denied Binance&#8217;s application the previous month.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the exchange has encountered similar issues in Austria, the Netherlands, and Cyprus after losing its European banking partner, Paysafe Payment Solutions (PSFE: NYSE), responsible for enabling deposits and withdrawals in euros for Binance&#8217;s customers through bank transfers.</p>
<p>Additionally, recent reports have claimed that Binance continued to maintain staff and operations in China despite announcing its departure in 2017 following the initial crypto ban in the country.</p>
<p>In recent months, Binance has faced operational disruptions from regulators worldwide. Belgian authorities requested Binance to cease all digital currency services in the country in June. On July 26th, the exchange withdrew its crypto license application in Germany.</p>
<h2>Binance Defies China&#8217;s Prohibitions</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/china-binance-dominant-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by Coinspeaker, the cryptocurrency giant has managed to maintain its presence in China despite the country&#8217;s prohibitions, raising questions about whether governmental control can overshadow the reach of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>According to WSJ, in May, Binance handled an astonishing $670 billion through its spot trading and futures services, demonstrating its global leadership.</p>
<p>Although Binance has stood out as the world&#8217;s leading exchange, its leadership could be undermined at any moment, especially if the multiple reports suggesting that some of its employees known as &#8220;angels&#8221; have provided guidance to Chinese and American users to evade KYC and register as residents of other countries are proven true.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/former-ftx-ceo-doj-bail/">Former FTX CEO&#8217;s Defense Slams DOJ’s Attempt to Revoke Bail</a></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/sam-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Bankman-Fried</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> defense team has mounted a robust defense against the US Department of Justice’s (DOJ) motion to revoke the former FTX CEO&#8217;s bail bond. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The defense’s 18-page </span><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66631291/185/united-states-v-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Judge Lewis A. Kaplan deconstructs the DOJ&#8217;s arguments, calling them “extremely thin” and criticizing the reliance on “assumptions, unsupported inferences, and innuendo.”</span></p>
<h2><b>The DOJ’s Claims against  Bankman-Fried</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankman-Fried’s defense attorneys methodically scrutinized the DOJ&#8217;s move to revoke bail, claiming that the government&#8217;s arguments lack substance and factual support. The defense contended that the claims leveled against Bankman-Fried were at best hypothetical and lacked solid evidence of wrongdoing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankman-Fried’s journey through the legal system began with his </span><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bankman-fried-arrested-bahamas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arrest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Bahamas, followed by extradition to the United States. After nine days in custody, he secured his release on bail on December 21. However, the DOJ is now attempting to reverse this decision, arguing that Bankman-Fried’s actions since his release warrant his return to remand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crux of the DOJ’s motion lies in the assertion that Bankman-Fried engaged in over 100 phone calls with a New York Times reporter. The government claims that during these calls, Bankman-Fried <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-doj-bankman-fried-ellison-diary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> personal documents of Caroline Ellison, a former executive of Alameda Research and a key witness that was not part of the official discovery material.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOJ claims that Bankman-Fried&#8217;s actions amounted to witness tampering and obstruction of justice and that he should be remanded. In addition to the phone call allegations, the government also claimed that Bankman-Fried used an encrypted messaging application Signal to communicate with other witnesses, raising concerns about potential attempts to evade surveillance. </span></p>
<h2><b>Defense against Bail Bond Annulment</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, arguments on the former FTX CEO&#8217;s bail bond saw his legal team vehemently challenge these claims, raising critical questions about evidence and fairness. The defense challenges the government’s version of events, asserting that it fails to accurately represent the facts and removes them from their proper context. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The documents provided in discovery, according to the defense, clarify that Ellison initiated communication with Bankman-Fried, and his response was an attempt to offer his assistance as a resource in a bankruptcy case, rather than an attempt to tamper with testimony.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding the government&#8217;s claim that Bankman-Fried used a VPN to hide his online activities, the defense straightforwardly countered this assertion. They claim that Bankman-Fried used the VPN for completely harmless reasons, such as watching football. The defense rejects any suggestion of inappropriate use, claiming that there is no evidence to show otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the defense addressed Bankman-Fried’s contact with a New York Times reporter, claiming that it was not intended to intimidate or sway the jury pool, as the government claims. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, they argue that he was exercising his rights by providing fair feedback on an ongoing article. The defense emphasizes that the reporter had alternate sources and that Bankman-Fried’s involvement was entirely legal.</span></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/garlinghouse-us-sec-xrp-ripple/">Brad Garlinghouse Slams US SEC for Using XRP Quarterly Reports against Ripple in Lawsuit</a></p>
<p>The recent ruling on <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a> vs <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ripple-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple</a> lawsuit has undeniably helped XRP gain in value and also traded volume. Following the ruling earlier last month, several centralized cryptocurrency exchanges including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase Global Inc</a> (NASDAQ: COIN), <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/kraken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kraken</a>, and Bitstamp, among others re-listed XRP for American crypto traders. Consequently, the XPR&#8217;s price experienced a macro breakout gray could lead to further gains in the coming months. Moreover, the XRP market is already bolstered by the many strategic partnerships between Ripple and traditional financial institutions in streamlining cross-border payments.</p>
<h2>XRP Market 2023 Q2 Report</h2>
<p>Ripple highlighted in the second quarter insights published on July 31 that the report would shift from the traditional format but still focus on providing transparency within the XRP market. Notably, the company focused on debunking several misconceptions identified since the ruling on July 13, in addition to providing some transparency on its XRP holdings. Furthermore, Ripple has been slammed for dumping millions of XRP into the market monthly instead of decentralizing the issuance process through a staking or mining mechanism.</p>
<p>Ripple highlighted that the SEC has no jurisdiction in the crypto market and should not purport to protect retail investors. Moreover, most XRP holders were against the lawsuit since it eviscerated their holdings for years.</p>
<p>“Consumers need protection, but not all roads lead to the SEC. If the SEC’s overreach has exposed a regulatory gap, that gap is not for a court to fill (and certainly not for the SEC to fill without legal authority). Protecting retail crypto traders is an important policy goal that is best addressed through thoughtful legislation,” the Ripple report noted.</p>
<p>In regards to the XRP market, Ripple only highlighted that it has some holdings excluding the escrow account. The company added that the majority of escrow’s monthly releases are put back for future access.</p>
<h2>Ripple CEO Garlinghouse Slams SEC</h2>
<p>According to Ripple CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/brad-garlinghouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brad Garlinghouse</a>, the SEC misunderstood the company’s quarterly XRP markets report after using them during the lawsuit. Nonetheless, Garlinghouse reiterated that the company will continue to Forster market transparency but from a different angle in the future.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We began these reports to voluntarily provide updates given our XRP holdings. Sadly, they were used against us in the SEC lawsuit &#8211; however, we remain steadfast in our commitment to transparency but I suspect they’re going to look a bit different moving forward <a href="https://t.co/oANR6WCG09">https://t.co/oANR6WCG09</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1686618130674774016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The statement by Garlinghouse was backed by digital asset-friendly lawyer John E Deaton who noted that Ripple was never obligated to issue the transparency reports as a private company. However, Deaton thinks the SEC could have used the same card by referring to fraud charges if Ripple did not provide transparency information</p>
<p>“Even though the SEC and others used this info against Ripple, the transparency prevented the SEC from attempting to assert bogus fraud, misrepresentation, or manipulation charges &#8211; which, let’s face it, it would have, if it could have. When you are transparent they can’t claim fraud &#8211; even when they want to,” Deaton <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-ripple-ceo-garlinghouse-and-deaton-condemn-us-sec-for-using-xrp-report-in-suit/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/softbank-semiconductor-arm-70b-ipo/">SoftBank&#8217;s Chip Designer Arm Eyes $70B Valuation in Upcoming IPO</a></p>
<p>British chip designer Arm Ltd, a subsidiary of the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/softbank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoftBank Group Corp</a>, is preparing to conduct an initial public offering (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-initial-public-offering-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPO</a>) in the coming months. According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-02/softbank-s-arm-targets-60-billion-plus-value-for-september-ipo#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> citing people familiar with the matter, the semiconductor maker targets a valuation between $60 billion to $70 billion for the IPO. The IPO event is anticipated to kick off as early as September, followed by share pricing in the subsequent week. This move sets the stage for what could be the largest initial public offering of the year.</p>
<p>Arm&#8217;s designs are crucial in manufacturing chips used by some of the biggest semiconductor companies worldwide, including Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. According to the report, these companies have been engaged in preliminary talks with Arm to become anchor investors in the upcoming IPO.</p>
<h2>Arm Seeks to Raise $10 Billion at the IPO</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, the chip maker faced a proposition from the British government to list its shares in London, but the company opted to pursue a listing on a US exchange instead. The firm made a confidential filing for a US listing on Nasdaq in April, indicating a strategic intent to expand its presence in the American tech market.</p>
<p>Arm named several financial services companies in the US as the IPO banks in the filing with the regulator. Some of these banks include <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/goldman-sachs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goldman Sachs</a>, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/jpmorgan-chase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JPMorgan Chase</a>, Barclays, and Mizuho Financial Group.</p>
<p>Upon listing on the American stock exchange, the SoftBank-owned company plans to raise between $8 billion to $10 billion from investors. If successful, the fundraising will become the largest in the tech industry since <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/alibaba-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alibaba Group</a> and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Platforms</a> conducted their respective IPOs in 2014 and 2012, respectively.</p>
<p>The move to go public comes amid growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) chips, reflected in the increased market mood towards technologies linked to generative AI and chips. Bankers initially pitched the company&#8217;s valuation in a wide range from $30 billion to $70 billion. However, SoftBank&#8217;s CEO Rene Haas, who was also appointed CEO at Arm last year, believed that the lower end of the range did not adequately represent the company&#8217;s true value.</p>
<p>Industry experts acknowledged the critical but lesser-known role that Arm has played in the tech world for a long time. Bob O&#8217;Donnell, president of TECHnalysis Research, highlighted the raised awareness of the firm&#8217;s contributions and its vital role in various technologies.</p>
<h2>Arm to Expand Its Business Offerings Beyond Smartphone Market</h2>
<p>The company, headquartered in Cambridge, has been a relatively unknown player in the tech industry, despite its technology being utilized in nearly every smartphone globally. The company&#8217;s core business involves selling the necessary blueprints for microprocessor designs and licensing instruction sets that govern how software programs interact with these chips.</p>
<p>However, under the leadership of Haas, Arm is now on a mission to diversify its reach beyond the smartphone market, which has experienced limited growth in recent years.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s CEO is setting his sights on more advanced computing ventures, explicitly targeting the burgeoning chip market for data centers dedicated to cloud computing and artificial intelligence applications.</p>
<p>Giant corporations like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a> have already adopted the company&#8217;s chips for its Amazon Web Services (AWS) due to their energy efficiency and economic viability.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/rakuten-mou-openai/">Japanese Company Rakuten Group Signs MoU with OpenAI</a></p>
<p>Rakuten Group has just entered into a strategic partnership with artificial intelligence (AI) firm OpenAI. By signing a memorandum of understanding with OpenAI, the Japanese company will be seeking to explore business opportunities that the partnership will make available to it, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/rakuten-group-developing-services-with-openai-2023-08-02/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a> reports.</p>
<h2>Rakuten to Tap OpenAI&#8217;s AI-Based Applications</h2>
<p>For Rakuten, its primary aim is to key into the world of AI by integrating OpenAI applications into its current offerings. And given the wide acceptance and popularity that some of these applications already enjoy, Rakuten will be hoping to take advantage of the situation for its growth.</p>
<p>OpenAI has seen its popularity grow significantly in the past few months. More so since it launched its artificial general intelligence (AGI) app <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT</a>.  As Coinspeaker <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/openai-launches-chatgpt-android-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>, ChatGPT is available for both Android and iOS users, and can also be accessed on the web.</p>
<p>But more than its prominent ChatGPT app, OpenAI also offers other applications including GPT-4 and other AGI models via APIs. And in addition to that, OpenAI also launched Whisper,  a speech-to-text transcription service, and an AI-based image generator dubbed Dall.E-2.</p>
<p>By partnering with OpenAI and using its innovative technologies, Rakuten Group seeks to improve its products and services in hopes that that will ultimately help to boost its customer experience.</p>
<h2>The Growing Popularity of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>It might be worth noting that the new partnership is further proof of how artificial intelligence has gradually crept into various industries. So much so that its influence has spread across a range of industries including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/amazon-artificial-intelligence/">e-commerce</a>, automobile, crypto, and even robotics to mention a few.</p>
<p>Although the details of this partnership remain sketchy at the moment, both companies certainly recognize the potential of AI technologies. For this, it will be interesting to see how they both harness AI to boost their businesses and pave the way for future advancements in the field.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-bitcoin-lightning-network/">Coinbase to Explore Adding Bitcoin Lightning Network for Global Crypto Payments</a></p>
<p>American-based cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> plans to explore the possibility of integrating the Bitcoin Lightning Network into its platform. The move is part of a broader plan to expand digital asset payment options for users across the world. During an open conversation on Twitter, now rebranded as X, Coinbase CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/brian-armstrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Armstrong</a> confirmed that the exchange is considering incorporating the Bitcoin Lightning network to enable easier payments globally.</p>
<p>Additionally, Armstrong emphasized the need for collaborative efforts from the crypto community, including Coinbase, to integrate layer 2 solutions, improve on-ramps, and streamline the user experience for wider crypto adoption.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The next step for crypto is to make payments instant and free globally.</p>
<p>This will take lots of work from all of us, Coinbase included, getting layer 2&#39;s integrated, better on-ramps, simpler UX/onboarding, etc.</p>
<p>A magic threshold would be getting the average payment under 1 cent… <a href="https://t.co/IDWTHsZNUq">https://t.co/IDWTHsZNUq</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Brian Armstrong 🛡️ (@brian_armstrong) <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1684281133658431488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Coinbase CEO Agrees to Work Together with Dorsey</h2>
<p>However, Armstrong&#8217;s vision was met with questions from long-standing Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) supporters like Michael Saylor, the former CEO of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/microstrategy-incorporated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MicroStrategy,</a> and Jack Dorsey, who previously owned Twitter before it was acquired by Elon Musk last year.</p>
<p>Saylor recommended the integration of Bitcoin Lightning on Coinbase, while Dorsey inquired about the superior money transmission protocol compared to Bitcoin. Armstrong responded, clarifying that Coinbase has boarded more people to Bitcoin than any other company.</p>
<p>While acknowledging Coinbase&#8217;s role in spreading Bitcoin adoption, Dorsey expressed willingness to collaborate on open internet money-transmission protocols not controlled by any single entity.</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt Coinbase introduced more people to Bitcoin than anyone else. And I&#8217;m grateful for that. Putting more of your resources towards your original focus on Bitcoin and layer 2 technologies would be amazing, and we&#8217;d be happy to partner,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1686610126453846016?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> Dorsey.</p>
<p>The open discussion concluded with a commitment from both entrepreneurs to work together in support of Bitcoin and layer 2 technologies.</p>
<h2>Binance Completes Integration of Bitcoin Lightning Network</h2>
<p>While Coinbase is still planning to leverage the Bitcoin Lightning Network, the company&#8217;s rival <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/">Binance</a> already completed the integration of the L2 network last month.</p>
<p>On July 17, Binance <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-bitcoin-lightning-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it had completed the network integration for BTC deposits and withdrawals, joining the likes of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/kraken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kraken,</a> OKX, Bitfinex, and River Financial, which have also embraced the layer 2 scaling solution.</p>
<p>With this, Binance users can now leverage the scaling solution to facilitate faster and more cost-effective transactions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Lightning Network&#8217;s adoption has gained momentum in emerging markets like South America and Africa, primarily driven by initiatives like the LN mobile payment application Strike.</p>
<p>Lightning Labs, the company behind the introduction of the layer 2 scaling solution, which uses micropayment channels between nodes to expedite transactions at a lower cost, recently released a new toolkit facilitating artificial intelligence (AI) applications&#8217; interaction with the Bitcoin network, enabling them to send, receive, and hold the crypto asset.</p>
<p>As the adoption of the Lightning Network grows, the crypto community continues to explore innovative solutions to enhance crypto payments and pave the way for broader global adoption.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ethereum-etf-sec-bitcoin/">Ethereum ETF Frenzy Sweeps SEC Following Bitcoin ETF Hype</a></p>
<p>The crypto investment landscape is undergoing a seismic shift as six entities have rushed to file applications with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) for Ethereum (ETH) futures-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).</p>
<h2>The Rise of Ethereum ETFs</h2>
<p>This whirlwind of activity closely follows the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-sec-spot-bitcoin-etf-applications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent wave</a> surrounding <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> spot ETFs, marking a pivotal moment in the convergence of digital assets and traditional finance.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1686510111123030016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a>, Eric Balchunas, a Senior ETF Specialist at Bloomberg, provided insight into the recent rise in applications to the SEC for Ether futures-based ETFs. His remark sheds light on the dynamic events taking place in the crypto investment ecosystem.</p>
<p>Notably, the Ether spot ETF frenzy which kicked off with the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1884021/000138713123009033/ethu-485apos_072823.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filing</a> from Volatility Shares on July 28, swiftly captivated the attention of market observers. Volatility Shares had already made waves in the crypto world back in June, introducing the first leveraged crypto ETF in the United States, the 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX).</p>
<p>This groundbreaking move laid the groundwork for what would become a cascade of ETF filings focused on Ethereum. The momentum continued to build as the calendar turned to August 1, with a remarkable flurry of filings from some prominent players in the investment industry. Bitwise, VanEck, Roundhill, ProShare, and Grayscale all joined the race within a mere 24 hours.</p>
<p>While the prospect of Ether ETFs has garnered significant attention, it&#8217;s important to note that the road to approval has historically been challenging. According to an insider familiar with the process, the SEC has yet to greenlight any ETF applications linked to ETH futures contracts.</p>
<p>However, the crypto community’s expectations remain high. If the SEC does not reject the recently submitted Ether ETF proposals, a new era in crypto investment could emerge. The launch of these ETFs, if approved, is set to occur 75 days after the filing date.</p>
<p>Volatility Shares, having taken the initiative by filing on July 28, is positioned to lead the pack, potentially preparing to launch its Ether ETF on October 12. Subsequent launches by other entities would follow suit.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Experiences Sideways Price Action</h2>
<p>The rush to launch Ethereum spot ETFs has sparked interest in the crypto community. However, despite the growing number of applications, the absence of regulatory approval and the looming possibility of withdrawals have kept ETH prices moving sideways.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the price of Ethereum is pegged at $1,856, up 1.9% over the past 24 hours per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">date</a> from CoinMarketCap. The coin managed to recover losses from the previous day, effectively bringing its price back to where it stood on Monday, at the $1,853 mark.</p>
<p>A notable observation is that Ethereum’s current price levels mirror those of mid-June, a period during which the asset dipped below $1,700 before rebounding and surging beyond the $2,000 mark.</p>
<p>Market participants have been closely watching ETH’s price dynamics, with keen anticipation for a potential breakout from its current range. Such a breakout could signal a shift in sentiment and potentially pave the way for a sustained upward trend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/irs-digital-document-2024-tax/">IRS Announces Full Digital Document Submissions for 2024 Tax Season</a></p>

<p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has announced that it will allow taxpayers to submit all their tax documents electronically for the 2024 tax season. Consequently, taxpayers will no longer need to mail or fax their paper forms and supporting documents to the IRS. Instead, they can upload them online through a secure portal. Additionally, the Treasury Department announced it will convert all paper <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/irs-tax-returns-stimulus-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tax returns</a> to digital documents by the 2025 season.</p>
<p>According to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, taxpayers will retain the choice to submit documents by paper. She said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;For those taxpayers, by filing season 2025, the IRS is committing to digitally process 100 percent of tax and information returns that are submitted by paper.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will not be the first time the US is allowing digital filings. Already, many taxpayers file their returns digitally through third-party providers. However, the COVID-19 pandemic, associated filing delays, and staffing shortages resulted in a massive backlog of unprocessed paper tax returns. This warranted a return to manual processing.</p>
<h2>A Decade-Long IRS Initiative</h2>
<p>The paperless project has been a priority of IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel, who took over in March. According to the IRS, the digitalization effort is part of a decade-long program to modernize systems and improve its services for taxpayers.</p>
<p>Currently, the service handles up to 125 million documents annually. Officials say that the IRS will save tens of millions of dollars each year by reducing paper submissions. It would also save the agency time wasted on sorting through the documents.</p>
<p>According to the IRS,  starting from 2024, taxpayers will also benefit from digital document submissions as they can expect faster refunds, fewer errors, and more security.</p>
<p>The initiative will be funded through <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/06/inflation-reduction-act-irs/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the Inflation Reduction Act</a>, which approved $80 billion over ten years for the IRS. While this has been cut to $60 billion, it remains the biggest funding the IRS has received in ages.</p>
<h2>Progress So Far</h2>
<p>Already, the IRS has obtained new scanning technology that will allow it to process tax returns more efficiently. It also plans to recruit an additional 20,000 employees over two years. These will bolster the commission’s tax enforcement and customer service unit.</p>
<p>According to the Treasury Department, the funding is already yielding short-term gains. The agency customer response rate has improved from 155 in 2022 to 87% in 2023. Treasury Secretary Yellen believes that with stable funding, the IRS will be able to sustain its initiatives and improve how it serves taxpayers.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/amd-stock-q2-2023-earnings-ai/">AMD Stock Gains after Q2 2023 Earnings and Plans to Boost AI Chip Production</a></p>
<p>On Tuesday, August 1, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advanced Micro Devices Inc</a> (NASDAQ: AMD) posted moderately better-than-expected results for the second quarter earnings. AMD reported non-GAAP earnings of 57 cents per share for the quarter, showing a 45.7% decrease compared to the same period last year. Despite the decline, it exceeded Street forecasts by one cent.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s group revenues also dropped by 18.2% to $5.359 billion, slightly surpassing analysts&#8217; predictions of $5.31 billion. Also, revenue in the gaming sector declined by 4% compared to last year, amounting to $1.6 billion. Data center revenue also saw a decrease of 11% to $1.3 billion. The client segment, which includes personal computing, experienced a significant decline of 54% in revenue, reaching $998 million. On the other hand, the embedded segment witnessed a 16% increase in revenue, totaling $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the current financial year, AMD projects first-quarter revenue to be around $5.7 billion, with a margin of error of $300 million. The company expects gross margins to be approximately 51%. Refinitv forecasts had previously estimated third-quarter revenue to be $5.82 billion.</p>
<p>The AMd Stock price gain 2.8% on Tuesday ending the trading at the $117.60 price level. With 82% gains since the beginning of 2023, AMD is the second-best-performing member of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index.</p>
<h2>AMD Is Betting on the AI Wave</h2>
<p>Advance Micro Devices is now gearing up for the launch of its artificial intelligence (AI) chips ahead this year. AMD CEO Lisa Su announced that the company is getting ready to produce more of its top-notch MI300 AI chips in the last quarter of the year.</p>
<p>These chips, which are in high demand, are designed to compete with Nvidia&#8217;s advanced H100 chips. Many customers are showing strong interest in the MI300 series, and AMD has strengthened its partnerships with major cloud providers, big companies, and leading AI firms.</p>
<p>AMD assured that it has enough components for the MI300 chips to launch aggressively in the fourth quarter and meet demand until 2024. While the older MI250 chip is still popular for less complex AI tasks, the new MI300 chip will likely be a major player in the market.</p>
<p>Investors believe that the release of the MI300 chips will challenge Nvidia in the fast-growing market for AI chips. However, there&#8217;s a challenge as the MI300 chips currently exceed the performance limits allowed for sale in China due to export controls. Unlike Nvidia and Intel, AMD hasn&#8217;t made special chips for the Chinese market.</p>
<p>To address this, AMD is considering modifying the MI300 and older MI250 chips to comply with U.S. export controls while also meeting the demand for AI solutions in China. Lisa Su <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/amd-leaps-on-q2-earnings-beat-plans-to-ramp-new-ai-chip-production" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We delivered strong results in the second quarter as 4<sup>th</sup> Gen EPYC and Ryzen 7000 processors ramped significantly. Our AI engagements increased by more than seven times in the quarter as multiple customers initiated or expanded programs supporting future deployments of Instinct accelerators at scale. We made strong progress meeting key hardware and software milestones to address the growing customer pull for our data center AI solutions and are on-track to launch and ramp production of MI300 accelerators in the fourth quarter.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Software developer MicroStrategy has revealed its plan to increase its Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) stack. According to a Tuesday filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>), the firm&#8217;s action plan includes raising at least $750 million by selling more stock. It will then use a sizable part of the fund raised to buy more BTC.</p>
<h2>MicroStrategy Continues Its Bitcoin (BTC) Acquisition Spree</h2>
<p>It might be worth mentioning that MicroStrategy, under the leadership of Chairman Michael Saylor, has shown continued interest in the flagship cryptocurrency. To put the above statement into perspective, the firm has invested billions of dollars into BTC since the pandemic.</p>
<p>However, it is also worth noting that, for some reason, Saylor has led <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/microstrategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MicroStrategy</a> to keep raising funds for its BTC purchases the old-fashioned way. That is, by selling more of the publicly traded company’s equity and bonds.</p>
<p>About its intention to sell more stock, the new filing revealed that MicroStrategy will not be using the entire capital to buy BTC. The statement reads in part:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and working capital.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>BTC Price Appreciates</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Bitcoin&#8217;s BTC price surged significantly following reports of the BTC Whale&#8217;s plan to increase its holding. The price went up from around $29,200 to about $29,800 late Tuesday. However, it has since retraced, and currently hovers around $21,400, as CoinMarketCap <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">data</a> suggests. Nonetheless, the price is still up on the daily chart, gaining 1.56% in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>As Coinspeaker earlier reported, MicroStrategy has 152,800 Bitcoin in its possession. That is worth approximately $4.5 billion, as of publication. But with the new announcement, expectations are that there is about to be some addition to those figures.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/kenya-suspends-worldcoin/" rel="prev">next</a></p>
