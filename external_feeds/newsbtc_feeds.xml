					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum — three of the cryptocurrency market’s most dominant coins — are about to simultaneously form a 3-day golden cross. This signal is rare, happening only a handful of times in the past in each individual asset. However, never have all three of these major cryptocurrencies triggered this signal all at the same time. What exactly does this mean, and what are the results of the 3-day golden cross?

This is about to happen in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, simultaneously, for the first time in their history. Previously, these signals arrived at different phases of previous bull markets. It wasn’t until all three coins golden crossed that a stronger rally began. Three top crypto assets — #Bitcoin, Ethereum, and #XRP — are on the brink of a golden cross on the 3-day timeframe All three firing at the same time has never happened before It will also be the third in history for BTC and XRP, second ever for Ether pic.twitter.com/bzVfK3ZpBp — Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; (@tonythebullBTC) July 19, 2023 What Is A Golden Cross In Crypto? A golden cross occurs when a higher timeframe moving average, typically a 200-period MA, crosses above a lower timeframe moving average, usually a 50-period MA, from below. In contrast, a death cross happens when the two cross down from from above. These crossovers generate a buy or sell signal in a moving average-based trading system. Such systems are designed to capture the majority of a trend, but tend to miss much of the early part of a rally as it awaits confirmation. The 3-day golden cross throughout the years &#124; BTCUSD on TradingView.com Moving Average Crossover: How Does The Signal Stack Up? The only time the signal suffered a drawdown was in Bitcoin in 2019. In all other instances, the buy signal using nothing more than a simple moving average crossover, was wildly profitable with limited downside. In 2015, the BTCUSD 3-day golden cross yielded over 2,000% ROI before crossing back down and giving the corresponding sell signal. XRP’s golden cross to death cross kept more than 9,000% of the uptrend’s gains. Ethereum never fired a signal back then, however, due to insufficient price history. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Continuation Pattern Points To 3-6 Months Of Uptrend Ahead Come 2019, Bitcoin had its misfire where the buy signal then sat through a long drawdown. Neither XRP nor Ethereum triggered a signal until 2020, when the entire crypto market began to rally together. The 2020 ETHUSD golden cross held onto over 1100% ROI before the death cross closed out the position. XRP failed to set a new all-time high, but the golden cross still clocked in 200% ROI. Even though Bitcoin fired early in 2019 and sat through a drawdown, the buy signal was still ultimately effective and retained 550% ROI by the time a death cross caused the position to close. Across the five historic buy signals, there was an average of 2,570% ROI when a golden cross occurred. While such returns aren’t likely in the future, this does suggest the signal is effective.

					<description><![CDATA[Ripple has been mostly preoccupied with its lawsuit with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, with a partially favorable ruling from Judge Analisa Torres last week stating that XRP tokens sold on the secondary market are not securities, the crypto firm has turned its attention to other things. This time around, Ripple has dipped its toes into the metaverse sector, joining a massive funding round for Futureverse. Ripple Joins $54 Million Funding Round For Futureverse On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Futureverse, a metaverse startup, had raised a total of $54 million. The company completed the Series A funding round, although at an undisclosed valuation. But the interesting part of the raise was the parties involved. Related Reading: Why This Upcoming Event Is Bearish For Axie Infinity (AXS) The raise was led by 10T Holdings, a crypto investment firm. However, the funding round seems to have managed to draw the attention of Ripple Labs as well. The raise is also significant in the fact that it took place at a time when crypto-related companies are seeing a decline in funding. Interestingly, the Futureverse startup is a combination of other startups. According to the Bloomberg report, Futureverse is actually a combination of 11 startups that span across different industries. These include metaverse, gaming, and artificial intelligence (AI), among others. XRP price sitting at $0.79 &#124; Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com Nevertheless, most of Futureverse’s products so far seem to be combining metaverse, gaming, and AI. The startup currently has a football (soccer) game that can be played on mobile called ‘AI League’ that has also been licensed by FIFA. Its next gamin product is said to be a boxing game leveraging the power of AI. A Return Fueled By Positive Sentiment Ripple has regained its foothold in the crypto industry following the court’s ruling against the SEC last week. With this, both the company and its native token, XRP, have experienced renewed vigor in the market. One example is Ripple looking to leverage real-world assets which it expects to reach a $30 trillion market cap in the next decade. Related Reading: Bearish Signal: BNB Open Interest Skyrockets To New Highs Following the ruling as well, the price of XRP jumped by over 60%, bringing the digital asset to its highest level since December 2021. Since then, XRP has continued on a bullish streak, surpassing Bitcoin in terms of average weekly volume, and emerging as one of the top performers in the space. Presently, the price of XRP is sitting at $0.791, representing a 4.92% increase in the last 24 hours.

					<description><![CDATA[Tesla has released its Q2 2023 earnings report, which has been highly anticipated by investors, and it shows no signs of Bitcoin movement for the electric car giant in the previous quarter. The report shows that the company has had a record-breaking quarter, with the best-ever production and deliveries and revenue approaching $25 billion in a single quarter, despite the current macroeconomic environment. Tesla Stands Firm On BTC Investment One important aspect of the report is the section on Tesla&#8217;s balance sheet, which shows the company&#8217;s holdings in digital assets, specifically Bitcoin (BTC). As of June 30, 2023, Tesla&#8217;s digital assets holdings stood at $184 million, which is the same amount as the previous quarter.  This indicates that the company has not sold any of its Bitcoin holdings, despite the recent volatility in the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Dogecoin Barks Upwards: Elon Musk’s Twitter Feed Sends DOGE Up 3% Tesla&#8217;s decision to hold onto its Bitcoin holdings is significant, as it shows the company&#8217;s confidence in the long-term potential of digital assets.  This is in line with Elon Musk&#8217;s previous statements about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, in which he has expressed support for their underlying technology and potential to transform the financial industry. Bitcoin Rebounds To $30,000 At present, the largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization and trading volume has surpassed the $30,000 threshold, recovering from its sharp decline to $29,400 on Tuesday.  Despite reaching a new yearly high of $31,800 on July 13th, Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish momentum suddenly dissipated, causing a retracement of over 1.6% in the last 14 days. However, the cryptocurrency has managed to maintain a 12% gain over the 30 days. In the event of further price drops and a failure to consolidate above the $30,000 mark, Bitcoin has the advantage of its 50-day Moving Average, which could serve as a strong support level at $29,100. However, sudden price movements have become increasingly common in recent months, following the thaw of the crypto winter.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Inflow Spikes, Is This Bearish? Typically, when Bitcoin experiences a price drop, it is followed by a period of consolidation. As long as BTC does not drop below its 50-day and 200-day Moving Averages, it can be seen as a short-term victory for Bitcoin bulls who have weathered another round of selling pressure. It remains to be seen whether BTC&#8217;s nearest support level will be able to hold and prevent another decline attempt.  Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

<p>One important aspect of the report is the section on Tesla&#8217;s balance sheet, which shows the company&#8217;s holdings in digital assets, specifically Bitcoin (BTC). As of June 30, 2023, Tesla&#8217;s digital assets holdings stood at $184 million, which is the same amount as the previous quarter. </p>

<p>This indicates that the company has not sold any of its Bitcoin holdings, despite the recent volatility in the cryptocurrency market.</p>

<p>Tesla&#8217;s decision to hold onto its Bitcoin holdings is significant, as it shows the company&#8217;s confidence in the long-term potential of digital assets. </p>
<p>This is in line with Elon Musk&#8217;s previous statements about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, in which he has expressed support for their underlying technology and potential to transform the financial industry.</p>
Bitcoin Rebounds To $30,000
<p>At present, the largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization and trading volume has surpassed the $30,000 threshold, recovering from its sharp decline to $29,400 on Tuesday. </p>
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/ilBYVuZc/" alt="Bitcoin " width="1814" height="858"/>
<p>Despite reaching a new yearly high of $31,800 on July 13th, Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish momentum suddenly dissipated, causing a retracement of over 1.6% in the last 14 days. However, the cryptocurrency has managed to maintain a 12% gain over the 30 days.</p>
<p>In the event of further price drops and a failure to consolidate above the $30,000 mark, Bitcoin has the advantage of its 50-day Moving Average, which could serve as a strong support level at $29,100.</p>
<p>However, sudden price movements have become increasingly common in recent months, following the thaw of the crypto winter. </p>

<p>Typically, when Bitcoin experiences a price drop, it is followed by a period of consolidation. As long as BTC does not drop below its 50-day and 200-day Moving Averages, it can be seen as a short-term victory for Bitcoin bulls who have weathered another round of selling pressure.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether BTC&#8217;s nearest support level will be able to hold and prevent another decline attempt. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Popular cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) experienced another price surge following a tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The dog-themed cryptocurrency saw a 4% jump just a few minutes after Musk&#8217;s post. Musk has previously supported DOGE on multiple occasions via his Twitter account, often posting memes and comments about the cryptocurrency. His tweets have been known to cause significant price movements in the market, with DOGE often surging by double-digit percentages following his endorsements. Musk&#8217;s Tweet Causes Another Dogecoin Surge, But Will It Be Short-Lived? Despite experiencing a surge in price following Elon Musk&#8217;s tweet, DOGE&#8217;s value remains considerably lower than its July high of $0.07518. At its peak, the cryptocurrency rose from $0.069 to $0.072 but soon lost some of its gains.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Has Broken This Open Interest Pattern, Quant Explains Currently, DOGE is trading around the $0.070 mark, at $0.0687 at the time of writing. Nonetheless, DOGE is still up by 3% in the 24-hour timeframe. It&#8217;s important to note that DOGE&#8217;s recent price movements have been encouraging. Despite being range-bound for the past two weeks, DOGE&#8217;s price has managed to maintain above its 200-day Moving Average (MA), which is a positive sign for the potential continuation of bullish momentum. In addition, DOGE&#8217;s average directional movement index (ADX) indicator is pointing towards another attempt to breach and regain its July high. The ADX is currently peaking to the upside, which indicates that the altcoin is gaining strength. Furthermore, DOGE&#8217;s Squeeze Momentum Indicator suggests that the cryptocurrency is entering another potential uptrend phase, which its ADX also supports. All these factors combined could help DOGE regain the $0.01 mark it reached in April. Nevertheless, despite its recent surge in price, DOGE may face challenges in maintaining its uptrend due to low trading volume. In addition, the cryptocurrency is expected to encounter significant resistance in the near term. If DOGE can sustain its uptrend, it will likely face challenges from the 50-day Moving Average (MA) currently at $0.07481. Furthermore, DOGE must overcome a resistance wall at $0.0752 to regain its July high. Related Reading: Ethereum Monthly Burn Surpasses 146,000 ETH As Total Clears $6.5 Billion According to Token Terminal data, DOGE&#8217;s market capitalization is $9.83 billion, with a circulating supply of tokens. Its fully diluted market capitalization is also $9.83 billion.  However, DOGE&#8217;s price-to-fully-diluted ratio (P/F ratio) is currently at an extremely high level of 16,006.25x, indicating that the cryptocurrency is trading at a premium relative to its fully diluted market capitalization. The P/F ratio has increased by 226.7% over the past 24 hours, suggesting that there may be increased demand for DOGE in the market. In conclusion, while DOGE&#8217;s recent surge in price can be attributed to Musk&#8217;s tweet, it remains to be seen whether it will continue to experience significant price movements in response to social media mentions and other media attention.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows the Bitcoin exchange inflow towards Binance has spiked during the past day, which may be bearish for the price. Bitcoin Exchange Inflow Has Registered A Large Spike As an analyst in a CryptoQuant post pointed out, a whale has made a large deposit to the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;exchange inflow,&#8221; which measures the total amount of Bitcoin that investors send to a specific centralized exchange (which, in this case, is Binance). When the value of this metric is high, it means that the holders are depositing large amounts to the platform right now. The investors may have made these transfers for selling-related purposes, depending on which type of exchange these inflows are for. Naturally, if that is the case, the price could feel a bearish effect from the inflows. On the other hand, low values imply the exchange in question isn&#8217;t receiving that many coins currently. Such a trend would imply that the market&#8217;s selling pressure may be low. Related Reading: Bitcoin Has Broken This Open Interest Pattern, Quant Explains Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange inflow for the cryptocurrency exchange Binance over the past day: The value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent hours &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange inflow for Binance has observed a rather large spike in the past day. With this deposit, around 4,451 BTC (approximately worth $133 million at the current exchange rate) has entered the platform&#8217;s wallets. Interestingly, this deposit has come from a whale that has bought 20,000 BTC over the last eight months, meaning that the investor still has over 15,000 BTC left in their wallet after the transaction. The whale may have made this transfer to take some profit at the current prices. Since the scale of the deposit is quite sizeable, it could potentially cause bearish ripples in the market. However, as another quant has explained, the deposits have been towards the derivatives side of the exchange and not the spot platform. Looks like the spot exchanges inflow hasn't moved today &#124; Source: CryptoQuant It would appear likely that the transfer hasn&#8217;t been made to sell the coins (at least not directly) but rather for opening positions on the derivatives market.

Such a large position can lead to volatility in the Bitcoin price, but unlike selling from spot deposits, this price action may not necessarily be bearish for the asset.

					<description><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency exchange OKX, has announced that its multichain wallet will now allow users to lock up and stake their Bitcoin (BTC) and BRC-20 tokens. This function is described as a token reward system for holders of Bitcoin and BRC-20 tokens. OKX Unveils Staking System On Multichain Wallet On Tuesday, OKX unveiled a new functionality on its multichain digital asset wallet, which enables users to stake Bitcoin (BTC) and BRC-20 tokens. According to the company&#8217;s media release, this token reward system is possible due to the integration of OKX&#8217;s open-source BRC20-S protocol.  Related Reading: Pre-Mined Ethereum Worth $116M Moves After 8 Years: Is A Major Price Dip Imminent? This protocol is an extended version of the BRC-20 standard that integrates functionalities for staking operations, like depositing, minting, and withdrawing. It allows users to earn BRC20-S tokens through the OKX Web3 DeFi aggregator. Furthermore, the BRC20-S protocol enables decentralized finance (DeFi) developers and projects to create staking pools on OKX Wallet. With these staking pools, Bitcoin holders and BRC-20 token holders can receive BRC20-S tokens. Additionally, this will help DeFi projects drive up user engagement and community-building efforts, according to OKX&#8217;s press statement. Jason Lau, OKX’s Chief Innovation Officer, claims that the wallet is the first multichain digital asset storage to support Bitcoin and BRC-20 token staking. “We have heard from OKX Wallet users that they want more opportunities to participate in the ecosystem, and we are thrilled to deliver that for them,” the CIO said. This staking capability comes as an addition to an existing host of Web3 Earn products on the OKX wallet. In the announcement, the company also mentioned the future introduction of complementary features, like a marketplace for selling BRC20-S tokens. OKX Wallet Announces Integration With Kava Blockchain In a separate announcement, OKX Wallet disclosed its partnership with Kava, an EVM-compatible blockchain built with Cosmos’ SDK (Software Development Kit). This integration will reportedly enrich the users’ options for digital asset transfer and transactions on the wallet. This represents another positive move by OKX Wallet in pursuit of maximum customer satisfaction as only a few days ago, the multichain wallet unveiled a partnership with PulseChain, another blockchain platform.

Despite these positive moves and collaborations, OKB, the utility token of the OKX ecosystem, has seen a negligible market performance. According to CoinGecko data, the token’s value has only increased by 0.3% in the last 24 hours, with a 0.7% dip in the past week. As of this writing, OKB is chasing hands at $43.14, with a daily trading volume of over $2.02 million. The token has a market cap of roughly $2.59 billion, making it the 29th-largest cryptocurrency in the industry.
