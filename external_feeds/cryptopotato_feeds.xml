			            <description><![CDATA[Uniswap had earlier invited community feedback to discuss potential areas of concern and opportunities for V4 improvement.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Uniswap Labs has shared some detail about its much-anticipated v4 release, which is currently undergoing active development. In a new post, the team behind the DeFi juggernaut Uniswap said it is thinking about the launch of the upcoming version in terms of three milestones.</p>
<p>If no security issues or delays with respect Cancun hard fork and audit process occur, V4 is likely to be launched later this year.</p>
<h2>Updates on Uniswap V4</h2>
<p>According to Uniswap Foundation&#8217;s governance lead, Erin Koen, the first step in the timeline includes publishing of protocol code which was achieved on June 13th. It involved the opening of the protocol repo for public view and contribution, a move meant to underscore Uniswap&#8217;s dedication to decentralization.</p>
<p>One of the main factors that V4&#8217;s <a href="https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-v4-and-the-dao/21626" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">launch</a> relies on is the completion of the audit process, which, in turn, depends on the successful integration of EIP-1153 into Ethereum&#8217;s Cancun. The upcoming upgrade is expected to occur in September-end.</p>
<p>Following Cancun, the devs will focus on an extensive auditing process of the v4 codebase before being deployed. The process is estimated to range anywhere between one to four months. Despite providing the timeline, Koen admitted,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The above timeline is purely indicative and it should be noted that the Cancun hard fork could be delayed, the audit process could be extended, and the protocol could be subjected to other security testing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>What’s New in V4?</h2>
<p>The V4 <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/uniswap-upgrades-to-v4-heres-whats-new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">upgrade</a> is expected to expand on the DEX&#8217;s coin-swapping capabilities by introducing &#8220;hooks&#8221; and custom liquidity pools. According to Uniswap Labs CEO Hayden Adams, hooks can be described as &#8220;plugins to customize how pools, swaps, fees, and LP positions interact.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new functionality aims to implement features such as on-chain limit orders and dynamic fees that might be accessible on more traditional exchange platforms but are not easy to bring in a blockchain setting that consists of no centralized infrastructures. Among other features, the pool creation cost on Uniswap v4 will also be slashed by 99% since all pools live within a single contract.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[In the Battle of the Bankruptcies, who will come out on top?
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to US Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane, Genesis, whose repayment plan was pending approval, will first have to resolve its outstanding issues with FTX.</p>
<p>The announcement came mere hours after Cameron Winklevoss’ <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cameron-winklevoss-issues-3-day-ultimatum-to-dcgs-barry-silbert-threatens-lawsuit/" data-wpel-link="internal">ultimatum</a> to DCG CEO Barry Silbert expired, meaning yet another lawsuit against Genesis’ parent company is also on the horizon. A response to said ultimatum, which would have forced DCG to stick to a repayment plan, may now be out of DCG&#8217;s control to begin with.</p>
<h2>Awfully Optimistic</h2>
<p>During a preliminary hearing concerning Genesis’ creditor repayment plan, Manhattan-based Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane stated that any further hearings regarding this proposal are likely to be delayed until the firm’ legal dispute with FTX was resolved, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-06/genesis-s-2-billion-spat-with-ftx-may-delay-creditor-payouts" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">according</a> to Bloomberg.</p>
<blockquote><p>“That schedule is looking awfully optimistic. My understanding is these deadlines were likely to slip.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However, a final ruling on the payment plan is still not out of the question. The two parties proposed “duel procedures” in order to settle FTX’s claim, a request that was denied by Judge Lane.</p>
<p>Also rejected by the judge were a second request from FTX to sue Genesis in a Delaware court and another from the former for a hearing to decide whether the claim is legitimate in the first place.</p>
<h2>Right to Confidentiality</h2>
<p>Genesis’ debt to FTX has been outright denied by the company in earlier hearings with Judge Lane, who outright <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/genesis-judge-denies-ftxs-bid-to-participate-in-confidential-mediation-sessions-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">refused</a> access to its confidential mediation sessions to the exchange&#8217;s legal counsel.</p>
<blockquote><p>“There will be a certain amount of radio silence because mediation needs that to work. Shortening the mediation does not shorten the case.”</p></blockquote>
<p>FTX originally claimed that Genesis owed it nearly $4 billion, a claim which has since been revised to only $2 billion. This, in turn, indicates that FTX is overestimating the scope of its business deal with its fellow crypto lending platform at best and simply grasping at straws at worst. As far as Genesis is concerned, FTX “is entitled to claims totaling $0.00.”</p>
<p>Judge Lane has ordered the two platforms to exchange information regarding the alleged debt and to report back at a later date. Until then, the court will refrain from ruling on whether FTX is even allowed to sue Genesis in the first place.</p>
<p>Once the parties have exchanged the necessary information, the court may schedule the hearing requested by Genesis regarding the size of its debt to FTX – assuming it exists in the first place.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the crypto landscape continues to change, recent days have seen Bitcoin ($BTC), along with several other cryptos, experience a notable downturn.</p>
<p>This downturn has caused ripples of concern throughout the market, with many traders now pondering whether the bullish momentum is over for now.</p>
<p>However, despite the slump, several new tokens are emerging, offering a silver lining.</p>
<h2>Red Week for Crypto As Bitcoin Price Stumbles</h2>
<p>It’s been a difficult week for crypto traders thus far, with most major coins and tokens experiencing a significant selloff.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has seen its price drop 4% in the past day – and has now closed in the red for three days in a row.</p>
<p>This surprise turnaround in fortunes comes after a period of sustained momentum for $BTC, which saw the coin’s price soar by 27% over the past month.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259378" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6.jpg" alt="Picture6" width="602" height="287" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-300x143.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>However, this bullish momentum appears to have been halted, with $BTC struggling to surpass the crucial $31,000 level.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, $BTC is retesting $30,000 – a vital psychological level that has often served as support and resistance in previous market cycles.</p>
<p>If it fails to hold, further downward momentum could be on the cards.</p>
<h2>Market Uncertainty Dampens Crypto Enthusiasm</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s not just Bitcoin experiencing a price dip – major altcoins like Ethereum ($ETH) are also seeing the bears take control.</p>
<p>The $ETH price has dipped over 5% from Monday’s high, with the token now trading around the $1,860 level.</p>
<p>A quick glance at the Coin360 <a href="https://coin360.com/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">heatmap</a> shows a sea of red, with big hitters like Ripple ($XRP) and Binance Coin ($BNB) also experiencing a sharp price drop.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture7-1.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259377" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture7-1.jpg" alt="Picture7" width="602" height="279" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture7-1.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture7-1-300x139.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture7-1-50x23.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>It appears that uncertainty is rippling throughout the crypto market following the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d3b06ad6-6b96-42bb-9fac-ebe1b8dc7fa6" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">release</a> of the Federal Reserve’s FOMC meeting minutes, which indicate that another rate hike could be in the works for July.</p>
<p>This is bearish news for the crypto market since higher interest rates can make riskier assets, like cryptocurrencies, less attractive to investors.</p>
<p>As a result, investor funds may be redirected towards “safer” financial instruments and away from cryptos, leading to a broad decline in coin/token values.</p>
<p>Despite the current headwinds, many traders still hope for a rebound – although time will tell whether they&#8217;re correct in their predictions.</p>
<h2>Which Tokens Are Traders Still Bullish On?</h2>
<p>However, it’s not all doom and gloom in the crypto market, with several new projects gaining traction and turning heads.</p>
<p>Two of these projects are Wall Street Memes and Thug Life, which are gearing up for major exchange listings once their respective presales conclude.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Memes Gears Up for Major CEX Listings &amp; Hits $13.2m Presale Raise</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=bitcoin-price-other-major-cryptos-are-stalling-but-traders-remain-bullish-on-these-tokens" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes ($WSM)</a> is a new meme token that aims to capture the spirit of the r/WallStreetBets subreddit and the GameStop saga, where retail investors challenged the big hitters on Wall Street.</p>
<p>The $WSM token is community-driven and aims to reward holders for showing faith in the Wall Street Memes brand – which is backed by over 1.1 million people worldwide.</p>
<p>Wall Street Memes’ scale can be traced to the success of the <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/wall-street-bulls" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall St Bulls NFT</a> collection, which launched in 2021 and sold out in 32 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture8-1.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259376" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture8-1.jpg" alt="Picture8" width="602" height="179" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture8-1.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture8-1-300x89.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture8-1-50x15.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>The collection’s popularity has prompted the creators to turn their attention to the crypto market, launching $WSM and hoping to capitalize on the ongoing meme coin craze.</p>
<p>This decision already appears to be bearing fruit, with high-profile names like <a href="https://twitter.com/RealCryptoJamie" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Crypto Jamie</a> opting to join the project as a brand ambassador.</p>
<p>Wall Street Memes is now in Stage 21 out of 30 during its presale phase, which has already raised $13.2 million.</p>
<p>Investors who get in early can purchase $WSM tokens at the appealing price of just $0.031.</p>
<p>While the exact price for the intended CEX listing remains undisclosed, it&#8217;s anticipated that the currently-offered price will be a discount on the eventual listing price.</p>

<h2>Thug Life Aims to Be “Baller’s Meme Coin” &amp; Raises $600,000 in One Week</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b_thuglife_33357?referrer=bitcoin-price-other-major-cryptos-are-stalling-but-traders-remain-bullish-on-these-tokens" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Thug Life ($THUG)</a> is another new meme token that many believe is set to explode in the crypto market.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, Thug Life is a project that embraces a bold and edgy persona in the world of finance – setting it apart from most other low-cap cryptos.</p>
<p>Thug Life’s branding features a variety of well-known memes and celebrities, including Snoop Dogg and Pepe the Frog, which looks set to appeal to a broad demographic of retail investors.</p>
<p>Not only that, but Thug Life’s team encourages investors to adopt a “gangsta” attitude and “pimp out” their money game.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture9-1.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259375" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture9-1.jpg" alt="Picture9" width="602" height="301" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture9-1.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture9-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture9-1-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>As these statements highlight, Thug Life aims to fuel a community-driven movement through humor and trolling – an approach that seems to be working, given the huge influx of new members to the official <a href="https://t.me/thuglifetoken" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Telegram channel</a>.</p>
<p>Like Wall Street Memes, Thug Life is in its presale phase, which has already raised over $600,000 in just one week.</p>
<p>The presale price of $THUG is $0.0007, fixed for the duration of the offering, ensuring that early investors can secure their tokens at a stable price.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin recorded more than 15 million Ordinals inscriptions. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin maximalists have proved to be highly staunch supporters of the crypto asset. For more than a decade, they have stayed as a united front, but the advent of Ordinals shook up the long-standing narrative. 2023 will be known for many things, one of them being &#8211; the Bitcoin community&#8217;s split into two warring factions.</p>
<p>The first cohort are Ordinals skeptics and supporters of &#8220;staying true&#8221; to Bitcoin &#8211; using the asset purely to process transactions. The second cohort is Ordinals fans. Both groups have compelling arguments to back up their case, but Vitalik Buterin believes Bitcoin Ordinals&#8217; booming popularity has helped revive the developers of the network.</p>
<h2>Vitalik Buterin Praises Ordinals</h2>
<p>While addressing a July 7 Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1DXxyvDYZqgKM" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Space</a> with Eric Wall and Udi Wertheimer, the Ethereum founder said Ordinals are starting to revive a &#8220;culture of actually doing things,&#8221; which, according to him, feels like a &#8220;real pushback to the laser-eye movement.&#8221; He believes this trend is good for the overall ecosystem.</p>
<p>The Ordinals protocol enabled NFTs on the Bitcoin network. Until then, Ethereum dominated the NFT scene. Hence, it can be said that Ordinals played a crucial role in changing the dynamic by bringing NFT creators from Ethereum to Bitcoin. This influx of new developers triggered the transaction fees on the network to soar.</p>
<p>Buterin, however, lauded the BRC-20 token standard and said its increasing prominence signals an outright abandonment of &#8220;stagnant&#8221; politics that he believes to be plaguing the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Ordinals&#8217; Explosive Year</h2>
<p>The latest <a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/state-of-the-dapp-industry-in-q2-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">stats</a> show that Bitcoin Ordinals trading volume rose by 2,834% from Q1 to Q2 of 2023, hitting an astonishing $210.7 million. All-time trades accounted for 554,215 across 150,969 unique traders, suggesting an increasing user interest who are keen on exploring new types of digital assets.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Bitcoin sports over 15 million Ordinals inscriptions at writing time, as per Dune Analytics <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">data</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a Bitcoin Ordinals proposal was released to slash inscription costs by 90%. Ordinals launchpad platform Luminex <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-ordinals-proposal-to-reduce-inscription-costs-by-90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">proposed</a> a new standard &#8211; BRC69 &#8211; that brings new on-chain features, such as &#8220;pre-reveal collection launching and on-chain reveals,&#8221; in addition to reducing inscription costs.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Deaton said the class action was the least of Ripple's worries. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John Deaton, crypto lawyer and legal representative of XRP holders in the lawsuit between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has disclosed that a recent class action brought against the company would most likely be made void if the firm wins the case.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1676589373226115073?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">tweet</a>, Deaton said the class action was the least of Ripple&#8217;s worries.</p>
<h2>Ripple&#8217;s Win in SEC Case to Nullify Class Action</h2>
<p>The class action in question was granted certification by Judge Phyllis Hamilton of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on June 30. The class suit <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/securities-law/ripple-labs-crypto-investors-get-class-status-in-securities-suit" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">alleges</a> that Ripple Labs, its CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and its subsidiary XRP II engaged in a scheme to raise hundreds of millions of dollars through sales of XRP to retail investors.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs accused the defendants of violating registration provisions of state and federal securities laws through the sale of the crypto asset, which has been tagged unregistered security.</p>
<p>While Garlinghouse and Ripple Labs challenged the certification, Judge Hamilton ruled that the class action met the four requirements to be certified. Ripple&#8217;s argument was based on the plaintiffs&#8217; failure to show that they would protect the interests of the class, as several proposed members disagreed on the premise of the suit.</p>
<p>One such member is Bradley Sostack, who made purchases in the secondary market, making his case subject to unique defenses, according to Ripple.</p>
<p>In response, Hamilton disclosed that the plaintiffs had clarified that individual issues would remain secondary to common class ones, and the standard opt-out procedure would remedy any disagreements over the premise of the suit.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Deaton said the plaintiffs&#8217; attorneys should hope the SEC loses in its lawsuit <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-v-sec-case-update-the-latest-developments-as-of-june-27th/" data-wpel-link="internal">against</a> Ripple, as the agency would set up a fund to pay XRP holders if the reverse becomes the case, thereby invalidating the class action.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Class Suit Only Concerns U.S. Investors</span></h2>
<p>On the other hand, if Ripple wins, Deaton believes Hamilton would follow Judge Analisa Torres&#8217; decision on XRP not being a security. Either way, the class suit will be invalidated when the SEC-Ripple case ends.</p>
<p>In response to an inquiry about offshore XRP holders, the crypto lawyer <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1676612189254299648?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">noted</a> that regulators in the U.K., Japan, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) do not recognize XRP as a security. Hence, the lawsuit applies only to U.S. investors.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[AI needs automated blockchain-based digital payment systems, according to Hayes.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Arthur Hayes, the co-founder and former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, believes bitcoin (BTC) will be chosen by artificial intelligence (AI) as the currency for their economic activities in the future.</p>
<p>In a lengthy Substack <a href="https://cryptohayes.substack.com/p/massa" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">essay</a> posted on July 7, the American entrepreneur laid out reasons for his belief, presenting arguments and conclusions to prove that the traditional financial system is unsustainable for AI-powered economies.</p>
<h2>The AI Currency Choice</h2>
<p>Hayes’ arguments were based on the financial needs of AI machines and their critical inputs. He compared the monetary attributes of gold, fiat, and bitcoin, evaluating their importance to an AI machine.</p>
<p>Addressing the financial needs of AI, Hayes postulated that such machines would need to use a blockchain-based digital payments system that is available at all times and completely automated. The traditional banking system, which mostly functions when humans are awake and is divided between geographies, would not be a good fit.</p>
<p>A blockchain-based system, with its rules outlined in clear and transparent code, would enable AI machines to pay their data providers and receive the same for their services.</p>
<h2>A Good Fit</h2>
<p>For any currency to be fit for AI-powered economies, Hayes explained that they must have a finite supply, be censorship-resistant, and possess energy purchasing power.</p>
<p>While gold has a finite supply on earth, the BitMEX co-founder insisted it has an unknown quantity off-world. Since the bullion is a physical commodity, the only way to use its digital representation is to trust a centralized entity to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/texas-lawmakers-propose-a-gold-backed-digital-currency/" data-wpel-link="internal">issue</a> a gold digital certificate; hence it is not censorship resistant. In addition, the value of gold can not be defined by one energy derivative, as the asset can be created through various sources.</p>
<p>Conversely, fiat has an infinite supply in its physical and digital forms, as governments control its <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/arthur-hayes-expects-the-us-to-start-printing-again-bullish-for-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">issuance</a>. The centralized oversight makes the currency censorship non-resistant, and its value is placed more on the politics of the government than its natural energy wealth.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/goldman-sachs-acknowledged-bitcoin-as-the-best-performer-in-2023/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a> has a finite supply of 21 million coins. However, due to its decentralized network, the asset is purely digital and censorship-resistant. Since new bitcoins can only be created via computers, the cost of electricity defines its value over time.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Bitcoin is thus the logical currency choice for any AI. It is purely digital, censorship resistant, provably scarce, and its intrinsic value is completely electricity-cost-dependent. There is nothing in existence today that comes close to challenging Bitcoin on these aspects,” Hayes stated.</p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange Gemini has filed a lawsuit against Digital Currency Group (DCG) – the owner of the institutional crypto lending company Genesis – for committing “fraud” against the exchange’s customers.</p>

<li>
<blockquote><p>“Those were lies,” the filing states &#8220;As it turned out, Genesis was recklessly lending huge amounts to a counterparty that Defendants knew was using these huge amounts to fuel a risky arbitrage trading strategy.”</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>Gemini is seeking relief including actual damages, punitive damages, and attorney’s fees.</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>“DCG — and Barry personally – are direct participants in the fraud that has damaged Gemini and hundreds of thousands of Earn users,” said Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss over Twitter on Friday. “This complaint is an important step in holding them accountable for what they have done.”</p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[The recent spot BTC ETF applications have had positive effects on the asset's price, but also on Grayscale's largest fund. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are arguably the hottest topic in the cryptocurrency community for the past few weeks, a trend that was only solidified during the last several days.</p>
<p>Recall that the SEC deemed all recent filings as &#8220;inadequate&#8221; last Friday, which put a major shade on all applications on whether they will be added to the growing list of rejections made by the securities regulator.</p>
<p>However, all companies reacted swiftly and refiled with more &#8220;adequate&#8221; information, mostly regarding their strategies on how to tackle potential market manipulation. BlackRock was among those, as it <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-stock-surges-12-as-blackrock-names-it-as-surveillance-partner/" data-wpel-link="internal">named</a> Coinbase as its surveillance partner.</p>
<p>Somewhat expectedly, these events affected BTC&#8217;s price movements. The asset slumped hard following the SEC&#8217;s warning last week from over $31,000 to $29,500 to chart a 10-day high. Nevertheless, the defiance of BlackRock and the other financial giants and their refilings sent the cryptocurrency north once again.</p>
<p>This resulted in BTC spiking to $31,500 mid-week, which was a new 13-month high. Yet, it failed there and fell hard to under $30,000 on Thursday. As of now, though, bitcoin has been able to reclaim that round-numbered milestone and trades just over it at the end of the week.</p>
<p>On a weekly scale, there are several notable gainers, including MKR (20%), FLOW (17%), FIL (16%), GRT (15%), and FXS (15%).</p>
<p>In terms of weekly price losses, APE leads the way with a 13% decline, followed by XLM (-11%), LEO (-10%), and FTM (-10%).</p>

<p><strong>GBTC Discount Narrows to 27% for the First Time Since May 2022, Here’s Why</strong>.

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As meme coins continue to shake up the crypto market, two tokens are seizing the spotlight.</p>
<p>Pepe 2.0 ($PEPE2.0) and Shib2.0 ($SHIB2.0) are witnessing an impressive upsurge, reflecting the growing interest in “2.0 tokens”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Wall Street Memes ($WSM), another trending token, is piquing traders’ curiosity – with many speculating that it could be the next big winner in the meme coin space.</p>
<h2>Pepe 2.0’s Spectacular Surge Outshines Meme Coin Rivals</h2>
<p>It’s been an incredible week for Pepe 2.0 investors, with the token’s price hitting an all-time high of $0.0000002219 just hours ago, per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-2-0/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>$PEPE2.0 is up a whopping 1,000% in the past five days, laying to bed the idea that it was just another copycat crypto with no price potential.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pepe-2-0" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CoinGecko</a>, over $61.6 million worth of $PEPE2.0 was traded in the past 24 hours – higher than FLOKI ($FLOKI) and Volt Inu ($VOLT).</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-7.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259311" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-7.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="284" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-7.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-7-300x142.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-7-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Excitingly for early investors, the current price momentum shows no signs of slowing down, hinting that those who missed out on the initial bull run might have another chance to ride the wave.</p>
<p>Moreover, the fact that $PEPE2.0 is now available on an array of CEXs has significantly boosted its accessibility, enabling a larger pool of investors to enter the market.</p>
<p>This wider exposure, combined with the ongoing bullish trend, is priming $PEPE2.0 for further price appreciation – making it one to watch in the days ahead.</p>
<h2>Shib2.0 Mirrors Pepe 2.0’s Bull Run &amp; Explodes in Value</h2>
<p>While Pepe 2.0 has been stealing the limelight, it&#8217;s not the only meme coin making waves.</p>
<p>The Shiba Inu sequel, dubbed Shib2.0 ($SHIB2.0), is also producing impressive gains for early investors.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xe1de07566ceb19d2e45b60b491776ab74c9b8d7a" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">DEXTools.io</a>, the $SHIB2.0 price is up an incredible 1,773% in the past day, making it one of the biggest gainers on the site.</p>

<p>Moreover, the number of token holders has grown to 4,250, while nearly 15,000 wallet transactions have been completed already.</p>
<p>The token’s market cap has even breached $14 million – all in the space of 24 hours.</p>
<p>The meteoric rise of Shib2.0 is a testament to the dynamic nature of the meme coin sector, where new projects can witness exponential growth in just a matter of hours.</p>
<p>This explosive start underlines $SHIB2.0’s potential – solidifying it as a promising new contender in the market.</p>
<h2>Can These Meme Coins Be the Next to Explode?</h2>
<p>While Pepe 2.0 and Shib2.0 are certainly fascinating case studies in the meme coin space, another contender is vying for traders&#8217; attention.</p>
<p>That contender is Wall Street Memes, a project sparking immense buzz in the crypto market.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Memes Looks Ready for Takeoff After Raising $13.1m</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=pepe-2-0-and-shib-2-0-continue-to-surge-while-traders-think-wall-street-memes-could-be-next-to-explode" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes ($WSM)</a> is a brand-new entrant to the meme coin market, one that blends humor with serious investment potential.</p>
<p>Aiming to capture the excitement that meme coin investing brings, Wall Street Memes presents itself as a lighthearted project for those that enjoy internet culture.</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from the r/WallStreetBets movement, the project’s creators have developed the $WSM token to allow community members to gain financial exposure to the brand’s growth.</p>
<p>This approach is bearing fruit, with the Wall Street Bets <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Telegram channel</a> seeing an explosion of new members in the past few weeks.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-8.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259312" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-8.jpg" alt="" width="602" height="300" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-8.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-8-300x150.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-8-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Not only that, but Wall Street Memes’ ongoing presale has also been an instant hit – and has now raised a remarkable $13.1 million.</p>
<p>With the presale in Stage 21 out of 30, $WSM is set to hit the open market soon, with the team hinting at Tier-1 CEX listings and influencer collaborations.</p>
<p>Interestingly, these collaborations have already started, with Twitter personality <a href="https://twitter.com/RealCryptoJamie" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Crypto Jamie</a> joining the team as a brand ambassador.</p>
<p>The final ambassador slot has been marked as &#8220;Coming Soon,&#8221; – sparking anticipation among investors about who this key figure could be.</p>
<p>Overall, the signs are undoubtedly promising for Wall Street Memes, meaning it could be a stellar second half of 2023 for the project.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[While CZ has offered assistance, Binance will continue with its decision to end deposit and withdrawal support for several Multichain-bridged tokens. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the CEO and founder of leading crypto exchange Binance, announced that his company&#8217;s users, assets, and platform were unaffected by the recent hack on the cross-chain router protocol Multichain.</p>
<p>The Binance boss <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1677188504365809665" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">tweeted</a> that the exchange had finalized all asset swaps and closed deposits a while before the incident occurred.</p>
<h2>Binance Unaffected by Multichain Exploit</h2>
<p>On July 6, Multichain experienced abnormal outflows from its bridge contracts to an unknown address, stirring rumors about a multimillion-dollar exploit. While the transfer&#8217;s reason is unknown, the Multichain team has asked users to revoke all approvals related to its contracts.</p>
<p>On-chain data shared in a tweet by blockchain security firm PeckShield <a href="https://t.co/D4GKGpuBtw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">showed</a> several transactions on the Multichain Fantom bridge. Approximately $58 million in USD Coin (USDC), $13.6 million in wrapped Ether (WETH), and $31 million in wrapped bitcoins (WBTC) were moved from the Fantom bridge&#8217;s Ethereum contract.</p>
<p>In addition, about $5.9 million and $666,000 were withdrawn from the Multichain <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x10c6b61dbf44a083aec3780acf769c77be747e23#tokentxns" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Moonriver</a> and <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x55f089d5f6aedfdacbd5e3acb0e8f31fbab44088" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Dogechain</a> bridge contracts on Ethereum, leaving only $100,000 and $700,000 worth of assets on each respective bridge.</p>
<p>Altogether, more than $109 million were moved from Multichain&#8217;s MPC address containing the platform&#8217;s lockup assets. To mitigate the losses, Multichain also <a href="https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1677096839731097600?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">asked</a> all users to stop using its services as an investigation into the incident is ongoing.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The lockup assets on the Multichain MPC address have been moved to an unknown address abnormally. The team is not sure what happened and is currently investigating. It is recommended that all users suspend the use of Multichain services and revoke all contract approvals related to Multichain,&#8221; the team said.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Binance Ceases Support for Multichain Tokens</h2>
<p>While CZ has offered assistance in helping with the situation, Binance continues with its decision to end deposit and withdrawal support for several Multichain-bridged tokens.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/updates-on-the-suspension-of-deposits-withdrawals-for-multichain-bridged-tokens-3c7d279dd37043bd8290ac718b5c08a4" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">disclosed</a> its decision to cease support for the Multichain-bridged tokens on July 5, following complaints about delayed transactions on the protocol. The exchange initially <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1661649462387957760?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">suspended</a> deposits for the affected tokens in May due to uncertainty surrounding the Multichain protocol.</p>
<p>Rumors have spread about the protocol&#8217;s management team being arrested in Shanghai after the CEO went missing. While speculations are unconfirmed, Multichain developers <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/gate-io-dispels-rumors-about-its-demise-amid-multichain-fiasco/" data-wpel-link="internal">disclosed</a> that the CEO&#8217;s disappearance left them without access to the platform&#8217;s servers, hence, the transaction delays.</p>
