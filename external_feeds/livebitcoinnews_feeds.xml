										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The nation of Pakistan has issued a <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2023/05/207337-crypto-ban-pakistan-is-reportedly-drafting-legislation-to-prohibit-cryptocurrency-transactions/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">warning that it’s going</a> to look into potentially banning crypto.</p>
<h2>Will Pakistan End All Crypto Activity?</h2>
<p>The news came by way of Pakistan Minister of State for Finance and Revenue Aisha Ghaus Pasha, who said in a recent Senate session that his country has no interest in legalizing crypto trading at any point. Right now, this is all widely speculative, and nothing is set in stone. In addition, the statements are coming from political officials, who change their minds as often as you might eat breakfast.</p>
<p>At the same time, if Pakistan were to move forward and ban all crypto trading and related activity, it would likely have atrocious effects on the country. One of the most devastating outcomes would be that Pakistan would easily fall behind when it comes to technological advancements.</p>
<p>Right now, blockchain is exploding like it never has before. There are also many countries and continents doing all they can to ensure crypto regulation is in place so that people can at least remain protected if they’re going to engage in crypto investing.</p>
<p>For example, the European Union (EU) has just passed a string of regulations <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/european-union-passes-heavy-string-of-new-crypto-regulations/" data-wpel-link="internal">known as MiCA designed</a> to ensure all crypto trading is clear, safe, and straightforward in European nations. While the framework isn’t necessarily perfect and leaves a lot of stones unturned, it is at least a step in the right direction, and there will probably be changes and additions made to these regulations in the coming future.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, it’s likely that people are going to engage in crypto trading anyway, whether the government allows them to or not. The fact is that Pakistan is still considered a developing nation, and thus the introduction of crypto could arguably aid the nation from a financial perspective like it could all Middle Eastern regions.</p>
<p>If regulators are to get in the way of innovation like this, the country will suffer because people who are looking to trade either way will not be protected as they do so. Furthermore, the nation is likely to fall behind regions such as the EU, which have accepted that crypto is a staple of the future and are moving forward with rules that will allow easier integration and practices.</p>
<h2>Who Supports This?</h2>
<p>Pasha’s comments are currently receiving support from other regulatory bodies in the country including the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and its director Sohail Jawad. Pasha also stated that banning crypto was one of the requirements established by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Currently, the FATF has not officially acted upon this, suggesting – at least in Pasha’s eyes – that the agency hasn’t done its job.</p>
<p>Some countries – like China – have already <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-crypto-mining-clampdown-in-china-is-not-over/" data-wpel-link="internal">taken measures</a> to ensure all crypto activity is banned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jerome Powell – the man at the head of the table in the Federal Reserve chambers – is getting ready to offer what many <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-in-stasis-below-27k-ahead-of-powell-speech/ar-AA1bpvB8" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">analysts call another hawkish</a> speech, and they’re concerned about what his words could do to bitcoin and the rest of the crypto industry.</p>
<h2>The Federal Reserve is at It Again</h2>
<p>Over the past year or so, every time the Federal Reserve does anything, bitcoin seems to get affected. In 2022, for example, the Federal Reserve regularly <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-fed-bitcoins-worst-enemy-right-now/" data-wpel-link="internal">hiked interest rates</a> as a means of fighting ongoing, record-high inflation in America.</p>
<p>These rate hikes didn’t really do much in terms of lowering the surging prices the nation was seeing. However, they <em>did</em> cause crypto prices to tank like they never had before. Also, with so many working-class people unable to afford the interest, they were instantly cut out of the American dream and could no longer get their hands on cars, homes, or items that would require loans as part of the purchasing process.</p>
<p>Right now, Powell hasn’t even given the speech yet, and already we’re seeing bitcoin take a few dips here and there. Shortly after the event was announced, bitcoin fell into the high $26,000 range. Prior to that, it had been trading for about $27,000 per unit. Marc Chandler – chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex – commented in a recent market update:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hawkish comments from Fed officials and the first decline in continuing unemployment claims below 1.8 million in two months boosted U.S. rates, and the odds of a… rate hike rose to about 37 percent. This represents a near tripling of the probability in the past week.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is also wide speculation that the Federal Reserve will hike rates again if Congress cannot come to an agreement on the present issue surrounding the debt ceiling. Janet Yellen – the current Treasury Secretary – has <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/how-janet-yellen-and-the-debt-ceiling-are-making-btc-look-good/" data-wpel-link="internal">warned that if the debt</a> ceiling isn’t raised, the U.S. is going to run out of money and become a bankrupt nation.</p>
<p>Right now, the nation is facing $31 trillion in debt, and House republicans – led by Speaker Kevin McCarthy – have stated that pushing things higher will result in far too much debt falling onto the shoulders of American taxpayers, and they’re reluctant to do as Yellen asks.</p>
<h2>More Rate Hikes Coming?</h2>
<p>Granted no agreement is made, some – such as Craig Shapiro of La Duc Trading – believe the Fed may step in. Shapiro said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Seems like Powell needs to take the rate hike odds up again today in order to be prepared to go again… if the debt ceiling debacle is tabled for a short-term resolution. Data remains too good right now with the SEP likely to show a lower YE23 U rate and higher PCE, both of which suggest the dots for 24 are way too low.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man in Aurora, Colorado has been accused of <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/aurora-man-accused-of-9-million-cryptocurrency-theft/ar-AA1ble3a" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stealing roughly $9 million</a> in crypto funds. 31-year-old Mark Shin has been charged with <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/theft/" data-wpel-link="internal">theft</a>, cybercrime, and money laundering at the time of writing for allegedly taking part in a scheme back in April of 2020 through his home computer.</p>
<h2>Mark Shin: Stealer or Advantage Taker?</h2>
<p>Shin is believed to have noticed an “unintended vulnerability in the revision 9 update” of the ICON Nation cryptocurrency. Instead of reporting this to ICON Foundation/Nation, court documents allege that Shin took part in a scheme that ultimately drained the network and made him an instant digital millionaire. The documents state:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shin changed the vote/select delegate function 558 times over an 11-hour period to mint unauthorized ICX. From his personal computer, Shin minted and stole from the ICON Nation approximately 13,924,045 unauthorized ICX, which was roughly the equivalent of approximately $8,988,406.00 U.S. dollars at the time of the attack.</p></blockquote>
<p>Chris Decker, a defense attorney, issued the following statement regarding his feelings on the case:</p>
<blockquote><p>I love this case. I think it’s fascinating.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shin is arguing that he did not engage in thievery, but rather saw a “golden opportunity” and chose to take advantage. Decker said of the matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Shin utilized the code that was written by this cryptocurrency to create his own mint or mint his own currency. So, he wasn’t taking property of another. He was creating new currency.</p></blockquote>
<p>George Brachler – legal analyst and former 18th Judicial District attorney – said this case is baffling and nothing like what he’s ever seen in nearly 30 years of serving the law. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve only been doing this (legal work) [for] 28 years. I’ve never seen a case quite like this.</p></blockquote>
<p>He was also quick to say that he doesn’t think Shin’s argument of just trying to mint a new currency is going to be successful. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t think it will because he acts guilty. I mean, this guy doesn’t act like what he’s doing is above board. He creates a bunch of different accounts. He tries to take the cryptocurrency that he has ‘minted’ and sends it around to other crypto wallets to try to disguise who’s the owner and how much he has.</p></blockquote>
<p>Prosecutors are claiming that Shin used a spinning service called Tornado Cash to move all the money into other wallets to disguise where they originated from. Tornado Cash, at the time of writing, has been used to launder at least $7 billion. Shin said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fact that I moved the money immediately after that is of no consequence to the fact that I minted it, and I didn’t steal it.</p></blockquote>
<h2>This Argument May Not Work</h2>
<p>Decker finished with:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think that this act undermines a general concern that people don’t quite understand how these programs work.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Something strange happened towards the latter half of May this year. While <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a> and Ethereum – two of the largest and most mainstream digital currencies – were taking price dips, altcoins – like XRP (Ripple) and Litecoin – <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/litecoin-xrp-and-other-altcoins-rise-wednesday-as-blue-chip-bitcoin-hits-a-lull/ar-AA1bk5EH" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">were exploding</a>.</p>
<h2>Altcoins Rose Last May While BTC Suffered</h2>
<p>During that time, Litecoin and Ripple endured price hikes of about five percent each, while others – like Sandbox – rose by as much as four percent. Axie also saw its price shoot up by a whopping eight percent. These numbers may not seem like much, but it’s unusual and interesting that this would happen, as these currencies often need to see bitcoin go up before they can follow suit.</p>
<p>The fact that they were able to travel in an entirely different price direction suggests that maybe the correlation between these assets and something larger like their daddy bitcoin are starting to thin out.</p>
<p>Some analysts believe this may have been the start of what they’re calling an “altcoin season.” This is typically when people (traders, investors, etc.) start to shift some of their attention away from larger, mainstream tokens like BTC and focus on smaller assets. As a result, these coins endure certain price hikes on a temporary basis, while some of the larger ones sink deeper into oblivion.</p>
<p>Still, the idea remains amongst many retail traders that bitcoin and Ethereum are “flight-to-safety” tokens, meaning that should things go wrong with the smaller tokens they invest in, they can always sell and allocate more of their wealth and portfolios to the latter two, thus bringing their statuses higher and giving themselves more stability.</p>
<p>One might assume that so long as bitcoin is there for them to enjoy, these investors feel safe enough to try other smaller coins out. Noelle Acheson – author of the “Crypto is Macro Now” newsletter – said that despite all this, volatility remains a problem in the industry at press time. She commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like macro markets, juggling resilient stock prices with increasingly bleak economic data points, the crypto market is also dealing with duality. There are some signs of frothiness.</p></blockquote>
<p>She also mentioned that despite the traction surrounding the mentioned altcoins, activity remains relatively low for these and other less-known digital currencies, and that in the long term, prices are still down and haven’t quite recovered from the 2022 bear market. She commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>In spite of these hints of froth, activity is low. Prices are down more than ten percent on the month, and volumes are trending lower.</p></blockquote>
<h2>BTC Is Not in the Best Place</h2>
<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum are also largely down despite small price jumps over the past five months.</p>
<p>BTC, for example, was trading in the mid-$16K range at the end of 2022. At the time of writing, the asset has moved into the $27K region, though this doesn’t compare to the $68,000 all-time high it achieved two Novembers ago.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kevin O’Leary of “Shark Tank” fame is worried about how the U.S. <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/cryptocurrency/stablecoins/bitcoin-miami-kevin-oleary-are-stablecoins-the-future-of-investment-funds" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">government is dealing with</a> crypto regulation. He says the federal government is less concerned about policy and more concerned with taking fast action, and this is coming back to hurt innovation.</p>
<h2>Kevin O&#8217;Leary: All the U.S. Needs is Policy</h2>
<p>Right now, he says policy is all the U.S. needs when it comes to crypto. He commented that the government doesn’t need to do anything fancy or special. It just needs to implement the right rules to ensure the industry is safe and sound for all. O’Leary stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not looking for the federal government to provide innovation. I&#8217;m looking for them to provide policy. We don&#8217;t need them to develop anything. What we&#8217;ll do is license multiple stable coins, all backed by the U.S. dollar, and let them compete in the market.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also said he thinks it’s very important that more action be taken to ensure all crypto companies are running on clean energy. This is an attitude he’s held for quite some time, going so far as to say a few years back that he would cease <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/report-bitcoin-mining-may-require-more-energy-than-180-countries/" data-wpel-link="internal">buying any crypto mined</a> in China given the country’s poor history with renewable energy (this was long before the country <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-crypto-mining-clampdown-in-china-is-not-over/" data-wpel-link="internal">outlawed crypto and</a> mining activity).</p>
<p>O’Leary was adamant that if crypto companies continued to walk the path that they’ve been walking over the past several years, the planet is going to suffer heavily. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have to listen to these people and realize we can&#8217;t mine coins using carbon offsets. We&#8217;ve got to go hydro; we&#8217;ve got to go nuclear. I am so glad I had to sell every share I had in a company that uses carbon offsets, because I see the writing on the wall and it&#8217;s not pretty.</p></blockquote>
<p>O’Leary isn’t the only person that has this attitude. Over the years, several reports have been written and published suggesting that crypto mining now utilizes more energy than most third-world or developing countries. In addition, big names like Elon Musk – the billionaire and South African entrepreneur behind companies like SpaceX and Tesla – have chimed in about crypto’s energy usage.</p>
<h2>Musk&#8217;s Attitude Towards Mining</h2>
<p>Not long ago, Musk made it clear he <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/elon-musk-permits-bitcoin-payments-for-tesla-vehicles/" data-wpel-link="internal">wanted Tesla customers to be able</a> to buy vehicles with bitcoin. This caused the price of the asset to shoot up, and everyone thought BTC was going to reach a new level of mainstream legitimacy.</p>
<p>However, it was not to be, as just a few weeks after that, Musk <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-has-taken-a-nasty-stumble-many-are-blaming-elon-musk/" data-wpel-link="internal">rescinded the decision</a>, claiming he was concerned about how much energy was being used to extract BTC from the blockchain and that he would only allow bitcoin-based purchases if miners were more transparent about their sources and used cleaner energy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A survey suggests that should the United States ever default, the public <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-would-be-more-trusted-than-the-dollar-as-a-safe-haven-if-the-us-defaults-survey-says/ar-AA1bdA1A" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">sees bitcoin as more</a> of a “safe haven” than the U.S. dollar.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Is a Bigger Safe Haven Than USD, Survey Says</h2>
<p>Things aren’t as strong as one would assume considering bitcoin only placed third on the list. The first “safe haven” viewed by participants was gold, meaning that if the U.S. defaults, most of these people would want to allocate their portfolios and wealth to gold. After that came Treasurys, and bitcoin placed third, meaning it’s still got a way to go in terms of earning general trust.</p>
<p>However, the news is good in that it means many people now feel safer towards bitcoin than they do fiat currency, and the asset has come a long way in a relatively short period. Bitcoin, as we all remember, has only been around since 2009. That’s about 14 years at this stage, so the fact that people can now see it in a stronger light than they do USD is a good sign that the industry is doing something right.</p>
<p>The survey in question was the Markets Live Pulse survey conducted by <em>Bloomberg</em>. The results suggest that about eight percent (or slightly less) see bitcoin as a stronger “safe haven” when compared to USD. This isn’t much, but it’s a step forward.</p>
<p>There are likely many reasons for this, the first one being that banks throughout the U.S. and Europe are crashing and burning like nobody’s business. Right now, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/analysts-provide-their-thoughts-on-latest-bitcoin-rally/" data-wpel-link="internal">institutions such as</a> First Republic, Signature, and Silicon Valley have all fallen into heaps of failure and are no longer in operation throughout America. Thus, the institutions that once came off as totally safe, sound, and secure are taking on the shape of unstable firms that can lose your coins or dollar bills the minute something troublesome happens.</p>
<p>The other reason could be that we have so many incapable people running the financial scene in the U.S. People like Janet Yellen, the Treasury Secretary, who <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/opinion-crypto-fans-may-want-to-wait-on-their-calls-for-regulation/" data-wpel-link="internal">in the past</a>, has commented that she felt inflation was a problem that would resolve itself. Also, there’s Jerome Powell, who despite all the trouble that he’s caused, still only resorts <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-fed-bitcoins-worst-enemy-right-now/" data-wpel-link="internal">to hiking interest rates</a> as a means of combating inflation.</p>
<h2>Treasurys Shouldn&#8217;t Be This High</h2>
<p>The interest rate hikes have done nothing but cause people to be shut out of the American dream. They can no longer afford cars, homes, or other large (yet necessary) items due to their inability to pay high interest. In addition, these interest rate hikes caused crypto prices to crash and burn throughout 2022.</p>
<p>With all this in mind, however, it’s a little shocking (and scary) to think people still trust Treasurys more than they do bitcoin given they placed second on the survey.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin cash price is climbing above $300 against the US Dollar, outperforming <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-bulls-in-control-above-29500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. BCH/USD could start a fresh surge if it clears the $325 level.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash price formed a decent support base above the $180 level. BCH started a decent increase and was able to clear the $225 resistance zone.</p>
<p>The price climbed above the $250 and $280 resistance levels. It even spiked above $300 and traded as high as $326.42. It is now trading above the $280 zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-cash-analysis-rally-seems-unstoppable-above-130/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. The current price action is positive, suggesting high chances of more gains.</p>
<p>There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $270.00 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $320 level.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $325 level, above which the price may perhaps rise toward the $350 level. Any more gains above $350 could set the pace for a move toward the $400 level.</p>
<p>Immediate support on the downside is near the $300 level or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $220 swing low to the $326 high. The first major support sits near the $270 level and the trend line region.</p>
<p>The trend line is also near the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $220 swing low to the $326 high. The next support is near the $245 zone, below which the bears might aim for $225. The next target for them may perhaps be near the $200 level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is investing in crypto equivalent to gambling? That’s how the United Kingdom sees it, and leaders are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/17/cryptocurrency-trading-in-uk-should-be-regulated-as-form-of-gambling-say-mps?ref=dessenter.ghost.io" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">suggesting that crypto be regulated</a> in the same way the U.K. oversees gambling activities.</p>
<h2>The United Kingdom Sees Crypto Investing as Gambling</h2>
<p>To an extent, one can argue that investing in crypto is sort of a gamble. Whenever you buy bitcoin, Ethereum, or some other digital asset, you’re taking a chance… A chance that it could go down or up. You don’t know where it will be.</p>
<p>The same idea applies to sitting down at a blackjack table. You could win big, or you could lose it all in a matter of minutes. In that sense, crypto and gambling are one and the same, and this is the idea that’s making its way into the financial operations of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>U.K. authorities believe that like gambling, investing in crypto can be quite addictive, and thus traders won’t always know when to stop. Thus, necessary rules must be put in place to protect people from themselves. Conservative MP and Treasury committee chair Harriett Baldwin explained in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Effective regulation is clearly needed to protect consumers from harm, as well as to support productive innovation in the U.K.’s financial services industry. However, with no intrinsic value, huge price volatility, and no discernible social good, consumer trading of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin more closely resembles gambling than a financial service and should be regulated as such. By betting on these unbacked ‘tokens,’ consumers should be aware that all their money could be lost.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right now, nothing is set in stone, and laws and rules are merely being suggested to the U.K. Parliament. However, should these rules pass, many analysts believe they will eventually influence future crypto regulations in the United Kingdom. Some even believe they will implement themselves <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/european-union-passes-heavy-string-of-new-crypto-regulations/" data-wpel-link="internal">into the MiCA</a> regulations recently passed by the European Union (EU).</p>
<p>Not everyone is happy about what’s going on. For example, a special committee under the Treasury has released a report claiming that crypto and blockchain are part of financial innovations that cannot – and should not – be governed under the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which is where crypto regulation would occur in the U.K. The report said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is not the government’s role to promote particular technological innovations for their own sake.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Some People Have Lost Everything</h2>
<p>Like gambling, there have been many people out that have ultimately gone nuts whenever a bull market has hit. They put all their money into something, expecting and believing with all their might that they will strike it rich within a set period.</p>
<p>However, this isn’t always the case. Crypto is often very volatile, and in years such as 2018 and 2022, there have been many instances of crypto traders losing all they have.</p>
