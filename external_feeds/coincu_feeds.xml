<p>A US court has ordered Cornelius Johannes Steynberg, the fugitive Head of the South African crypto scam Mirror Trading International (MTI), to pay penalties and reparations for a Bitcoin fraud scheme.</p>



<p>MTI was a Bitcoin-based network marketing fraud that originated in South Africa and attracted participants from all over the globe.</p>



<p>In September 2020, a group calling itself Anonymous ZA attacked weaknesses in MTI&#8217;s poorly-coded website, making news. Chainalysis named MTI the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency fraud in 2020 after the company fled with over $589 million in bitcoin. South Africa accounted for more than half of the firm&#8217;s traffic, along with the United States, United Kingdom, Mexico, and Canada.</p>



<p>According to the report, this is the biggest civil monetary penalty ever imposed by the CFTC in any matter. The CFTC is an independent US government organization that supervises the American derivatives markets, which include futures, swaps, and some types of options.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1983.png"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="430" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1983.png" alt="CFTC Issues Largest Fine In History $3.4 Billion to Former Mirror Trading&#039;s CEO" class="wp-image-184615" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1983.png 640w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1983-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" title="CFTC Issues Largest Fine In History $3.4 Billion to Former Mirror Trading&#039;s CEO 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>The government stated in a statement announcing the ruling by US District Judge Laurence Yeakel that Steynberg committed fraud related to retail foreign currency transactions, among other offenses.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Judge Lee Yeakel of the US District Court for the Western District of Texas entered an order of default judgment and permanent injunction against Cornelius Johannes Steynberg of Stellenbosch, Western Cape, Republic of South Africa,” the report said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to the authority, Steynberg participated in a worldwide fraudulent multilevel marketing scheme to obtain Bitcoin from individuals for membership in an unlicensed commodities pool conducted by Mirror Trading between 2018 and 2021.</p>



<p>The CFTC said that MTI&#8217;s &#8220;controlling person&#8221; took 29,421 BTC from 23,000 Americans for conducting an unlawful commodities pool operation, worth at more than $1.7 billion at the time of acceptance.</p>



<p>Although the agency fined Steynberg, it warned that the fine may not result in the recovery of any money lost because wrongdoers may lack sufficient funds or assets.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Argo Blockchain declined in 2022 as the price of Bitcoin declined and mining difficulty grew, pushing up expenses.</em></li>



<li><em>During the fiscal year 2022, the company mined 2,156 bitcoins, a 5% increase over the previous year.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to the London-listed company&#8217;s results call on Friday, Argo Blockchain PLC <a href="https://www.accesswire.com/751823/Argo-Blockchain-PLC-Announces-2022-Full-Year-Results" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mined</a> 2,156 Bitcoin during the fiscal year 2022, a 5% rise over the previous year.</strong></h5>

<p>Mining activities brought in $58.6 million in income, a 36% decline from 2021 owing to the bitcoin bear market, an increase in global hashrate and network difficulty, and rising energy prices.</p>



<p>According to a statement, the London-based company recorded a net loss of 194.2 million British pounds ($240 million) compared to a net gain of 30.8 million pounds the previous year. Meanwhile, the price of Bitcoin fell by more than 60% last year.</p>



<p>Adjusted EBITDA was $1.2 million, down from $74.2 million in 2021, and margins were 54%, down from 84%. Argo has 141 Bitcoin as of December 31, 2022. Argo boosted hashrate capacity by 55%, from 1.6 EH/s at the end of 2021 to 2.5 EH/s at the end of 2022, in terms of operational highlights.</p>



<p>Seif El-Bakly, Argo Blockchain Interim CEO, stated: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Having navigated challenging market conditions in both the crypto sector and the global economy in the second half of 2022, Argo has emerged stronger and in a much more solid financial position.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The company <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156138-argo-blockchain-avoids-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">avoided</a> bankruptcy on December 29 by agreeing to sell its Helios mining plant in Dickens County, Texas, to Galaxy Digital for $65 million. It also obtained a fresh $35 million loan secured by its mining equipment from investor Michael Novogratz&#8217;s crypto-focused financial services business.</p>



<p>Argo retained possession of its entire fleet of mining equipment, and Galaxy has signed a two-year hosting arrangement with Helios to host roughly 23,619 Bitmain S19J Pro machines.</p>



<p>Argo also completed a swap deal with Core Scientific for S19J Pro machines totaling roughly 970 PH/s, concluding the hosting relationship with Core in lieu of self-mining activities at Helios.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance plans to launch a new Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Sakura Exchange Bitcoin (SEBC), in June.</em></li>



<li><em>The current Sakura Exchange Bitcoin service will end on May 31.</em></li>



<li><em>The company acquired Sakura Exchange in November last year and showed its willingness to enter Japan.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On April 28, Coinpost <a href="https://coinpost.jp/?p=455923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Binance intends to start a new Japanese cryptocurrency exchange, Sakura Exchange Bitcoin (SEBC), in June.</strong></h5>

<p>According to the article, the exchange will introduce a new service called &#8216;Binance Japan&#8217; after June and will provide more information shortly.</p>



<p>Individual users who register an account with SEBC will be unable to connect information with the current Binance Japan exchange, forcing them to go through the customer identification (KYC) process again.</p>



<p>Sakura Exchange&#8217;s existing Bitcoin service will be discontinued on May 31. Customers must submit a virtual currency selling order by 8:00 a.m. on May 26 (Friday) and a Japanese yen withdrawal process by 5:00 p.m. on May 28 (Sunday). Yes, any virtual currency that remains in the account after the deadline will be converted to Japanese yen at the rate in effect on June 5 and refunded to the registered bank account.</p>

<p>The company is attempting to gain clearance and business registration from the Financial Services Administration in order to offer services as a crypto exchange.</p>



<p>Binance previously stated in November last year that it would enter the Japanese market by purchasing SEBC, a Japanese-licensed cryptocurrency exchange. In Japan, the foreign version of Binance has ceased allowing new user registrations at the moment.</p>



<p>Also, whether Japanese users will be able to use the global version even after the launch of Binance JAPAN, and whether Binance&#8217;s major issues, such as BNB, will be whitelisted in the future.</p>



<p>Last year, FTX, which gained notoriety due to its bankruptcy, established FTX Japan as a means of acquiring domestic exchange Liquid. It has also become a prohibited trend. Although the details differ this time, Binance&#8217;s domestic expansion is proceeding in the same manner as FTX, so users of the exchange&#8217;s overseas version should exercise caution.</p>

<li><em>The majority of LPs are now concentrated in the ETH/USDC pool, while idle capital on the network is still waiting to be deployed.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>zkSync Era is the first zkEVM to reach mainnet, which is a significant milestone for the zk-rollup sector as a whole.

<p>In addition, data shows that activities on the zkSync Era chain mainly revolve around DEX, especially liquidity providers (LPs) on SyncSwap, iZUMi Finance, Mute.io, and Velocore. Currently, most LPs are concentrated in the ETH/USDC pool during the zkSync Era chain. The idle capital on the network is still waiting to be deployed.</p>

<p>iZUMi Finance, a one-stop Liquidity-as-a-Service (LaaS) DeFi protocol, has announced a $22 million fundraising round. The funds will be utilized to promote the early liquidity of its zkSync Era network on-chain Order Book DEX (Decentralized Exchange) product, iZiSwap Pro.</p>



<p>The name was changed from zkSync 2.0. Account Abstraction and EVM support through Solidity and Vyper are among the new features included in the first version of zkSync 2.0. zkSync 2.0 may be used with smart contracts, as well as the Zinc native programming language and zkPorter.</p>



<p>zkSync has not yet issued a token at the time of writing. However, Matter Labs has revealed that the token will be launched one year after the mainnet. As a result, there might be a chance for consumers to support and utilize early goods and projects in the ZkSync Era ecosystem in order to be Airdrop, like Arbitrum and Optimism, were.</p>

<li><em>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said that it expects lenders to collaborate with fully regulated cryptocurrency enterprises to assist them in opening bank accounts.</em></li>



<li><em>Meanwhile, the HKMA said that banks should assist regulated crypto companies with their legal need for bank accounts.</em></li>

<p>With the pandemic gone, the Hong Kong economy is recovering speedily, and many newly created or abroad enterprises are eager to open bank accounts in Hong Kong to investigate commercial prospects.</p>



<p>Banks are speeding up the processing of account opening applications in response to increased demand. In effect, there have been increasing complaints about how difficult it is to get an account, with some claiming that banks would reject applications owing to anti-money laundering (AML) concerns and perceived high risks.</p>



<p>To that purpose, the authorities have actively talked with banks in recent months, informing them that there is no legal or regulatory requirement banning Hong Kong banks from offering banking services to virtual (VA) linked organizations.</p>



<p>In a blog post signed by Arthur Yuen, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority&#8217;s deputy chief executive, the watchdog said it expected regulated virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to be able to successfully register for a bank account via a fair procedure.</p>

<p>According to a <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-28/hong-kong-seeks-to-help-crypto-firms-escape-their-exile-from-the-banking-sector" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>, the HKMA indicated in a circular issued later that day that banks should assist licensed crypto companies with their legitimate demand for bank accounts.</p>



<p>The statement also urged bankers to educate employees and develop specific teams to help the digital-asset industry rather than taking a wholesale de-risking approach that excludes new businesses or nationalities.</p>



<p>The operating permit includes certain special stipulations, according to which traders with a portfolio of fewer than $1 million are subject to various limitations under Hong Kong legislation.</p>



<p>Moreover, the new rules only enable investors to purchase and sell large-cap currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Yet, this is still seen as a significant step towards allowing cash to flow from Asia into the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>The adjustments come after Hong Kong&#8217;s Securities and Futures Commission <a href="https://news.coincu.com/184366-hong-kong-regulators-crypto-license/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> yesterday that it would issue rules on its crypto exchange licensing scheme in May.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>A proportional fee system is a scheme that guarantees transaction fees accurately reflect the processing expenses needed for completing certain transactions.</p>



<p>Zcash is a blockchain-based payments network that focuses on privacy by using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to shield transactions, keeping the contents of a transaction secret even on a public blockchain. Zcash, which arose from the Zerocash protocol, diverged from the Bitcoin network in 2016. ZEC is the ticker sign for its native token.</p>



<p>The blockchain is one of the main digital currency blockchains that aims to solve this growing problem and give its users back control and privacy.</p>



<p>ZKPs are the result of a cryptographic approach developed in the 1980s. They let two parties verify information with each other without disclosing the underlying data.</p>



<p>The Electric Currency Corporation (ECC), which produced Zcash, expanded the ZKP toolbox with Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge, or &#8220;zk-SNARKs.&#8221;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The Zcash protocol continues to be our primary focus at ECC, as we work to exit “Emergency Mode” and deliver a solid and reliable user experience,&#8221; the post wrote.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fund availability is an important forthcoming feature that will allow Zcash users to spend money before their wallets are completely synced. This change will not impact mobile wallet users who send frequent single-recipient transactions.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>NFTs have a bright future, according to Daniel Alegre, who joined Yuga Labs as CEO last month.</em></li>



<li><em>Alegre said that the firm intends to expand user access to its games as well as enable other companies to create goods and events for Otherside.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-27/yuga-labs-bayc-ceo-daniel-alegre-wants-to-revive-nfts-with-gaming-events" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg News</a></em>, Daniel Alegre, Yuga Labs&#8217; new CEO, said in an interview that NFT has a bright future since it is the key to the worlds of gaming, events, and e-commerce.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1963.png"><img decoding="async" width="1013" height="801" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1963.png" alt="New Yuga Labs CEO Seeks to Revitalize NFTs Through Games and Events" class="wp-image-184563" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1963.png 1013w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1963-300x237.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1963-768x607.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1963-750x593.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1013px) 100vw, 1013px" title="New Yuga Labs CEO Seeks to Revitalize NFTs Through Games and Events 31"></a></figure></div>


<p>Alegre said that the firm intends to expand user access to its games as well as enable other companies to produce goods and events for Otherside. He&#8217;s spent most of his time since joining the company reorganizing Yuga to seem more like a regular business, spinning out each NFT collection into its own mini-franchise.</p>



<p>A dearth of quality games that can compete with titles from established publishers has been a concern for Yuga and Web3 game makers in general, which Alegre aims to address. He said that the corporation is currently debating whether to expand its brand beyond online and mobile games and into consoles.</p>



<p>According to a recent analysis by DappRadar, Yuga Labs, the inventor of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, continues to dominate the NFT industry, accounting for roughly 35% of all NFT trade volume for the six months from October 2022 to March 2023.</p>



<p>Yuga Labs bought the CryptoPunks and Meebits NFT project Property from original inventor Larva Labs in 2022, in addition to the Bored Ape Yacht Club and its affiliated collections, including the Mutant Ape Yacht Club and Otherside metaverse gaming land rights.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1964.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="572" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1964-1024x572.png" alt="New Yuga Labs CEO Seeks to Revitalize NFTs Through Games and Events" class="wp-image-184564" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1964-1024x572.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1964-300x168.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1964-768x429.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1964-1536x858.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1964-2048x1143.png 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1964-750x419.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1964-1140x637.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="New Yuga Labs CEO Seeks to Revitalize NFTs Through Games and Events 32"></a></figure></div>


<p>Dookey Dash, the company&#8217;s most recent game, earned remarkable average revenue per user stats. Though the game was free to play as long as players had one of Yuga&#8217;s NFTs, money was made through selling passes to strangers and in-game add-ons. Alegre refused to provide exact data.</p>



<p>Part of Yuga&#8217;s attraction, according to Alegre, is that it has worked hard to build a brand that draws prominent people and keeps them engaged, something he believes gaming developers have yet to do.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Realistically, large gaming companies would have to fundamentally upend their economic model in order for them to really think about how others can own part of the ecosystem,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yuga Labs achieved a landmark legal win for Web3 last week when a federal court decided in its favor against artist Ryder Ripps and ally Jeremy Cahen. The couple had created RR/BAYC, a spoof of Yuga&#8217;s endeavor, as a copycat collection of the Bored Ape Yacht Club.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bit4You has halted all activities, including withdrawals, due to the bankruptcy of one of its main partners.</em></li>



<li><em>On April 24, an Estonian court suddenly ordered CoinLoan to cease all activities, including withdrawals.</em></li>



<li><em>CoinLoan is also no longer necessary to register as an exchange custodian of virtual currency.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bit4You, a Belgian <strong>crypto</strong> lending platform, has ceased operations after one of its service providers, CoinLoan, was ruled insolvent by an Estonian court.</strong></h5>

<p>Bit4You discovered CoinLoan&#8217;s bankruptcy on April 24, and the lender no longer has the essential registration as a digital asset custodian, according to a blog post published on Wednesday.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We would like to inform you that we recently learned that one of our major service providers, Estonia-based CoinLoan, no longer had the required registration as a custodian of virtual currencies.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to the statement, CoinLoan controls around 85.66% of Ripple (XRP) coin, approximately 81.45% of Bitcoin, and 67.32% of Ethereum.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="fr" dir="ltr">Suite à cela, nous avons immédiatement entamé plusieurs démarches pour comprendre la nature et la portée de cette situation.<br><br>En savoir plus &#8211; <a href="https://t.co/wg7iHqN9jt" target="_blank">https://t.co/wg7iHqN9jt</a></p>&mdash; Bit4you (@Bit4you1) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bit4you1/status/1651263959440277508?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 26, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Estonian regulatory authorities issued a stop order, preventing CoinLoan from processing or distributing assets without the explicit authorization of a temporary insolvency practitioner. This prevents the platform from transferring, releasing, or disposing of assets or from otherwise completing transactions until such approval is obtained.</p>



<p>There has been no indication that the monies held by CoinLoan would not be retrieved, according to Bit4You. According to a CoinLoan blog post quoted by the Bit4You team in their release, the firm thinks it can satisfy its obligations:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Our legal team has provided sufficient arguments to prove CoinLoan&#8217;s ability to fulfill its obligations. The appointment of the interim trustee seems to be the easiest way for the court to find a solution by letting an independent third party verify the financial situation of the company.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to the article, the Estonian court&#8217;s move was unexpected and would have an immediate impact. To prevent a run on its cash, the business restricted customer withdrawals in July 2022 to $5,000 every 24-hour period.</p>
