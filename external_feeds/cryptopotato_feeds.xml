            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; New York, United States, May 24th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>Following months of battle-testing by partner projects, developers, and community, production-ready Nautilus Chain graduates from testnet.</p>
<p><a href="https://zebec.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Zebec</a>, a pioneer in streaming finance, announced today the launch of Nautilus Chain &#8211; soon to be Zebec Chain &#8211; on mainnet, an important milestone in building its continuous payments infrastructure and global ecosystem. The first of its kind as an L3, Nautilus Chain offers the fastest EVM environment in web3 capable of parallel transaction processing, combining the speeds of Solana with the stability and functionality of EVM-based Solidity smart contracts, paving the way to the next generation of DeFi and consumer applications with a continuous stream of transactions or payments.</p>
<p>Nautilus Chain’s settlement layer is currently built on Solana node, its execution layer on Neon EVM and Solidity smart contract, with data availability hash stored off-chain in order to keep Nautilus’ modular blockchain architecture. With plans to transition settlement layer to optimistic roll-up and data availability stored on layer 1 chains such as Etherium, BSC or Bitcoin to further maximize throughput while remaining stable and reliable to support high-throughput payment applications such as payroll, DeFi applications, and on-chain gaming.</p>
<p>The mainnet upgrade brings over 80 projects, such as <a href="https://coraldex.finance/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Coral Finance</a>, <a href="https://witnet.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Witnet</a>, and <a href="https://www.poseiswap.xyz/?chain=triton" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">PoseiSwap</a> to name a few, with dozens more in the process of onboarding and a track record of seamlessly processing over 40 million transactions on testnet to date.</p>
<p><span style="color: #767676; font-size: 19px; font-style: italic;">&#8220;Zebec is helping to create a future where money is able to move more freely; giving individuals, businesses, investors, and teams faster and easier access to funds and tokens,&#8221; said Sam Thapaliya, Founder of Zebec. &#8220;The launch of Nautilus on mainnet is another breakthrough on the path towards this vision.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Key features of the Nautilus Chain</h2>
<p><strong>High Throughput</strong></p>
<p>Through parallelizing transactions instead of processing them linearly, Nautilus delivers an initial TPS of 2,000, with much higher rates soon to come.</p>
<p><strong>Developer-friendly</strong></p>
<p>Solidity developers are able to build high-throughput applications in an EVM environment. While the chain&#8217;s modular structure supports customization and gives developers control of the tech stack — or chain stack — in building dApps. The chain is highly interoperable and extensible and, with app-specific rollups, enables projects to strike the perfect balance between decentralization, throughput, performance, cost, and efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Reliable</strong></p>
<p>The high speeds and performance of the Nautilus chain, because it is a sovereign rollup, do not compromise the overall reliability and security of the infrastructure. Its robust design ensures optimal uptime and resilience, even under the most demanding conditions.</p>
<h2>Built for the Real World</h2>
<p>With its core innovation in performance and security, Zebec’s technology has transformative potential in the world of traditional finance, blockchain adoption, and smart contract-based digital financial applications.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Zebec’s progress with Nautilus Chain development has the potential to bridge the gap between traditional finance and web2 payroll applications and the emerging web3 ecosystem.&#8221; &#8211; said Steve Chen, Head of Blockchain Development for Nautilus</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;By harnessing the unparalleled speed, security, and interoperability of Nautilus, Zebec’s technology is poised to revolutionize traditional finance, bringing the benefits of blockchain technology to mainstream industries. As we continue to explore the potential of Zebec’s L3 chain, we foresee a future where seamless integration between web2 and web3 applications leads to the eventual replacement of conventional financial systems with blockchain technology and creating a more inclusive and efficient global economy.&#8221;- Chen continued.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Zebec continues to innovate and expand its ecosystem, it invites developers, companies, and projects from around the world to join it in creating a more connected, efficient, and accessible financial future.</p>
<h2>About Zebec</h2>
<p>Zebec enables real-time and continuous streams of payments and financial transactions for payroll, investments, and more. Founded in 2021, with investments by Circle, Coinbase, Solana Ventures, Breyer Capital, Republic, and Lightspeed Venture Partners, among others, Zebec services hundreds of companies, running thousands of continuous payment streams and bringing the blockchain to everyday lives.</p>
<h2>About Nautilus</h2>
<p>Nautilus is a high-performance modular blockchain built for real-world DeFi and Web3 applications delivering high speed and low cost of processing transactions within a highly secure and stable decentralized system.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do Kwon – co-founder of the collapsed Terra (LUNA) blockchain – has been denied bail after receiving initial approval to be released for roughly $430,500. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">On Wednesday, a court </span><a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/crypto-mogul-do-kwon-s-bail-is-revoked-in-montenegro-1.1924367" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">spokesperson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> told Bloomberg that a high court in Monetegro’s capital overturned a lower court decision to </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/terraform-labs-founder-do-kwon-to-be-released-on-440k-bail-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> Kwon on €400,000. The founder remains in jail. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Prosecutors were quick to </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/do-kwons-bail-appealed-by-montenegrin-prosecutors-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">appeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the lower court decision earlier this month, which left things to the higher court to decide. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Basic court should now make another decision, taking into account what the High Court ruled,” said Marija Rakovic, the court spokeswoman. “There is no legal limit to how many motions can follow between the respective judges in deciding on bail for the two South Korean nationals.” </span></p></blockquote>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The ruling also applies to Kwon’s former chief financial officer Han Chong-Joon, both of whom have pleaded not guilty to document forgery charges after allegedly traveling to Montenegro on a forged passport.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in March, after which he was demanded by the United States, South Korea, and Singapore. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Securities and Exchange Commission has already </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-sues-terraform-labs-and-do-kwon-for-crypto-fraud-involving-ust-and-luna/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">charged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the founder with fraud surrounding Terra’s UST and LUNA tokens and later </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/do-kwon-cashed-10k-btc-using-a-swiss-bank-claims-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">accused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> him of cashing out 10,000 Bitcoin (BTC) with a Swiss bank. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Terra’s collapse in May 2022 kickstarted a wave of insolvencies throughout the crypto industry stretching until the year’s end, turning Kwon into of the industry’s most hated personalities. </span></li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Florida Governor Ron De Santis has officially announced that he’s entering the United States 2024 Presidential race, poised to be former President Donald Trump’s greatest opponent within the Republican primary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike Trump, De Santis has pushed pro-crypto policy multiple times in the past and is staunchly opposed to Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).</span></p>
<h2>De Santis Would Protect Bitcoin</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">De Santis announced his plans to run in a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1661498079386931206" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Twitter Spaces</a> alongside the platform’s owner, Elon Musk, on Wednesday. Musk has </span><a href="https://twitter.com/MarioNawfal/status/1648128894979956736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1648128894979956736%7Ctwgr%5Ee49bdc41d2b7ccb906a7d10ce200a18b9ce17ef2%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.benzinga.com%2Fnews%2F23%2F04%2F31852077%2Felon-musk-reveals-he-voted-for-biden-in-2020-now-he-wants-a-normal-person-with-common-sense-as-next" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">expressed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> regret for voting for Joe Biden in the 2020 election, but also wasn’t interested in Trump since he desired a “normal person for president.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both Musk and De Santis found common ground in their opposition to “woke” ideology, and their support for free speech. They also happen to both be </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/elon-musk-issues-warning-for-dogecoin-investors-explains-why-doge-is-his-favorite-crypto/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">crypto-friendly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, while Trump has repeatedly called Bitcoin a “</span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/former-us-president-donald-trump-bitcoin-looks-like-a-scam/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">scam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When asked about his view on crypto’s regulatory situation in the United States, De Santis said that citizens have “every right to do Bitcoin,” and would oppose any statute to ban its use. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As President, we’ll protect the ability to do things like Bitcoin,” said De Santis. “I just do not have the itch to control everything that people may be doing in this space.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">De Santis echoed comments from other crypto-supportive Republicans in agreeing that the Biden Administration is attempting to </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/regulators-want-crypto-to-stay-the-f-away-caitlin-long-erik-voorhees-consensus-2023-live/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">kill the crypto industry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the United States through regulation.

<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The current regime – clearly they have it out for Bitcoin, and if it continues for another four years, they’ll probably end up killing it,” he added.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Bitcoin Miami 2023 last week, Democratic Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/presidential-candidate-robert-f-kennedy-pledges-inviolable-right-to-hold-and-use-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">pledged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to protect citizens’ “inviolable right” to hold and use Bitcoin.

<h2>No CBDCs for De Santis</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By contrast, the Biden White House has expressed interest in implementing a potential CBDC to “bring the U.S. financial infrastructure into the digital era… without the risks or irrational exuberance brought by crypto assets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Similar to Republic Congressmen Tom Emmer and </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sen-ted-cruz-introduces-a-bill-to-prevent-the-fed-from-issuing-a-cbdc/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ted Cruz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, De Santis is outright opposed to CBDCs. He introduced legislation in March to </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/no-cbdc-in-florida-says-governor-ron-desantis/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> any such technology from being used in Florida. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see it as a massive transfer of power from individual consumers to a central authority, and I don’t think that’s good for a free society,” he said.</span></p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[The politician had recently quit the party over the crypto scandal.  ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea&#8217;s ruling party has called for early enforcement of the law that seeks the country&#8217;s lawmakers and high-level government officials to declare their cryptocurrency-related assets.</p>
<p>The proposed bill would require local officials and lawmakers to declare all personal crypto holdings over 1 million Korean won (worth around $760). The move was prompted by a major crypto scandal involving a former lawmaker of the opposing party.</p>
<h2>Calls to Expedite Bill</h2>
<p>A report by Yonhap news agency <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20230523005800315?section=news" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">suggests</a> that People Power Party&#8217;s floor leader unveiled a bill last Friday proposing all public officials and candidates disclose their crypto holdings.</p>
<p>The original bill was previously scheduled for implementation in December this year. However, Rep. Yun Jae-ok, a third-term lawmaker, who was elected as the new floor leader of the conservative PPP last month, deemed the set date to be &#8220;too late&#8221; and added that the bill needs to be amended to add a clause moving up the enforcement.</p>
<p>The lawmaker said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Given the current high level of public interest, especially regarding lawmakers, it&#8217;s not appropriate to enforce the law six months later after the promulgation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yun further revealed that he asked the leader of the Public Administration Committee to propose a modified version of the law. The bill is reportedly scheduled to be put to a vote on May 26.</p>
<p>The latest development emerges on the heels of the ongoing scandal surrounding former Democratic Party lawmaker Kim Nam-kuk who has been at the center of controversy over his cryptocurrency investments. He is currently under investigation by local prosecutors for alleged campaign finance violations and tax portals, as well as for hiding criminal proceeds of his crypto possessions and transactions.</p>
<p>Kim announced leaving the party last week and continued to maintain his innocence. While responding to allegations, the now-independent lawmaker asserted that he was not required to disclose activities surrounding his crypto assets and denied liquidating his holdings.</p>
<p>As part of the investigation against the politician, authorities <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/south-korean-prosecutors-raided-upbit-and-bithumb-hqs-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">raided</a> the offices of prominent crypto exchanges  &#8211; Upbit and Bithumb.</p>
<h2>South Korea&#8217;s Regulatory Standpoint</h2>
<p>South Korean lawmakers have increased regulatory scrutiny of the crypto-asset industry after the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/south-korean-authorities-seize-terra-executives-assets-worth-160m-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">collapse</a> of the Terra ecosystem tokens last May.</p>
<p>As such, the legislators passed a first phase review of proposed regulations that offers the Financial Services Commission authority to investigate and monitor financial activity related to the asset class with stipulations ranging from governing the sale, storage, and trading. Consumer protection and compliance reporting were some of the aspects that were particularly stressed.</p>
<p>If passed, the bill would require digital asset service providers to distinguish internal holdings from consumer assets, carry insurance and maintain reserves in the event of non-market-related losses.</p>

<p>According to the class action lawsuit filed with a Floridan court by plaintiff Daniel Harper, Shaquille shilled the Astrals token through posts and videos on several of his social media handles.</p>
<h2>O&#8217;Neal Faces Lawsuit Over Astrals Project</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/647748832/Harper-v-O-Neal#" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">lawsuit</a>, Astrals is a 3D-modeled NFT collection founded by the NBA celebrity alongside his son, Mylers O&#8217;Neal. Shaq&#8217;s son headed the role of &#8220;Investors Relations&#8221; while his music manager, Brian Bayati, acted as the project&#8217;s CEO.</p>
<p>Building on the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-solana/" data-wpel-link="internal">Solana network</a>, Astrals seeks to onboard users into an ecosystem that offers gaming and metaverse experiences. These services are accessible through the Solana-based NFT marketplace Magic Eden.</p>
<p>Encouraging users to engage with Astrals&#8217; native cryptocurrency, the project launched the Shaq Signature Pass as an exclusive 50-piece collection of NFTs. These collectibles can only be claimed with the native token.</p>
<p>Harper&#8217;s lawsuit, which claims that Astrals tokens are unregistered securities, means that the assets will be subjected to the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-launches-its-own-ico-howeycoin-to-educate-investors/" data-wpel-link="internal">Howey test</a>. This is a process used to determine whether a cryptocurrency (or any other type of asset) falls under the category of security or an investment contract.</p>
<p>If the Astrals token passes the Howey test, it will be classified as a security and must be registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As such, the SEC will likely take legal action against Astrals and its executives, demanding a settlement.</p>
<h2>Not the First</h2>
<p>Since joining the industry, O&#8217;Neal has found himself in several crypto-related lawsuit cases. Earlier this month, he was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/nba-icon-shaquille-oneal-describes-his-ftx-summons-as-inadequate-seeks-dismisal-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">involved</a> in a court case regarding the collapsed crypto exchange FTX.</p>
<p>After being summoned to the court regarding his interaction with FTX, the NBA celebrity stated that the notice was inadequate, as it was tossed at his moving car and not served at his home.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Coinbase lashed out on the SEC saying the agency has no plans to consider the crypto exchange's petition on any timeline. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In response to the SEC&#8217;s arguments against its petition for a writ of mandamus, Coinbase said the financial regulator &#8220;is talking out of both sides of its mouth, and it is wrong at each end.&#8221; The crypto exchange&#8217;s chief legal officer Paul Grewal described the mandamus as &#8220;the tailor-made remedy for the extraordinary facts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The longstanding dispute between the crypto exchange and the market regulator is at the heart of the battle. Last month, Coinbase sued the SEC, claiming that the latter failed to provide a response as the former sought a formal notice-and-comment process that would enable the public to weigh in. The SEC later responded, deeming Coinbase&#8217;s allegations to be &#8220;baseless.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Coinbase vs. SEC</h2>
<p>In a 23-page <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/4Y8RdHCBOhXBvqYH51pw5P/564dd375bfeaaf866180888ef9a96432/2023.05.22_-_Dkt._27_-_Coinbase_Mandamus_Reply.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">filing</a> to the Third Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals, the crypto exchange said the SEC&#8217;s broad enforcement campaign on the same topic posed by Coinbase&#8217;s rulemaking petition renders the agency&#8217;s delay &#8220;unreasonable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coinbase argued that mandamus is warranted and blamed the SEC for &#8220;making up its mind&#8221; to deny the petition. It also said the Commission&#8217;s enforcement actions confirm that it is not considering Coinbase&#8217;s Petition.</p>
<p>The filing also cited that the SEC has instituted over 25 digital asset-related enforcement actions since the filing of the petition in July 2022.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;These actions presuppose that the agency believes the securities laws are clear and workable as applied to digital assets and that additional rulemaking is unnecessary. And many of these enforcement actions require the Commission to take positions on the central questions in Coinbase’s rulemaking petition, such as the standard for identifying whether a digital asset is a security.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Coinbase also hit back at the SEC, saying the latter&#8217;s argument that &#8211; regulated entities should wait to be sued &#8211; ignores its obligations to create significant new legal standards through rulemaking and not enforcement.</p>
<h2>SEC&#8217;s Earlier Response</h2>
<p>After failed attempts to get a response from the SEC about its stance on proposing and adopting rules to govern the regulation of securities that are offered and traded via digitally native methods, a US court <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-ordered-10-days-to-file-response-to-coinbases-petition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">ordered</a> the commission to respond to Coinbase’s complaint in ten days.</p>
<p>The Commission then argued that it is under no obligation to issue new regulations and added that Coinbase has no standing to sue the agency. It also said the digital asset industry already has rules and regulations governing it.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) published a tweet on Wednesday noting that China Central Television (CCTV) recently put out a broadcast related to digital assets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The executive claimed that similar coverage has served as a catalyst for crypto bull runs in the past. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">CZ </span><a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1661391542504902664" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">provided</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a link to the </span><a href="https://t.co/2wcArnPI93" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">broadcast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> which aired on May 23, and included a 98-second segment about Hong Kong regulators “Implementing a mandatory licensing system for virtual asset trading platforms,” beginning June 1. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The news itself wasn’t entirely positive for the industry, with </span><a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/news-and-announcements/news/doc?refNo=23PR53" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">SFC guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> including rules not to incentivize retail trading through stablecoins, and others explicitly banning crypto “gifts” (likely including airdrops). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, CZ viewed the act of broadcasting crypto alone to be a massively bullish development, calling it a “big deal.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Chinese-speaking communities are buzzing,” he said. “Historically, coverages like these led to bull runs.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The CEO clarified that his tweet was not “financial advice,” and that the past does not predict the future. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mainland China has banned crypto altogether, but Hong Kong has chosen to </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/hong-kong-confirms-crypto-commitment-at-web3-conference-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">press on</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> with ambitions to become a regional crypto hub.

			            <description><![CDATA[The delay in the completion of Multichain's backend upgrade has caused users' transactions to be stucked on the protocol for three days.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Users of the cross-chain router protocol Multichain have been reportedly experiencing delays in receiving their funds following an upgrade.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There have also been rumors about the arrest of the Multichain team, which is yet to be confirmed.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">MULTI Sinks 24% in 24 Hours</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Several Multichain users have complained about their funds being stuck in the protocol for as long as 72 hours. Part of the problem seems to stem from a backend upgrade, which the team said is taking longer than usual.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to an operation update provided on May 23, Multichain <a href="https://multichain.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/7036431417103-Multichain-23-May-Operation-Update" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">The upgrade of the back-end node is taking longer than expected. Most of the routes are working as usual, as some routes (Kava, zkSync, Polygon zkEVM) are suspended temporarily for now. All the affected transactions will arrive once the upgrade is complete.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, ongoing discussions on Multichain&#8217;s Telegram channel as of May 24 revealed that all but one router was undergoing an upgrade. One of the admins in the group said, &#8220;Only one router left in the upgrade progress. Other 6 routers work fine now,&#8221; with another one stating that the team was working on the final router and operations will be &#8220;back to normal once it is finished.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, Multichain&#8217;s token MULTI has fallen over 24% in the last 24 hours, from $7.09 to $5.39, according to Coingecko. The crash in the token&#8217;s value could be a result of panic selling from holders.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Multichain Team Allegedly Arrested in China</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Lookonchain also reported that some investors have likely been <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1661351267795636224?t=Pa5WjYlSOalHbQpFjiAzWQ&amp;s=19" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">selling</a> their multichain tokens.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One address deposited 494,200 MULTI (valued at $2.75 million) to the crypto exchange Gate.io on May 24. Digital asset financial services group Hashkey also transferred $247,000 worth of MULTI to the same crypto exchange today.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, an address with the ENS name hwg.eth sold over 36,000 MULTI tokens to get $200,000 on May 23. Notably, Fantom Foundation also <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1661356745367908358?t=q94iNZaMnKpha_PnO2ED9A&amp;s=19" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">recently removed</a> approximately 450,000 MULTI (worth $2.4 million) tokens from liquidity on SushiSwap.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Amid reports of delayed transactions and token price slump, there have also been rumors of the Chinese authorities arresting the Multichain project team and with over $1 billion in contract funds &#8220;under control.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, Multichain has neither confirmed nor refuted the ongoing rumors, but we shall give an update as this is a developing story.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Marseille, France, May 24th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>In an age where the crypto world is dominated by GameFi, DeFi, NFTs, and meme coins, Hestia is revolutionizing the industry by demonstrating how cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology can be applied to traditional economic projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://hestia-project.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Hestia</a>, a groundbreaking decentralized freelance platform, is harnessing the power of decentralization to hustle the gig economy and empower freelancers and clients alike.</p>
<p>The Hestia project stands out from its crypto counterparts by focusing on real-world applications and creating a sustainable ecosystem for a broad range of industries. By leveraging the advantages of blockchain technology, Hestia offers an innovative economic model that enables fair distribution of power, wealth, and community governance.</p>
<h2>A New Economic Model: Decentralization at Its Core</h2>
<p>Hestia&#8217;s decentralized approach sets it apart from traditional freelance platforms, which often suffer from centralization issues and associated inefficiencies. By eliminating the need for a central authority, Hestia provides a more transparent, equitable, and efficient ecosystem for freelancers and clients to connect and collaborate.</p>
<p>Hestia&#8217;s dual-token system, comprising the stable HTX token and the growth-focused HTI token, enables seamless transactions within the platform while fostering the development of the ecosystem. The HTX token is indexed to USDT, providing a stable medium of exchange, while the HTI token is designed for use in exchanging HTX for other tokens or fiat currencies, as well as financing the Hestia ecosystem.</p>
<p>The platform&#8217;s unique tokenomics ensures that users can access its services without subscription fees or hidden costs. A modest 5% fee on token swaps between HTX and HTI is the only charge, which is used to support the platform&#8217;s ongoing operation, maintenance, and evolution.</p>
<p><strong>Community Governance: Empowering Users</strong></p>
<p>Hestia&#8217;s commitment to community governance allows users to participate directly in decision- making processes, creating a more inclusive, transparent, and democratic ecosystem. Token holders can vote on proposals, contribute to platform development, and help shape the future of the Hestia network.</p>
<p><strong>Bridging the Gap Between Crypto and Traditional Industries</strong></p>
<p>By combining the best of blockchain technology with a focus on real-world applications, Hestia is challenging the notion that cryptocurrencies are only suitable for niche projects like GameFi, DeFi, NFTs, and meme coins. The platform&#8217;s innovative approach demonstrates how blockchain can transform traditional industries and drive meaningful change in people&#8217;s lives.</p>
<h2>About Hestia</h2>
<p>Hestia is a testament to the versatility and potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. By creating a decentralized, user-driven freelance platform, Hestia is paving the way for a more equitable, transparent, and efficient future for freelancers and clients around the globe.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Amsterdam, Netherlands, May 24th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>The organizers of <a href="https://www.theweb3.wtf/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">The Web3.Conference</a> are celebrating a successful day-long event that brought together the industry’s leading lights. Held in Amsterdam on May 19th, the annual event from the AroundB team discussed hot topics and gathered industry insights from Web3 experts.</p>
<p>With more than 20 speakers, four panel discussions, and six startup pitch sessions during seven hours, the agenda contained something to suit every guest. Mark Eid from <a href="https://qlindo.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Qlindo</a>, the main sponsor of the event, spoke about green real estate and renewable energy investment opportunities.
