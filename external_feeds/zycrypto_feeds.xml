<p>In a surprising case that caught the crypto community&#8217;s attention, Sarita, a New York housewife, uncovered her husband&#8217;s hidden <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-at-70000-arthur-hayes-reveals-why-this-price-level-is-unlikely-to-happen-till-2024/">Bitcoin</a> assets during her divorce proceedings.</p>



<p>According to a Saturday report by CNBC, Sarita, who chose to use a pseudonym for her safety, disclosed that she tracked down 12 bitcoins, currently worth close to half a million dollars, in a previously undisclosed crypto wallet owned by her husband after months of investigation and the assistance of a forensic accountant.</p>



<p>As per the report, Sarita, now seeking divorce after a decade in marriage, expressed her shock and feeling of being blindsided by her husband&#8217;s cryptocurrency investment. She admitted that although she had heard of Bitcoin, she had little knowledge about it since they had never discussed it or made investments together.</p>



<p><em>“I know of bitcoin and things like that. I just didn’t know much about it,”</em> she said, adding, “<em>it was never even a thought in my mind, because it’s not like we were discussing it or making investments together…It was definitely a shock.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cryptocurrency-tracking-in-divorce-a-nightmare"><strong>Cryptocurrency Tracking in Divorce: A Nightmare</strong></h2>



<p>As more and more people get involved with cryptocurrencies, cases of financial infidelity related to digital assets are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Moreover, experts in divorce law concur that the legal system is struggling to keep pace with the complexities of cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Notably, tracking down hidden cryptocurrency assets <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cryptocurrency-effect-marriage/">during divorces</a> has led to the emergence of forensic investigators specializing in studying and tracking cryptocurrencies owned by spouses.</p>



<p>In a note to CNBC, divorce attorney Kelly Burris explained that due to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, obtaining information through traditional means, such as subpoenas, is often impossible. Instead, forensic analysis of computers or phones is necessary to identify wallet addresses and conduct blockchain analysis.</p>



<p><em>“The thing with cryptocurrency is it’s not regulated by any kind of centralized bank, so usually you can’t subpoena somebody and get documents and information related to somebody’s cryptocurrency holdings,”</em> said Burris.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In divorce cases involving cryptocurrencies, investigators pay close attention to hardware wallets, cold storage methods, and the movement of tokens across various blockchains. However, the increasing practice of &#8220;chain hopping&#8221;, where individuals quickly switch between different blockchains, complicates asset tracking.</p>



<p>Further, the rapid expansion of the cryptocurrency market, and the introduction of privacy tokens, such as Zcash, Dash and Monero, have also made it challenging to conduct forensic investigations since they offer anonymity when conducting transactions. Additionally, some divorcees may also choose to use crypto mixers such as the now-defunct Tornado Cash, making it harder to trace their assets.</p>



<p>That said, as the popularity and complexity of cryptocurrencies continue to grow, it has become clear that the legal system will need to adapt to handle cases involving digital assets effectively. Still, first, clear crypto regulations are needed.</p>

<p>Arthur Hayes, the co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, has predicted a period of significant volatility for Bitcoin in the coming months before eventually surging to new highs in 2024.</p>



<p>In a Friday, May 26 interview with WhatBitcoinDid host Peter McCormack, Hayes predicted that Bitcoin&#8217;s price will not exceed $70,000 until next year.</p>



<p><em>“We got this halving next year, 2024. I think that&#8217;s going to be a good year. I don&#8217;t think we get up to $70,000 this year. I think next year is when we cross that barrier, and then we get the blow-off top 2025, 2026, and then it&#8217;s Armageddon,” </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yV-zwcFnR3Q&amp;t=1781s&amp;ab_channel=WhatBitcoinDid">said</a> Hayes.</p>



<p>The crypto guru, who disclosed working on Maelstrom, his family office, noted that he considers Bitcoin a serious experiment that has demonstrated success thus far. He also revealed that he <a href="https://zycrypto.com/former-bitmex-ceo-arthur-hayes-on-why-bitcoin-price-has-likely-reached-bottom/">views Bitcoin</a> as a durable form of currency capable of maintaining its purchasing power in terms of energy. Drawing a parallel between the value of Bitcoin and that of oil over time, Hayes suggested that Bitcoin has performed well in preserving its value.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hayes-economic-outlook"><strong>Hayes&#8217; Economic Outlook</strong></h2>



<p>Hayes further recognized the inherent challenges and risks present within the current financial system. He drew attention to the widespread practice of governments printing money to tackle increasing debts, cautioning that this strategy is not sustainable and may potentially lead to a collapse, further exacerbating the challenges Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies face.</p>



<p>“<em>You know governments print a bunch of money, the fed being the most egregious of all of them,</em> and now they&#8217;ve exacerbated the problems…if we print all this money,<em> how do we take it out of the system without causing bad effects,” </em>added Hayes.</p>



<p><em>“They think they&#8217;re so smart that they can time the market,</em> and the market is not going to inflict pain on them,<em> and the market is going to only act in a very linear fashion it&#8217;s not going to,” </em>he went on.<em> </em></p>



<p>Given these concerns, Hayes advised individuals to explore alternative assets outside the traditional financial system. In Particular, he suggested considering investments in <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-bulls-set-eyes-above-30000-as-gold-taps-new-all-time-high/">Bitcoin,</a> gold, real estate, or businesses that generate cash flow, emphasizing the importance of taking action now rather than waiting until it becomes more difficult to access these assets.</p>



<p>Additionally, recognizing that purchasing Bitcoin may pose challenges in certain regions due to regulatory restrictions, he urged individuals to find ways to acquire Bitcoin and, if necessary, consider relocating to places where it is easier to do so.</p>

<p>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has expressed confidence that the court will make a final determination on the ongoing XRP lawsuit sooner than projected.</p>



<p>During the Redefine Summit 2023 earlier this week, Garlinghouse shed light on <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-sec-may-have-just-bitten-off-more-than-it-can-chew-as-ripple-eyes-very-big-win-in-case/">Ripple&#8217;s determination</a> to fight for clarity and transparency in the cryptocurrency industry, noting that the nearly 3-year legal tussle with the SEC was nearing an end.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>In terms of where things stand today, I feel very confident that we will see a decision from the courts this year…I would guess in weeks, not months,&#8221;</em> Garlinghouse stated.</p>



<p>Notably, at the recent Dubai Fintech Summit just a week ago, Garlinghouse stated that he anticipates the case will conclude within two to six months.</p>



<p>The CEO’s optimistic statements come following a recent <a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">ruling</a> in which Judge Analisa Torres denied the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) request to seal internal documents related to William Hinman&#8217;s speech. The speech in question addressed why Ethereum (ETH) was not considered a security. The court ruled that the notes and emails associated with the speech should be made public on June 13, a move Garlinghouse hailed as a &#8220;huge win for transparency&#8221; during the interview.</p>



<p>Despite the ongoing legal battle and the lack of regulatory clarity, Ripple has chosen to stand firm and fight for its interests and the entire crypto industry. Garlinghouse acknowledged the financial toll the lawsuit has taken, stating, &#8220;<em>We&#8217;ve spent a lot of money defending it, and I think what we&#8217;ve called out is that the government of the United States and the SEC particularly is putting politics ahead of smart policy.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Garlinghouse further highlighted the frustration felt by many entrepreneurs in the crypto industry due to actions by the SEC and other government agencies, leading to some relocating their operations overseas. <em>&#8220;Because of that, you are seeing entrepreneurs go overseas. Most of our hiring is not in the US now. Most of our customers are non-US,” </em>he added.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Pro-Ripple lawyer Jeremy Hogan also expressed his belief in the lawsuit ending soon in a Tuesday, May 23, tweet. According to the lawyer,&nbsp; Judge Analisa Torres is not obligated to wait for the release of redacted documents before making a decision. However, he suggested that she might choose to do so, adding, &#8220;<em>I would not hold my breath until after June 13.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Filed in December 2020 by the SEC, the XRP lawsuit alleges that Ripple executives, including Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse, violated securities laws by selling XRP without proper registration. Conversely, Ripple has continued to contend that XRP is a digital currency and not a security.</p>



<p>With Ripple having <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-whales-amass-nearly-half-a-billion-coins-as-traders-shower-confidence-on-a-ripple-win-in-sec-case/">bagged several wins</a> in court over the past year or so, it remains to be seen whether the ultimate ruling will favour it, which, if so, would be a major win for the entire crypto industry.</p>

<li>Web3 lawyer John Deaton discovered a footnote in documents that confirms the SEC discussed the possibilities of XRP not meeting the requirements of the Howey test.</li>



<li>Though the SEC did not comment on the record, Deaton believes the statement confirms what the crypto community has expressed for years.</li>



<li>XRP Army and other digital asset executives share their views on the lingering court case stating how it would shape regulation in the industry.</li>
</ul>



<p>The legal tussle between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) takes a new turn as web3 lawyers and digital asset users scrutinize a new revelation concerning the case. </p>



<p>Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton has <a href="https://twitter.com/johnedeaton1/status/1660301659887616000?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">stated</a> that a small footnote that he discovered in Ripple’s brief could play a key role in determining the merits of the case. On May 22, Deaton explained on Twitter that the footnote confirmed a conversation between staff of the SEC concerning Ripple “<em>prior to the Hinman speech.”</em></p>



<p>“<em>There are reasonable grounds to conclude that XRP does not satisfy all elements of the Howey Analysis and is therefore not a ‘security’ for purposes of the federal securities laws,” </em>the footnote reads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a potential game changer as internal debates within the Commission on XRP not being a security could switch the dynamics and narrative. The US regulator charged Ripple alongside two of its executives Brad Garlinghouse and Christian Larsen for issuing $1.3 billion in “unregistered securities.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ripple has consistently denied these claims insisting that it does not meet up the requirements for the Howey Test, the age-long test used by regulators to determine if assets fall under securities. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Deaton stated that this proves “<em>what we have said for years.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>“Everything that an XRP holder has been shouting for the past couple of years, it has absolutely confirmed that XRP has been discussed,” </em>he added.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-speculations-as-legal-tussle-nears-end"><strong>More speculations as legal tussle nears end</strong></h2>



<p>New developments in the case including the recent ruling on the Hinnan document have been debated in crypto circles. Deaton believes that there are parts that will hinder Ripple’s shot at victory, although it still looks promising.</p>



<p>“<em>I think the chances of Ripple getting a complete victory are much slimmer after reading this than I felt before. I still don’t think the SEC is getting a complete victory either,”  </em>he added. </p>



<p>Deaton explained that Judge Torres might decide to fine the company for its early sale of XRP and other transactions but not on subsequent sales as that does not amount to securities. Similarly, Marc Fagel, a former SEC security lawyer added that while secondary markets were helpful to prove the Commission’s case, “<em>Torres would be overstepping to make a ruling on secondary sales.” </em></p>

<ul>
<li>Spot gold rose 0.9% to a new record high of $2,080.72 an ounce on Wednesday following an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Market commentators criticize the continuous decision of the Feds to hike interest rates predicting a future stall in hikes.</li>
</ul>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC) now trades above $26,000 after the Feds vote to raise the interest rate to the highest point in 16 years but signals a pause for future hikes. </p>



<p>BTC trades hands at $26,737 at the time of writing after falling on May 2. The slight rally comes after the Federal Reserve hikes interest rates by another 25 points amid significant economic turmoil in the banking sector.</p>



<p>At the start of the week, BTC price crawled in anticipation of the rate hike but witnessed the market leader reclaiming $26k, a much-needed boost as bulls locked their eyes on the $30,000 resistance level. </p>



<p>Gold prices hit new highs following the hike by the Feds, benefiting from the bank&#8217;s decision to implement stringing measures for future hikes. An ounce of gold now trades at $2,080 as investors seek a safe haven in the precious metal.</p>



<p>The Federal Reserves leaning toward a pause in rate hikes after a streak of 10 previous hikes also fueled a surge in the digital asset market. The Feds will now adopt a more “<em>data-driven and meeting-by-meeting approach” </em>for future decisions.</p>



<p>Financial analysts at ING believe that a pause is here to stay, given worsening economic situations and <em>‘bank stresses.’</em></p>



<p>“<em>With lending conditions rapidly tightening in the wake of recent bank stresses, we think this will mark the peak for interest rates with recessionary forces set to prompt interest rate cuts later this year.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-experts-mount-pressure-on-feds">Experts mount pressure on Feds</h2>



<p>Financial executives have criticized the approach of the Federal Reserve in handling inflation, pointing to the collapse of regional banks as more continue to struggle amid higher interest rates for consumers. Michael van de Poppe, Eight’s CEO, lashed out at the Federal Reserve. </p>



<p>“<em>The biggest joke is the fact that Jerome Powell says that the banking system has improved and is healthy, sound, and resilient. It’s the weakest it has ever been, and another few banks have been falling apart after the market. This was the last hike,” </em>he added.</p>



<p>Former CEO of BitMEX Arthur Hayes says the decisions of the Feds are now based on politics rather than rational decisions.</p>



<p>“<em>You never know what is the trigger that causes Yellen or Powell to cave and bail everyone out. It’s all politics now, and politics is more about power than rational decisions,” </em>he tweeted.</p>

<p>Prominent blockchain-based payment solutions company, Ripple, is contemplating making strategic acquisitions in crypto-friendly countries in a bid to expand its business model.</p>



<p>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse unveiled this information during a live interview at last week&#8217;s Dubai Fintech Summit. In his remarks, the Ripple boss noted that Ripple&#8217;s aspirations <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-expands-into-the-institutional-crypto-custody-market-following-250-million-acquisition-of-metaco/">go beyond</a> its existing emphasis on cross-border payments for businesses and encompass various other aspects of the blockchain technology sector.</p>



<p><em>“What I think will be next is certainly something Ripple thinks about. We started with enterprise-based cross-border payments. We talked about there being four primitive pieces to blockchain-based technologies; liquidity, compliance, custody and tokenization. Ripple aspires to be more than just that…I think you’d expect that we will expand into some of those other areas either organically or through acquisitions,”</em> said Garlinghouse.</p>



<p>The CEO then emphasized the significance of operating in countries that support blockchain technologies, citing the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-debuts-first-ever-in-market-on-demand-liquidity-odl-deployment-in-the-middle-east/">United Arab Emirates (UAE)</a> and Switzerland as prime examples of nations that offer an encouraging environment for entrepreneurs in the crypto space.</p>



<p><em>“I think we will look at making acquisitions in markets that are friendly to these technologies,” </em>he said, adding <em>“In the previous panel, you had representations from UAE, Switzerland. These are countries that are providing the clarity for entrepreneurs to invest and that allows a company like Ripple that is larger.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Furthermore, to back his statements, Garlinghouse disclosed that Ripple had over $1 billion in cash reserves positioned to be allocated towards the said strategic acquisitions.</p>



<p><em>“We have more than $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet. We want to deploy that to grow both organically and also inorganically through acquisition,” </em>he went on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Garlinghouse&#8217;s remarks came amid heightened concerns over the regulatory environment in the United States. During the interview, he expressed his frustration at the US, stating that the country is falling behind significantly due to the prioritization of politics over policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to him, investment and growth potential in blockchain technologies risked being pursued outside the United States of America due to the country’s apparent anti-crypto ideologies.</p>



<p>He went on to state that Ripple expects to spend approximately $200 million defending itself against the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-sec-may-have-just-bitten-off-more-than-it-can-chew-as-ripple-eyes-very-big-win-in-case/">ongoing lawsuit</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), asserting that the case lacks a solid foundation.</p>



<p>That said, despite the difficulties encountered in the United States, Ripple&#8217;s ambitions for expansion, which include the possibility of acquiring companies in crypto-friendly regions, have the potential to establish the company as a frontrunner in the global blockchain industry.</p>



<p>This strategic move would boost the utilization of Ripple&#8217;s ecosystem and ultimately drive the value of XRP towards the coveted $1 price level. At press time, the cryptocurrency was trading at $0.4672, up 3.39% in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>In a May 18, 2023 press release, the New York Fed and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) published the results of a research study, known as Project Cedar Phase II x Ubin+.</p>



<p>Project Cedar is a Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s New York Innovation Center initiative that seeks to develop a technical framework for a theoretical wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) and contribute to the CBDCs dialogue.</p>



<p>Phase I of Project Cedar revealed that using a wholesale CBDC to facilitate blockchain technology transactions could improve the speed and safety of wholesale cross-border payments.</p>



<p>Ubin+ is a MAS initiative to improve the efficiency of cross-border settlement using distributed ledger technology (DLT) and non-DLT financial networks.</p>



<p>The collaboration to investigate whether wholesale central bank digital currencies (wCBDCs) could improve the efficiency of cross-border, multi-currency payments was announced by the New York Fed and the MAS in November 2022.</p>



<p>Project Cedar Phase II x Ubin+ examined whether DLT could improve the efficiency of cross-border wholesale payments and settlements involving multiple currencies.</p>



<p>As stated by the released Project Cedar Phase II x Ubin+ report, the study was aimed at contributing to the ongoing innovation in the financial sector and not to advance any specific policy outcome. Neither was the study intended to signal any imminent decisions about the appropriateness of issuing a CBDC nor indicating how one would be designed.</p>



<p>The hypotheses tested in the study aimed to establish whether wholesale CBDC systems developed using DLT could be technically interoperable with other payment systems across different jurisdictions, could facilitate cross-border payments across illiquid currency corridors, or could shorten the processing time of cross-border, cross-currency payments initiated in different jurisdictions.</p>



<p>Project Cedar Phase II x Ubin+ has shown that payments can be safely made across multiple ledgers without a central clearing authority or the establishment of a shared central network. The results also showed that simulated payments could be settled atomically, in near real-time, addressing concerns of counterparty risks.</p>



<p>Project Cedar Phase II x Ubin+ also demonstrated that DLT could support enhancements to cross-border multi-currency payments and settlements relating to network interoperability and autonomy, settlement, and speed. The study noted that alternative technical designs other than DLT may also provide viable solutions.</p>



<p>“Cross-border payments are a major railway for facilitating the functioning of the global economy,” said Michelle Neal, New York Fed’s Head of the Markets Group.</p>



<p>Areas for future experimentation and analysis identified by the study include the viability of the network scalability, the involvement of additional currencies supported by their corresponding central bank ledgers, and privacy limitations and liquidity optimization.</p>

<p>According to a May 23, 2023 media release, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) issued global recommendations to jurisdictions on the regulation of crypto and digital asset markets. IOSCO has requested comments on its recommendations through public consultation by July 31, 2023.</p>



<p>‘Retail access, suitability, and distribution’ of crypto assets is one of the key areas covered by IOSCO’s recommendations. IOSCO proposed that regulators should require crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) to operate in a manner consistent with its standards regarding interactions and dealings with retail clients.</p>



<p>This includes assessing the appropriateness and/or suitability of particular crypto-asset products and services offered to each retail client. In developing new frameworks for crypto and digital asset markets, regulators should consider imposing requirements related to suitability/ appropriateness assessments.</p>



<p>Client Suitability Assessment enables CASPs to profile potential clients to choose the best investments aligned to their objectives, risk tolerance, preferences, experiences, specific needs and circumstances, among other factors.</p>



<p>As per IOSCO recommendations, If CSAPs use suitability assessments, regulators should require that the assessments are robust enough not to give clients the impression that they fully understand the operations and the related risks of crypto asset markets.</p>



<p>IOSCO further proposes that where a prospective client does not demonstrate sufficient knowledge, the CASP should not permit that client to trade crypto assets.</p>



<p>On the retail distribution of crypto-assets, IOSCO has requested public feedback on what other safeguards should be adopted, whether regulators should take steps, and to what extent to restrict advertisements and endorsements promoting crypto-assets.</p>



<p>Following the crypto market bankruptcies in 2022 and events surrounding the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange, the technical committee of IOSCO published a consultation report in February 2023 on the suitability requirements for complex financial products.</p>



<p>The report set out proposed principles relating to customer protection, including suitability and disclosure obligations relating to the distribution of complex financial products to retail and non-retail customers by intermediaries.</p>



<p>Following the issuance of its recommendations, IOSCO has requested jurisdictions to review them against their current regulatory frameworks to ensure compliance with its standards and to fix any gaps as soon as possible. IOSCO aims to finalize its recommendations by the end of the year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an April 2023 media release, IOSCO published its work program for 2023-24. The work program called for IOSCO to maintain the momentum from its July 2022 crypto-asset roadmap and to assess and respond to the risks associated with crypto-asset market activities and decentralized finance.</p>

<p>Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has expressed confidence in Cardano making substantial strides in its mission to create a truly decentralized and inclusive blockchain ecosystem.</p>



<p>In a Thursday, May 25 video on his YouTube channel, Hoskinson provided an update on the project&#8217;s progress and outlined the significant developments that will contribute to the platform&#8217;s unrivalled decentralization in the cryptocurrency space.</p>



<p>First, Hoskinson highlighted CIP 1694, an important project which aims to bring a new way of governing <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-ada-staking-value-surpasses-400-million-ada-reaching-161-million-in-tvl/">Cardano</a>. Currently, most major decisions on how things are done on the network are decided by the Cardano Foundation and a small group of people. However, according to Hoskinson, with CIP 1694, more people from the community will be able to have a say and be involved in making decisions.</p>



<p><em>“You should have a say, not people you&#8217;ve never met not people that aren&#8217;t accountable to you and not people who don&#8217;t have your best interest at heart and I&#8217;d like to believe we can get there. That&#8217;s why we built Cardano,”</em> said Hoskinson.</p>



<p>He further mentioned that the team behind this project was working hard to build and test it on node 8.0, adding that they plan to release node 8.1 soon.</p>



<p>To further encourage community involvement, Charles Hoskinson announced the launch of a grant and Request for Proposal (RFP) program. According to him, these initiatives will provide interested individuals and organizations opportunities to contribute to the Cardano ecosystem by developing tools, infrastructure, and voting accountability mechanisms. He noted that these programs&#8217; details will be unveiled in June and July.</p>



<p>In addition, the crypto guru revealed that Cardano is collaborating with the University of Edinburgh&#8217;s decentralization index lab to measure the project&#8217;s level of decentralization compared to other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This collaboration aims to showcase Cardano&#8217;s significant progress in decentralization, aligning with the project&#8217;s primary goal of building decentralized protocols.</p>



<p>He also mentioned various other <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-explosive-network-developments-fuel-speculation-for-1-ada-price-milestone/">ongoing projects</a> within the Cardano ecosystem. These include advancements in peer-to-peer mechanics, signature support, and the development of the Hydra open-source program. According to him, these developments further contribute to Cardano&#8217;s journey towards unrivalled decentralization.</p>



<p><em>&nbsp;“My belief is that we&#8217;ll actually be substantially more decentralized than all cryptocurrencies on Market which is one of the primary goals of these types of protocols,”</em> he added.</p>



<p>Notably, Charles Hoskinson once again stressed the significance of focusing on moving forward even when facing criticism from others in the industry. That said, as Cardano prepares to enter the age of Voltaire, the network can anticipate a surge of projects and people joining, which will positively impact its overall growth and that of ADA, its native token.</p>

<p>Global financial services behemoth VISA recently shared a range of significant milestones in its ongoing pursuit of digital asset payments and seamless crypto onboarding.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://usa.visa.com/solutions/crypto/rethink-digital-transactions-with-account-abstraction.html">blog</a> titled &#8220;Rethinking Digital Transactions with Account Abstraction” earlier this week, the firm disclosed it is now exploring how gas fees can be redesigned using Account Abstraction on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling secure and automatic payments for self-custodial wallets. It then added that it is deeply engaged in studying Ethereum&#8217;s proposal ERC-4337 for digital payments.</p>



<p>Rolled out on the Ethereum mainnet in early March, ERC-4337 is a key component of VISA’s exploration, as it adds the ability for smart contracts to transact on behalf of the user.</p>



<p>The firm also noted that it has successfully deployed two sets of Paymaster contracts on the Ethereum Goerli testnet, a move aimed at showcasing the potential for redesigning gas fees on the blockchain to improve user convenience. Mustafa Bedawala of Visa’s crypto department <a href="https://twitter.com/digitalmustafa/status/1658710491613761536">observed</a> that the firm’s first paymaster contract is focused on investigating whether users can pay transaction fees with alternative tokens, like dollar stablecoins or, potentially, CBDCs apart from ETH.</p>



<p><em>“To transact on the Ethereum blockchain today, a user needs to acquire ETH to pay for gas fees; similarly, to transact on Polygon blockchain, a user needs to acquire the native token MATIC. Is there a solution that eliminates the need to accumulate a different range of native blockchain tokens solely for the purpose of paying for gas?</em>” wrote Visa.</p>



<p>The other paymaster contract is aimed at completely covering gas fees for user transactions, addressing a major pain point in the crypto space.</p>



<p><em>“Account Abstraction offers a solution by allowing users to bypass these costs if a third party, such as a fintech wallet provider, is willing to cover them. In this case, the wallet provider or dApps can act as Paymasters, covering gas fees for users and significantly reducing friction. The ERC-4337 Paymaster concept can be a potential way to incentivize user adoption by making it free for users to transact through their wallet platform,” </em>the firm added.</p>



<p>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has previously expressed his longstanding interest in gas fees Account Abstraction, calling it a dream of the Ethereum developer community. Buterin recommends the use of social recovery wallets and multi-signature wallets for crypto investors to achieve self-custody of their assets.</p>



<p>Thus, with the imminent implementation of ERC-4337 and the emergence of smart contract wallets, wallet security, as well as payments, are expected to improve significantly for VISA users opening doors to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/visa-wants-to-create-an-ecosystem-to-make-crypto-more-accessible-like-other-currencies/">wider adoption</a> of cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>In the latest development in the fight against cybercrime, Binance, the world&#8217;s leading cryptocurrency exchange, has collaborated with US law enforcement to seize $4.4 million and freeze accounts connected to North Korean organized crime.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, May 24, Binance took to Twitter to express its fulfilment in its collaboration with US law enforcement agencies, highlighting the crucial role played by its investigations team in uncovering and taking action against North Korean criminal entities.</p>



<p><em>“We are proud to have assisted US law enforcement in seizing $4.4M and freezing accounts linked to North Korean organized crime,” the </em>exchange <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1661474788370690049">wrote</a>.</p>



<p><em>“We proactively took action against accounts connected to these individuals over a year ago, in compliance with lawfully served warrants and in collaboration with law enforcement,” </em>it added.</p>



<p>Binance’s statement follows a Tuesday announcement by the US Department of the Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) that it had sanctioned five entities involved in malicious cyber activities supporting the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK).</p>



<p><em>“The DPRK conducts malicious cyber activities and deploys information technology (IT), workers who fraudulently obtain employment to generate revenue, including in virtual currency, to support the Kim regime and its priorities, such as its unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs</em>,” wrote OFAC.</p>



<p>As previously reported, the DPRK has been engaging in cyber activities worldwide, primarily aimed at stealing funds to support its <a href="https://zycrypto.com/north-korea-is-stealing-your-crypto-to-fund-its-ballistic-missile-program-un-report/">illicit programs</a>. According to the OFAC, the Pyongyang University of Automation, recognized as one of the DPRK&#8217;s top cyber training institutions, has been responsible for nurturing malicious cyber actors, many of whom operate under the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), the primary intelligence agency behind the DPRK&#8217;s cyber operations.</p>



<p>The RGB, a controlled entity of the North Korean government and previously sanctioned by OFAC, oversees the activities of several cybercriminal groups, including the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/norway-recovers-5-9-million-out-of-axie-infinity-loot-from-notorious-lazarus-group/">Lazarus Group</a> which is responsible for several significant cryptocurrency heists in 2022. In March 2023, a UN Panel of Experts revealed in a report that DPRK cyber actors stole a record amount of virtual currency in 2022, surpassing previous years.</p>



<p>That said, while this is not the first time Binance has collaborated with US law enforcement in combating cybercrime, the US government has remained tight-lipped on such claims, perhaps due to its restrained relationship with the exchange. In January and February, the exchange <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-and-huobi-freeze-funds-linked-to-100m-harmony-one-hack-124-btc-recovered/">announced</a> the freezing of more than $100 million linked to the Harmony One hack last year in collaboration with Huobi. </p>



<p>Despite the lack of proper recognition, Binance reaffirmed its commitment to promoting a safe and secure environment for cryptocurrency transactions, noting that it will continue to “work closely with authorities around the world every day to help prevent crimes and take action against bad actors.”</p>

<p>It has been a relatively stable week for Bitcoin, with the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization witnessing minimal fluctuations in its price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin saw its largest red day on Wednesday after dropping around 3% amid worries over US debt uncertainties and President <a href="https://zycrypto.com/joe-biden-slams-wealthy-crypto-traders-what-you-need-to-know-on-the-presidents-anti-bitcoin-stance/">Biden’s stance</a> against tax waivers for crypto traders. However, the price managed to regain ground late Thursday after a brief dip to $25,995, pushing past the key resistance level of $26,000 and closing at $26,500.</p>



<p>Overall, while the price has not moved much since mid-May, a key metric exchange metric has emerged, allowing investors to gauge potential shifts within a price range that has held over the past two or so weeks.</p>



<p>On Thursday, May 25, Tomáš Hančar, an analyst at on-chain analytics firm Cryptoquant highlighted that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/key-bitcoin-metric-reaches-crucial-support-level-can-price-pull-a-2021-like-rally/">Bitcoin</a> had seen a significant drop in exchange inflows, reaching a six-year low. According to the pundit, the trend, which began in early May 2023, has continued at a rapid pace, with the current levels not witnessed since mid-January 2017.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>Exchange depositing transactions have been breaking historical lows since early May &#8217;23,”</em> the pundit wrote.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="409" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-28-1024x409.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81398" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-28-1024x409.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-28-300x120.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-28-768x307.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-28.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>One potential reason for this shift has been the lingering distrust among speculators and investors following the FTX controversy. According to the pundit, the fallout from the FTX revelation as an actual Ponzi scheme has led to a &#8220;flight to safety&#8221; in the form of self-custody. As a result, many individuals have been opting for self-storage as the preferred method for long-term asset preservation.</p>



<p>“<em>The message of &#8220;not your keys, not your coins&#8221; has simply been getting traction,”</em> he added.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the analyst also pointed out a delay in new investors entering the market, whom he referred to as &#8220;tourists.&#8221; These individuals have yet to recognize the potential of the current upward market trend. According to him, these investors are unaware of the opportunities because they are not keeping up with the current market conditions. For this reason, he noted that it may take a few more weeks or even months for them to realize that the “<em>bull market has basically been in its early phase since the FTX capitulation candle back in early Nov last year.”</em></p>



<p>That said, while the decline in exchange depositing transactions could indicate the early signs of a new bull market, Tomáš Hančar emphasized the need to consider other on-chain indicators. Notably, the overall network activity, the rising number of wallets, including the general downward trend of miners to exchange flow support this hypothesis.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, as the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors&#8217; growing inclination towards self-custody for assets such as Bitcoin demonstrates a desire for greater control and security and is positive for Bitcoin&#8217;s price.</p>



<p>At press time on Friday, Bitcoin was trading at $26,829, up 2.21% in the past 24 hours. In the past week, the cryptocurrency has lost a mere 1.56%, according to CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>On May 25, the South Korean National Assembly passed the &#8220;Kim Nam Guk Prevention Law,&#8221; which requires legislators and high-ranking government officials to disclose their cryptocurrency holdings.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.news1.kr/articles/5058538">News1</a>, the amendments to the National Assembly Law were approved with broad support, ensuring that cryptocurrencies are included in the legislators&#8217; register of private interests.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-new-law-aims-to-promote-transparency-and-prevent-abuses-of-authority"><strong>The new law aims to promote transparency and prevent abuses of authority</strong></h2>



<p>This new law aims to promote integrity and transparency in the government by addressing concerns about the potential misuse of cryptocurrencies by lawmakers and public officials.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the Public Officials Ethics Act amendment also mandates high-ranking public officials, including legislators, to register their cryptocurrency assets.</p>



<p>These measures were taken in response to suspicions and controversies surrounding Representative Kim Nam Guk, a member of the Democratic Party, who was accused of owning cryptocurrencies valued at up to 6 billion won (over $4.5 million). This raised concerns about possible conflicts of interest and insider trading activities.</p>



<p>Leaders from different political parties, including the People Power Party and the Democratic Party of Korea, expressed agreement on the need to pass this law during a meeting with the Speaker of the National Assembly.</p>



<p>Therefore, it is expected that with the approval of this law, transparency regarding the cryptocurrency holdings of public officials will become a reality in South Korea, strengthening public trust in institutions while enhancing cryptocurrency regulation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>South Korea continues to make progress in cryptocurrency regulation</strong></h2>



<p>In April 2023, the South Korean National Assembly passed the cryptocurrency regulation bill, overcoming the most significant initial obstacle before becoming law.</p>



<p>Hwang Suk-jin, a Special Committee on Digital Assets of the People Power Party member, stated that following the National Assembly&#8217;s approval, he expects it to become law in the first half of the year. It only requires approval from the legislative and judicial committees.</p>



<p>The bill requires cryptocurrency <a href="https://zycrypto.com/south-koreas-aml-watchdog-goes-after-16-crypto-exchanges-operating-without-registration/">service providers</a> to keep users&#8217; funds separate and secure, avoiding mixing them with their own funds. This has been a controversial issue that several countries are including in their regulations following the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/revealed-sam-bankman-fried-secretly-loaned-crypto-news-site-the-block-and-its-ceo-43-million/">alleged embezzlement</a> by <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-ceo-cz-calls-sam-bankman-fried-a-fraudster-reveals-the-real-reason-behind-ftx-crash/">Sam Bank-Fried</a> at the now-bankrupt exchange, FTX.</p>



<p>Likewise, the bill establishes penalties such as imprisonment and fines up to five times the illicit gains for those who fail to comply with the new regulations. Additionally, courts could impose maximum sentences such as life imprisonment in cases where reported losses to victims exceed $3.73 million.</p>

<p>Circle, a well-known stablecoin issuer, has released the Euro Coin on the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/circle-rolls-out-usdc-cross-chain-transfer-protocol-for-ethereum-and-avalanche-networks/">Avalanche network</a>, marking a huge extension beyond its Ethereum basis, in a bold move intended to increase stablecoin accessibility.</p>



<p>Circle hopes to develop a multi-chain presence for its Euro Coin by utilising the Avalanche blockchain, giving consumers more alternatives and boosting the stablecoin&#8217;s acceptance. The selection of Avalanche, a platform renowned for its scalability and low transaction costs, demonstrates Circle&#8217;s drive to innovation and its commitment to offering customers a wide variety of options.</p>



<p>The partnership between Circle and Avalanche is an important point in the evolution of stablecoin ecosystems. The technical team at Circle worked closely with Avalanche to make sure that the Euro Coin was integrated into the new blockchain without any issues. The safe connection between the Avalanche blockchain and the Euro Coin allows for quick transactions while preserving the usefulness and stability of the digital asset.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrency community has paid close attention to the introduction of the Euro Coin on Avalanche. This action not only solidifies Circle&#8217;s position as a market leader in stablecoins but also demonstrates its commitment to going beyond Ethereum.</p>



<p>In a press release, Joao Reginatto, VP of Product at Circle, stated: “By launching Euro Coin on Avalanche’s fast and efficient platform, we can help developers and their users experience near-instant, more cost-effective financial transactions and unlock new possibilities for payments, remittances and 24/7 FX.”</p>



<p>As a result of its expansion onto Avalanche, Circle now has access to the fast-expanding Avalanche ecosystem, enabling strategic alliances with ongoing initiatives and encouraging fresh partnerships. The Euro Coin is widely accepted inside the Avalanche network and is interoperable, positioning it as a reliable medium of trade and piquing interest from both businesses and investors.</p>



<p>Other stablecoin issuers will be inspired to venture beyond their initial blockchain foundations by Circle&#8217;s ground-breaking action, which serves as a model for others. The introduction of the Euro Coin on Avalanche highlights the sector&#8217;s dedication to innovation and blockchain compatibility.</p>



<p>The development of the Euro Coin on the Avalanche network sets the path for a more durable and connected future for stablecoins. With more options for users and a drive towards a multi-chain ecosystem, this development pushes the limits of stablecoin acceptance.</p>



<p>With increasing collaboration, innovation, and more opportunities within the cryptocurrency environment, Circle&#8217;s Euro Coin on Avalanche represents a significant development in the stablecoin market. This revelation reverberates as evidence of the persistent pursuit of advancement within the digital asset space, where limitations are persistently pushed to create a more inclusive and stable financial ecosystem.</p>
