			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Deutsche Bank is seeking to increase its income in the digital assets space and has applied for a licence in Germany.</p>
A potential income stream
<p>According to a report earlier on BNN Bloomberg, the largest German bank has applied to the regulator for a licence to be able to custody cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.</p>
<p>Bloomberg quoted David Lynne, Head of Deutsche&rsquo;s commercial banking unit, who said at a conference on Tuesday:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re building out our digital assets and custody business. We just put our application into the Bafin for the digital asset license,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lynne was also quoted as saying that the licence application was part of a strategy to increase fee income at Deutsche&rsquo;s corporate bank division, something that is also being done at Deutsche&rsquo;s investment arm DWS Group.</p>
Institutions finally entering the crypto space
<p>The Deutsche Bank move into crypto is fresh on the heels of other major institutional sallies in this direction. Blackrock&rsquo;s filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF was announced late last week, while Fidelity is also rumoured to be doing the same thing, as well as eyeing up the possible purchase of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.</p>
<p>It does seem rather portentous that just as retail investors are fleeing the cryptocurrency market in droves, some of the biggest Western institutions are going in the opposite direction and are finally entering the crypto asset space.</p>
Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s colourful past
<p>However, not all in the cryptocurrency sector might be appreciative of Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s latest step into the world of digital assets. Some might say that in the traditional finance world Deutsche Bank makes FTX look like a man stealing a loaf of bread.</p>
<p>The largest of the German banks has been made to pay many millions of dollars in fines over recent years for an absolute litany of financial misdemeanours that range from interest rate manipulation, to bribes, to Russian money laundering, and to turning a blind eye to Jeffery Epstein&rsquo;s use of the bank, to name but a few.</p>
<p>Add to this that Deutsche Bank is said to be in a parlous financial situation and could be one of the next banks to fall. Although given that it is judged to be one of the Globally Systemically Important Banks (GSIBs), in short &ldquo;too big to fail&rdquo;, central banks might potentially backstop Deutsche if it came to it.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A recent report by the Financial Times revealed Crypto.com operates proprietary trading and market-making teams. </p>
<p>A report by the Financial Times revealed that Singapore-based crypto exchange Crypto.com has teams trading tokens for profit. Citing five unnamed people with direct knowledge of the company&rsquo;s trading practices, the report indicates that the exchange operates proprietary trading and market-making teams.</p>
<p>One of the persons with direct knowledge about the exchange&rsquo;s trading teams said executives at Crypto.com gave external trading houses &ldquo;absolutely dramatic sworn statements that Crypto.com was in no way involved in trading.&rdquo; Another person said employees at the exchange were asked to &ldquo;say there is no internal market maker type operation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crypto.com denied these claims and said employees were not asked to lie to other trading houses. The exchange conceded that it does have an internal market maker but said, &ldquo;This is not a controversial practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We have an internal market maker that operates on the Crypto.com exchange and that internal market maker is treated exactly the same as third-party market makers that identically facilitate tight spreads and efficient markets on our platform.</p>

Exchange Revenue Is Derived from Its Retail Trading App
<p>The exchange told media publication Decrypt that it does not rely on proprietary trading as a source of revenue, as the Financial Times reported. In an email, the exchange said:</p>

<p>This market making activity is a regulated practice, as long as there is a level playing field, i.e. all market makers have to follow the same ruleset, that assures market fairness &amp; integrity.</p>

<p>The company further told the Financial Times that most of its revenue comes from its retail trading app, where the exchange was traders&rsquo; counterparty for transactions and which operated as a broker model.</p>

<p>As such, the Crypto.com trading team ensures that Crypto.com is risk neutral by hedging these positions on a number of venues, including the Crypto.com exchange, the exchange said.</p>

<p>One of the people familiar with the matter said the company&rsquo;s proprietary trading desk trades on Crypto.com&rsquo;s exchange and other venues. Another person added that the proprietary trading team&rsquo;s sole objective is the make money &ldquo;and not facilitating an exchange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The exchange&rsquo;s trading practices have been called into question during intense regulatory scrutiny in the US. The SEC recently accused crypto exchange Binance and its rival Coinbase of securities violations. In response to the lawsuits, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler told CNBC:</p>

<p>These trading platforms, they call themselves exchanges, are commingling a number of functions.</p>

<p>He added:</p>

<p>In traditional finance, we don&rsquo;t see the New York Stock Exchange also operating a hedge fund, making markets.</p>

Crypto.com Shutters US Institutional Exchange Services
<p>Following the news of the SEC&rsquo;s lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, Crypto.com announced that it would shut down its institutional exchange services for US customers. The exchange explained that demand is drying up due to the current market landscape in the US.</p>
<p>The company did not specifically reference the regulatory action, but it was undoubtedly a concern for the exchange.</p>

<p>The Financial Services and Markets Bill (FSMB) on Monday received approval from the second chamber of the Houses of Parliament, the House of Lords. The bill already received support from the House of Commons and will now enter its final stages: Consideration of Amendments and Royal Assent.</p>
<p>Lawmakers indicated that the June 19 proceedings were part of a &ldquo;tidy up&rdquo; operation to ensure the bill is &ldquo;effectual.&rdquo;</p>

&mdash; House of Lords (@UKHouseofLords) June 19, 2023
<p>

</p>
FSMB Likely to Become Law Soon
<p>The 340-page FSMB was introduced in July 2022 in an attempt to stabilize Britain&rsquo;s financial condition post-Brexit. The original bill included plans to regulate stablecoins, but provisions for managing crypto as a regulated activity were later included. Legislators subsequently added crypto promotion supervision as the bill passed through parliament.</p>
<p>The FSMB will now undergo its final stages before becoming law: Consideration of Amendments and then, finally, Royal Assent.</p>
<p>Consideration of Amendments is the bill&rsquo;s final reading by both Houses of Parliament. During this final reading, the House of Commons will amend the bill before the House of Lords approves or deny these changes. The bill will then go between the two Houses until they reach an agreement.</p>
<p>Following approval from the Houses, the bill will undergo Royal Assent, where King Charles III formally agrees to make the bill a law.</p>
<p>The FSMB will likely become law soon. Andrew Griffith, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said in April that crypto regulation could be expected within the next 12 months as the UK positions itself to become the next global crypto hub.</p>
UK To Introduce Stricter Crypto Marketing Rules
<p>Recently, the UK&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that it would introduce tighter advertising rules for the crypto industry, which will take force in October. Under the new guidelines, the FCA did away with &ldquo;refer a friend&rdquo; incentive bonuses and introduced a cooling-off period for first-time crypto buyers.</p>
<p>The authority will also prohibit giving away free NFTs and cryptocurrencies via airdrops to encourage users to invest in digital assets. The FCA will not ban NFTs and airdrops, merely promotions involving them.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">Due to fear of attacks from the U.S. SEC, investors are selling cryptocurrencies, and some companies have begun utilizing this opportunity to aggressively increase their holdings of coins and tokens while their prices are low, hoping that after fears end, they will increase in value.</p>
<p class="s3">Now, big institutions are increasing their Bitcoin exposure even though the prices have begun plummeting toward the red zone. Alongside all of this, Tradecurve, an upcoming hybrid exchange, has been forming a bullish pattern.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s7">Why Large Companies Are Bullish on Bitcoin</p>
<p class="s3">Throughout the recent months, large corporations have injected huge amounts of liquidity into MicroStrategy, and some of the largest companies to do so include BlackRock and Fidelity, alongside Bank of America. For corporations that are not interested in buying Bitcoin directly, MicroStrategy shares typically serve as a reliable proxy investment, with the goal of getting exposure to the price performance of BItcoin. BlackRock and Fidelity are the top five stock owners of the company, as reported by CNN.</p>
<p class="s3">With all of that taken into consideration, Bitcoin has been trading at a value of $25,528.55 as of June 16, 2023. In the last week, the low point for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency was at $24,864.61, while the high point was at $26,653.24.</p>
<p class="s3">Moreover, the all-time high of Bitcoin occurred on November 10, 2021, at $69,044.77, indicating that the cryptocurrency now trades 62.96% under this point of value. In the last 30 days, Bitcoin decreased in value by 4.9%, while in the last 24 hours, it saw an increase of 2.4%.</p>
<p class="s7">Tradeucurve Has Begun Forming a Bullish Price Pattern</p>
<p class="s3">After the large accumulation of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency by BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bank of America, it is clear that interest in the blockchain space has spiked, and Tradecurve has also seen a bullish outlook as a direct result of this.</p>
<p class="s3">The TCRV token spiked by 20% in the previous week, and analysts predict that it can spike 50% by the end of June.</p>
<p class="s3">Tradecurve is an emerging player in the online trading ecosystem, and it is undergoing its presale run, offering a unique proposition for investors and traders. The platform combines derivatives and crypto trading within a single platform and eliminates any sign-up KYC checks, prioritizing privacy.</p>
<p class="s3">On Tradedcurve, users from all around the world can trade all derivatives from a single account just by opening one using their email, lining a crypto wallet, and making a deposit. What differentiates Tradecurve from its peers is also the implementation of features such as algorithmic trading using AI and its implementation of Proof of Reserves (PoR).</p>
<p class="s3">With PoR, transparency is prioritized, and with AI trading bots, trades can be executed a lot quicker and more efficiently when compared to manual trading. Analysts are bullish on the future of TCRV as well and predict a climb of 100x, especially when it gets listed on TIer-1 exchanges and on Uniswap.</p>
<p class="s3">During Stage 3 of the presale, TCRV traded at $0.015, and now at Stage 4, its price spiked by 20% to $0.018, indicating a bullish pattern. The presale stage kicked off with a flying start, as even after a day, 4,810,042 TCRV tokens have already been sold, indicating that interest is high in the project.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In recent times, Polygon (MATIC)&mdash;a layer-2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain&mdash;has experienced a decline in its price following regulatory actions, raising concerns among investors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Uwerx, a decentralized finance (DeFi) project, has been making waves with its impressive presale achievement.</p>
<p>Let's delve into the current state of Polygon (MATIC) and Uwerx and explore the factors contributing to their respective performances.</p>
<p class="s6">Will Polygon (MATIC) Emerge Stronger Amidst Regulatory Hurdles?</p>
<p>Polygon (MATIC)&mdash;previously known as Matic Network&mdash;is a groundbreaking platform designed to scale and develop Ethereum infrastructure effortlessly. Its cornerstone is the Polygon SDK, a versatile framework supporting various application types.</p>
<p>By effectively transforming Ethereum into a comprehensive multi-chain system, Polygon (MATIC) introduces the concept of an Internet of Blockchains.</p>
<p>However, the recent regulatory scrutiny by the SEC has cast a shadow on Polygon (MATIC)'s price and future prospects, leading to a decline in its value.</p>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) is currently priced at $0.6473, with a trading volume of $386,410,068 in the last 24 hours. Despite a live market cap of over $6 billion, the value of Polygon (MATIC) has experienced an almost 25% decline during this period.</p>
<p>Market predictions for Q4 2023 indicate a possible price of $1.27 for Polygon (MATIC).</p>
<p class="s6">SolidProof and InterFi Network Audits Validate Uwerx's (WERX) Trustworthiness</p>
<p>Uwerx, the visionary force in the freelance landscape, is on the verge of a groundbreaking launch. Uwerx takes security to unparalleled heights, safeguarding the project's integrity.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Etherscan, an Ethereum block explorer and analytics platform, has launched an innovative tool that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to retrieve and interpret the source code of specific contract addresses. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Dubbed the 'Code Reader,' this application aims to enhance users' understanding of Ethereum source code by harnessing the capabilities of ChatGPT, an algorithmic implementation for natural language developed by OpenAI.</p>
Decoding Ethereum Contracts via AI: A Glimpse into Code Reader
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Powered by ChatGPT, Code Reader's function is to generate insights into Ethereum contracts' source code files based on user prompts. After a user inputs a prompt, the tool responds with AI-generated interpretations of the contract&rsquo;s source code files. In the world of blockchain analytics, Code Reader represents a significant advancement, as it provides comprehensive lists of smart contract functions related to Ethereum data and offers deep insights into the interactions of the underlying contract with decentralized applications.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Using Code Reader, however, requires a valid OpenAI API Key and sufficient OpenAI usage limits. The tool does not store any user's API keys, safeguarding user privacy and data security.</p>
Etherscan&rsquo;s Beta Integration of ChatGPT: A Prudent Approach
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While Etherscan's integration of ChatGPT signals a major leap forward, the company maintains a cautious stance. The firm highlighted that the newly launched Code Reader is currently in its beta phase and that user feedback is actively encouraged for the tool&rsquo;s refinement.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Importantly, Etherscan reminds users that the tool is for informational purposes only and cautions them against taking ChatGPT's responses at face value. This precautionary approach relates to the AI industry's common issue known as "hallucinating," where AI may generate false or misleading results not supported by real-world data. In light of this, Etherscan has been explicit in advising users to always verify the responses they receive from the tool.</p>
AI in Blockchain Analytics: Future Prospects and Challenges
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch of Etherscan's Code Reader comes amid a growing trend of AI integration in blockchain analytics, seen with Alchemy's recent launch of its own ChatGPT-based tool, AlchemyAI. However, the burgeoning role of AI in the blockchain industry also presents considerable challenges, especially regarding feasibility and data capacity.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A report by Singaporean venture capitral firm Foresight Ventures highlighted the substantial resources required to train large AI models, which can exceed the capacity of most networks. This report suggests that small AI models remain a more feasible choice, underlining the need for caution amidst the excitement surrounding the integration of larger AI models like ChatGPT.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Etherscan&rsquo;s launch of the AI-powered Code Reader, and its integration of ChatGPT, marks a significant development in the use of AI in blockchain analytics. However, the challenges presented by AI hallucinations and data capacity constraints underline the importance of careful management and continuous improvement in this fast-paced industry.</p>

After a user inputs a prompt, the tool responds with AI-generated interpretations of the contract&rsquo;s source code files. In the world of blockchain analytics, Code Reader represents a significant advancement, as it provides comprehensive lists of smart contract functions related to Ethereum data and offers deep insights into the interactions of the underlying contract with decentralized applications.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Using Code Reader, however, requires a valid OpenAI API Key and sufficient OpenAI usage limits. The tool does not store any user's API keys, safeguarding user privacy and data security.</p>
Etherscan&rsquo;s Beta Integration of ChatGPT: A Prudent Approach
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While Etherscan's integration of ChatGPT signals a major leap forward, the company maintains a cautious stance. The firm highlighted that the newly launched Code Reader is currently in its beta phase and that user feedback is actively encouraged for the tool&rsquo;s refinement.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Importantly, Etherscan reminds users that the tool is for informational purposes only and cautions them against taking ChatGPT's responses at face value. This precautionary approach relates to the AI industry's common issue known as "hallucinating," where AI may generate false or misleading results not supported by real-world data. In light of this, Etherscan has been explicit in advising users to always verify the responses they receive from the tool.</p>
AI in Blockchain Analytics: Future Prospects and Challenges
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch of Etherscan's Code Reader comes amid a growing trend of AI integration in blockchain analytics, seen with Alchemy's recent launch of its own ChatGPT-based tool, AlchemyAI. However, the burgeoning role of AI in the blockchain industry also presents considerable challenges, especially regarding feasibility and data capacity.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A report by Singaporean venture capitral firm Foresight Ventures highlighted the substantial resources required to train large AI models, which can exceed the capacity of most networks. This report suggests that small AI models remain a more feasible choice, underlining the need for caution amidst the excitement surrounding the integration of larger AI models like ChatGPT.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Etherscan&rsquo;s launch of the AI-powered Code Reader, and its integration of ChatGPT, marks a significant development in the use of AI in blockchain analytics. However, the challenges presented by AI hallucinations and data capacity constraints underline the importance of careful management and continuous improvement in this fast-paced industry.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance-backed BNB Chain has unveiled opBNB, a new Layer-2 testnet designed to address the pressing scalability challenges that have slowed the mass adoption of blockchain technology.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This Optimism-based Layer-2 network offers promising solutions, aiming to increase transaction speed, lower costs, and enhance network security.</p>
Unveiling opBNB: The New Era of Scalability
<p class="md-end-block md-p">On June 19, BNB Chain announced the opBNB testnet launch, an innovation in the blockchain space that seeks to enhance the scalability of the BNB Smart Chain (BSC). opBNB represents a tangible commitment to ensure a seamless, efficient experience for users, developers, and projects within the BSC ecosystem. This development is a clear demonstration of BSC's ambition to bring the power of blockchain to everyone, despite falling to exploits in the past.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">An Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible layer-2 chain, opBNB uses Optimism OP Stack to further bolster BSC's scalability while maintaining cost-effectiveness and security. This revolutionary layer-2 solution leverages Optimistic Rollups, a technique that reduces computational load on the main chain by executing transactions off-chain and only posting transaction data on-chain.</p>
Scaling Beyond the Challenges
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Blockchain networks often grapple with network congestion and high fees during periods of heightened network demand. The existing BNB Chain can handle around 2,000 transactions per second at transaction costs of roughly $0.10. However, with opBNB's advanced features, the Binance blockchain network is set to push its gas limit to an incredible 100 million per block, a considerable increase from the 30 million limit allowed by Optimism.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This dramatic upgrade will allow opBNB to process over 4,000 transfer transactions per second, with the average transaction cost dropping to less than $0.005. These improvements are part of opBNB&rsquo;s efforts to streamline data accessibility, enhance the caching layer, and addjust the submission process algorithm to allow simultaneous operations.</p>
The Potential Impact of opBNB
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The introduction of opBNB marks a turning point in BSC&rsquo;s evolution, offering enhanced scalability and robust security measures that will enable the network to cater to a growing user base and expand its range of applications. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">For developers and projects, opBNB provides a solid, EVM-compatible platform for building diverse ecosystems and reaching more users. It offers a substantially improved throughput and lower transaction costs, providing a more seamless user experience. Projects previously hampered by the high volume of transactions on BSC can now thrive in the new, more scalable opBNB environment.</p>
Skeptics and Prospects
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite the promising innovation, some critics, such as Cinneamhain Ventures partner Adam Cochran, argue that BNB Chain&rsquo;s decision to launch an Optimism fork, instead of opting for other options like becoming a layer-2 directly on Ethereum or even a layer-3 on Optimism or Arbitrum, doesn&rsquo;t make sense. He blamed the scaling issues on the centralization of an Ethereum fork and unsafe gas limit settings.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite skepticism, opBNB continues to show potential, especially given BNB Chain&rsquo;s status as the third-largest blockchain network in terms of DeFi total value locked. Its TVL stands at $3.38 billion, with a 24-hour volume of $264 million and roughly a million active daily userrs.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch of opBNB invites developers and projects to experiment, build, and contribute to the broader BSC ecosystem, fostering the future of blockchain technology and paving the way for the next generation of blockchain innovation.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Ethereum's journey towards sclability and improved efficiency took a promising turn with the unveiling of a research proposal by an Ethereum research team, consisting of Mike Neuder, Francesco D&rsquo;Amato, Aditya Asgaonkar, and Justin Drake.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">This proposed solution centers around the increase of the MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE (MaxEB), an Ethereum parameter currently capping the effective balance of Ethereum validators at 32 ETH.</p>
A Case for Bloating: Validator Set Size
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Under the current structure, the MaxEB has inadvertently caused the validator set size to bloat, compelling large-scale staking operations to run a vast number of validators. With over 600,000 active validators and an additional 90,000 in the activation queue, the Ethereum network experiences substantial strain. This proposal asserts that by increasing the MaxEB, it's possible to unblock future consensus layer upgrades, improve the performance of the current consensus mechanism and peer-to-peer (p2p) layer, and enhance operational efficiency for validators of all scales.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Preserving Decentralization, Enhancing Efficiency</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The research team emphasizes the need to maintain Ethereum's core principle of decentralization while simultaneously boosting efficiency. As such, the proposed increase in MaxEB does not tamper with the 32 ETH minimum requirement to become a validator. The aim is for an opt-in approach, offering validators a choice to partake in the changes.</p>
Unlocking Ethereum's Roadmap: SSF and ePBS
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Ethereum roadmap includes significant consensus layer improvements, such as single-slot finality (SSF) and enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation (ePBS). Currently, these upgrades are hampered by the inflated size of the validator set. Increasing the MaxEB could potentially facilitate the realization of these roadmap goals, which are critical to Ethereum's evolution and efficiency.</p>
Relieving the Consensus Layer, Improving Rewards
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Ethereum's consensus layer experiences high stress levels due to the massive validator set size. A case in point is the multi-epoch delays in finalization the beacon chain faced in May 2023. By opting for an increased MaxEB, validators could choose to keep their stake wjithin the protocol for compounded rewards, thereby mitigating some of this strain.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In addition, the proposal outlines potential benefits for validators themselves. A higher MaxEB could democratize the compounding of stake, benefitting solo-stakers, who currently do not earn staking rewards above the existing MaxEB. For large-scale stakers tasked with managing thousands of validators, this change could significantly reduce operational overheads.</p>
Assessing Potential Trade-offs
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While counter-arguments against raising the MaxEB exist&mdash;primarily the appeal of the current simplicity and considerations around committees&mdash;the research team believes the proposed benefits significantly outweigh potential costs. The adoption of this proposal could mark a significant step towards a more sustainable and upgradeable Ethereum consensus layer, offering a feasible solution to Ethereum's scalability challenges.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance has confirmed that it is setting up Bitcoin Lightning nodes in order to scale and speed up Bitcoin transactions.</p>
Binance creates Bitcoin Lightning Network Nodes
<p>The Lightning Network uses micropayment channels which facilitate faster and cheaper off-chain transactions. By deploying Lightning Network nodes, Binance is looking to improve the speed and efficiency of Bitcoin transactions, allowing for seamless and near-instantaneous transfers.</p>
<p>Binance recently tweeted from its Twitter account, confirming that it was indeed setting up new lightning nodes, and that these would be used to enhance deposits and withdrawals.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">#Binance is working to integrate the #Bitcoin Lightning Network for deposits and withdrawals. Some eagle-eyed users spotted our new lightning nodes recently. Yes - that's us!

&mdash; Binance (@binance) June 20, 2023
<p>

</p>
Enhancing Scalability and Transaction Speeds
<p>The integration of the Bitcoin Lightning Network is a strategic move by Binance to address the long-standing scalability issues faced by Bitcoin. The Lightning Network's off-chain protocol facilitates micropayments and considerably reduces transaction fees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Binance recognises the importance of tackling these challenges to ensure a more efficient and user-friendly trading experience on its platform. By leveraging Lightning Network's capabilities, Binance aims to significantly enhance transaction speeds while reducing costs, ultimately benefiting its user base.</p>
Driving Mainstream Adoption
<p>It might be guessed that the primary motivation is to accelerate the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies by overcoming one of Bitcoin's key limitations: scalability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the leading player among the crypto exchanges, Binance will always look to implement such innovative solutions. Both Kraken and Bitfinex have already integrated the Lightning Network, and therefore it was only a matter of time before Binance followed suit.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>According to recent reports, Fidelity Investments could be going down the Blackrock route and applying for Bitcoin spot ETFs.&nbsp;</p>
First Blackrock, Now Fidelity&nbsp;
<p>Blackrock&rsquo;s decision to apply for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) seems to have encouraged another leading asset management firm to go down the same route and capitalize on the growing demand for crypto investment products among institutional and retail investors. According to an anonymous source, Fidelity Investments applied the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to develop a Bitcoin ETF similar to BlackRock's structure, allowing investors to gain exposure to the digital asset without owning it directly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ETF would primarily focus on physically-backed Bitcoin futures contracts, providing a more regulated and accessible investment vehicle for traditional market participants.</p>
Fidelity Also Eyeing Grayscale?&nbsp;
<p>Furthermore, if the word on the street is to be believed, the latter is also looking to acquire another asset management giant, Grayscale Investments. The latter currently offers the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin through a traditional security. If the rumors are true and if Fidelity is able to successfully acquire Grayscale, then the former asset management firm will gain access to an already established platform for its Bitcoin ETF. With Grayscale&rsquo;s parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), being in financial hot water for some time, Fidelity&rsquo;s possible swooping in could salvage the situation.&nbsp;</p>
Fidelity&rsquo;s Crypto Offerings
<p>The potential move by Fidelity signifies the increasing acceptance and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies by traditional financial institutions. With over $10 trillion in assets under management, Fidelity's entry into the Bitcoin ETF space would bring significant credibility and legitimacy to the cryptocurrency market, potentially attracting a new wave of institutional investors.</p>
<p>The company already offers several crypto products to its investor base. Notably, Fidelity Investments was the pioneer in providing investors with the opportunity to include cryptocurrency assets in their 401(k) retirement accounts. Additionally, in December 2021, the company introduced the Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF in Canada. To top it all, the company opened access to Bitcoin and Ether trading to all its retail traders in March 2023, further expanding its offerings in the cryptocurrency space.&nbsp;</p>
Will The SEC Approve?&nbsp;
<p>Bitcoin enthusiasts have long awaited the approval of a Bitcoin ETF, as it could potentially open the floodgates for massive institutional investment, driving the price of the digital currency to new heights. Moreover, the introduction of a regulated Bitcoin ETF could also alleviate some of the concerns around market manipulation and investor protection.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that the reports about Fidelity's Bitcoin ETF filing and the potential acquisition of Grayscale remain unconfirmed at this time. As with any financial product, the approval process for a Bitcoin ETF involves rigorous scrutiny from regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The timeline for approval and implementation of such a product can be uncertain.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s market dominance has again breached the 50% mark after two years following the filing of the BlackRock ETF.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This marks the first time since 2021 when China announced a complete ban on crypto mining and Tesla distanced itself from the asset that the dominance metric has risen above 50%.&nbsp;</p>
Recapturing Its Throne&nbsp;
<p>Bitcoin dominance is the measure used to determine how much Bitcoin makes up the total crypto market capitalization. The dominance crossed the 50% mark on the 6th of June, 2023, and then settled slightly lower at $49.9%, according to data sourced from TradingView. At present, Bitcoin dominance is back above the 50% mark, hovering at around 50.5%. This means that Bitcoin now accounts for half of the total $1.1 trillion market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market. Out of this, Bitcoin&rsquo;s currency market capitalization is around $520 billion, according to data from Coingecko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s market dominance has surged by over 10% since the 27th of November 2022. This increase has primarily been driven by investors looking at Bitcoin as a safe haven for their investments following the dramatic collapse of the Sam Bankman-Fried-led FTX exchange and growing regulatory scrutiny of altcoins in the United States of America. Bitcoin was last near the 50% mark in June 2022, after which the crypto markets saw a significant drop thanks to dogged and persistently high inflation in the US. This high inflation led the Federal Reserve to take aggressive steps to contain it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Bitcoin&rsquo;s dominance metric has come under some criticism for under-representing Bitcoin&rsquo;s actual market share by also including stablecoins in its calculations. But, this year has also seen the stablecoin markets struggle, with the Securities and Exchange Commission ordering Paxos to shutter its BUSD in February. This move erased billions from circulation.&nbsp;</p>
Ethereum Holds Steady&nbsp;
<p>While Bitcoin had dropped significantly in 2022, Ethereum had seen an even more significant drop, with the ETH/BTC pair dropping to a ratio of only 0.05%. However, with Bitcoin&rsquo;s market dominance on the upswing, Ethereum (ETH) has held its position quite steady and has been around the 20% mark for the better part of a year. At present, the combined value of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) make up around 70% of the entire crypto market.</p>
Bitcoin Dominance To Grow?&nbsp;
<p>Some, such as MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor, believe that Bitcoin&rsquo;s market dominance will continue to grow, eventually reaching 80% of the total market in the next few years. According to Saylor, increasing regulatory scrutiny and pressure from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission would eventually cause a majority of other market assets to &ldquo;go away.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Regulatory clarity is going to drive #Bitcoin adoption by eliminating the confusion &amp; anxiety that has been holding back institutional investors. Bitcoin dominance will continue to grow as the #Crypto industry rationalizes around $BTC and goes mainstream. The entire industry is destined to be rationalized down to a Bitcoin-focused industry, with maybe half a dozen to a dozen other Proof of Work tokens.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Saylor also blamed the lack of any institutional money making its way to the crypto markets on the confusion and anxiety created by the thousands of other cryptocurrencies that have positioned themselves as an alternative to the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency. He also pointed out that Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has called a commodity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin is the universally, globally-acknowledged digital commodity in this industry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite the fear and uncertainty prevailing in the markets, Bitcoin&rsquo;s value has grown over 3% over the past week. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $26,768, according to data from Coingecko.&nbsp;</p>
The BlackRock Exchange Traded Fund (ETF)
<p>One of the major drivers of Bitcoin&rsquo;s price and dominance in recent days is BlackRock announcing that it is filing for a Bitcoin Spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), according to crypto research firm Santiment. Investors are quietly confident that the ETF may receive approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to a filing by the Nasdaq stock exchange with the SEC, Coinbase Custody Trust Company would be the custodian of the fund&rsquo;s Bitcoin holdings, while the Bank of New York Mellon would custody the fund&rsquo;s fiat currency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, some have also raised concerns about the Bitcoin Spot Exchange Traded Fund after details hidden in the filing shed light on what BlackRock could potentially do in the event of a Bitcoin hard fork. According to the ETF filing, in the event of a hard fork, BlackRock would get to decide which fork to go with, effectively deciding on the future of Bitcoin.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is working on a concept of a global infrastructure to ensure the interoperability of settlements between digital currencies issued by central banks.</p>
A New Class Of Cross-Border Payment Systems&nbsp;
<p>The International Monetary Fund Director stated at a conference in Morocco that the IMF was working on a principle of interoperability. According to her, the concept involves a &ldquo;shared infrastructure.&rdquo; This would help avoid the emergence of settlement blocks, which is the last thing that anyone wants as they look to avoid further economic fragmentation. The International Monetary Fund presented the outline of the new cross-border payment system, which it states uses a single ledger to register and record central bank digital currency (CBDC) transactions, programmability, and improved information management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new platform concept was unveiled on the 19th of June at a roundtable on CBDC policy held in Morocco. The event was held in partnership with the Central Bank of Morocco. At the event, the International Monetary Fund&rsquo;s director of monetary and capital markets department, Tobias Adrian, stated that the new platform could benefit individual and institutional users by offering faster transaction times and significantly lower fees. He added,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of the 45 billion dollars paid to remittance providers every year may then go back in the pockets of the poor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Furthermore, the new platform can help central banks intervene in foreign exchange markets, resolve disputes, and aggregate information on capital flows. It can also be adapted for domestic, wholesale, and retail CBDCs as well.&nbsp;</p>
Details Of The Platform&nbsp;
<p>Further details about the platform, called the XC (cross-border payment and contracting) platform, were disclosed in an IMF FinTech note. The note was co-authored by the International Monetary Fund&rsquo;s monetary and capital markets department director and released the same day as the announcement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;XC platforms offer a trusted single ledger &ndash; a document representing property rights -- on which standardized digital representations of central bank reserves in any currency can be exchanged.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The XC platform has been designed on the same model as the infrastructure of central bank digital currencies. It would consist of a settlement layer with a single layer and access to the layer would be gradually expanded. At present, institutions must have a reserve account with their respective central banks in order to conduct cross-border operations. However, the XC platform would directly allow the trading of tokenized central bank reserves, with liquidity still coming from institutions that held reserve accounts.</p>
<p>The XC platform will also offer a programming layer that would give institutions the opportunity to innovate and customize their services as required, while an AML layer would help to meet privacy protections and trust conditions. The platform would also not require CBDCs. Instead, the platform would facilitate interoperability between assets and money tokenized by the private sector and create standards and a safe environment to program financial contracts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a press statement, the IMF Managing Director stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we proceed to the upcoming 2023 IMF and World Bank Annual Meetings, I have just wrapped up an excellent panel discussion with Governor of Bank Al Maghrib Abdellatif Jouahri on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) as part of the High-level Policy Roundtable on Central Bank Digital Currencies: The Role of the Public Sector in Money and Payments &ndash; A New Vision.&rdquo;</p>

The Rise Of CBDCs&nbsp;
<p>According to a report by the Atlantic Council, 11 countries have launched their own central bank digital currency. Additionally, all G7 countries are currently in the developmental stage of creating a CBDC. A total of 114 countries, representing 95% of the global gross domestic product, are exploring creating a central bank digital currency. This is in stark contrast to only 35 countries in 2020. Supporters of central bank digital currencies argue that they can provide significantly better financial services for citizens, while critics argue that they pose a considerable risk to privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although there are signs of a division, the United States is also exploring CBDCs, with treasure officials stating that the agency is looking into privacy concerns associated with CBDCs. The assistant secretary for financial institutions at the US Treasury, Graham Steele, stated at the Transform Payments US 2023 conference that retail CBDCs have pros and cons, with one challenge related to privacy. Some lawmakers, such as Florida Governor and Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis, have openly opposed CBDCs. DeSantis had signed a bill banning CBDCs, making Florida the first state to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The movement to establish a central bank digital currency is an attempt to surveil &amp; control the finances of Americans. It would violate privacy, limit consumer choice &amp; undermine market competitiveness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Republican Senator Ted Cruz has also opposed CBDCs and has even mooted banning the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is working on a concept of a global infrastructure to ensure the interoperability of settlements between digital currencies issued by central banks.</p>
A New Class Of Cross-Border Payment Systems&nbsp;
<p>The International Monetary Fund Director stated at a conference in Morocco that the IMF was working on a principle of interoperability. According to her, the concept involves a &ldquo;shared infrastructure.&rdquo; This would help avoid the emergence of settlement blocks, which is the last thing that anyone wants as they look to avoid further economic fragmentation. The International Monetary Fund presented the outline of the new cross-border payment system, which it states uses a single ledger to register and record central bank digital currency (CBDC) transactions, programmability, and improved information management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new platform concept was unveiled on the 19th of June at a roundtable on CBDC policy held in Morocco. The event was held in partnership with the Central Bank of Morocco. At the event, the International Monetary Fund&rsquo;s director of monetary and capital markets department, Tobias Adrian, stated that the new platform could benefit individual and institutional users by offering faster transaction times and significantly lower fees. He added,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of the 45 billion dollars paid to remittance providers every year may then go back in the pockets of the poor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Furthermore, the new platform can help central banks intervene in foreign exchange markets, resolve disputes, and aggregate information on capital flows. It can also be adapted for domestic, wholesale, and retail CBDCs as well.&nbsp;</p>
Details Of The Platform&nbsp;
<p>Further details about the platform, called the XC (cross-border payment and contracting) platform, were disclosed in an IMF FinTech note. The note was co-authored by the International Monetary Fund&rsquo;s monetary and capital markets department director and released the same day as the announcement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;XC platforms offer a trusted single ledger &ndash; a document representing property rights -- on which standardized digital representations of central bank reserves in any currency can be exchanged.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The XC platform has been designed on the same model as the infrastructure of central bank digital currencies. It would consist of a settlement layer with a single layer and access to the layer would be gradually expanded. At present, institutions must have a reserve account with their respective central banks in order to conduct cross-border operations. However, the XC platform would directly allow the trading of tokenized central bank reserves, with liquidity still coming from institutions that held reserve accounts.</p>
<p>The XC platform will also offer a programming layer that would give institutions the opportunity to innovate and customize their services as required, while an AML layer would help to meet privacy protections and trust conditions. The platform would also not require CBDCs. Instead, the platform would facilitate interoperability between assets and money tokenized by the private sector and create standards and a safe environment to program financial contracts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a press statement, the IMF Managing Director stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we proceed to the upcoming 2023 IMF and World Bank Annual Meetings, I have just wrapped up an excellent panel discussion with Governor of Bank Al Maghrib Abdellatif Jouahri on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) as part of the High-level Policy Roundtable on Central Bank Digital Currencies: The Role of the Public Sector in Money and Payments &ndash; A New Vision.&rdquo;</p>

The Rise Of CBDCs&nbsp;
<p>According to a report by the Atlantic Council, 11 countries have launched their own central bank digital currency. Additionally, all G7 countries are currently in the developmental stage of creating a CBDC. A total of 114 countries, representing 95% of the global gross domestic product, are exploring creating a central bank digital currency. This is in stark contrast to only 35 countries in 2020. Supporters of central bank digital currencies argue that they can provide significantly better financial services for citizens, while critics argue that they pose a considerable risk to privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although there are signs of a division, the United States is also exploring CBDCs, with treasure officials stating that the agency is looking into privacy concerns associated with CBDCs. The assistant secretary for financial institutions at the US Treasury, Graham Steele, stated at the Transform Payments US 2023 conference that retail CBDCs have pros and cons, with one challenge related to privacy. Some lawmakers, such as Florida Governor and Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis, have openly opposed CBDCs. DeSantis had signed a bill banning CBDCs, making Florida the first state to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The movement to establish a central bank digital currency is an attempt to surveil &amp; control the finances of Americans. It would violate privacy, limit consumer choice &amp; undermine market competitiveness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Republican Senator Ted Cruz has also opposed CBDCs and has even mooted banning the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">The highly anticipated full launch of the Ninja Warriors Meta blockchain game is set to take place in Q4 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">However, before this groundbreaking release, the platform launched its second presale, where for every USDT invested, the user receives 66.6666667 NWT. NWT is the native token of the Ninja Warriors Meta gaming platform.</p>
Ninja Warriors Meta's Presale&nbsp;
<p class="s3">In line with the project's roadmap, the NWT presale is already underway before the full launch of Ninja Warrior Meta's blockchain gaming platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">The NWT token is the native token and core of the Ninja Warrior Meta ecosystem. Thus, the presale allows gamers to acquire NWT tokens at a discounted price before the general publicif they intend to fully participate in the full game mode upon launch at the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">The minimum investment amount is 100 USDT, while whales can only buy a maximum of 100,000 USDT. All investors must submit personal details as part of the know-your-customer (KYC) procedure.</p>
<p class="s3">It would also allow gamers and investors to enjoy a share in future developments, enhanced gameplay, immersive game modes, rewards, and an expanded gaming ecosystem.</p>
<p class="s3">The roadmap showcases a clear vision for exponential growth, and the team behind Ninja Warriors Meta is committed to continuous development and strategic partnerships with industry leaders.</p>
<p class="s3">To fund the project's roadmap and ensure widespread adoption and awareness, the NWT presale allows Ninja Warrior Meta to run a dedicated branding phase utilizing organic traffic generation on social media platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">The focus would be expanding the Ninja Warrior Meta community, including captivating press releases, team interviews, and strategic campaigns.</p>
<p class="s3">The presale goes beyond promoting the Ninja Warrior Meta blockchain game through engaging storytelling and content like videos and gameplay showcases.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">Notably, it facilitates gathering like-minded crypto game participants, influential figures, and investors, immersing them in Ninja Warriors Meta.</p>
<p class="s3">Moreover,&nbsp; Ninja Warriors Meta is set to release a move-to-earn (M2E) application for Android and iOS platforms in two months. This application offers users the opportunity to accumulate points through physical activities, including gym visits and diverse movements. These points can be exchanged for DBUSD tokens.</p>
Full-game Launch
<p class="s3">Amid the ongoing NWT presale, since Q3 2022, gaming enthusiasts have been eagerly awaiting the announcement of Ninja Warriors Meta's full-game platform. The game is set for launch in Q4 2023.</p>

<p class="s3">Players would need to get a Ninja Warriors membership to fully participate in all game modes.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">Players that obtain a low-cost monthly subscription are set to receive a free non-fungible token (NFT) character that allows its owner to enter the Ninja Warrior Meta ecosystem and start playing, earning, and progressing.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">Since the Ninja Warrior Meta game would launch on Polygon's layer-2 blockchain, players would also need to set up a MATIC-compatible wallet and fund said wallet with sufficient MATIC for transaction gas fees.</p>
<p class="s3">Players would also expect to earn as they play, covering whatever initial costs were incurred during gameplay. For that reason, Ninja Warriors Meta incorporates an in-game rewards system designed to be fair and sustainable.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Tether, the issuer of USDT, the world&rsquo;s largest stablecoin, has minted the second 1 billion token on the Ethereum blockchain in less than two months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stablecoin issuer has said that the new mint is part of its "inventory replenish" program to ensure stablecoin liquidity across all chains. In other crypto developments, Tradecurve has been building momentum as investors flock to the new trading platform that has the potential to rekindle interest in the DeFi space.</p>
<p></p>
Tether Mints Additional 1 Billion USDT
<p>Tether&rsquo;s treasury has announced the minting of 1 billion USDT tokens on the Ethereum blockchain just two months after a separate 1 billion USDT token was minted. So far in 2023, the stablecoin issuer has now minted over $16 billion worth of USDT tokens. Tether remains the most dominant USD-pegged stablecoin with a market cap of $83 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Announcing the latest mint, Tether&rsquo;s CTO Paolo Ardoino, explained that the tokens were minted for chain swap and not due to a rising interest in the purchase of digital assets. Chain swap refers to the process of sending digital assets (in this case USDT) from one blockchain network to another &ndash; bridging assets across multiple blockchains.</p>
<p>After the mint, on-chain data showed that Tether&rsquo;s Treasury sent $750 million worth of USDT in a chain swap transaction to Binance. According to Arkham Intelligence, the popular blockchain analytical firm, the Tether Treasury sent the funds in three separate batches of $250 million transactions after an initial $10 test transaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The analytical firm later reported that of the $1 billion new tokens minted, only $146 million remains on the Ethereum blockchain as the others have been swapped for USDT on other chains.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Tradecurve (TCRV) Price Set to Hit $0.018
<p>Along with the increasing dominance of Tether in the stablecoin sectors, Tradecurve has enjoyed increasing attention in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Tradecurve is building the first DeFi platform where its users will have the opportunity to trade both cryptocurrencies and derivatives (like stocks, forex, options, and commodities) from a single account.</p>
<p>Experts are bullish that the price of Tradecurve (TCRV) could easily jump above its current $0.018 price because of the magnitude of the derivatives markets. The Bank for International Settlements reports that in June 2022, the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market rose to $632 trillion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bullish predictions for the price of Tradecurve come from the platform&rsquo;s potential to connect the crypto market with the global derivatives market.</p>
<p>Experts believe the Tradecurve platform could rekindle interest in the DeFi space as crypto traders would no longer need to open more than one account to trade global financial instruments. As more traders enter into the Tradecurve ecosystem, experts predict that the price of TCRV could jump from $0.018 to as high as $1.5 by the end of 2023.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Reports indicate that the Venezuelan government may be shutting down its national cryptocurrency, the petro. </p>
<p>The government of Venezuela could be winding down its petro cryptocurrency after members of Sunacrip, the country&rsquo;s crypto watchdog, were found to be involved in a corruption scheme.</p>
<p>Reports by Bloomberg Linea indicate that it could be the end of Venezuela&rsquo;s national oil-backed cryptocurrency, the petro. Three persons linked with the country&rsquo;s crypto regulator said the petro would be liquidated five years after issuance.</p>
<p>Bitcoin.com first shared the news and reported that the decision was made as part of Sunacrip&rsquo;s restructuring. The decision reportedly also includes liquidating the debts contracted with big petro holders, including department stores that decided to accept petro as a payment method.</p>
<p>The decision to restructure Sunacrip came after its head Joselit Ramirez was arrested in March on corruption charges. Venezuelan president Nicolas Madura removed Ramirez from his position for allegedly participating in a plan to steal from the country&rsquo;s oil operations.</p>
<p>Soon after news of Ramirez&rsquo;s alleged involvement in corruption came to light, energy suppliers across the country shut down various crypto-mining operations. Local media reports and&nbsp;tweets&nbsp;from Venezuela&rsquo;s National Association of Cryptocurrencies indicate that crypto mining facilities were shut down in the states of Carabobo, Bolivar, and Lara. Numerous crypto exchanges were also&nbsp;ordered&nbsp;to cease their activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The petro was introduced in 2018 as a way to sidestep sanctions imposed by the Trump and Obama administrations and has largely been viewed as a failure. The introduction of an oil-backed national crypto was met with scepticism from global leaders, and former US president Donald Trump banned US investors from trading in petro.</p>
<p>Introduced amid a financial crisis, Venezuela no longer lists the petro as a currency. When introducing the petro, the Maduro administration permitted several crypto exchanges to operate in the country, introducing Venezuelans to cryptocurrencies as an alternative to their declining currency.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Do Kwon has been sentenced to four months in jail by a Montenegro district court for forging travel documents. </p>
<p>Bloomberg reports that a Montenegrin Basic Court in the country&rsquo;s capital of Podgorica sentenced Do Kwon and his associate Han Chang-Joon to four months in jail for forging travel documents. The infamous co-founder of the collapsed Terraform Labs was arrested in March in Podgorica, where he was found attempting to travel to Dubai with a forged passport.</p>
<p>Kwon and Joon were found guilty of forgery charges, and two Costa Rican and Belgian passports and two identity cards belonging to Kwon and Joon were confiscated.

Do Kwon: An Internationally Wanted Man
<p>Kwon is a South Korean national who stands accused on charges of multibillion-dollar fraud related to the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022.

<p>Following Terra&rsquo;s collapse, South Korean authorities charged Kwon in September for violating its Capital Markets Act and issued a warrant for his arrest.</p>
<p>The International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) accordingly issued a red notice for Kwon, signalling international law enforcement agencies to track him down and arrest him on charges of fraud.</p>
<p>US Federal prosecutors further indicted Kwon with two counts each of securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud, and conspiracy.</p>
<p>Both South Korea and the US are seeking Kwon&rsquo;s extradition.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Supported Above 26236:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 20 June 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) sought to add to recent upside momentum early in the Asian session as the pair moved back above the 26500 level after encountering buying pressure around the 26245.77 area, right around the 23.6% retracement of the broad depreciating range from 31050 to 24750.&nbsp; Selling pressure had previously intensified around the 26783.20 area, representing a test of the 38.2% retracement of the narrower depreciating range from 30050.66 to 24750.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bulls anticipate a decisive break above the 26587.57 area, an upside price objective above which Stops were recently executed and that is associated with buying pressure that emerged around the 24750 and 25143.24 areas.&nbsp; Below the market, downside price objectives include the 25323.24 and 24680.87 levels.&nbsp; Stops are also cited below major retracement levels linked to the 19568.52 and 15460 levels, including the 25094, 23954, 23255, 22278, and 22025 areas.</p>
<p>Additional downside price objectives include the 24440, 23208, and 22769 levels.&nbsp; Following recent price activity, areas of technical resistance and potential selling pressure include the 27528, 27737, 27805, 28200, 28473, and 28873 levels.&nbsp; Upside retracement levels in recent depreciating ranges include the 28700, 28741, 28868, 29243, 29299, and 29284 levels.&nbsp; Above the market, upside price objectives include the 30420.74, 31237.11, 31477.37, 32501.23, 32556.73, 32989.19, 34583.96, 34658.69, 35222.66, 37765.28, and 38403.97 levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 26654.83 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 26470.61.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
