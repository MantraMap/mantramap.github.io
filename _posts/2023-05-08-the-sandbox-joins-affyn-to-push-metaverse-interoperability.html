<p>Popular metaverse platform, The Sandbox, forms a partnership with Singapore-based Web 3 game development firm, Affyn to create an immersive and more interoperable open metaverse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Announced Monday, The Sandbox, a leading decentralized gaming virtual world, has entered into a partnership with Singapore-based games and metaverse developer, Affyn, to enhance the metaverse experiences for both their players. The partnership aims to extend the interoperable metaverse experiences, offering a first-of-its-kind community-focused, interoperable and open metaverse, connecting creators and collaborators across the globe. The partnership aims to create sustainable Web 3 gaming ecosystems and metaverses, converging the physical and virtual worlds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the meeting between the two entities, Lucaz Lee, Ceo and co-founder of Affyn showed excitement about the partnership, promising users and enthusiasts a &ldquo;more immersive and interactive experience&rdquo; following the partnership.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our shared belief and vision of an open metaverse is the driving force behind this collaboration,&rdquo; Lee said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re confident it will provide gamers, collaborators and virtual world enthusiasts with an even more immersive and interactive experience.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a joint statement release, the collaboration aims to bring interoperability within the metaverse and blockchain gaming. The two companies are currently working together to explore interoperability within the open metaverse, allowing for a seamless experience for all communities. As the metaverse community grows, this partnership will allow gamers, creators and collaborators to easily interact across the Sandbox and Affyn metaverse communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the collaboration also aims to educate creators and newcomers in the field, helping them better understand the metaverse and giving them a better opportunity to grow their communities in the metaverse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Sandbox has always been a strong advocate of interoperability and decentralisation,&rdquo; George Wong, Head of Singapore Sandbox said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to see more platforms embracing interoperability as a choice rather than working in independent silos and we hope that this brings forth more creative opportunities and exciting use cases to collaboratively grow the metaverse experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since its launch, The Sandbox has witnessed massive user adoption rates, mainly pushed through its collaboration with A-list stars and global brands. The Web 3 virtual gaming firm has collaborated with over 400 partners including Warner Music Group, Ubisoft, Tony Hawk, Gucci Vault, The Walking Dead, Invincible, Snoop Dogg, Adidas, Deadmau5, Steve Aoki, SM Entertainment, Atari, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Sandbox offering players a platform to create and design their own adventures, the partnership with Affyn will allow players to continuously share stories in the metaverse, bringing together characters and heroes from both virtual worlds into one immersive metaverse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partnership is set to be unveiled in the upcoming Affyn&rsquo;s keynote event, Evolution, on May 10 2023, revealing new features of its virtual game and a new game set to launch later this year.&nbsp;</p>
