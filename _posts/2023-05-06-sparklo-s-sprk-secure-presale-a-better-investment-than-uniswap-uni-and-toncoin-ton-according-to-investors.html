<p class="s6">Toncoin (TON) is currently troubled by a continuous downtrend movement, and an impending price swing is about to shift to the bears in Uniswap (UNI). With hopes of little return on the aforementioned tokens, investment in the Sparklo presale couldn&rsquo;t have come at a better time.</p>
<p class="s8">Uniswap's (UNI) Price Movement is Predicted to Shift to the Bears</p>
<p class="s6">Uniswap's (UNI) recent price movement is showing a bearish trend, with sellers populating the market more than buyers. Uniswap (UNI) has been trading on support, currently at $5.3 in the wake of a 1.77% decline in the past 24 hours at the time of writing.</p>
<p class="s6">The price swing, which is characterized by an increase in selling pressure, is set to shift once more to the bears, with support tested repeatedly. With Uniswap&rsquo;s (UNI) failure to break the $5.6 resistance earlier, it is currently trading at $5.2.</p>
<p class="s6">Considering the technical analysis of Uniswap (UNI), the bearish trend might endure for a while. Investors are bracing for Uniswap&rsquo;s (UNI) downtrend by putting their investment somewhere else, especially in the Sparklo presale.</p>
<p class="s8">Toncoin (TON): Persisting Bearish Movement Frustrates Investors</p>
<p class="s6">Toncoin (TON) is a decentralized Layer-1 blockchain experiencing a continuous downtrend on the 24-hour to 90 days price chart. The hopes of a price swing in Toncoin (TON) were dashed in the past 24 hours after it recorded a 1.9% decline in price.</p>
<p class="s6">With the hope of an upward price movement dampened and no scheduled events to impact the price of Toncoin (TON), investors are frustrated. Consequently, investments in other projects, which promise high profits, are on their cards, over Toncoin (TON). Moreover, the opportunity to invest in the Sparklo presale is too good to be passed up by them, thereby resulting in increased purchases at the expense of Toncoin (TON).</p>

<p class="s12">Sparklo (SPRK): Creating the Possibility to Invest in Bits of Precious Metals</p>
<p class="s6">Before the launch of Sparklo, it was difficult and almost impossible to invest in bits of precious metals such as platinum, gold, and silver. However, with its creation, investors can now invest in any amount of desired rare metals through fractionalized NFTs. Furthermore, investors who purchase the complete NFT will receive real-world assets in their chosen locations.</p>
<p class="s6">The token&rsquo;s presale is worth a competitive price of just $0.017. In addition, a further 30% bonus until May 5th makes the presale even cheaper and has mouth-watering growth potential. According to experts, the price of Sparklo can increase by over 3,000% in the following year.</p>
<p class="s6">With the importance given to transparency, the KYC audit is ongoing and in its final stage, and the smart contract has been successfully audited by InterFi Network, which it passed with no mishaps. Lastly, to promote investment security, the liquidity has been locked for 100 years, thereby dispelling fears of a rug pull.</p>
