<ul>
<li>The digital asset market plummeted 3.6% in the last 24 hours in reaction to the SEC&#8217;s legal action against Binance.</li>



<li>The Commission is alleging a lack of care on the part of Binance by operating an unregistered exchange, commingling, and putting user assets at risk.</li>



<li>Binance has denied all allegations so far adding that they will “<em>vigorously defend”</em> the integrity of its platform.</li>
</ul>



<p>Binance comes under the regulatory scrutiny of the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) once more, with the Commission <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">filing a lawsuit</a> that has sent the market tumbling.</p>



<p>Following the lawsuit filed by the SEC against Binance on June 5, the cryptocurrency market has felt the heat across asset prices, investor sentiments, and other ripple effects of the Commission’s hammer. Both top assets and meme coins have been trading at lows wiping billions off the market cap.</p>



<p>Market leader Bitcoin (BTC) lost 4.2% in the aftermath of the lawsuit, trading below $26,000 for the first time since March. BTC trades at $27,068 at press time, with bearish traders betting on a $24k BTC price. Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, declined by 3.1% in the same period and trades at $1,884.</p>



<p>Other altcoins recorded a much more significant drop culminating in a 3.6% market cap slip in 24 hours per CoinGecko. Elon Musk-backed Dogecoin DOGE plunged 7%, wiping away little gains picked up last week. Leading the pack was PEPE as it continued its free fall, losing 14.9%.</p>



<p>Other assets hit by the development include The Sandbox (SAND), Terra Luna Classic (LUNC), Axie Infinity (AXS), etc. The crypto fear and greed index also points to significant downward market sentiment not recorded since USD Circle lost its dollar&nbsp; peg in March. The radar is in the “fear zone” at 44 down from last week’s “neutral 51.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-binance-to-vigorously-defend"><strong>Binance to “<em>vigorously defend</em>”</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC filed a total of 13 charges against Binance, ranging from illegally operating an exchange, commingling user assets, and conducting the sale of unregistered securities. In a press release issued on Monday, the Commission added that- </p>



<p>“<em>We allege that Zhao and the Binance entities not only knew the rules of the road, but they also consciously chose to evade them and put their customers and investors at risk all in an effort to maximize their own profits.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, Binance has distanced itself from all allegations <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-responds-to-secs-complaint-pledges-vigorous-defense-amid-overwhelming-industry-support/">noting</a> that the exchange has been compliant with regulations and will defend its reputation “vigorously.”</p>



<p>“<em>Any allegations that user assets on the Binance.US platform have ever been at risk are simply wrong. We will vigorously defend against any allegations to the contrary.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The digital asset community has expressed dissatisfaction with the conduct of the SEC and other regulatory bodies recently. In recent months, Binance has been under intense regulatory pressure from the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. </p>

<p>Cardano (ADA) and the broader cryptocurrency market faced a significant setback as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) targeted Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, with a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-responds-to-secs-complaint-pledges-vigorous-defense-amid-overwhelming-industry-support/">lawsuit</a>. The regulatory action contributed to a market-wide price decline, impacting several crypto assets, including Cardano, which dropped over 5% hours after the announcement.</p>



<p>The SEC filed a complaint in the District of Columbia, alleging that Binance has been offering &#8220;unregistered securities&#8221; since its inception. In the complaint, the SEC specifically mentioned several cryptocurrencies that are claimed to fall into this category, including Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), Algorand (ALGO), Filecoin (FIL), and others.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="871" height="370" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-13.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81849" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-13.png 871w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-13-300x127.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-13-768x326.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 871px) 100vw, 871px" /></figure>



<p>In its filing, the SEC provided an overview of Cardano&#8217;s background, expressing concerns about its level of decentralization. In support of its argument, the SEC contended that the Cardano Foundation handles legal custody and brand ownership; IOHK, an engineering firm led by Charles Hoskinson and responsible for blockchain design and maintenance; and Emurgo possessed a substantial portion of ADA&#8217;s overall supply.</p>



<p>“<em>These three entities collectively received 5.2 billion ADA following the initial mining of ADA or approximately 16.7% of the initial token supply of 31.1 billion ADA,” </em>read the complaint.</p>



<p>The regulator asserted that these companies sold the token to finance different aspects of their projects, such as development, marketing, and business operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to the SEC&#8217;s classification, members of the Cardano community took to Twitter to voice their support and counter the allegations. Dr Shweta, a proponent of Ripple, <a href="https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1665758173624401923">emphasized</a> that ADA cannot be considered a security citing the Howey Test, which states that cryptocurrencies meeting certain criteria can be classified as securities.</p>



<p>According to his analysis, Cardano does not meet those criteria, as it was not offered to U.S. investors during its initial coin offering (ICO). He thus argued that it is not a security token, stablecoin, or decentralized finance (DeFi) token.</p>



<p>Another Cardano adherent, Chris O, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheOCcryptobro/status/1665821007368830977">criticized</a> the SEC&#8217;s argument, stating that the complaint overlooked crucial facts. Chris O pointed out that the ADA ICO occurred in Japan and was not accessible to U.S. investors. Moreover, he highlighted the omission of the thousands of stake pool operators who actively participate in running the Cardano protocol. The pundit also expressed confidence in Cardano&#8217;s decentralization, emphasizing that it would be the ultimate shield against such claims.</p>



<p>That said, as the legal battle between the SEC and Binance unfolds, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-scams-will-only-get-worse-with-ai-cardanos-charles-hoskinson-warns/">Cardano</a> proponents remain determined to defend their platform&#8217;s reputation and decentralized nature. It thus remains to be seen how this offensive against the SEC&#8217;s classification will shape the future of Cardano and its standing within the crypto market.</p>



<p>At press time on Tuesday, ADA was trading at $0.356, up 1.3% in the past 24 hours. Other cryptos had also recovered from what most players call FUD by the SEC, with Bitcoin and Ethereum up over 3% over the same duration.</p>

<p>Despite a sluggish beginning to the month, Ethereum is poised to gain bullish momentum, with key fundamental indicators signalling a potentially <a href="https://zycrypto.com/this-pundit-believes-ethereums-price-could-tap-450000-in-the-next-2-decades-heres-why/">positive trajectory</a> ahead.</p>



<p>On Monday, June 5th, onchain analytics firm Santiment shared an interesting observation regarding Ethereum&#8217;s distribution of wealth. In a tweet, the firm reported that a significant amount of Ethereum has been moving into self-custody and decentralized finance (DeFi) options, consolidating these coins within the largest whale addresses on the Ethereum network.</p>



<p><em>“As more and more Ethereum has been moving into self custody &amp; DeFi options, many of these coins have been absorbed by the largest whale addresses on the network. The 10 largest non-exchange addresses now hold an AllTimeHigh 31.8M $ETH worth $59.47B,” </em>wrote Santiment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="643" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-12-1024x643.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81844" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-12-1024x643.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-12-300x188.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-12-768x482.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-12.png 1430w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Notably, the accumulation of these 2.1M coins valued at just over $3.8 billion has continued unabated since 2019, with the holdings of the top 10 non-exchange addresses now surpassing the previous record set in August 2015.</p>



<p>Apart from the allure of discounted prices and the Merge in 2022, these whales&#8217; increased interest in Ethereum can be attributed to the recent Shanghai upgrade. This upgrade has sparked a surge in enthusiasm for Ethereum, leading these whales to capitalize on its potential opportunities.</p>



<p>Today, Cross-chain transaction platform iCrosschain noted that the upgrade has significantly impacted the Ethereum network by enhancing transaction throughput and reducing costs. This has, in turn, enhanced Ethereum&#8217;s potential to reshape the crypto world by opening doors to new possibilities and applications.</p>



<p><em>“With the Shanghai upgrade, more than 3 million ETH has been unstaked on the Ethereum network. Once Ethereum&#8217;s Shanghai upgrade permitted withdrawals from staking contracts, Celsius is reshuffling its staked ETH holdings. The amount of ETH on exchanges has decreased significantly in recent times,”</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/iCrosschain/status/1665700758166335488">added</a> the firm.</p>



<p>These developments and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereums-fate-hangs-in-balance-as-exchange-deposits-spike-to-an-8-month-high/">decreased ETH holdings on exchanges</a> indicate an evolving landscape for Ethereum and its potential to revolutionize the crypto world.</p>



<p>That said, just like Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has been facing price volatility in recent weeks, with the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization now facing another rocky start to the week. Despite remaining fairly stable for most of the day Monday, June 5, Ether plunged by about 5.6% after the US market opened to tap $1,785 after the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">SEC sued Binance</a> for allegedly offering several unregistered securities. </p>



<p>This marks the third consecutive day of decline for the cryptocurrency, with investors now hoping the price can recapture the $1,850 resistance level to avert a further slide southwards. At press time, Ether was trading at $1,884, down 2.50% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today sued Coinbase just a day after <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">cracking down on Binance</a>.</p>



<p>The regulatory body alleges in the new lawsuit that Coinbase failed to register as a broker, national securities exchange, or clearing agency despite providing these services to customers. The SEC also alleges that a number of tokens offered by the crypto exchange qualify as securities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sec-sues-coinbase-for-alleged-securities-violations"><strong>SEC </strong><strong>Sues Coinbase For Alleged Securities Violations</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC has dropped the hammer on Coinbase, a day after the regulator took similar action against Binance, the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange by market capitalization.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908.1.0.pdf">official case file</a>, Coinbase had operated as an unregistered security broker since 2019, nearly two years before the company became the first publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange in April 2021.</p>



<p>The SEC also alleges that the cryptocurrency exchange &#8220;made available for trading, crypto assets that are being offered and sold as investment contracts, and thus as securities.&#8221;</p>



<p>Tokens powering Solana, Cardano, Polygon, The Sandbox, Filecoin, Axie Infinity, Chiliz, Flow, Internet Computer, Near Protocol, Voyager Dash, and Nexo have all been identified as securities by the SEC.</p>



<p>Back in March, the securities watchdog <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-action-against-coinbase-triggers-ballistic-reaction-from-crypto-community/">served </a>Coinbase with a Wells Notice to hint that it would soon bring an enforcement action against the company. Coinbase responded to the Wells Notice in April.</p>



<p><em>“Coinbase has elevated its interest in increasing its profits over investors’ interests, and over compliance with the law and the regulatory framework that governs the securities markets and was created to protect investors and the U.S. capital markets,&#8221; the filing today reads.</em></p>



<p>The SEC also pointed to Coinbase’s staking service, alleging that it includes five stackable crypto assets, making the program an investment contract and, therefore, an area where the exchange violated securities laws.</p>



<p>Commenting on the charges against Coinbase, SEC chair Gary Gensler <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1666059466750541825">noted </a>that the crypto trading platform denied its clients&#8217; essential protections that prevent fraud and manipulation and evaded proper disclosure and safeguards against conflicts of interest.</p>



<p>The SEC wants the defendants — Coinbase, Inc. and Coinbase Global, Inc. — to be &#8220;permanently restrained and enjoined&#8221; and no longer able to do business within the U.S. Notably, unlike the Binance lawsuit, the SEC has not named founder and CEO Brian Armstrong or any other executive.</p>



<p>Still, this is not Coinbase&#8217;s first time locking horns with the American regulator. Last year the exchange, helmed by Brian Armstrong, petitioned the SEC to come up with new rules tailored to digital assets. In April, already under a publicly-acknowledged probe by the agency, Coinbase took a gamble and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-goes-offensive-against-the-sec-with-lawsuit-targeted-at-regulatory-clarity/">sued </a>the SEC, hoping to force the agency to respond to its petition.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coinbase Targeted By State Regulators</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase is also facing scrutiny from a task force of ten U.S. state securities regulators after getting sued by the SEC on the same day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>State regulators from Alabama, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, South Caroline, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin have <a href="https://asc.alabama.gov/News/2023%20News/6-6-2023_Coinbase.pdf">issued </a>a “show cause order” against Coinbase and its parent corporation Coinbase Global alleging that they broke the law by offering the staking rewards program &#8220;Earn&#8221; to state residents.</p>



<p>Coinbase has 28 days to explain why it should not be directed to cease and desist from selling unregistered securities in Alabama.</p>

<p>The crypto industry’s latest blow rocked digital assets’ prices on Monday.</p>



<p>The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Bitcoin, recently traded hands at around $25,496, down 4.54% over the past 24 hours. The downturn started after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">filed a lawsuit</a> against crypto behemoth Binance, the operating company for Binance.US, and Binance founder and CEO Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao on allegations of breaking federal securities rules.</p>



<p>Despite the carnage, recent analysis shows that some major crypto players are buying the dip.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-whales-accumulate"><strong>Whales Accumulate</strong></h2>



<p>Bitcoin may have taken a serious hit yesterday, but not every class of crypto investor is dashing to the exit.</p>



<p>The total crypto market capitalization plunged over 3.5% overnight as the SEC sued Binance. Bitcoin had been treading comfortably above the $27,000 level for the better part of last week, but the charges against the leading crypto exchange rekindled fears about industry integrity and the intention of regulators to exert more authority over trading platforms.</p>



<p>The SEC also alleged that a couple of tokens, including the native coins for the Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Coti (COTI), and Algorand blockchains (ALGO), Filecoin network (FIL), Cosmos hub (ATOM), Sandbox platform (SAND), Axie infinity (AXS) and Decentraland (MANA) are unregistered securities.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, on-chain data indicate that some larger market participants are scooping up crypto at the dip.</p>



<p>On-chain analytics tool Lookonchain <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1665977586718248960">said </a>on Tuesday that Cumberland — a prominent liquidity provider in digital assets — withdrew approximately 67.8 million USDC from Circle and deposited 67.1 million of the stablecoins to U.S.-based digital assets exchange Coinbase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crypto Prime brokerage FalconX also <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48?a=0x1157a2076b9bb22a85cc2c162f20fab3898f4101">acquired </a>37 million USDC from Circle before sending 29.5 million USDC to Binance. Additionally, as per etherscan, Asian investment firm FBG Capital <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xc3f7a7ed42125d2b45bcf8ebcb9fc5657eb674cd#tokentxns">deposited </a>44 million USDT to Binance shortly after the news of the SEC lawsuit went public.</p>



<p>Lookonchain also identified a crypto whale that withdrew 703,871 USDC and over 2.5 million USDT from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Aave before purchasing $3.35 million worth of ether.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is This Dip Worth Buying?</strong></h2>



<p>While the pain that this most recent capitulation has wrought across the market can’t be understated, the one glimmer of hope it offers weary crypto traders is that the worst of the decline could be over as high-net-worth investors are already stepping in to buy the dip.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, regular retail crypto traders should proceed with extreme caution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When crypto prices plummet as rapidly as they have in the market recently, it can make that token you’ve been eyeing look like a great deal. But old Wall Street experts have a rule of thumb that aptly explains moments like this: “Never try to catch a falling knife.”</p>



<p>This means pro traders could make a buck trading on increased market volatility, but further downside could occur shortly.</p>



<p>Trader Crypto Tony <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoTony__/status/1665986631764000768">suggests </a>that Bitcoin could see a short-term bounce before a fresh tumble toward the $24,500 region.</p>



<p>“Shed some more profit on my short this morning, but now looking for a relief wave before the final leg down towards $24,500. I anticipate this is the final leg down before we accumulate for pump to come July / August,” he tweeted.</p>

<p>On Monday, Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange by traded volume, was hit with a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">lawsuit</a> by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleging violations of federal securities laws.</p>



<p>Through thirteen charges, the SEC claimed that the exchange, led by CEO Changpeng Zhao &#8216;CZ&#8217;, offered unregistered securities through its BNB token and other tokens. The agency also accused Zhao and various Binance entities of engaging in deceptive practices, conflicts of interest, inadequate disclosure, and deliberate evasion of legal obligations.</p>



<p>In response to the charges, Binance issued a <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/sec-complaint-aims-to-unilaterally-define-crypto-market-structure-8707489117122437402">statement</a> expressing disappointment with the SEC&#8217;s decision to file a complaint, despite actively cooperating with the agency in extensive good-faith discussions to reach a negotiated settlement.</p>



<p>Binance further criticized the SEC&#8217;s approach, accusing the commission of lacking clarity and guidance in the digital asset industry. According to the exchange, <em>&#8220;The SEC&#8217;s refusal to productively engage with us is just another example of the Commission&#8217;s misguided and conscious refusal to provide much-needed clarity and guidance to the digital asset industry.&#8221;</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Binance also argued that the SEC&#8217;s actions undermined America&#8217;s position as a global hub for financial innovation and leadership. It noted that the SEC&#8217;s actions were driven by a desire to claim jurisdictional ground and make headlines rather than protect investors.</p>



<p>That said, the exchange expressed its intention to defend its platform, asserting, <em>&#8220;We intend to defend our platform vigorously&#8230; We take the SEC&#8217;s allegations seriously, but they should not be the subject of an SEC enforcement action.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>While some believe SEC’s decision to sue Binance was long overdue due to the long-felt apparent bad blood between the two entities, the industry has overwhelmingly criticized the SEC due to its latest overreach. Since Monday, industry partners have rallied behind Binance overwhelmingly, emphasizing the importance of defending this technology from what they perceive as misguided lawsuits.</p>



<p>“<em>Honestly, what is happening isn’t anything new. It’s always the same fight between freedom and authoritarianism just with different players, technology, and words,” </em><a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1665780536177217537">tweeted</a> Cardano co-founder Charles Honskinson. “<em>It does seem like this event is a perfect opportunity for the entire industry to set aside its fragmented nature and unite for a common sense set of rules and guidelines that can prevent the United States from slipping into a dystopia that would make 1984 look like a vacation.”</em></p>



<p>Ben Todar, CEO of Moon Nation Game, also expressed his disappointment arguing that the SEC&#8217;s actions undermine the freedom and innovation associated with cryptocurrencies and raise suspicions about the commission&#8217;s role as a tool utilized by traditional banks to stifle the growth of digital currencies.</p>



<p><em>“By targeting Binance, the SEC appears to align with the interests of established financial institutions that perceive cryptocurrencies as a threat to their dominance,” </em>he wrote.</p>



<p>That said, as the legal battle between Binance and the SEC unfolds, the cryptocurrency industry watches closely, hoping for a resolution that balances regulatory oversight with innovation and consumer protection.</p>

<p>Despite displaying an admirable measure of strength year-to-date, Bitcoin has not been off to a good start this month, with the top cryptocurrency losing momentum due to recent market dynamics.</p>



<p>At press time, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-bulls-put-on-defensive-amid-fears-of-damaging-inflation-and-job-data-this-month/">Bitcoin</a> was trading at $25,537, reflecting a 6.18% drop in the past 24 hours, with investors now closely observing its movements and assessing the possibility of a new low in its price.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-5-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81809" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-5-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-5-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-5-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-5-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-5-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Recently, &#8220;Grizzly&#8221;, an analyst with onchain analysis firm Cryptoquant, highlighted the short-term support level for Bitcoin. According to him, the realized price for the 1–3-month age band is $27,200, which has historically been a crucial support level. If Bitcoin fails to reclaim this level, he noted that further support can be found at $25,300. Accordingly, failure to hold this level would likely send the price towards $20,000, the current realized price of the 3–6-month age band, according to the analyst.</p>



<p>However, according to &#8220;DanCoinInvestor&#8221;, an analyst at the same firm, a further decline in Bitcoin&#8217;s price to a new low is &#8220;very unlikely.&#8221; On Monday, June 5, the pundit noted that the crypto market was transitioning into a bull market phase, pointing out two key indicators supporting this notion. First, he highlighted the unrealized loss indicator, which measures how many market participants are currently losing money.</p>



<p><em>“The Unrealized Loss reached the bottoming zone (green) and then escaped, and now we are in the transition zone towards the bull market. FYI, it is normal for the peaks of this model to decrease from cycle to cycle, as shown in the chart, as BTC&#8217;s width of peaks and bottom narrow as the volume of the crypto market continues to grow,” </em>he wrote.</p>



<p>Moreover, the analyst highlighted Bitcoin&#8217;s dip and recovery above the realized price (represented by the yellow line), stating BTC was now trading within a stable range. The realized price metric signifies the average purchasing price of the market participants. Despite the temporary drop, Bitcoin has maintained stability and is holding its ground within the established price range.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="561" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-4-1024x561.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81808" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-4-1024x561.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-4-300x164.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-4-768x421.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-4.png 1431w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>DanCoinInvestor further mentioned that although the crypto market may experience a decline in the fourth quarter of 2023 or early 2024, it is highly unlikely that Bitcoin will make a new low. Instead, he noted that any recession-induced drop would represent the last chance before entering the strong bull zone.</p>



<p>That said, whether Bitcoin can break through the abovementioned resistance and regain upward momentum or experience a deeper pullback remains to be seen as its price evolves. Moreover, perhaps the recent purchase of over 1 million BTC by about 2.36 million addresses between the $26,360 and $27,160 levels could keep price buoyed, as <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1665377439940313088">highlighted</a> by popular analyst Ali Martinez on Sunday, June 4.</p>

<p>Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/revolutionizing-cardano-decentralization-how-staking-baskets-enable-seamless-ada-delegation-to-stake-pools/">Cardano</a>, has sounded the alarm about the increasing threat of crypto scams, particularly with the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology.</p>



<p>Speaking in a June 4 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AnksNTWbIc&amp;ab_channel=CharlesHoskinson">video</a>, Hoskinson addressed the prevalence of scams in the cryptocurrency space where individuals impersonate prominent figures like him, Elon Musk, or Bill Gates to deceive unsuspecting victims into handing over their hard-earned crypto.</p>



<p>The pundit shared a recent video from Nvidia, a leading technology company, demonstrating their advancements in generative AI. The video showcased the ability to create realistic video game graphics and generate lifelike human images using AI technology. Hoskinson expressed his worry that this rapidly evolving technology could be used to manufacture videos and audio, making it appear as if he is soliciting money or offering investment opportunities.</p>



<p>The crypto millionaire warned that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/scammers-hack-openai-ctos-twitter-account-to-promote-crypto-scam/">scammers</a> could leverage generative AI to create convincing content, leading thousands of people to fall victim to these sophisticated scams. Despite his efforts to educate and raise awareness about scams, Hoskinson predicted millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies, including ADA, would be stolen in the next 12 to 24 months.</p>



<p><em>“Millions of dollars worth of ADA and other cryptocurrencies will be stolen. This is the world we&#8217;re heading towards because of generative AI. It&#8217;s one of the dark sides and unintended consequences, but scammers are already doing this,” </em>he said.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, while Hoskinson admitted feeling helpless in the face of this growing threat, he stressed the need for individuals to remain vigilant and authenticate any communication they receive. He further suggested using Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption to verify identity, given that AI is currently unable to crack such encryption.</p>



<p>Hoskinson also highlighted&nbsp;Atala Prism, a solution built on Cardano to create authenticated communication channels. He hoped that integrating this technology into various platforms and communication channels could mitigate the impact of scams fueled by generative AI.</p>



<p>In conclusion, Hoskinson reiterated his warning: &#8220;<em>You don&#8217;t get something for nothing. It&#8217;s always a scam.&#8221;</em> He urged viewers to adopt a sceptical approach, assuming all content is unauthenticated until proven otherwise.</p>



<p>As cryptocurrency evolves, the battle against scams becomes increasingly challenging. Earlier last month, Facebook’s parent company Meta <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-scams-are-the-new-crypto-scams-meta-warns-120006510.html">highlighted</a> the uptick in AI-driven crypto scams.</p>



<p>As per the firm, the scams often come disguised as browser extensions or mobile apps posing as ChatGPT and AI software to steal user credentials. And whereas the firm stated it is working on building tools to detect and block these types of malware, it emphasized prevention being better than cure, asking users to be more vigilant online.</p>

<p>Franklin Templeton, one of the world&#8217;s largest asset managers with over $1.5 trillion in assets under management, plans to invest heavily in Bitcoin as well as its underlying technology.</p>



<p>This strategy was revealed by Sandy Kaul, the Senior Vice President of Franklin Templeton&#8217;s burgeoning crypto business, during a Sunday <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSm-mrJAqNg&amp;t=5s&amp;ab_channel=ScottMelker">interview</a> with Scott Melker, host of the Wolf Of All Streets podcast. </p>



<p>Discussing how Franklin Templeton entered the digital asset space, Kaul explained that the company was intrigued by the technology behind Bitcoin and had decided to experiment on blockchain to bring operational efficiency and cost savings for its businesses.</p>



<p>As such, the company commenced research on individual coins, created multi-coin portfolios, and even invested in various crypto firms through a dedicated venture capital fund created in 2021.  Furthermore, she disclosed that Franklin Templeton operates its node operations to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Bitcoin network and its growth.</p>



<p>Kaul also emphasized that Franklin Templeton&#8217;s interest in crypto extends beyond Bitcoin. She highlighted the vast opportunities presented by the cryptocurrency’s blockchain and expressed her belief in investors exploring emerging opportunities.</p>



<p>“<em>I think one of the issues we have right now is that people fixate too much on just Bitcoin and oftentimes don&#8217;t think about the broader ecosystem….Bitcoin is a huge Innovation, and we think it&#8217;s going to have massive opportunities in the future,</em>” said Kaul.</p>



<p>Kaul also predicted a continued surge in institutional investors dabbling with cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. She highlighted the cyclical nature of the crypto market, with waves of bull markets occurring every few years since 2011.</p>



<p>According to her, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/arks-cathie-wood-says-bitcoins-upsurge-as-global-banks-roil-will-attract-new-institutional-investors-in-droves/">institutions</a> prefer to enter the market when prices are low, and the sector is not in the spotlight. Thus, the current crypto winter was a period in which institutions strategically positioned themselves in the market, similar to the gradual adoption of alternative assets that took around 10 to 15 years. Furthermore, Kaul emphasized the importance of institutional involvement in creating a solid foundation for the market, which would play a crucial role in propelling cryptocurrencies to new heights following substantial price declines.</p>



<p>“<em>I know they&#8217;re not worried about the price. They salivate at low prices…If you&#8217;ve seen Bitcoin go to $69,000 and you see it at $15,000, you know $69,000 can happen again.”</em> She added.</p>



<p>That said, as Franklin Templeton commits to investing further in Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem, the asset manager joins prominent hedge funds, such as Grayscale Investments, Ark Invest and Pantera Capital, that have already made substantial investments in the space.</p>



<p>Furthermore, with Franklin Templeton&#8217;s commitment to education and promotion alongside its investment activities, mainstream acceptance of digital assets in investment portfolios will likely accelerate.</p>

<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-101">filed fresh charges</a> against the world’s largest crypto exchange, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-to-delist-monero-zcash-and-other-privacy-coins-as-regulatory-pressure-intensifies-in-europe/">Binance</a> and CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao.</p>



<p>The commission is bringing 13 charges against the exchange, accusing it of transferring billions of dollars in user assets to a European company controlled by CZ.</p>



<p>Binance is also accused of “blatant disregard” of federal laws and subverting the SEC’s control to let high net-worth individuals trade on the exchange, which it describes as unregulated.</p>



<p><em>“Through thirteen charges, we allege that Zhao and Binance entities engaged in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a release.</em></p>



<p>Binance is already in court over charges by the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) which alleges that Binance willfully disregarded federal laws, similar to the charges by the SEC. CFTC is asking the court to, among other things, stop the crypto giant from operating in the US.</p>



<p>The allegations are coming in the wake of a massive crackdown on crypto companies in the US, which is still ongoing. The SEC through its chairman Gensler has stated severally that any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin is most likely a security, which places every crypto exchange under the commission&#8217;s jurisdiction.</p>



<p>Coinbase has challenged this position in court, requesting that the SEC develop proper regulations for the crypto industry. The SEC in its response, said it takes time to make such regulations and that there’s sufficient guidance for the industry currently.</p>



<p>Because of this regulatory “war”, Coinbase and other indigenous crypto exchanges are looking to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-plans-to-move-offshore-due-to-severe-lack-of-clarity-from-sec-how-avorak-ai-helps-amid-these-developments/">increase their presence</a> outside the US, even though they have no near-term plans to leave the country.</p>



<p>Binance seems to have faced more issues than any of them, though. As a result, the US arm of the exchange, Binance.US, is already reducing CZ&#8217;s share. The pressure has also made it necessary for CZ to step down as CEO, with Richard Teng as a potential successor.</p>

<p>Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, has said that he expects Bitcoin&#8217;s bull market to begin around October or September.</p>



<p>In a Thursday blog, Hayes discussed the current state of the financial markets and the factors that he believes will contribute to the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-at-70000-arthur-hayes-reveals-why-this-price-level-is-unlikely-to-happen-till-2024/">rise of Bitcoin</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fiat-holders-expect-more-trouble"><strong>Fiat Holders, Expect More Trouble</strong></h2>



<p>Delving into the situation in the United States, Hayes predicted the country&#8217;s financial sector would continue experiencing problems, leading to a mass exodus from the fiat monetary financial system. In terms of the US Federal Government, the pundit projected that politicians would continue to prioritize spending. At the same time, the government&#8217;s borrowing would persist, resulting in trillions of dollars of debt being accumulated every year.</p>



<p>He also highlighted the public awareness of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s endless money printing, which he noted would contribute to Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish momentum as people seek to protect against potential inflation.</p>



<p><em>“As more and more pundits start talking about what is happening to the billions of dollars printed by the Fed and US Treasury and handed out as interest, it will become common knowledge once more that the money printer is going brrr. And when the printer goes brrr, Bitcoin goes boom!” </em>he wrote.</p>



<p>Additionally, he touched on the US banking system, noting that banks were likely to keep struggling due to inflation and rising short-term policy rates.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Brace For The Bull Run</strong></h2>



<p>That said, he predicted a flow of liquidity into Bitcoin and assets such as gold, noting that the real Bitcoin bull market will begin in the late third and early fourth quarter of this year. He also emphasized the importance of patience in the markets, noting that nothing goes up or down in a straight line.</p>



<p><em>“I believe the fireworks and the real Bitcoin bull market will begin in the late third and early fourth quarter of this year. Between now and then, chill…Take a vacation, and enjoy nature and the company of your friends and family. Because come this fall, you better be strapped into your trading spaceship, ready for liftoff,”</em> <a href="https://cryptohayes.substack.com/p/patience-is-beautiful">wrote</a> Hayes.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Hayes shared his analysis of Bitcoin, stating, <em>&#8220;I expect that Bitcoin will remain resilient at this level. I do not anticipate a retest of $20,000 or anything close to it</em>.”</p>



<p>He emphasised that the market&#8217;s typical lacklustre performance during summer was primarily due to waning interest and boredom among traders. He noted that the gradual influx of funds into global risk asset markets is crucial to Bitcoin&#8217;s resilience and strength.</p>



<p>Utilizing this period of relative tranquillity, the pundit concluded by disclosing that he intends to gradually increase his allocation to Bitcoin after replenishing his general trading account.</p>

<p>Ripple is reportedly considering an initial public offering (IPO) as its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approaches its conclusion.</p>



<p>During a May 31 interview with Digital Perspectives, Linda P. Jones, a seasoned Wall Street veteran with 25 years of experience, alluded to this possibility by providing her expert analysis on the potential implications of a Ripple Initial Public Offering (IPO).</p>



<p>Jones performed an initial assessment to approximate the potential stock value of Ripple. Using the latest data from private investments firm Linqto, she determined Ripple&#8217;s current share price to be $35, which corresponds to a valuation of $5.7 billion. Linqto offers interested investors the opportunity to purchase stocks before the company goes public in an IPO. However, Jones highlighted a disparity in Linqto&#8217;s valuation, suggesting that it seems disproportionately low when considering Ripple&#8217;s historical performance and its significant holdings of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/a-new-boom-for-xrp-record-breaking-address-activity-indicates-upturn-ahead-to-1-xrp-price/">XRP</a>.</p>



<p>Drawing attention to Ripple&#8217;s extensive XRP reserves, Jones emphasized that the 42 billion XRP tokens held in escrow are currently valued at $21 billion, assuming a market rate of $0.50 per token. In her view, this valuation alone exceeds Ripple&#8217;s current market value by four times, indicating a significant undervaluation and suggesting that Ripple&#8217;s true worth could be considerably higher.</p>



<p>The pundit further drew a comparison to Coinbase&#8217;s successful IPO, speculating that Ripple&#8217;s valuation could reach $107 billion, 20 times its current value, meaning $600 per share.</p>



<p>According to her, if the XRP lawsuit concludes favourably and the token regains its previous high of $3.59, the XRP escrow value could surge to $150 billion, potentially driving Ripple&#8217;s stock price even higher. She further expressed her belief in Ripple’s potential to achieve a half-trillion-dollar valuation, considering the successes of companies like Nvidia and Apple.</p>



<p>Ripple has previously expressed its desire to go public. In May 2022, CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated during a conference in Davos that Ripple would explore the possibility of an initial public offering (IPO) once the ongoing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reached its conclusion. Recently, he expressed his belief in the case <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-boss-confident-groundbreaking-verdict-is-coming-in-weeks-after-hinman-speech-docs-win/">concluding in weeks</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, according to Eleanor Terrett, a Fox Business reporter, the blockchain firm reportedly conducted a successful private &#8220;roadshow&#8221; in April to meet with potential investors ahead of its IPO. Terrett tweeted on Thursday that the event was attended by numerous respected institutional investment firms on Wall Street, indicating strong interest in Ripple&#8217;s offering.</p>



<p>That said, as the lawsuit nears its end, a win for Ripple could have far-reaching implications for the firm and the broader cryptocurrency market. It could also enable the company to go public, increasing its popularity and potentially pushing the value of XRP to the long-awaited milestone of $10.</p>

<p>According to the “2023 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report”, 139.3 million cryptojacking attempts were recorded in 2022 compared to 97.1 million in 2021, a 43% year-over-year increase. The observed attack volumes exceeded the 100-million mark for the first time. The report stated that cryptojacking volume increased in North America, Asia, and Europe. However, the Latin America region recorded a 66% drop year-over-year.</p>



<p>Despite skyrocketing attack volumes in Europe, the United States (U.S.) remained the country with the highest volume with cryptojacking attempts rising 41% year over year. Retail had the highest total cryptojacking attack volumes by industry, followed by Education, Finance, Healthcare, and Government.</p>



<p>In cryptojacking, attackers gain access to the victim’s computer or mobile device’s computing power and use them for cryptocurrency mining without the knowledge and authorization of the victim.</p>



<p>Cryptojacking attacks have occurred across various industries. Launched in 2017, Coinhive allowed website owners to embed JavaScript code onto their websites, thereby using the website visitor&#8217;s computer to mine the cryptocurrency, Monero.</p>



<p>In another cryptojacking incident, researchers at the cloud monitoring and defence firm RedLock reported that Tesla’s cloud system had been cryptojacked in February 2018 after hackers exploited a password vulnerability to mine cryptocurrency. Tesla said that the data exposure was minimal and quickly addressed the vulnerability.</p>



<p>In 2018, a cryptojacking code was discovered on the Los Angeles Times Homicide Report page. The code used minimal computing power such that users could not easily detect when their devices were used to mine the Monero cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>In 2018, a European water utility control system was cryptojacked and used to generate the Monero cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>As per the 2022 SonicWall’s Threat Mindset survey, 66% of organizations were more concerned about cyberattacks in 2022 than in previous years. 29% of organizations reported that they have roughly the same amount of concern about attacks as they did in 2021, with only 5% reporting as being less concerned.</p>



<p>Respondents ranked Ransomware (91%) as the top cyber attack concern. Other concerns by the respondents were; Phishing and spear-phishing (76%), Encrypted malware (66%), File-less attacks (39%), Memory-based malware (24%), Cryptojacking (23%), IoT malware (22%), and Side-channel attacks (18%).</p>



<p>Sonicwall recommends the following to detect and prevent cryptojacking in your organization: Keeping computers and web browsers up to date, using reputable anti-malware software, regularly updating antivirus and security software on all devices, and educating users to be cautious when opening emails and attachments.</p>



<p>Further recommendations from SonicWall to detect cryptojacking include preventing unauthorized downloads, using ad blockers, using zero-day protection, Implementing strong authentication, protecting cloud resources, and using anti-bot protection to help prevent malware from spreading to a computer or network.</p>

<p>Indeed, there is a crypto token known as OpenAI ERC, but it is a token linked to a free-to-use telegram bot that provides users access to ChatGTP and DALL-E via chat commands. It is not linked to OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT.</p>



<p>As expected, the tweet got significant traction, with almost 80,000 views and 83 retweets, while no one was allowed to comment. Blockchain security firm, Beosin told Cointelegraph that the hackers used a crypto wallet-draining kit that could drain non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and ERC-20 tokens from any wallet that authorizes it.</p>



<p>Fortunately, there was no evidence that any of her followers fell for the scam at the point of recovering the account, but it is hard to tell since no comments were allowed for any victim to warn others.</p>



<p>This is just one of many Twitter hack incidents this year in which hackers used the accounts of prominent people with large followings to promote their crypto scams. The governor of Madhya Pradesh, an Indian state, suffered a similar attack on his official Twitter account earlier this year, alongside other top public figures, including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse.</p>



<p>It appears such attacks usually target communities of projects that are either popular or bullish. Most attacks initially targeted the Ripple community at the beginning of the year when XRP rallied to new levels, and now OpenAI since ChatGPT has become a household name.</p>



<p>To avoid being a victim, take your time to verify from reliable sources before engaging in any such offers, ideally published on official websites. Also, try to report suspicious offers like this one, as some accounts did on Twitter, which helped to get the attention of the account owner, who could have been the victim of a sim swap attack.</p>
