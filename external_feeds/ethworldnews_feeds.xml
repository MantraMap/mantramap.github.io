<p>The controversial FTX hack last month, which led to a loss of more than $370 million, has once again been brought into the limelight. The United States Department of Justice has launched a criminal probe into this matter. According to a report by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-27/us-probes-how-372-million-vanished-in-hack-after-ftx-bankruptcy" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, this probe is separate from the fraud case that former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is currently facing in Manhattan.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Funds exploited from FTX have been frozen by authorities</strong></h2>



<p>The investigation into the hack is being headed by the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team of the Department of Justice. This team consists of a network of prosecutors who specialize in digital asset investigation. A person familiar with the matter has revealed that a portion of the exploited funds has been frozen by authorities. This investigation is separate from the fraud charges that have been brought against&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-to-be-released-after-posting-250-million-bail/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>. The former CEO had previously indicated that the exploit may have been an inside job.</p>



<p>The hack was initially&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/0xfoobar/status/1591261359152705538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a>&nbsp;by the crypto Twitter community. FTX employees subsequently confirmed to popular on-chain sleuth&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1591276687228035074" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ZachXBT</a>&nbsp;on Twitter that hundreds of millions of dollars were flowing out of FTX-owned wallets. The initial figure was close to $650 million since FTX employees had started transferring assets into cold wallets as a&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/_Ryne_Miller/status/1591326796305530880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1591326796305530880%7Ctwgr%5E5804e9a63837a114a4351ef76deb5e6f21c40948%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fftx-reportedly-hacked-as-officials-flag-abnormal-wallet-activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">precaution</a>. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Following the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings &#8211; FTX US and FTX [dot] com initiated precautionary steps to move all digital assets to cold storage.  Process was expedited this evening &#8211; to mitigate damage upon observing unauthorized transactions.</p>&mdash; Ryne Miller (@_Ryne_Miller) <a href="https://twitter.com/_Ryne_Miller/status/1591326796305530880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">November 12, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The exploit was later acknowledged by current CEO John Ray III who stated that there had been “unauthorized access” within hours of filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy on 11 November.&nbsp;&nbsp;The days following the hack saw the perpetrator swapping the exploited tokens for ETH. These funds were then bridged to Bitcoin using the RenBridge service. The perpetrator also employed mixer services to obscure the money trail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Bankman-Fried affirmed that 56 million Robinhood shares were bought with loans from Alameda Research between April and May 2022.</li><li>The loans were issued in several amounts to Sam and his co-founder Gary Wang, per a court affidavit.</li><li>FTX lawyers asked a judge to freeze the assets after BlockFi claimed ownership of SBF&#8217;s stake in Robinhood.</li></ul>



<p>Disgraced crypto tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried told an Antiguan court that loans from Alameda Research were used to acquire a 7.6% stake in stock broker and crypto exchange Robinhood. Bankman-Fried affirmed the source of capital for his Robinhood stock scoop in a court affidavit shortly before his arrest in December.</p>



<p>As previously reported, troubled crypto lender BlockFi filed for ownership of Sam’s Robinhood. Lawyers for the bankrupt exchange asked a judge to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-blockfi-tussle-sbfs-robinhood-stock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freeze</a> the assets for the benefit of creditors, debtors, and claimants. </p>



<p>According to the affidavit, SBF acquired the shares along with FTX and Alameda co-founder Gary Wang. The pair domiciled Emergent Fidelity Technologies in Antigua to manage the investment in Robinhood. Bankman-Fried controlled 90% of Emergent while Gary assumed 10% control of the company, per court filing.</p>



<p>Gary and SBF then bootstrapped Emergent with loans from Alameda, securing tens of millions in loans. Alameda issued four promissory notes lending roughly $491 million to Bankman-Fried and $54 million to Gary, said SBF. Bankman-Fried added that extra capital to complete the massive $600 million purchase was probably also borrowed by the pair.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In order to capitalize Emergent so that it could make the investment into Robinhood, Gary and I agreed to borrow funds from Alameda Research Ltd. Those funds were capitalized into Emergent and it used those funds to acquire the shares in Robinhood.</p></blockquote>



<h2>FTX Customer Funds Stolen?</h2>



<p>The affidavit supposedly confirmed allegations from the CFTC and SEC that Alameda issued loans to individual and top executives within Bankman-Fried’s sunken crypto empire. Also, the CFTC’s complaint alleged that Alameda siphoned customer funds from FTX before the trading giant edged insolvency in May 2022.</p>



<p>Indeed, the filing from the U.S. regulator and SBF’s affidavit echoed concerns that the 56 million Robinhood shares were bought with stolen customer funds from FTX.  Individual creditor Yonatan Ben Shimon argued a similar claim to the Antiguan court. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8230;Emergent acquired a 7/6% shareholding in Robinhood for about US$650 million possibly using funds improperly diverted from those invested by me and others with FTX. I know nothing regarding the source of the funds used to acquire the 7/6% interest in Robinhood beyond the fact that it was allegedly “working capital”.</p><cite>&#8211; Yonatan Ben Shimon, indivudal creditor.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Bankman-Fried refuted allegations of criminal negligence prior to his arrest in the Bahamas and extradition to the United States. However, Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/12/23/caroline-ellison-admits-she-and-bankman-fried-conspired-to-steal-from-ftx-customers-and-mislead-investors-reports-say/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">testified</a> to diverting user funds from SBF’s crypto exchange to his trading giant in a plea deal. </p>

<ul><li>Fantom co-founder Andre Cronje has laid out the protocol’s roadmap for 2023.</li><li>The protocol will focus on expanding its dApp ecosystem through gas monetization and subsidies.&nbsp;</li><li>Cronje has been appointed to the Board of Directors for Fantom Foundation Ltd.</li><li>The protocol previously pledged to bring down its token burn rate to incentivize dApp developers.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/fantom-up-20-andre-cronje-return/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andre Cronje</a>, the popular DeFi architect who co-founded the Fantom Foundation, has laid out the 2023 roadmap for the layer 1 blockchain. Cronje, who refers to himself as the “Vice President of Memes” at Fantom Foundation, has stated that the foundation will focus on the expansion of its decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem next year.</p>



<h2><strong>Fantom to incentivize builders with gas monetization and subsidies</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://andrecronje.medium.com/letter-to-fantom-foundation-team-eb3d870c6be8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">letter</a> from Cronje to the foundation team, the objective for next year is to provide the highest throughput blockchain available in order to create a single, secure settlement layer for all decentralized activity. This goal is to be achieved by improving the tools, integration, and ease of use for developers, rather than catering to specific user verticals like DeFi, NFT, gameFi, and exchanges.</p>



<p>Cronje has outlined several core focus areas for the next 12 months. These include gas monetization, which will allow dApps to share revenue based on the gas used in transactions, similar to how YouTube and Twitch creators earn income. The foundation also plans to implement gas subsidies, which will allow dApps to interact without requiring users to pay gas fees themselves, making onboarding easier and more seamless.</p>



<p>Another key focus for the Fantom Foundation is account abstraction, which will eliminate the distinction between contract and EOA accounts. Under this system, contracts will be able to initiate transactions and pay for gas, and EOAs will simply serve as authorities authorized to instruct wallets to take certain actions. This will allow for a more user-friendly dApp experience and enable social recovery options such as email and password authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An economic abstraction for gas fees is also in the pipeline, which will allow fees to be paid in tokens other than FTM, and is developing a new middleware layer to improve smart contract processing and unlock the full potential of hardware. Other focus areas include performance engineering, documentation and training, and business development.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje also informed the team that he has formally been appointed as a member of the Board of Directors for both Fantom Foundation Ltd and Fantom Operations Ltd.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Sam Bankman-Fried’s quantitative trading firm Alameda Research, made sensational claims during her plea hearing on 19 December. A transcript of the said hearing was unsealed earlier today. According to a report by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/alamedas-ex-ceo-tells-judge-she-hid-billions-loans-ftx-execs-2022-12-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, Ellison has confessed that FTX executives including former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, received secret loans worth billions of dollars from Alameda.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Caroline Ellison prepared fake balance sheets to mislead investors</strong></h2>



<p>The former Alameda chief revealed that the trading firm could borrow unlimited funds from the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX. The transcript further revealed that Ellison and Bankman-Fried conspired to hide this crucial information from FTX’s investors, customers, and creditors.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We prepared certain quarterly balance sheets that concealed the extent of Alameda&#8217;s borrowing and the billions of dollars in loans that Alameda had made to FTX executives and to related parties,&#8221; </p><cite>Ellison told U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams.</cite></blockquote>



<p>The United States Department of Justice put out a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/united-states-attorney-announces-extradition-ftx-founder-samuel-bankman-fried-united" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a>&nbsp;yesterday which revealed that Caroline Ellison had reached a plea deal and will be cooperating with prosecutors in the investigation. FTX co-founder Gary Wang also pleaded guilty and secured a similar deal with the prosecutors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wang revealed during his plea hearing, which was also held on 19 December, that he was directed to alter FTX’s code to give Alameda exclusive access to the exchange. At the time, investors and customers of the exchange were being told that Alameda had no such privileges. Wang did not name the people who issued these directions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both Ellison and Wang will likely be called upon to testify against former associate Sam Bankman-Fried whose next hearing is scheduled for 3 January 2023. SBF was&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-to-be-released-after-posting-250-million-bail/" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a>&nbsp;into the custody of his parents in Palo Alto, California yesterday after he posted a bail bond of $250 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>FTX was hacked for hundreds of millions in cryptocurrencies a few hours after filing for bankruptcy.</li><li>Paxos quickly froze 11,184 Paxos Gold (PAXG) tokens stolen from the crypto exchange following a request from  U.S. Federal authorities</li><li>The on-chain trust firm recovered roughly $20 million after tracking the assets to four Ethereum addresses. </li></ul>



<p>Paxos rescued $20 million in digital gold stolen from Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange FTX, per The Block.</p>



<h2>11,184 PAXG Stolen From FTX</h2>



<p>An unknown hacker stole 11,184 PAXG tokens backed by real gold in Paxos’ custody from FTX shortly after the crypto exchange declared bankruptcy on November 11, 2022. Reports said the hacker drained over $400 million in other crypto assets like DAI and Ether (ETH) from the platform. </p>



<p>Paxos is a regulated crypto trust and blockchain company. The firm is also the issuer of Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin. After the hack, Paxos <a href="https://paxos.com/2022/11/12/paxos-freezes-paxg-tokens-related-to-ftx/" rel="nofollow noopener">tracked</a> the PAXG tokens to four Ethereum addresses and froze the assets in compliance with a request from U.S. Federal Law Enforcement.</p>



<p>Notably, the hacker swapped around $300 million in virtual currencies in ETH, becoming of the largest Ether holders. Ethereum&#8217;s community grew concerned that the attacker might tank ETH&#8217;s price in a bid to launder crypto.</p>



<p>The team reportedly “reclaimed the assets” and transferred $20 million in PAXG tokens from the “FTX Accounts Drainer” wallets to a null address. Paxos’s treasury burned the tokens and minted 11,184 new PAXG tokens into a separate crypto wallet.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2>FTX Users In Limbo&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Billions in assets from Sam Bankman-Fried’s flatlined exchange remain unaccounted for. The November hacker <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-hacker-becomes-35th-largest-holder-of-ethereum-after-panic-purchasing-approx-50m-of-eth/">stole</a> over $400 million in cryptocurrencies and digital assets. The CFTC, SEC, and Federal prosecutors allege $4 billion from customer funds were diverted to Alameda Research, under Bankman-Fried’s instructions.</p>



<p>SBF’s trading giant also hid $8 billion in liabilities on the crypto exchange, per reports. Court filing revealed tens of millions in personal loans to company executives including Bankman-Fried himself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company recovered roughly $1 billion in crypto assets and cash equivalents, according to Bankruptcy CEO John Ray III as he testified before Congress in Washington DC. Ray also remarked recovering assets was a slow process due to a lack of proper accounting in SBF’s crypto empire.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>BlockFi and FTX are in contention over 56 million shares in trading giant Robinhood.</li><li>The shares are currently controlled by Emergent Fidelity Technologies, a company owned almost entirely by fallen crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried.</li><li>BlockFi argued ownership of the Robinhood stock as part of a deal with Bankman-Fried but FTX pushed for the assets to stay frozen.</li></ul>



<p>FTX filed a motion in a bid to freeze around $450 million in Robinhood shares as bankruptcy creditors battle over control for Sam Bankman-Fried’s massive investment in the trading giant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The assets in question are some 56 million shares in equity and crypto trading platform Robinhood. Bankman-Fried <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/robinhoods-stocks-soar-20-after-sam-bankman-fried-confirms-his-stake-in-the-company/">bought</a> his stake in Robinhood for $600 million back in May 2022. According to the court filing, the shares are currently owned by Emergent Fidelity Technologies. Notably, SBF owns 90% of the company and controlled its operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BlockFi Sues For Robinhood Stock</p>



<p>BlockFi <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/blockfi-ftx-ceo-over-robinhood-shares/">sued</a> the fallen exchange Founder over his Robinhood shares. The bankrupt crypto broker claimed that Bankman-Fried pledged his 56 million shares as part of a deal. BlockFi also claimed the agreement was reached FTX declared bankruptcy on November 11.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other claimants of SBF’s Robinhood stock include Yonathan Ben Shimon (creditor), and Sam Bankman-Fried himself, per the court filing.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>FTX Ask Judge To Freeze SBF’s Robinhood Stock</h2>



<p>The bankrupt crypto exchange <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.deb.188450/gov.uscourts.deb.188450.291.0.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">responded</a> to BlockFi and other claimants by asking the judge to freeze Bankman-Fried’s shares in Robinhood. Instead, lawyers representing the disgraced exchange argued to maintain the asset freeze until the bankruptcy court deliberate on the best resolution for all parties.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The fact that multiple prepetition creditors of different Debtors and Mr. Bankman-Fried are all seeking to obtain possession of the Robinhood Shares demonstrates that the asset should be frozen until this Court can resolve the issues in a manner that is fair to all creditors of the Debtors.</p></blockquote>



<p>BlockFi’s complaint is one of several against SBF’s shattered crypto empire. Court filing revealed at least $3 billion owed to the top 50 creditors. Over 1 million creditors also failed claims.&nbsp;The bankruptcy court <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-creditors-committee-wintermutre/">chose</a> crypto market maker Wintermute and Genesis entity GGC International as part of the Unsecured Creditors Committee.</p>

<ul><li>Sam Bankman-Fried will be released on a whopping $250 million pre-trial bail.&nbsp;</li><li>The former FTX CEO will move in with his parents in California.&nbsp;</li><li>Alameda Chief Caroline Ellison has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with law enforcement.&nbsp;</li><li>SBF previously claimed that he was down to his last $100,000.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, the former chief of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, is set to walk free following his&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-approved-extradition/" rel="noreferrer noopener">extradition</a>&nbsp;to the United States. A federal magistrate judge in New York has ruled that the disgraced CEO is to be released on a $250 million bail designed by federal prosecutors and SBF’s attorneys. Nicholas Roos, the prosecutor, in this case, has described it as the “largest pre-trial bond ever”.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Sam Bankman-Fried released into the custody of his parents</strong></h2>



<p>Per a report by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ftx-founder-bankman-fried-make-us-court-appearance-after-extradition-2022-12-22/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, Judge Gabriel Gorenstein has set strict terms for the release. SBF will be released into the custody of his parents, who are reportedly putting up the equity in their home to partially satisfy the bail conditions. Additionally, he will also be required to surrender his passport and undergo regular mental health treatment and evaluation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users on Twitter were infuriated with the judge’s ruling. Despite his parents putting up the equity in their $25 million California house, the general sentiment was that Sam Bankman-Fried would use customer funds to fund his bail. The former FTX CEO had previously stated that he was down to his last $100,000.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Caroline Ellison joins hands with prosecutors</strong></h2>



<p>Caroline Ellison, the former Chief Executive of SBF’s quantitative trading firm Alameda Research, has secured a plea deal with the prosecutors. According to a press release put out by the U.S. Department of Justice, Ellison, along with FTX co-founder Gary Wang, plead guilty to the fraud charges brought by the DOJ.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to an unsealed&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23495436/crypto-cooperator-ftx-alamedas-caroline-ellisons-plea-agreement-inner-city-press-on-the-case.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">plea agreement</a>&nbsp;with the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Ellison will have to post a $250,000 personal recognizance bond. Terms of the agreement also include the clearing of any charges against Caroline Ellison except criminal tax violations, provided she fully cooperates with the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Sources said Sam Bankman-Fried could arrive in the U.S. as early as Wednesday afternoon.</li><li>Bankman-Fried was approved for extradition to face eight counts of criminal charges for fraud in FTX&#8217;s crash.</li><li>SBF waives his right to contest U.S. extradition after spending a week at the Bahamas Fox Hill prison. </li></ul>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried will be extradited to the United States to stand trial on fraud and money laundering charges over FTX’s crash, per reports from the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried could be arraigned in a Manhattan Federal District Court as early as Wednesday afternoon, NYT said. SBF was held at the Bahamas Fox Hill prison after his arrest earlier in December. However, no official timeline was disclosed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried was held in custody ahead of an extradition hearing after a judge <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-us-extradition/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-us-extradition/" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied</a> his bail request. SBF seemingly planned to contest U.S. extradition pending a review of the Justice Department’s criminal indictment. Prosecutors from the Southern District of New York charged Bankman-Fried on eight counts including fraud and campaign finance violations. </p>



<p>The FTX founder <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sam-bankman-fried-expected-back-in-bahamas-court-11671581149?mod=e2tw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">waived</a> his right to contest extradition during a hearing on Wednesday. SBF’s counsel Jerone Roberts submitted an affidavit with the decision and Bankman-Fried affirmed to the court saying “Yes, I do wish to waive my right to formal extradition proceedings.”</p>



<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried To Stand Trial For Fraud</h2>



<p>U.S. Attorneys charged Bankman-Fried with fraud over the collapse of FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange comingled with trading giant Alameda research, another piece of SBF’s crippled crypto empire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prosecutors also accused the FTX Founder of violating campaign finance laws. Bankman-Fried reportedly donated tens of millions to bipartisan U.S. lawmakers. The CFTC and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-fraud-ftx-customers/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-fraud-ftx-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a> also charged SBF with defrauding customers, lenders, and investors. </p>



<p>In short, Sam Bankman-Fried stands accused of stealing customers&#8217; assets on FTX to finance Alameda’s debts and trading capital. The charges argue that Bankman-Fried also instructed FTX employees to mask Alameda’s billions in liabilities on the crypto exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bankruptcy CEO John Ray testified to congress that FTX crashed due to a lack of corporate controls and risk management at the company. SBF admitted to loose control at the FTX but denied any criminal liability or intent</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Wintermute Founder Evgeny Gaevoy suggested that his crypto maker might move to fill in the created by FTX&#8217;s collapse.</li><li>Gaevoy and CEO Marina Gurevich said the company was considering rolling out a derivatives exchange built for professional traders, similar to FTX but with a few changes.</li><li>Gaevoy suggested segregated customer funds and third-party asset custody as some solutions to prevent another crash.</li></ul>



<p>Wintermute Founder Evgeny Gaevoy might launch a crypto exchange to cater to professional traders after FTX’s collapse in November left a void in the financial derivatives market, Forbes reported.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FTX rose to prominence partly due to Sam Bankman-Fried positioning the platform as a derivates exchange “built for traders by traders’. The angle propelled FTX towards crypto stardom, growing into one of the largest crypto trading venues with billions in transactions before SBF filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 11. </p>



<h2>Gaevoy&#8217;s Derivatives Exchange Plans</h2>



<p>Gaevoy along with Wintermute CEO Marina Gurevich pointed to the intensified workload following FTX’s crash as the company moves to capture market share and fill the boots of Sam Bankman-Fried’s exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gaevoy <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2022/12/20/with-sam-bankman-frieds-hedge-fund-gone-crypto-trading-firm-wintermute-emerges/?sh=5ee639ed2bbb" rel="noopener">shared</a> thoughts on running a financial derivatives exchange with standard financial controls and risk management. According to FTX bankruptcy CEO John Ray, the crypto exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-alameda-liabilities-korean-account/">imploded</a> largely due to a lack of risk management and corporate accounting practices,</p>



<p>Founder Gaevoy proposed segregating customer funds from company liquidity as part of an improved system for storing user deposits. Regarding asset custody, the veteran crypto trader said he would adopt a trading architecture similar to traditional financial exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This means Gaevoy is a proponent of leveraging outside entities and third-party service providers to custody assets, as opposed to dedicating resources towards building in-house crypto asset custody solutions.

<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/uniswap-nft-trading-airdrop-genie/">Uniswap</a>, the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) by trading volume, has enabled crypto purchases through fiat. Users of Uniswap Protocol will now be able to buy crypto using their credit and debit cards as well as through a bank transfer. This feature has been developed in association with Moonpay.</p>



<h2><strong>Uniswap brings DeFi closer to users</strong></h2>



<p>The new feature has been <a href="https://uniswap.org/blog/web-fiat-on-ramp" rel="nofollow noopener">described</a> by the DEX as “direct to DeFi”. The aim is to eliminate the need for a middleman and bring users directly to the DeFi experience through a seamless onboarding experience.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>With self-custodial wallets, permissionless and immutable protocols, and a transparent public ledger, DEXs have built-in user protections.” the press release read.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>While card payments will be supported in 160+ countries, bank transfers will be available for most of the US, Brazil, Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), and the UK. As of now, users can purchase DAI, ETH, MATIC, USDC, USDT, WBTC, and WETH. However, WBTC and WETH will not be available for users in the US. As of now, Uniswap is only supporting four chains for this feature, namely Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>No minimum fees</strong></h2>



<p>Uniswap has clarified that this feature has been made available with zero minimum fees. Additionally, users can enjoy zero spreads on their USDC purchases. The protocol is also working to integrate an off-ramp so that users can send crypto back into their bank accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the feature has been marketed as a push towards DeFi, users who choose to go through Moonpay to purchase crypto will have to comply with its KYC/AML policy. Uniswap has clarified that the customer data acquired by Moonpay will not be shared with them.&nbsp;</p>
