<ul><li>The United States SEC has filed a response to Coinbase’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit filed against it.&nbsp;</li><li>The securities regulator asserted that the crypto exchange may have knowingly violated securities laws.&nbsp;</li><li>The SEC said in its latest filing that it would oppose any motion for judgement that the crypto exchange might file.&nbsp;</li><li>The regulator also dismissed Coinbase’s suggestion that an IPO approval would protect it from enforcement actions in the future.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has asserted that American crypto giant <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-stock-tanks-downgraded-analyst/">Coinbase </a>may have knowingly violated securities laws. In a filing made with the Manhattan Federal Court, the securities regulator claimed that the crypto exchange was aware that its crypto listings would be under the purview of federal securities laws. </p>



<h2><strong>SEC Will Oppose Any Motion For Judgement From Coinbase</strong></h2>



<p>According to the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908.26.0.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">response</a> sent to U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla, the SEC asked the court to disregard arguments previously made by Coinbase regarding the legality of its crypto listings, citing that the exchange was a multi-billion dollar entity with access to sophisticated legal counsel. The securities regulator further took issue with the crypto exchange’s argument that the approval of its IPO confirmed its underlying business and protected it from future enforcement actions. </p>



<p>The SEC cited Coinbase’s previous court filings which noted that the uncertainty regarding the security status of the tokens listed on the crypto exchange may pose a risk to its investors.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>These actions clearly show that Coinbase understood that the securities laws could apply to its conduct and knew which rules to consider in evaluating the legality of its conduct, but nevertheless made the calculated decision to take on this risk in the name of growing its business.&#8221; </p><cite>Securities and Exchange Commission</cite></blockquote>



<p>The SEC believes that the arguments made by Coinbase are flawed and highlighted that it had adopted the very legal framework as a basis for making listing decisions that it claimed had no applicability to its activities. The response filed with Judge Polk requested the denial of the exchange&#8217;s motion to have the lawsuit dismissed. The regulator also stated that it would oppose any motion for judgement from the crypto exchange.</p>

<p>Wall Street giant JPMorgan believes that a spot <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-pro-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> ETF in the United States won’t have the impact that the crypto and TradFi communities believe it will. According to a JPMorgan strategist, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s seal of approval for firms in the U.S. to offer spot BTC ETFs is unlikely to be a game changer for the crypto market. </p>



<h2><strong>Spot Bitcoin ETFs Would Add Liquidity And Price Transparency</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-07/jpmorgan-says-a-bitcoin-etf-wouldn-t-be-an-industry-game-changer" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou stated in a note earlier today that the SEC’s approval for a spot BTC ETF is unlikely to be a game changer. The strategist pointed out that similar products have been offered in European and Canadian markets for years and have failed to attract significant investment. The strategist believes that the optimism and hype around such an exchange-traded fund will get a reality check once it hits the American crypto market. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Bitcoin funds overall, including futures-based and physically backed funds, have attracted little investor interest since Q2 2021, also failing to benefit from investor outflows from gold ETFs over the past year or so.” </p><cite>Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, Strategist at JPMorgan</cite></blockquote>



<p>That being said, Panigirtzoglou acknowledged the advantages of having a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. crypto market, adding that physically backed funds offered greater opportunities than futures-based funds. The note from the JPMorgan strategist added that spot ETFs would offer more direct and secure exposure to Bitcoin by addressing issues surrounding custody. He added that spot ETFs would be a more accurate reflection of real-time supply, and bring more liquidity and enhance price transparency in spot bitcoin markets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Barry Silbert, DCG, and Genesis knowingly committed fraud against Gemini customers, the lawsuit filed today alleges.</li><li>Gemini insists that Genesis and DCG owe over $700 million to Earn users since late last year.</li><li>The suit is the latest development in an ongoing spat between the company founded by the Winklevoss twins and Barry Silbert’s conglomerate</li></ul>



<p>Gemini, a crypto exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, is suing Barry Silbert and his conglomerate Digital Currency Group for<a href="https://t.co/jiquoIbmgp" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://t.co/jiquoIbmgp" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> knowingly defrauding Earn customers</a> of nearly a billion in cryptocurrency. </p>



<p>The suit filed today in a New York court alleges that DCG, its CEO Barry Silbert, and its subsidiary Genesis misinterpreted financial statements knowing fully well the consequences of their actions. &#8220;Genesis was wildly insolvent,&#8221; Cameron Winklevoss said on Friday speaking about Silbert&#8217;s attempts to hide the massive hole in the lender&#8217;s finances. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Today, <a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">@Gemini</a> filed a lawsuit against <a href="https://twitter.com/DCGco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">@DCGco</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/BarrySilbert?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">@BarrySilbert</a> personally in New York court.

</div></figure>



<h2>Gemini Finally Takes DCG To Court Over Earn Program</h2>



<p>Last year, Genesis was one of several entities with exposure to failed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. The lender suffered a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet before parent company DCG swooped in to absorb the losses, a move that Gemini insists was made up. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>5/ It&#8217;s now clear this was a carefully crafted lie. DCG didn’t absorb any losses or provide real capital. Behind the scenes, DCG wrote Genesis a sham 10yr promissory note w/ a measly 1% interest rate – worth just a fraction of its $1.1b face amount. Genesis was wildly insolvent.</p><cite>&#8211; Cameron Winklevoss tweets about Friday&#8217;s lawsuit against DCG &amp; Genesis</cite></blockquote>



<p>A public spat ensued between the crypto exchange and Barry Silbert&#8217;s companies after Genesis filed for bankruptcy late last year. Genesis was the lending partner for Gemini&#8217;s Earn program and was unable to meet client demands. The crypto exchange claims that <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-genesis-winklevoss-dcg-lawsuit/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-genesis-winklevoss-dcg-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genesis owes Earn users around $766 million</a>, per filings. </p>

<p>Park&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/Barn_Bridge/status/1677110787780018176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1677110787780018176%7Ctwgr%5Edda16063ebd205a0818ddbc09806bef3c4775849%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coindesk.com%2Fpolicy%2F2023%2F07%2F07%2Fbond-token-prices-slumps-10-as-barnbridge-faces-sec-investigation%2F" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/Barn_Bridge/status/1677110787780018176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1677110787780018176%7Ctwgr%5Edda16063ebd205a0818ddbc09806bef3c4775849%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coindesk.com%2Fpolicy%2F2023%2F07%2F07%2Fbond-token-prices-slumps-10-as-barnbridge-faces-sec-investigation%2F" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord message</a> seen on Friday noted that there is limited information on the SEC&#8217;s actions against BarnBridge DAO and the team members. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I am letting you know that the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Barnbridge DAO and individuals associated with the DAO. Because the SEC&#8217;s investigation is ongoing and non-public, I am limited in the information that I will share publicly. </p><cite>&#8211; Douglas Park&#8217;s message to the team on Discord.</cite></blockquote>



<p>The DeFi service offers its users a fixed rate on swaps on yield offerings from lenders like Aave. The protocol&#8217;s total value locked (TVL) once boasted over $500 million but floated around $1.2 million at press time. BardBridge&#8217;s BOND coin fell over 8% on Friday following the news. </p>

<h2>America&#8217;s Crypto Scene Under The Cosh From SEC Actions</h2>



<p>BarnBridge joins a list of crypto entities that the SEC is either investigating or charging with rule-breaking. </p>



<p>Decentralized autonomous organizations are also a contentious topic among U.S. regulators and policymakers. The Commodities and Futures Trading Commission <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ookidao-loses-cftc-lawsuit-643000-penalty/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ookidao-loses-cftc-lawsuit-643000-penalty/" rel="noreferrer noopener">won its case against Ooki DAO</a> in one of the world&#8217;s first verdicts against a DAO. </p>



<p>Ooki DAO was ordered to pay $643,542 in penalties and shut down its operation immediately after failing to respond to the CFTC&#8217;s allegations in court. The verdict perhaps sets a dangerous precedent for future DAO cases as these decentralized organizations could be held liable as a &#8220;person&#8221; under the Commodities Exchange Act.</p>

<p>Chief executive officer of crypto exchange Binance, Changpeng Zhao, rebuffed reports that senior leadership exits are a sign that the company is about to crumble like former rival FTX. Zhao tweeted that the news surrounding these exits is &#8220;FUD&#8221;. </p>

<p>Chief strategy officer Patrick Hillmann, senior vice president for compliance Steven Christie, and general counsel Han Ng are among the executives that are leaving Binance.

<h2>Senior Execs Jump Ship As Binance Spars With Regulators</h2>



<p>The exits come at a time when the SEC and DOJ are lodging accusations against crypto&#8217;s largest centralized exchange. Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued CZ for operating an unregistered securities exchange on American soil. </p>



<p>Zhao was also accused of knowingly <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" rel="noreferrer noopener">commingling customer and corporate funds</a> through several private entities like Merit Peak. </p>



<p>Reports claim that criminal charges from the U.S. Justice Department are imminent following a lawsuit from the SEC. </p>



<p>The company also faces regulatory hurdles in Europe particularly in Australia and France. French authorities raided the Binance office in Paris on suspicions of &#8220;aggravated money laundering&#8221;. Australia&#8217;s securities regulators pulled back its derivatives license and opened a &#8220;targetted review&#8221; of client classification at the exchange. </p>

<ul><li>The judge overseeing Genesis’ bankruptcy case has ordered the crypto lender and FTX back to the negotiation table.&nbsp;</li><li>Manhattan Judge Sean Lane wants both parties to exchange information about the dispute over $2 billion owed to FTX.&nbsp;</li><li>Judge Lane’s latest ruling stated that there will likely be a delay in the payout plan for Genesis’ creditors.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The judge overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings of Genesis Global Holdco has ordered the defunct crypto lending firm and bankrupt crypto exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-sues-firm-to-recover-700-million-sbf/">FTX</a> back to the negotiation table. The latest order came after both parties failed to reach an agreement regarding the $2 billion that FTX claims are owed to it. </p>



<h2><strong>Genesis Bankruptcy Judge Expects Delay In Payout To Creditors</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-06/genesis-s-2-billion-spat-with-ftx-may-delay-creditor-payouts?srnd=all" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the ongoing dispute between Genesis Global and the Bahamas-based FTX exchange will likely keep the court from considering a payout plan for the crypto lender’s stranded creditors. Both parties are under Chapter 11 bankruptcy and are in the process of recovering money to pay back their creditors. However, earlier this year, FTX laid a stake for a $3.9 billion claim from the DCG subsidiary. </p>



<p>In the latest court filing, FTX reduced the claim amount to $2 billion. Despite declaring bankruptcy after FTX, Genesis has indicated that it is nearing the completion of the process and has requested Judge Sean Lane to approve a payout plan for its creditors next month. However, the bankruptcy judge indicated that the crypto lender’s plan appeared to be “awfully optimistic” and was likely to slip past the deadline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Genesis and FTX have put forward separate approaches to reach a resolution in the matter. The bankrupt crypto lender has sought a court date from Judge Lane to determine the legitimacy of the $2 billion claim made by FTX. On the other hand, FTX wants to sue Genesis in Delaware and wants the bankruptcy judge’s permission for the same. The crypto exchange’s bankruptcy proceedings are currently underway in Wilmington, Delaware. In response, Judge Sean Lane refused to grant either request and ordered both parties to exchange information pertaining to the dispute.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation reportedly carried out a search at the residence of Jesse Powell, the man behind <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/kraken-sec-probe-unregistered-securities/">Kraken</a>, the second-largest crypto exchange in the United States. People familiar with the matter revealed that the FBI’s raid was not in connection with Powell’s cryptocurrency business but related to his non-profit ventures. </p>



<h2><strong>Kraken CEO Was Under Investigation Since Last Fall</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/technology/jesse-powell-kraken-crypto-fbi.html" rel="nofollow noopener">New York Times</a>, the FBI searched Jesse Powell’s residence in Los Angeles’ Brentwood area in March this year. Documents viewed by NYT revealed that federal agents seized electronic devices from the Kraken CEO’s home during the search. The search was reportedly over accusations against Powell of hacking and cyber-stalking a non-profit. </p>



<p>The Verge Center for the Arts, which was founded by Jesse Powell, accused him of interfering with its computer accounts and blocking access to emails and other online communications. The FBI and federal prosecutors in California have reportedly been looking into Powell since last fall. No formal charges have been filed against the Kraken founder yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>News of the FBI&#8217;s search and investigation was confirmed by Jesse Powell’s lawyer Brandon Fox, who added that Powell had not done anything wrong. A spokeswoman from Kraken told NYT that the FBI’s investigation of Verge was not related to the crypto exchange in any manner. According to her, the crypto firm had no reason to believe that the investigation involved any other potential issues. At the time of writing, there was no official statement from Jesse Powell regarding the recent developments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After facing severed banking relationships, hostile regulators, and several instances of FUD, multiple senior executives at Binance have reportedly turned in their resignations. The executives blamed their decision to quit on CEO Changpeng Zhao’s handling of the regulatory inquiries and investigations into the exchange’s operations. Their departure comes amid mounting regulatory and legal troubles for the world’s largest crypto exchange.</p>



<h2><strong>BNB Tanks After Top Executives Quit Binance</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/07/06/binance-crisis-executives-quit-changpeng-zhao-justice-department/" rel="nofollow noopener">Fortune</a>, senior executives at Binance, including Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann, Senior Vice President for Compliance Steven Christie, and General Counsel Han Ng, informed the Chief Executive that they were quitting the company. A person familiar with the matter revealed that the executives blamed their departure on Changpeng Zhao’s handling of the investigation by the US Department of Justice. The Justice Department’s probe is just one of many filed by federal agencies in the United States. </p>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binances-market-share-down-by-10-in-2023/">Binance</a> or CEO Changpeng Zhao have not put out an official statement addressing the news of the recent departures. However, CSO Patrick Hillmann took to Twitter to inform everyone that he was leaving the company on good terms and would continue to respect and support Zhao. The BNB token took a visible hit following the latest development and was trading at $234 at the time of writing. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The loss of key figures from legal and compliance departments will likely cause problems for the crypto giant, given that it is juggling several regulatory inquiries. The crypto exchange is currently facing probes from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), among several other investigations. Matthew Price, Binance’s Chief of Global Investigations and Intelligence, also quit the company recently.&nbsp;</p>

<p>British Virgin Islands-based Bitfinex has managed to recover $315,000 lost in a hack nearly seven years ago. The United States Department of Homeland Security helped the crypto exchange recover the funds in the form of cash and cryptocurrencies as part of an ongoing prosecution of the persons associated with the hack.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Bitfinex Will Redistribute Recovered Funds To Its Victims</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-06/crypto-exchange-bitfinex-says-315-000-from-2016-hack-recovered" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Bitfinex worked with Homeland Security to recover the funds that were lost in a hack back in August 2016. The hack drained 120,000 <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-pro-bitcoin/">Bitcoins</a> from the crypto exchange which was valued at approximately $72 million at the time. At the time of writing, the stolen Bitcoin was valued at a whopping $3.7 billion. The latest recovery is part of the exchange’s ongoing efforts to work with law enforcement and other agencies to recover the crypto assets stolen from the platform. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The U.S. government continues to make progress in prosecuting individuals involved in the Bitfinex security breach and in seizing funds associated with the theft.&#8221;</p><cite>Bitfinex Staff</cite></blockquote>



<p>The recovered funds will be redistributed among the holders of Bitfinex’s Recovery Right Tokens. These digital coins were issued to the victims of the hack and represent the funds owed to them. However, given that there are nearly 30 million Recovery Right Tokens in circulation, the victims will likely be refunded a negligible amount from the recent recovery. Authorities arrested a couple last year for allegedly laundering billions worth of Bitcoins associated with the hack. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Users in the Netherlands could choose to withdraw their funds from Binance to Coinmerce, Coinmerce CEO Jaap de Bruijn said in a blog post. </li><li>The company chose Coinmerce as its local partner amid preparations to exit the Dutch market due to regulatory reasons</li><li>Binance is shutting down its operations in the Netherlands and other European jurisdictions while facing lawsuits in the U.S.</li></ul>



<p>Dutch crypto exchange Coinmerce is an option for Binance users looking to withdraw their funds as crypto&#8217;s largest exchange bows out of the Netherlands due to licensing complications. </p>



<p>The update was confirmed by both Binance in an email to Dutch users and a <a href="https://coinmerce.io/en/news/binance-offers-dutch-users-switch-to-coinmerce/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coinmerce.io/en/news/binance-offers-dutch-users-switch-to-coinmerce/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> from Coinmerce. &#8220;The crypto assets of the Dutch users at Binance will be transferred to Coinmerce via a controlled transition,&#8221; said Coinmerce CEO Jaap de Bruijn on Thursday. Notably, the transfer is optional and free.</p>



<p>Binance is unable to continue servicing Dutch users after failing to secure a license from the Dutch Central Bank as a virtual asset provider. The company will exit the Netherlands and shut down its local business as announced last month. </p>



<p>Per an email sent to Dutch users, the platform chose Coinmerce as its local partner since it is regulated by the DNB since 2020. Coinmerce boasts a &#8220;nearly identical&#8221; list of cryptocurrencies as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/14s43f0/binance_recommending_coinmerce_in_the_netherlands/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/14s43f0/binance_recommending_coinmerce_in_the_netherlands/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">noted</a> by the exchange in its email to users. </p>



<h2>Binance In Europe</h2>



<p>The Dutch Central Bank fined Binance $3.6 million (3.3 million euros) last year for operating without a license. Months later in 2023, the company is winding down local Dutch operations and referring users to a rival exchange. </p>



<p>French investigators stormed the platform&#8217;s Paris office as part of a probe into suspected money laundering. Australia&#8217;s securities regulator ASIC revoked the company&#8217;s license and also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-australia-probed-derivatives/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-australia-probed-derivatives/" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched a probe into client classification</a> at the exchange. </p>



<p>The company has reaffirmed its commitment to complying with local laws and working with regulators to secure licenses needed to service users across jurisdictions. </p>
