Binance Granted Permission to Offer Broker-Dealer Services in Dubai
<p>In a blog post, Binance announced the news today, saying that the license allows it to offer services in Dubai approved by VARA, including exchange and broker-dealer services. Binance said the services are currently limited to institutional and qualified retail investors.</p>
<p>The exchange secured a provisional MVP license in March 2022 and a preparatory MVP license in September 2022. The exchange&rsquo;s progression from a Provisional License to an Operational License allows eligible users in the country &ldquo;to access authorized services, including the ability to safely convert virtual assets to fiat under VARA-designated standards compliant with the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Head of Regional Markets at Binance, Richard Teng, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are honored to be the first exchange to be granted an operational Minimum Viable Product License by VARA &mdash; a result of over a year of due diligence, collaboration, and consistent demonstration of responsible intent &ndash; that now allows us to be able to leverage the potential of a progressive regulatory framework, enabling innovation while furthering user protection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adding,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Operating within this regulated ecosystem, we are committed to ensuring secure and seamless customer migration, with robust Know-Your-Customer and Customer-Due-Diligence as part of the rigorous onboarding remediation as stipulated by VARA. Our priority is to be able to operate this first fully regulated exchange in, and from Dubai, in a FATF-compliant ecosystem, setting the stage for global scalability with uncompromised user assurance.&rdquo;</p>

Binance Looks to UAE for Future Prospects
<p>Last month, the exchange said it was considering a move to Dubai as it continues its struggles with the US SEC. Alex Chehade, Binance Dubai&rsquo;s General Manager, said that the exchange believes the UAE is a prime destination for crypto businesses and applauds the region&rsquo;s pro-crypto stance and policies.</p>
