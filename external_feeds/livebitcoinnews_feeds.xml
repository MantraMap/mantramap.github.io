										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In early 2021, the state of Texas paid a <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/texas-paid-bitcoin-company-175k-205910042.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">bitcoin mining company</a> called Bit Deer approximately $175,000 per hour.</p>
<h2>Texas Doled Out Cash for No Work</h2>
<p>For what purpose, you ask? Well, it wasn’t because the Lone Star State wanted to gain access to mined BTC units. It wasn’t to create jobs, and it wasn’t to help build the region’s economy. It was because the state was suffering from devastating winter storms, and the money was so that the company would shut off its mining rigs and not put the power grid in trouble.</p>
<p>The early 2021 winter storms suffered by Texas ultimately led to several deaths and a wide array of other problems. There were simply too many people blasting their heaters all day and night, and this led to serious issues with the state’s power sources. It also prevented many other individuals from gaining access to the power they needed to heat their homes and stay warm.</p>
<p>Over the past several years, Texas has <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/texas-is-still-a-major-crypto-mining-hub/" data-wpel-link="internal">become home to a wide</a> array of crypto mining companies, many of which hail from China given their home country ended bitcoin <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-crypto-mining-clampdown-in-china-is-not-over/" data-wpel-link="internal">mining in the summer</a> of 2021 and dubbed the practice illegal. Texas – known for its vast open spaces and low-cost energy – seemed like a good place to set up shop and keep things going, but this has led to some unexpected barricades, as with so many digital currency mining enterprises now making their way to the rural south, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/nasty-heatwave-causes-texas-btc-miners-to-slow-down/" data-wpel-link="internal">power has become</a> limited and at times, more expensive for common people.</p>
<p>February of 2021 saw Texas suffering from winter storms Uri and Viola. The events led to several blackouts and freezing temperatures for residents. Mining computers and other machinery used by companies like Bit Deer were allegedly utilizing as much electricity as was required to power 6,500 homes. The money the state paid to Bit Deer was doled out over a four-day period of no activity, meaning the firm garnered as much as $18 million for NO WORK. As much as we all love mining, in many ways, that just doesn’t sound morally or ethically right.</p>
<h2>Is Mining Really That Bad?</h2>
<p>Crypto mining has garnered something of a negative reputation over the years amongst eco-friendly individuals. They say the practice should be outlawed fully given it is allegedly leading Mother Earth towards a dismal path that there’s no return from. In addition, there have been several reports published in the past suggesting crypto <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/report-bitcoin-mining-may-require-more-energy-than-180-countries/" data-wpel-link="internal">mining utilizes more energy</a> than most developing nations.</p>
<p>Even industry heads like Elon Musk have expressed concerns about the mining process. In early 2021, Musk was all set to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/elon-musk-permits-bitcoin-payments-for-tesla-vehicles/" data-wpel-link="internal">let crypto holders</a> buy Tesla vehicles with BTC, but the decision was later rescinded as Musk <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-has-taken-a-nasty-stumble-many-are-blaming-elon-musk/" data-wpel-link="internal">demanded answers regarding</a> the cleanliness of miners’ energy sources.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center suggests <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2023/04/10/majority-of-americans-arent-confident-in-the-safety-and-reliability-of-cryptocurrency/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">most Americans don’t</a> feel confident about, nor do they feel safe using, crypto.</p>
<h2>Survey: American&#8217;s Aren&#8217;t Confident Around Crypto</h2>
<p>Between March 13 and 19 of this year, the Research Center asked a group of people about their feelings towards crypto, and roughly three quarters of the respondents (about 75 percent) suggested that their confidence in the space was lacking or nonexistent. For example, just under 40 percent of those taking part in the study said that they had zero confidence in the industry and didn’t feel comfortable in any way, shape, or form trading or using digital assets in any capacity.</p>
<p>Another 36 percent of the respondents, while their negative feelings weren’t nearly as large as the first group, said that their confidence was not particularly strong, and that it would take a lot to convince them otherwise. The most depressing part of the survey? Only two to four percent of those taking part said they feel extremely confident in crypto, while 18 percent said they only feel “somewhat” confident.</p>
<p>These kinds of numbers are a shame because despite all that’s been accomplished in the digital currency arena over the last ten years, there are still far too many people marred by recent incidents involving <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">FTX</a> and other faulty companies. Like we’ve mentioned in several articles in the past, the FTX debacle is likely to leave a long-lasting – if not permanent – stain on the face of crypto.</p>
<p>With so much fraud taking place throughout the departments of FTX, and many other forms of crypto-related heists and crime occurring, one can’t really blame people for not feeling as strongly about crypto as they should.</p>
<p>FTX, for example, saw more <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/report-the-damage-caused-by-ftx-was-worse-than-initially-thought/" data-wpel-link="internal">than $200 billion in crypto</a> wiped from the digital slate, and it’s been alleged that customer funds were used by Sam Bankman-Fried and his fellow executive inappropriately (to either purchase luxury Bahamian real estate or to pay off loans for another company). This kind of fusing of both customer and company funds is illegal, and it casts a serious pall over the arena.</p>
<h2>There&#8217;s So Much Fraudulent Activity</h2>
<p>In addition, we’re constantly hearing about crypto cyberattacks and scams, the most common now being <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/romance-scams/" data-wpel-link="internal">romance scams</a>. There are so many people out there looking for love or significant others. In the digital age, they’re turning to the internet to find their perfect matches, but things are getting thwarted as many of those with online love profiles could potentially be crypto thieves that tell their victims to invest in criminal-controlled digital platforms.</p>
<p>Once they begin investing and trust that things are going well, they’re likely to encounter issues if they try to extract money from the platforms, and it’s not long before they realize they’ve been played.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The effects of the 2022 bear market haven’t fully disappeared, it seems. There are many companies out there still dealing with the repercussions of those bearish ripples, the Gemini exchange in New York <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/the-winklevoss-twins-have-lent-100-million-of-their-own-money-to-keep-their-gemini-exchange-afloat-as-venture-funding-slows/ar-AA19IGfp" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">being a big one</a>.</p>
<h2>Gemini Gets $100 Million from Its Founders</h2>
<p>Not long ago, it was announced that Gemini founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss issued a loan of approximately $100 million of their own funds to aid in the company’s continued operations. This suggests one of many things, a major one being that the exchange is now on pins and needles and could be walking the same cold and ugly path that so many other crypto platforms (from <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">FTX</a> to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/celsius-network-is-next-crypto-company-to-file-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">Celsius</a>) have trodden over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>To be fair, those companies arguably engaged in fraudulent and criminal activity, which is why they likely experienced troubles (both financial and otherwise) towards the end. At the time of writing, Gemini hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing, nor is there any evidence suggesting the company took part in scam-like behavior, so it’s likely Gemini is still reeling from the ongoing bear conditions that made themselves so prominent last year.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it’s good news that the Winklevoss Twins are endowed with so much money given their company likely wouldn’t be surviving right about now without it. The fact that they’re able to shell out the necessary funds to keep the firm going suggests Gemini has a fighting chance, and its customers still have time to receive what’s theirs and enjoy a certain degree of stability.</p>
<p>However, it’s disappointing to know that while individual assets are doing relatively well (BTC, for example, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-rose-to-30k-in-mid-april-analysts-discuss-why/" data-wpel-link="internal">recently hit $30K</a> for the first time in about ten months), the respective exchanges that sell or hold them are another story. It’s as though the fall of FTX is still ringing bells (and rather negative ones at that) approximately half a year after the exchange came crashing to the ground, and it’s likely that trust for crypto exchanges has fallen in recent weeks and months due to the fraudulent behavior that has clearly taken place within its departments.</p>
<p>While neither Cameron nor Tyler Winklevoss have issued individual statements regarding Gemini’s fate, they have mentioned that the money they’ve issued will be utilized strictly for operational purposes.</p>
<h2>A Lot of Previous Problems</h2>
<p>Gemini has been hit hard over the past 12 months. The company engaged in not one, but two separate <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/gemini-exchange-engages-in-more-layoffs/" data-wpel-link="internal">layoff orders</a> that saw more than ten percent of its overall staff suddenly hitting the bread lines. In addition, the company’s lending arena Genesis Global Capital is now being scrutinized by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>The agency recently hit <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/investors-are-suing-the-gemini-exchange-over-alleged-fraud/" data-wpel-link="internal">Genesis with charges</a> that it sold unregistered securities through a lending program called Gemini Earn.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recent kidnapping and murder of a woman in Seoul, South Korea (the nation’s capital city) has turned up <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/2nd-ld-key-suspect-in-kidnapping-murder-first-proposed-killing-over-cryptocurrency-disputes-police/ar-AA19DSnQ" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">some new evidence</a>. Police investigating the matter believe the woman may have been involved in various crypto-related disputes, and that her attacker was associated and hired by the opposing party.</p>
<h2>Why Is There So Much Crypto Crime in South Korea?</h2>
<p>The pair perpetrating the crime was a husband-and-wife duo named Yoo and Hwang, and they are believed to have paid more than $53,000 to the key suspect in the murder to carry things out. This stems from an official statement from Seoul’s Suseo Police Station. Arrest warrants were later issued for the suspect (who goes by the name Lee) and for Hwang, who is wanted for questioning.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Lee has confessed to all the charges that are against him, while the married couple say they have nothing to do with what’s going on. Lee has been arrested along with two other accomplices for allegedly carrying out the murder of the 48-year-old woman from the Gangnam district in Seoul, South Korea. The killing is believed to have occurred on March 29 of this year. Lee and his associates then later (crudely) disposed of her remains.</p>
<p>Lee has issued an apology to the victim and her family, saying in recent statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;d like to offer my sincere apology to the victim in this case, and I pray for the repose of her soul. I am also really sorry to her family for the irreparable scars this has caused.</p></blockquote>
<p>South Korea appears to be at the center of heavy digital currency-centered crime as of late. Not long ago, it was <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-executive-do-kwon-arrested-in-montenegro/" data-wpel-link="internal">announced that Do Kwon</a> – the creator of Terra Labs – had been arrested in the European nation of Montenegro after he was discovered to be holding phony passports at an airport terminal. Do Kwon was wanted by authorities in connection with the collapse of Terra USD, an algorithmic stable currency that fell apart in the summer of last year, causing investors to lose billions.</p>
<h2>Kwon Making Off with Investments?</h2>
<p>Kwon is believed to have transferred all his Terra <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-sec-case-against-crypto-exec-do-kwon-just-got-a-lot-hairier/" data-wpel-link="internal">holdings into BTC just</a> weeks before the coin’s collapse, suggesting to authorities that Kwon was planning to kill the currency and make off with any remaining profits in a rug pull. For months, Kwon was a fugitive hiding from the law, though he continued to deny this claim on social media, instead mentioning that he <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-exec-do-kwon-says-hes-willing-to-cooperate-following-arrest-warrant/" data-wpel-link="internal">was willing to cooperate</a> with police and that he was busy writing code in his living room.</p>
<p>The victim in this present case was part of a crypto investment scheme that the married couple also took part in. They ultimately discussed stealing her digital currency stash after the murder was to take place.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The picture above is a return test chart of a quantitative strategy. Before the back test week is 2021 to 2023, 25 months, the rate of return is as high as 7869%, which is equivalent to an annualized rate of return of 3779%, which is the annualized rate of return. The rate is close to 40 times. It&#8217;s time to embrace the future with <a href="https://www.atpbot.com?utm_source=livebitcoinnews&amp;utm_medium=sp&amp;utm_campaign=20230512" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>AI trading bots</strong></a>.</p>
<h4>What is Quantitative Trading?</h4>
<p>The quantitative strategy platform is a trading platform based on big data and artificial intelligence technology that develops a series of automated trading strategies by studying historical data and market trends. Through the quantitative strategy platform, you can choose a strategy that suits you, and automatically trade to obtain stable returns. According to incomplete statistics, the proportion of quantitative transactions used by investment banking institutions has exceeded 90%, and it has already determined the future of the speculative world.</p>
<h4>What are the advantages of automated quantitative trading over manual trading?</h4>
<p>Faster speed: Automated trading systems can analyze market data and execute trading operations more quickly, so that transactions can respond faster and capture market opportunities faster.</p>
<p>Better discipline: automated trading systems can adhere to strict trading rules and strategies, and avoid bad trading decisions caused by emotions and subjective judgments. Therefore, automated trading systems are better able to maintain trading discipline and stability.</p>
<p>More Precise: Automated trading systems are able to use sophisticated algorithms and models to analyze market data to more precisely identify and exploit trading opportunities and better manage risk.</p>
<p>Automated execution: The automated trading system can automatically execute trading strategies 24 hours a day, reducing the manpower and time costs required for manual trading, and can also keep trading while sleeping or leaving the computer.</p>
<p>Backtesting and optimization: Automated trading systems can use historical data for backtesting and optimization to improve trading strategies and improve trading performance.</p>
<h4>Why are quantitative trading bots suitable for the crypto market?</h4>
<p>The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and market trends are difficult to predict, and many investors have suffered losses as a result. However, trading platforms based on quantitative strategies can use data analysis and machine learning technology to find the laws and trends in the market, improve the success rate of investment, and reduce risks.</p>
<p>How should we carry out quantitative trading? First of all, you have to have a quantitative strategy. If you don&#8217;t have one, then ATPBot is a good choice.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new report has emerged talking about what it was that <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/hubris-incompetence-and-greed-plagued-failed-cryptocurrency-exchange-ftx/ar-AA19HgzF" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">really led to the destruction</a> and collapse of the FTX digital currency exchange.</p>
<h2>Why Did FTX <em>Really</em> Fall?</h2>
<p>Everyone would like to think it was heavy corruption or something similar, but per the words of the report, it was merely “hubris and greed.” Hubris is described as “arrogance before the gods” (according to games like <em>Far Cry 5</em>). Mere mortals like us should take that like everyone at FTX had tremendous egos. They all thought they were too smart and too capable and thus didn’t take necessary precautions.</p>
<p>In terms of greed, it’s clear that many people involved with the company sought to get their hands on money they didn’t necessarily need. Money that belonged to other people. This is among the many charges that the former head executive of FTX – Sam Bankman-Fried – is now facing. It is said that SBF utilized customer funds to purchase luxury real estate in the Bahamas, where the company was stationed. Naughty, naughty, naughty…</p>
<p>In addition, the debtors’ report also suggests that an incredible lack of competence underlined the many mishaps that occurred behind the FTX walls. For example, the company failed to create key executive roles to ensure specific duties were tackled in due time. Thus, you had an environment where everyone was clearly multi-tasking… Something they weren’t equipped to do. There was also no cybersecurity department to keep customer funds safe should mishaps have occurred (which they obviously did).</p>
<p>Lastly, the company is believed to have lied to third parties about its funds and business dealings, and there were many jokes amongst employees about how quick the company was to lose track of millions of dollars at a time. There was also no controlled framework or oversight of business dealings. In the end, this helped the firm to “collapse as quickly as it had grown,” the report comments.</p>
<p>The fall of FTX is likely to go down as one of the most embarrassing occurrences within the digital currency space. Founded in 2019 (merely four years ago), the company quickly rose through the ranks to become the third largest crypto exchange in the world by the summer of 2021. Everyone thought the company was on top of the world and incapable of collapsing, but they were wrong…</p>
<h2>A History of Bad Behavior</h2>
<p>In November of 2022, Sam Bankman-Fried complained online <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-i-the-fall-of-a-token/" data-wpel-link="internal">that his company needed</a> cash fast to continue operating. He <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">approached his competitor</a> Binance about being bought out, but the latter firm took one look at FTX’s issues and quickly said “no.” FTX then had no choice but to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">file bankruptcy</a>.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before this led to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftxs-disgraced-founder-has-been-arrested/" data-wpel-link="internal">the arrest</a> of Sam Bankman-Fried, who is <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-to-await-trial-at-his-parents-house/" data-wpel-link="internal">now awaiting trial</a> at his parents’ home in Northern California.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are here with exciting news! Working on the blockchain, Xrp Classic is nearing the end of their blockchain, which they call Classic Chain. Classic Chain is configured using the powerful and reliable Proof of Authority protocol. Xrp Classic is proud to share the results of closed beta tests and in this article we will give you some important information.</p>
<h3>What is Proof of Authority?</h3>
<p>Proof of Authority was proposed by Gavin Wood, one of the co-founders of Ethereum. In the Proof of Authority protocol, users who verify transaction blocks on the blockchain use their identities and reputations instead of using and staking cryptocurrency assets to validate transactions. In networks that use the Proof of Authority protocol, individuals with pre-verified identities gain the authority to produce new blocks. The real identities of the validators responsible for the functioning of the network are known, and their authorization comes after a certain review process following the disclosure of their true identity.</p>
<h3>What is the Purpose of Using Proof of Authority Blockchain Networks?</h3>
<p>Proof of Authority was developed as an alternative to commonly used protocols such as Proof of Stake and Proof of Work. It is used in blockchain networks with the aim of providing an alternative to the limitations and issues that need to be addressed in Proof of Stake and Proof of Work. The Proof of Authority protocol allows for a higher number of transactions per second compared to other protocols. The energy consumption in these transactions is significantly lower. In comparison to other protocols, lower transaction fees are incurred.</p>
<h3>Tests on the Classic Chain TestNet Network:</h3>
<h4>Nodes</h4>
<p>The developer team has been conducting closed beta tests on the Classic Chain TestNet network for a long time, today we will share with you some results of these tests. In the closed TestNet network, the number of blocks currently created has exceeded 100,000. This is a testament to the strong and steady progress of the blockchain.</p>
<h4>Fast and Efficient Block Creation and Transfer Time</h4>
<p>The developer team has made and continues to make some updates to the methods of creating nodes as a result of long work to improve the performance of the blockchain. Thanks to these updates, it was possible to reduce the average block generation and transfer time from 6.5 seconds to 5.1 seconds in low-intensity situations. These fast transaction times will enable users to perform transactions on the blockchain faster and more efficiently.</p>
<h3>Transition Plans to Open Beta Tests</h3>
<p>Closed Beta tests of Classic Chain continue unabated, and they stated that they will share other data and achievements they have achieved in the near future. After the Closed Beta tests are fully completed, they announced that they will start open beta tests.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Xrp Classic on their success!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The price of bitcoin rose to $30,000 in mid-April for the first <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/04/11/forget-the-fed-is-this-the-real-reason-behind-cryptos-200-billion-bitcoin-ethereum-bnb-xrp-cardano-dogecoin-polygon-and-solana-price-boom/?sh=76d5c434711d" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">time since June of last year</a>. The asset is now up roughly $14,000 from where it was at the end of 2022, which was arguably the worst year on record for the world’s number one digital asset by market cap.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Just Keeps Shooting Up</h2>
<p>Of course, we’ve now got analysts throughout the digital asset space wondering what could have caused such a massive hike in the currency’s price. Markus Thielen – head of research and strategy at Matrix Port – commented in a recent note:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stable coin tether (USDT) has now reached a market capitalization of $80 billion, an increase of $13.8 billion. The issuance of USDTs on Ethereum accounts for another $35 billion, but the spread between USDTs issued on Tron and Ethereum is now widening significantly. The all-time high in USDT issuance was at $82 billion in May 2022, and tether is now only $2 billion away from it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rachel Lin – chief executive of crypto trading company Synfutures – was also quick to chime in with her two cents, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Higher-than-expected U.S. jobless claims suggest the Federal Reserve may soon halt rate hikes, which could benefit risk assets like crypto. Conversely, a higher unemployment rate could signal a looming recession, negatively impacting all assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tether is a stable asset that is often widely tied to BTC. In fact, it is often <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-13-bitcoin-bitfinex-price-manipulation-cryptocurrency.html#:~:text=Researchers%20now%20say%20that%20the%20digital%20currency%20Tether,in%20value%20from%20March%202017%20through%20March%202018." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">believed that in 2018</a>, when BTC was struggling pricewise, Tether was utilized to purchase more BTC on the side to help push the asset along and tie it further to USD. Thielen commented further that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Circle USDC lost $11.8 billion and Paxos-Binance BUSD lost $9.4 billion. Obviously, those large moves had implications for crypto assets. In addition, the volume of spot vs. derivatives has now declined to just 11 percent. This means that for every $11 traded in spot, $100 dollars are traded in derivatives. This is the lowest ratio since May 2022 and is a sign of &#8216;pure speculation.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>Katharine Wooller – director at Coin Cover – mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin&#8217;s ten-month high should be a confirmation that we’re seeing a return of a crypto bull market. Since the start of 2023, the crypto market has faced regular turmoil in the form of regulatory challenges and the collapse of crypto companies [which are] indicative of wider systemic problems. Yet, despite this, the market continues to perform well against all odds.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Trying to Put the Past Behind It</h2>
<p>Thus far, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a> has shown extraordinary signs of recovery given it’s only been five months since the start of the year. The currency is easily rising through the ranks to put the doldrums of 2022 behind it once and for all.</p>
<p>During the previous 12 months, bitcoin lost more than 70 percent of its value and fell drastically from its all-time high of $68,000 per unit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrencies are upending the elitist, paper-shuffling world of traditional finance. They’re creating new stores of value and reigniting financial interest amongst a new class of investors. <a href="https://blocktrade.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Blocktrade</a> is taking cryptocurrency engagement to a new level through its gamified universe &#8211; a cryptocurrency trading platform that incorporates levels, collectibles, leaderboards and challenges into crypto trading.</p>

<p>The wave of NFT popularity that reached new highs in the last years is still only the beginning of investment into digital worlds and personas. Now, crypto investments, digital collectables, and unique, personalizable avatars are all available on a single platform: Blocktrade.</p>
<p>As part of this gamified crypto universe, Blocktrade has just launched a Crypto Greek Gods collection, introducing 50 unique avatars representing Greek Gods for users to immerse themselves in a world where mythological creatures come to life.

By intertwining gaming and crypto through a Greek God theme, Blocktrade is creating a captivating connection that bridges the past and future.</p>
<p>The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the digital landscape, and Blocktrade is a crypto platform designed for the future. Gamification is the next step in trading culture and a move that will leave traditional finance further behind.
