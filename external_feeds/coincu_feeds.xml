<p>The digital asset manager announced the change on Friday. Lido (LDO) is currently the second largest token in the Grayscale DeFi fund, accounting for 19.04% of it.</p>

<p>Grayscale DeFi Fund currently accounts for 45.46% of each token in Uniswap (UNI), 19.04% of Lido (LDO), 11.53% of Aave (Aave), 10.82% of MakerDAO (MKR), and 10.82% of Curve Token DAO (CRV) at 7.03% and Synthetix (SNX) at 6.12%.</p>



<p>This digital asset manager said it adjusted the DeFi fund&#8217;s portfolio, selling a certain number of existing tokens by the weight of each token and using the proceeds to buy LDO.</p>



<p>&#8220;In accordance with the CoinDesk DeFi Select Index methodology, Grayscale has adjusted the DeFi Fund&#8217;s portfolio by selling certain amounts of the existing Fund Components in proportion to their respective weightings, and using the cash proceeds to purchase Lido (LDO),&#8221; Grayscale said in a company <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/07/07/2701070/0/en/Grayscale-Digital-Large-Cap-Fund-Grayscale-DeFi-Fund-and-Grayscale-Smart-Contract-Platform-Ex-Ethereum-Fund-Announce-Rebalancing-of-Funds-for-Second-Quarter-2023.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release</a>. &#8220;No tokens were removed from the DeFi Fund.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lido, a liquid staking service, also offers tokens that aim to make staking on Ethereum cheaper. Lido staking ETH (stETH) is its most popular product and the seventh largest cryptocurrency, according to CoinGecko. STETH performing well has made LDO, the governance token linked to Lido, more attractive to investors.</p>

By comparison, its flagship product, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), has over $18 billion in assets. The DeFi Fund has also been running moderately hot, down more than 73% since its launch in July 2021.</p>

<li><em>Circle has blacklisted three wallet addresses and frozen about 63 million USDC related to the Multichain attack.</em></li>



<li><em>The Multichain Bridge has announced an outage and has not given a cause for yesterday&#8217;s problem.</em></li>

<p>Circle, the issuer of the popular USDC stablecoin, acted quickly in response to the recent security breach on the Multichain protocol. This decisive move demonstrates Circle&#8217;s commitment to protecting the integrity and security of its stablecoins.</p>

<p>In response to the incident, Multichain took to Twitter from its official account to notify users of the temporary suspension of its services. This notice is intended to provide transparency to users and advise them to only interact with the platform once the situation is resolved.</p>

<p>Affected parties, including Circle and Multichain, are likely working hard to investigate the breach, determine the root cause, and make the necessary improvements to prevent similar incidents in the future. More than 24 hours have passed, but information about the cause of the hack has not been revealed.</p>



<p>This multi-chain bridge service has recently caused a lot of frustration for users due to incidents and negative information about the project leader. At the end of May, the bridge also stopped working for the reason that there was no access when it lost contact with CEO Zhao Jun. Meanwhile, the project&#8217;s development team and CEO are rumored to have been arrested by Chinese police before.</p>

<p>A confidential July 7 report from Teneo, the liquidation firm, which CoinDesk reviewed, says failed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital has a &#8220;potential claim&#8221; worth more than $1 billion with DCG and its lending subsidiary Genesis. The report also states that BlockFi has received a &#8220;preferred payment&#8221; of more than $220 million from 3AC.</p>



<p>Preference claims would come into play if the hedge fund were aware it made payments that put one or more debts into a better position than other debts. In this case, they concern transactions made by 3AC during what&#8217;s known as the insolvency twilight zone following the collapse of the Terra Luna project earlier in 2022.</p>



<p>However, with the current situation, the companies involved are all struggling and caught up in a tangle of lawsuits and complaints with different partners.</p>

<p>DCG and Genesis, along with founder Barry Silbert, are both embroiled in a lawsuit <a href="https://coincu.com/200998-dcg-has-responses-to-the-lawsuit-from-gemini/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> yesterday by Gemini CEO Cameron Winklevoss alleging a conspiracy to defraud Genesis creditors following claims of more than $600 million by the company. Gemini stagnates and shows no sign of being met.</p>



<p>In addition, BlockFi also filed a complaint requesting the recovery of more than $1 billion from FTX/Alameda. However, based on the filing filed by FTX, FTX does not accept BlockFi&#8217;s argument and argues that BlockFi is abusing bankruptcy rules. Accordingly, its bankruptcy plan was also opposed.</p>



<p>For now, Teneo declined to comment on any payback plans. DCG and BlockFi did not return requests for comment.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>DCG has officially responded after Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss announced that he had filed a lawsuit against the company and founder Barry Silbert.</em></li>



<li><em>Silbert&#8217;s company denied Gemini&#8217;s accusations and argued that CEO Winklevoss was trying to deny responsibility for the Earn program.</em></li>



<li><em>A protracted lawsuit could break out with $1.2 billion of user funds still in storage.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DCG has issued an <a href="https://twitter.com/DCGco/status/1677346741409173508" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official response</a> to the lawsuit filed by Gemini CEO Cameron Winklevoss with disapproval of all allegations.</strong></h5>

<p>The back-and-forth between DCG and its &#8220;close&#8221; partner Gemini has been intense since its subsidiary, lending platform Genesis, filed for bankruptcy at the end of January this year. Genesis and Gemini have a partnership through Gemini&#8217;s Earn program, and the bankruptcy left $1.2 billion in Gemini user funds trapped on the platform.</p>



<p>In response to a recent lawsuit, Silbert&#8217;s company has denied Gemini&#8217;s allegations and said that this is just an advertising ploy by Gemini CEO to escape responsibility from the Earn program and $1.2 billion in user money.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>In addition, DCG also denies all allegations that the company and its employees have any wrongdoing and considers these allegations to be unfounded defamation. This company attempted to negotiate a settlement for Genesis&#8217; bankruptcy, while Gemini was not actively involved in the process. Neither Cameron nor Tyler Winklevoss has appeared in any recent face-to-face meetings.</p>



<p>The development is nothing new, but the fact that both companies are blaming each other could lead to a protracted lawsuit. User money still needs to be included while the two sides try to push and give.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the previous post, on July 7, Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss tweeted that Gemini <a href="https://coincu.com/200982-gemini-files-lawsuit-dcg-for-fraud-conspiracy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had filed</a> a lawsuit against DCG and founder Barry Silbert. Winklevoss alleges that Barry was not only the mastermind and mastermind of the DCG and Genesis creditor scam but that he was directly and personally involved in this scam.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-507.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="296" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-507.png" alt="DCG Has Responses To The Lawsuit From Gemini" class="wp-image-201001" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-507.png 900w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-507-300x99.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-507-768x253.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-507-750x247.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="DCG Has Responses To The Lawsuit From Gemini 9"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Besides, Winklevoss said it was a complicated lie, with DCG not taking losses and not providing actual capital. Barry, DCG, and Genesis conspired to fabricate false financial statements to hide the truth from Gemini and its creditors.</p>

<p>Kennedy&#8217;s support for the king of crypto has been notable throughout his campaign, and he has gone as far as accepting the digital asset for campaign donations. However, the news of his substantial BTC holdings has led to questions about his objectivity in policymaking, particularly related to the regulation of the cryptocurrency industry. Kennedy has expressed concerns about government-issued digital assets, but his personal financial interest in Bitcoin could be seen as a potential conflict of interest.</p>



<p>It is unclear when Kennedy acquired the Bitcoin holdings, and the filing does not specify whether the investment was made by Kennedy himself or a member of his family. The lack of transparency has only added to the concerns raised by this news, highlighting the importance of transparency in political campaigns and policymaking. As the digital asset industry continues to gain mainstream attention and influence, it is crucial that policymakers approach it with an informed and objective perspective.</p>



<p>The news also emphasizes the need for a clear and concise regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry, ensuring that candidates and policymakers alike can operate with clarity and transparency. As the industry becomes more prevalent in the political sphere, policymakers must take a proactive approach to regulation, working to create a fair and level playing field for all participants.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gemini has sued DCG and Barry Silbert for a fraud conspiracy against Genesis creditors. DCG calls it a &#8220;publicity stunt&#8221;. Mediation process is ending.</strong></h5>



<p>Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has sued Digital Currency Group (DCG) and its founder Barry Silbert. Gemini alleges that Silbert and DCG were involved in fraud against creditors of Genesis, a cryptocurrency lending platform that filed for bankruptcy last year. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Today, <a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Gemini</a> filed a lawsuit against <a href="https://twitter.com/DCGco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@DCGco</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/BarrySilbert?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@BarrySilbert</a> personally in New York court. Barry was not only the architect and mastermind of the DCG and Genesis fraud against creditors, he was directly and personally involved in perpetrating it.</p>&mdash; Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1677327395869581316?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 7, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>According to the complaint, Silbert and DCG conspired with Genesis to create false financial reports to hide the fact that Genesis was insolvent. DCG responded to the lawsuit by calling it a &#8220;publicity stunt&#8221; by Cameron Winklevoss to deflect blame from himself and Gemini. The mediation process is coming to an end, and the case is expected to be handled under Chapter 11 bankruptcy law.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size"><em>This is yet another publicity stunt from Cameron Winklevoss to deflect blame and responsibility from himself and Gemini, which operated the Gemini Earn program. Any suggestion of wrongdoing by DCG or any of its employees is baseless, defamatory, and completely false. From day one, DCG has remained committed to reaching an amicable solution for all parties to the Genesis bankruptcy. </em><br><br><em>Senior DCG leadership has been working around the clock over the course of multiple months in active negotiation with representatives of the Official Unsecured Creditors Committee and Ad Hoc Committee to reach a deal while Gemini&#8217;s leadership was MIA or only issuing press statements. To be clear, neither Cameron nor Tyler Winklevoss have been involved in any of the recent in-person meetings. The mediation process is nearing a close and we expect to bring the Genesis Chapter 11 case to a conclusion soon.</em></p>

<p>Gemini claims that Silbert and DCG were involved in a carefully crafted fraud against creditors of Genesis. When Genesis notified Gemini that it would terminate the Earn program in October 2022, Silbert reached out to set up a meeting to induce Gemini to continue to Earn. He did this knowing that Genesis was massively insolvent. Silbert claimed that Genesis faced only a timing issue, but this was a lie that hid the gaping hole in Genesis’s balance sheet.</p>

<p>When Three Arrows Capital (3AC) collapsed in June 2022, it blew a $1.2 billion hole in Genesis’s balance sheet. Instead of coming clean, Genesis claimed that everything was business as usual because DCG had stepped in to absorb the losses. However, DCG did not absorb any losses or provide real capital. Behind the scenes, DCG wrote Genesis a sham 10-year promissory note with a measly 1% interest rate – worth just a fraction of its $1.1 billion face amount. Genesis was wildly insolvent.</p>

<p>The fraud extends to the very top, with Silbert and other DCG executives directly involved in these lies and concealing the truth from Gemini and other creditors. According to Cameron Winklevoss, Mark Murphy, then-COO of DCG (and current President), was copied when Genesis disseminated its fake financial reports. He knew that the reports lied about DCG’s financial support for Genesis but did not correct them.</p>

<p>The snapshot date for the certificate is July 1st, and the findings reveal a substantial increase in BTC asset accumulation compared to the previous month (June 1st).</p>



<p>According to the certificate, <a href="https://www.huobi.com/en-us/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.huobi.com/en-us/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Huobi</a>&#8216;s BTC asset accumulation has surged by an impressive 53.3% since June 1st. This represents an increase of approximately 8,300 BTC in just one month. The majority of this increase can be attributed to the accumulation of TRC20-BTC, a type of Bitcoin token based on the TRON network.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the transfer-in address associated with this significant increase in BTC assets is closely linked to prominent figures in the cryptocurrency industry, including Justin Sun, the founder of TRON, and Poloniex, a well-known cryptocurrency exchange.</p>



<p>The transparency provided by Huobi&#8217;s asset reserve certificate offers valuable insights into the exchange&#8217;s strategies and holdings. Such information can be crucial for investors and market participants seeking to better understand the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>By closely monitoring the movements and holdings of major players like Huobi, investors can gain a deeper understanding of market trends and potential investment opportunities. Additionally, the involvement of influential figures like Justin Sun further adds to the significance of this development.</p>

<p>Sega, a gaming studio known for popular titles such as Sonic The Hedgehog and Yakuza, was once regarded as one of the most ardent supporters of blockchain gaming. However, recent developments suggest that the company is now taking a step back from the industry due to the global crypto industry meltdown.</p>



<p>In an interview with Bloomberg News, Co-Chief Operating Officer Shuji Utsumi stated that P2E (play-to-earn) games are boring and that the firm will withhold its biggest franchises from third-party blockchain gaming projects to avoid devaluing its content. This decision marks a significant shift for Sega, which previously advocated using blockchain-based technology to boost the appeal of its titles.</p>



<p>Although Sega will be suspending its plans to develop GameFi in the short term, the company will continue to invest in related projects and allow external partners to use its lesser-known Three Kingdoms and Virtua Fighter characters for non-fungible tokens. The company&#8217;s intent to join the once-red-hot NFT community, first announced in 2021, drew widespread criticism from gamers who viewed crypto technology as bad for the environment.</p>



<p>Utsumi was also non-committal about employing Web 3.0 technology in what Sega dubs its &#8220;super game&#8221; initiative, a lineup of big-budget online multiplayer games due to roll out from 2026. Sega&#8217;s shift reflects a broader cooling on the concept of web3, a term used to describe an internet built around the blockchain, that once attracted billions of dollars from the likes of Andreessen Horowitz. Peers such as Ubisoft Entertainment SA have also pulled back on their investments in NFT games after drawing criticism amid low interest.</p>

<p>Buterin sees these developments as a refreshing departure from what he describes as the &#8220;stagnant&#8221; politics prevalent in the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p>



<p>According to Buterin, ordinals are revitalizing the culture of taking action and making things happen within the cryptocurrency space. He believes that this new trend represents a significant pushback against the laser-eye movement, which has been a prominent symbol of Bitcoin enthusiasts.</p>



<p>Buterin emphasized the need for the cryptocurrency community to focus on implementing various layer-2 solutions to enhance scalability and efficiency. He suggested that while Bitcoin&#8217;s base layer is crucial, the best approach would be to explore different methods of improving its performance. By implementing layer-2 solutions, such as payment channels or sidechains, Buterin believes that Bitcoin can become more scalable and adaptable to future needs.</p>

<p>The co-founder of Ethereum&#8217;s remarks come at a time when the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem is actively seeking innovative solutions to address the scalability challenges faced by popular blockchain networks. Layer-2 solutions have emerged as a promising avenue for enhancing transaction throughput and reducing fees on existing blockchains.</p>



<p>Buterin&#8217;s comments also highlight the ongoing debate between Bitcoin and Ethereum regarding their respective approaches to scalability and functionality. While Bitcoin has primarily focused on being a secure store of value, Ethereum has strived to provide a platform for building decentralized applications and smart contracts.

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>There is analysis that the Multichain bridge has completely lost control. This is not the same as being hacked.</em></li>



<li><em>Analysis suggests that the cause may be due to some force majeure circumstances. Complete control has been lost, rather than simply being attacked.</em></li>



<li><em>Asset transfers take a long time, and the receiving addresses are clean.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Analysis by Loki Zeng states that Multichain is not an attack by hackers when it is discovered that the characteristics of transactions are completely normal.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-500-1024x538.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-500-1024x538.png" alt="Multichain Not a Hacker Attack, The Network Is Completely Out Of Control" class="wp-image-200962" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-500-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-500-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-500-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-500-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-500-1140x599.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-500.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Multichain Not A Hacker Attack, The Network Is Completely Out Of Control 20"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>According to the analysis, the asset transfer lasted for a long time, a small amount of 2 USDC. This is a test before the assignment. It shows that the transferor has a sustainable transferability that is checked before the transfer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="zh" dir="ltr">几个特点： <br>1）资产转移持续时间很长，说明转移者并不着急<br>2）资产转移前进行了2USDC的小额测试，其中USDC还转了2币2U，说明转移者有可持续的转移能力  <br>3）每种资产转移到了独立钱包，之后没有进一步行为（如转移到交易所、swap、混币）<br>4）接收钱包是完全干净的，甚至gas都没有</p>&mdash; 0xLoki (@Loki_Zeng) <a href="https://twitter.com/Loki_Zeng/status/1677140750818238465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 7, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Each asset is moved to an independent wallet, and there are no further actions after that (such as moving to an exchange, swapping, or mixing coins). The receiving wallet is completely clean, even without gas.</p>



<p>Considering the specifications of the MPC, the transferor may have gained complete control of the private key segments that exceed the threshold in some way.</p>



<p>Besides, the &#8220;Method of Attack&#8221; is straightforward. It is a simple assignment, there is no contract, and there is a test. The attacker may not be a hacker. The assignor has not performed further processing and execution, and the operator may not have absolute discretion.</p>



<p>Currently, the assets controlled by Multichain MPC&#8217;s multi-signature are completely out of control. Correspondingly, if the owner of the retained portion of the shard holding MPC or other multisig shards exceeds the threshold, all of these assets and contracts can go unchecked.</p>



<p>As mentioned in the previous article, early this morning, the Multichain bridge once again <a href="https://coincu.com/200802-multichain-130m-assets-withdrawn-unknown-cause/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warned</a> users that $130 million in assets was moved for unknown reasons. This caused many users to criticize the project because it returned to work not long after crashing at the end of June.</p>



<p>Recently, the Fantom Foundation, which has a close relationship with each other, wanted to break free of influence, claiming that FTM was never released or managed by Multichain, so FTM over wFTM, FTM ERC-20, and Opera will not be affected.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For the avoidance of doubt,  FTM was never issued or managed by Multichain, so wFTM, FTM ERC-20, and FTM on Opera are not affected.</p>&mdash; Fantom Foundation (@FantomFDN) <a href="https://twitter.com/FantomFDN/status/1677201526643720194?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 7, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Currently, the project only advises users to stop working on the platform and revoke all contracts related to the approval chain. Besides, it does not shed light on the hack and offers a plan for reactivation.</p>



<p>This causes the MULTI token price to continue falling into the abyss with a 16% drop in the past 24h, currently trading at $2.61.</p>
