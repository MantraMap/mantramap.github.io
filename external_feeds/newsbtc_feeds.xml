					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price is correcting higher from the $27,000 support. BTC must clear $29,000 to continue higher in the near term. Bitcoin formed a base and corrected higher above the $27,500 resistance. The price is trading above $27,800 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $27,600 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it clears the $28,400 and $29,000 resistance levels. Bitcoin Price Eyes Fresh Increase Bitcoin price extended its decline below the $27,500 level. However, BTC remained well-bid above the $27,000 zone. A low was formed near $26,969 before the price started an upside correction. The price was able to climb above the $27,500 resistance. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $27,600 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. It is now trading above $27,800 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. Bitcoin price is now facing resistance near the $28,400 level. A high is formed near $28,407 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is trading well above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $26,969 low to the $28,407 high. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Immediate resistance is near the $28,400 level. The next major resistance sits near the $29,000 zone. A close above the $29,000 resistance could start a decent increase. In the stated case, the price may perhaps rise toward the $29,800 resistance zone. Any more gains could open the doors for a test of $30,000. Fresh Decline in BTC? If Bitcoin’s price fails to clear the $28,400 resistance, it could react to the downside. Immediate support on the downside is near the $28,000 level. The next major support is near the $27,800 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $26,969 low to the $28,407 high. A downside break and close below the $27,680 support might push the price toward the $27,500 support. Any more losses might take Bitcoin toward $27,000. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $28,000, followed by $27,680. Major Resistance Levels – $28,400, $29,000, and $30,000.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cardano (ADA) is a blockchain-based platform that allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Created by Charles Hoskinson, one of the co-founders of Ethereum to address some of the scalability and interoperability issues faced by existing blockchain networks. Given the asset’s potential, ADA has gained a lot of attention in the crypto community over the years. However, lately, many investors and traders have wondered about the crypto&#8217;s next move amid the uncertainty in the crypto market.  Cardano (ADA) Possible Bullish Breakout In the past week, Cardano (ADA) has seen some significant bearish price action. The asset crashed in the past 7 days with the price down by nearly 20%. This bearish trend can be attributed to several factors, including the ongoing downtrend in the market.  However, despite the bearish trend, ADA may be poised for a bullish breakout, according to the asset’s price chart. On the 1-day time frame, Cardano has just tapped into an order block indicating a likely reversal (upward movement). An order block is basically the last bullish or bearish candle before the formation of a significant move in the market. It refers to a price level where a large number of buy or sell orders are clustered, creating a significant level of support or resistance.  Large institutional traders, hedge funds, or other market participants who place big buy or sell orders at a specific price level create order blocks. An identified order block at a certain price level may be that price will bounce off that level and move in the opposite direction.  In this case, ADA could form a reversal to the upside given the asset tapping into the order block at the $0.37 region. Though it is uncertain when ADA will execute the reversal, it could happen soon given the precision in the chart. Meanwhile, at the time of writing, ADA bears seem exhausted as the asset has only been down only 0.2% in the last 24 hours. ADA currently trades at $0.38, slightly above the above-identified order block price level.  Should ADA continue an opposite direction to the upside and not invalidate the marked out order block. ADA&#8217;s price could tap into major highs such as the one at the $0.46 zone. Fundamentals That Could Contribute To ADA&#8217;s Breakout Technicalities aside, Cardano also has some fundamentals that could be a part of its possible bullish breakout. An instance is the Snowmantastic NFT project transition from the Ethereum network to the Cardano network. Snowmantastic has collaborated with over 200 projects in the industry. Its transition to Cardano could drive a huge amount of investors into this ecosystem, therefore, increasing the native’s token price in the long run.  On the Cardano network, we can already see a similar scenario where the accumulation of ADA is on the rise. According to a chart shown by the popular crypto analyst, Ali Chart, on April 1, the number of large transactions on Cardano reached 4,000.   By April 13, the transactions climbed up nearing 5,000. The analyst noted, Large ADA transactions are on the rise, suggesting that Cardano network activity is heating up as institutional players and whales make their moves. This is a bullish sign supporting the ADA uptrend! Featured image from iStock.com, Chart from TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The cryptocurrency market has experienced significant volatility in recent months, with the price of Bitcoin (BTC) dropping from its new yearly high of $31,000 to its current trading price of $27,300. This pullback has left Bitcoin at a crossroads, with traders waiting to see whether the key support level of $27,000 will hold or break. However, Bitcoin is known for its volatility, and bid liquidity movement can provide valuable insights into market activity. In Q1/2023, a block of bid liquidity was identified in what appeared to be controlled by a single entity, which was named Notorious B.I.D, according to the research and analysis firm Material Indicators.  Related Reading: Bullish Momentum Expected For ARB As Arbitrum Completes DAO Airdrop Bitcoin Rally 2.0 On The Horizon? This entity was successful in attracting more bids to fuel a Bitcoin rally, and the movement of bid liquidity became predictable over time. However, the game ended with a rug pull in the first week of March. As of this writing, according to Materials,  there are indications that a similar entity may be active in the market again, with bid liquidity movement that looks similar to what was seen in Q1. While there is no way of knowing for sure if Notorious B.I.D. is back, it appears that somebody is using a large stack to play a similar game. One of the key differences between what was seen in Q1 and what is being observed now is that the buy walls are changing size. This could be a distribution strategy, as the large buyer seeks to push the price up to a higher distribution range and ultimately use those bids as exit liquidity.  According to the fire chart of the Material Indicator, there is a substantial bid wall situated just below the $26,000 mark. This bid wall may have the potential to prevent a further decline in Bitcoin&#8217;s price shortly, but only if the $27,000 support floor is broken. Despite this, Bitcoin&#8217;s current support level has remained stable, indicating that there is a possibility of a rebound to higher levels. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that Bitcoin&#8217;s price may bounce back to higher levels. BTC’s MVRV Reaches 11-Month High According to Gaah, a researcher and analyst from the CryptoQuant Firm, the MVRV (market-value-to-realized-value) ratio is a key indicator of market sentiment and can provide valuable insights into investor behavior. The ratio is calculated by dividing the market capitalization of Bitcoin by its realized capitalization, which is the sum of the value of all Bitcoin transactions since they were last moved on-chain. When the MVRV ratio is in the green quadrant, below a value of 1.44, it is considered to be in the accumulation zone. This indicates that there is decreased selling pressure in the market, as the realized capitalization of Bitcoin exceeds its market capitalization. In other words, investors are less motivated to sell their Bitcoin, as they believe that its true value is higher than its current market price. Gaah notes that the MVRV ratio reached a high of 0.82 in December 2022, when Bitcoin was still trading at around $17,000. This is the same level that the ratio reached in 2018, just before Bitcoin experienced a significant drop in value. However, Gaah believes that the current market conditions are different and that the MVRV ratio is a reflection of the increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin.

<p><a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/6447ad48e76d1277fe452295-MVRV-reaches-an-11-month-high" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According </a>to Gaah, a researcher and analyst from the CryptoQuant Firm, the MVRV (market-value-to-realized-value) ratio is a key indicator of market sentiment and can provide valuable insights into investor behavior. The ratio is calculated by dividing the market capitalization of Bitcoin by its realized capitalization, which is the sum of the value of all Bitcoin transactions since they were last moved on-chain.</p>

<p>When the MVRV ratio is in the green quadrant, below a value of 1.44, it is considered to be in the accumulation zone. This indicates that there is decreased selling pressure in the market, as the realized capitalization of Bitcoin exceeds its market capitalization. In other words, investors are less motivated to sell their Bitcoin, as they believe that its true value is higher than its current market price.</p>
<p>Gaah notes that the MVRV ratio reached a high of 0.82 in December 2022, when Bitcoin was still trading at around $17,000. This is the same level that the ratio reached in 2018, just before Bitcoin experienced a significant drop in value. However, Gaah believes that the current market conditions are different and that the MVRV ratio is a reflection of the increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum&#8217;s (ETH) staking ecosystem has made headlines in the blockchain space since the recent Shanghai upgrade. As the crypto market continues to grow, Ethereum has emerged as a market leader in staking, offering some of the best yields and attracting more investors. But what exactly makes Ethereum&#8217;s staking so attractive? Related Reading: Bullish Momentum Expected For ARB As Arbitrum Completes DAO Airdrop Ethereum Staking Goes Big According to DeFi Ignas, a leading expert in decentralized finance (DeFi), Ethereum&#8217;s ETH has the best token economics in crypto. One of the main reasons for this is Ethereum&#8217;s decision to move away from the Proof of Work (PoW) to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.  He suggests that If Ethereum had remained on PoW, $4.7 billion worth of ETH would have been issued, more than the entire market cap of UNI, Uniswap’s native token, at $4 billion. This move has made Ethereum supply deflationary, creating a more valuable asset for investors. However, as DeFi Ignas points out, Ethereum&#8217;s staking ratio currently stands at just 14.8%, the lowest among major blockchains. This is despite offering a competitive ~4.5% APR. One reason for this low staking ratio is that other blockchains have a more concentrated token distribution, with insiders, team members, and early investors actively staking for rewards.  According to DeFi Ignas, recent data suggests that the staking landscape is shifting, with some major players losing market share and a significant amount of ETH being withdrawn from staking platforms. In particular, Kraken, Coinbase, and Huobi have all seen a decline in their market share in the past month. Furthermore, 36% of all ETH staking withdrawals originate from Kraken. It&#8217;s worth noting that when there are more withdrawals than deposits, it typically indicates a bearish sentiment among investors, as they sell their holdings in larger quantities than they are buying. This is further supported by the fact that around 40% of all ETH stakers have a negative ETH PnL, meaning they are holding ETH at a loss. However, there is a silver lining to this data. According to DeFi Ignas, 29% of all ETH stakers have staked their ETH at the current price, which suggests that there are still many investors who believe in the long-term potential of ETH and are willing to hold onto their investments despite short-term market fluctuations, which for him, this is a bullish sign for the future of Ethereum staking. ETH Staking, The Best Risk/Reward Option For Financial Freedom? According to DeFi Ignas,  Ethereum staking is poised to overtake decentralized exchanges (DEXes) by total value locked (TVL), with just 15% of all ETH currently staked across 83 protocols. Also, despite being a relatively new industry, the Liquidity Staking Derivative (LSD) ecosystem has already surpassed lending, bridging, and CDP stablecoins in terms of TVL, and it&#8217;s expected to continue growing in the future.  Additionally, Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), which enables &#8220;squad staking&#8221; by allowing groups to stake different amounts of ETH collectively, is another trend gaining traction in the Ethereum staking ecosystem. On the same note, the prominent crypto analyst McKenna has stated in a recent Twitter post that Ethereum&#8217;s staking rate has increased from 14.15% to 14.93% post-Shanghai, and this trend is expected to continue. McKenna predicts that ETH staking will become a major sink, with a staking rate close to 20% by the end of the year. The increase in staking is also a bullish sign for the future of Ethereum, as it demonstrates the community&#8217;s commitment to the network and its success. As more funds are locked in staking, the circulating supply of ETH decreases, creating a scarcity that could potentially drive up the asset&#8217;s price.

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin market may be close to a decision point as on-chain data shows the Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR) is retesting the 1.0 level. Bitcoin aSOPR Has Declined Towards A Value Of 1.0 Recently According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the BTC market had shifted towards a profit-dominated regime back in January. The &#8220;aSOPR&#8221; is an indicator that tells us whether the average investor is selling their Bitcoin at a profit or at a loss currently. The &#8220;adjusted&#8221; in aSOPR comes from the fact that this metric has been adjusted for filtering out transactions/sales of all coins that were done within only one hour of the previous transaction/purchase. The benefit of making this restriction is that it removes all noise from the data that wouldn&#8217;t have had any noticeable implications for the market. When the value of this indicator is greater than 1.0, it means the total amount of profits being harvested by the investors is more than the losses right now. On the other hand, values of the metric below the threshold suggest the market as a whole is realizing some losses at the moment. The 1.0 level itself naturally serves as the break-even mark, where the total amount of profits becomes equal to the losses. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin aSOPR over the last few months: The value of the metric seems to have been above the 1.0 mark in recent days &#124; Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 17, 2023 Historically, the aSOPR 1.0 level has been quite important for Bitcoin, as it has represented the mark where the transition between bullish and bearish trends has taken place. During bear markets, the indicator generally stays under this level, as investors naturally realize large losses. The mark acts as resistance in such market conditions, meaning that any attempts to break above it usually end up in failure. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘ESR’ Continues To Show Bullish Divergence, Will Price Follow? On the contrary, the 1.0 level acts as a support for the price during bullish periods, making sure that the indicator stays in the profits zone. Both these patterns can also be seen in action in the above graph, as the 2022 bear market saw the metric being stuck in the zone below 1.0, while the rally that started in January has observed it is in the green area. There was an exception last month, however, when the Bitcoin aSOPR sharply plunged below the 1.0 mark due to a sharp plunge in the price. It wasn&#8217;t long, though, before the metric (and also the price) returned back toward the bullish trend, implying that it was only a temporary anomaly. Recently, as the asset&#8217;s price has once again been going down, the indicator has also declined toward the 1.0 level. &#8220;With aSOPR currently retesting the break-even level of 1.0, this puts the market close to a decision point,&#8221; explains Glassnode. Related Reading: What’s Behind The Recent Bitcoin Drop? Here’s What On-Chain Data Says It now remains to be seen whether the retest will be successful, and this level will act as support for the price, or if a break below will take place, possibly bringing with it more decline for the cryptocurrency. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $27,300, down 10% in the last week.

Both these patterns can also be seen in action in the above graph, as the 2022 bear market saw the metric being stuck in the zone below 1.0, while the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/report-claims-bitcoin-price-rally-will-continue-whats-next/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rally</a> that started in January has observed it is in the green area.</p>
<p>There was an exception last month, however, when the Bitcoin aSOPR sharply plunged below the 1.0 mark due to a sharp plunge in the price. It wasn&#8217;t long, though, before the metric (and also the price) returned back toward the bullish trend, implying that it was only a temporary anomaly.</p>
<p>Recently, as the asset&#8217;s price has once again been going down, the indicator has also declined toward the 1.0 level. &#8220;With aSOPR currently retesting the break-even level of 1.0, this puts the market close to a decision point,&#8221; explains Glassnode.</p>

<p>It now remains to be seen whether the retest will be successful, and this level will act as support for the price, or if a break below will take place, possibly bringing with it more decline for the cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $27,300, down 10% in the last week.</p>

The firm behind the XRP coin has moved millions of tokens within the past few days. XRP whales are also following the trend, moving millions of tokens as well.

The firm moved the coins to another wallet address suspected to belong to it on April 24.  Later, the recipient&#8217;s wallet transferred some funds, which included its previous balance. It moved 70 million XRP worth $32 million to an affiliate wallet of Ripple through multiple transactions. It then sent the funds to Independent Reserve, Bitso, and Bitstamp crypto exchanges.

					<description><![CDATA[The Arbitrum Foundation has just concluded its distribution of the ARB airdrop to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and it has triggered some positive expectations among the community. DAOs Receive 90 Million ARB Following the 1 billion ARB distribution that went to the community, the Arbitrum Foundation has executed the second stage of its airdrop. On Monday, the foundation announced that it was commencing the airdrop distribution to DAOs. Related Reading: Bitcoin At $25,000 Or $30,000? Crypto Analyst Weighs In In total, over 90 million ARB were distributed to 125 DAOs with Treasure DAO receiving the highest allocation of the bunch. These tokens were sent out at a time when the price of the digital asset was trading around $1.32-$1.33, putting the fair value of the airdrops around $120 million. The Twitter thread below lists the 125 DAOs and how many tokens they received. The list of @arbitrum&#39;s DAOs Airdrop!!! 👀 1.@Treasure_DAO &#8211; 8,000,000 $ARB2.@GMX_IO &#8211; 8,000,000 $ARB3.@Uniswap &#8211; 4,378,188 $ARB4.@SushiSwap &#8211; 4,249,418 $ARB5.@dopex_io &#8211; 3,863,107 $ARB6.@CurveFinance &#8211; 3,476,796 $ARB7.@RDNTCapital &#8211; 3,348,026 $ARB 🧵 1/18 pic.twitter.com/dE5eDORWPL &#8212; ANDAO (💙,🧡) 🦇🔊 (@ArbitrumNewsDAO) March 21, 2023 Following the airdrop, the price of ARB saw a slight uptick but this did not last long as the coin quickly resumed its downward trend. Its price briefly touched $1.35 in the early hours of Tuesday. However, as of the time of writing, it is back down to $1.31. Arbitrum Still Has A Long Way To Go The ARB airdrop to DAOs has so far not had the effect on the price of the digital asset as expected, but that has not eliminated the bullish expectations for the cryptocurrency. Analyst Jack Niewold took to Twitter to share that he expects ARB to flip the likes of XRP. However, ARB is still trading sideways but this can also be attributed to the general market downtrend which has seen the majority of the market lose their gains from last week. If this slow momentum continues, then it is unlikely that ARB will meet the expectations for its price.

It is currently the third-highest behind Ethereum and BSC in terms of volume, DefiLlama data shows. Additionally, where Ethereum’s volumes have dropped over the last week by 2.53%, Arbitrum is up 11.74%. Related Reading: Losses Dominate Crypto Over The Weekend, Has The Bear Market Returned? ARB’s trading volume has unfortunately seen a decline over the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency saw trading volumes of $558.8 million, a 27.64% decline from the previous day’s numbers. This shows a decline in interest for investors and has contributed to the downward trend that the token has experienced. ARB’s price also fell below $1.3 briefly on Tuesday before recovering to $1.31. At this current price, the coin is seeing meager gains of 0.46% on the 24-hour chart but is down a significant 25% on the 7-day chart.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">The Arbitrum Foundation has just concluded its distribution of the ARB airdrop to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and it has triggered some positive expectations among the community.</p>
<h2 class="p2">DAOs Receive 90 Million ARB</h2>
<p class="p2">Following the 1 billion ARB distribution that went to the community, the Arbitrum Foundation has executed the second stage of its airdrop. On Monday, the foundation announced that it was commencing the airdrop distribution to DAOs.</p>

<p class="p2">In total, over 90 million ARB were distributed to 125 DAOs with Treasure DAO receiving the highest allocation of the bunch. These tokens were sent out at a time when the price of the digital asset was trading around $1.32-$1.33, putting the fair value of the airdrops around $120 million. The Twitter thread below lists the 125 DAOs and how many tokens they received.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="p2">Following the airdrop, the price of ARB saw a slight uptick but this did not last long as the coin quickly resumed its downward trend. Its price briefly touched $1.35 in the early hours of Tuesday. However, as of the time of writing, it is back down to $1.31.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Arbitrum Still Has A Long Way To Go</h2>
<p class="p2">The ARB airdrop to DAOs has so far not had the effect on the price of the digital asset as expected, but that has not eliminated the bullish expectations for the cryptocurrency. Analyst Jack Niewold took to <a href="https://twitter.com/JackNiewold/status/1650568650238091310?s=20" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a> to share that he expects ARB to flip the likes of XRP.</p>
<p class="p2">However, ARB is still trading sideways but this can also be attributed to the general market downtrend which has seen the majority of the market lose their gains from last week. If this slow momentum continues, then it is unlikely that ARB will meet the expectations for its price.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Shytoshi Kusama, the pseudonymous lead developer of Shiba Inu, has shared an exciting message with the SHIB community in the official Shibarium Telegram group today. It comes at a time when the SHIB price is facing a make-or-break moment, as NewsBTC reported yesterday. Exciting Updates For The Shiba Inu Community? The lead developer was responding to a user of the group who pointed out that the last Medium update on the ongoing development of the layer 2 network was made a while ago. Kusama responded that the project is progressing rapidly and that members of the Shiba Inu community already have plenty of updates: I think the army has plenty of updates as the chain activity and all the tokens are very public. We&#8217;re in go mode, not bro mode. What exactly Kusama means by this can only be speculated. In the last medium update on Shibarium, he announced that the layer-2 technology will be released on the mainnet before the end of 2023. However, an exact date is not yet known. The latest comment by Kusama suggests that significant progress is currently being made towards the mainnet launch.

Bone Shibaswap (BONE), the governance token of the Shibaswap ecosystem, recently received a listing from the major crypto exchange OKX. In addition, Kusama recently announced the forthcoming release of ShibaSwap 2.0 in a Telegram message. Remarkably, it is not uncommon for Kusama to use metaphors to announce progress in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Even before the launch of the beta version of Shibarium, the developer posted numerous encrypted messages. Just yesterday, Kusama stated that he was working with Shiba Inu team members to achieve &#8220;the impossible.&#8221; Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whales On Buying Spree, Add 311 Billion Tokens During Price Dip SHIB Price Still Faces Make-Or-Break Moment The deep correction in the crypto market has caused the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price to break down an ascending triangle pattern that has been developing since early March. Now SHIB is trading near the crucial support level at $0.00001005. If SHIB breaks this level to the downside as well, the uptrend that started earlier this year would be in jeopardy. SHIB needs to stay in the trading range between $0.00001005 and $0.00001151 to avoid a break of the trend in the higher time frame. If the bulls fail to defend the trading range, a decline to $0.00000965 would be the most likely scenario before SHIB could possibly fall back to the $0.00000855 price level. Currently, a symmetrical triangle pattern has formed in the 2-hour chart. An upward breakout towards the middle part of the aforementioned trading range is key (near $0.00001096). Otherwise, a break to the lower levels could be next. Featured image from Rayne L. / Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>
