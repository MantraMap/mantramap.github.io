<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>SEC Chair</em> Gary Gensler<em> comments on the recent court ruling in the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against Ripple, expressing both satisfaction and disappointment with the outcome.</em></li>



<li><em>The court ruling determined that institutional sales of Ripple&#8217;s tokens violated federal securities laws, while sales on exchanges and programmatic sales were not considered securities.</em></li>



<li><em>The ruling&#8217;s implications for retail investors and the potential for an appeal raise uncertainty about the future regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has publicly addressed the recent court ruling in the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against Ripple, stated that while he was disappointed with a district court&#8217;s decision in the Ripple case regarding retail investors, he was pleased with the portion of the order that found institutional sales of the tokens did violate federal securities laws.</strong></h5>

<p>Last week, Ripple <a href="https://coincu.com/202599-ripple-wins-against-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achieved</a> a partial victory as the court ruled that institutional sales of the XRP tokens violated federal securities laws, while sales on exchanges and programmatic sales did not qualify as the sale of securities. The ruling was based on the SEC&#8217;s inability to establish that speculative investors had a reasonable expectation of profits from the efforts of others.</p>



<p>During a talk on artificial intelligence at the National Press Club, Gensler was asked about the ruling&#8217;s impact on his stance on cryptocurrency and whether it necessitates federal legislation for regulatory oversight. He expressed satisfaction with the court&#8217;s decision to recognize the importance of investor protection for institutional investors. However, he voiced disappointment regarding the ruling&#8217;s implications for retail investors and stated that the SEC is still assessing the opinion.</p>



<p>Gensler reiterated similar sentiments in an interview with <em><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/sec-chair-warns-ais-potential-201110024.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yahoo Finance</a></em> later in the day. He acknowledged the court&#8217;s recognition of XRP as a security for institutional investors and its consideration of fair notice. He mentioned that the SEC is continuing to evaluate the ruling and its implications.</p>



<p>The SEC chair declined to provide further details on the SEC&#8217;s requirements for being confident about spot <a href="https://coincu.com/202973-sec-now-acknowledges-blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin exchange-traded funds</a> (ETFs), citing ongoing litigation and the need to avoid prejudging the applications before the regulatory body.</p>

<p>When questioned about the SEC&#8217;s regulatory approach, Gensler highlighted that the SEC has engaged in rulemaking, including notice and comment rulemaking and special purpose broker-dealer licensing. He also acknowledged the existence of the European Union&#8217;s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework, which emphasizes rulemaking.</p>



<p>This public response from Gensler marks the first time he has addressed the Ripple case since the court ruling. His expressed disappointment with the verdict&#8217;s impact on retail investors coincided with a drop in the price of Ripple&#8217;s XRP, following a brief nearly 100% rally in response to the mixed verdict.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The ruling&#8217;s nuanced differentiation between private sales to accredited investors and programmatic sales to exchanges has raised concerns among experts, including former SEC official <a href="https://coincu.com/203157-xrp-security-or-not-former-sec-official-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Reed Stark</a>. Stark believes the ruling is on &#8220;shaky ground&#8221; and anticipates an appeal. He criticized the ruling&#8217;s potential creation of a new category of &#8220;quasi-securities&#8221; dependent on investor sophistication, deeming it counter-intuitive and inconsistent with SEC case law.</p>



<p>The possibility of an appeal introduces uncertainty regarding the final outcome of the case and the future regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Customers Bank emerges as a top banking partner for the US crypto industry after the closure of Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank.</em></li>



<li><em>The bank offers the Customers Bank Instant Token (CBIT) platform for 24/7 payments, attracting clients from both crypto and other industries.</em></li>



<li><em>Customers Bank also downplays its crypto connections but continues to serve major crypto players while focusing on risk management and expanding its payments business.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Customers Bank, a small Pennsylvania-based bank, has become a preferred banking partner for the US crypto industry, attracting a wave of new clients after the collapse of crypto-friendly banks Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1153.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="978" height="733" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1153.png" alt="Customers Bank Now Emerges As Favorite Banking Partner For US Crypto Industry" class="wp-image-203489" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1153.png 978w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1153-300x225.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1153-768x576.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1153-750x562.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 978px) 100vw, 978px" title="Customers Bank Now Emerges As Favorite Banking Partner For US Crypto Industry 4"></a></figure></div>


<p>With its platform Customers Bank Instant Token (CBIT), the bank offers 24/7 payments for its crypto clients, similar to Silvergate Capital&#8217;s now-closed Silvergate Exchange Network. The closures of Silvergate and Signature Bank left little competition for Customers Bank, positioning it as a leading player in the market.</p>



<p>According to a <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-17/after-ftx-and-silvergate-customers-bank-cubi-becomes-crypto-s-favorite-bank#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em> report, Customers Bank has partnered with hundreds of digital asset firms, including major exchanges, market makers, and stablecoin issuers. It managed to attract new clients from the crypto sector as well as technology, venture capital, and fund finance sectors after the collapse of Silvergate and Signature Bank. The bank&#8217;s staff worked tirelessly to onboard these new clients, positioning the bank as a reliable and trusted banking partner.</p>



<p>However, the bank is now downplaying its connections to the crypto industry. The bank has decided to limit crypto-related deposits on its Customers Bank Instant Token platform to no more than 15% of its total balance sheet. Deposits on the platform accounted for around 13% of the bank&#8217;s total deposits at the end of Q1 2023. Customers Bank&#8217;s CEO, Sam Sidhu, has emphasized that the bank&#8217;s focus is on strengthening and deepening customer relationships across multiple industries, rather than relying solely on crypto-related deposits.</p>

<p>The US regulatory environment surrounding the crypto industry has become more stringent, with increased scrutiny from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and warnings from bank industry regulators about the risks of doing business with the crypto sector. As a result, Customers Bank is cautious about openly promoting its crypto business and is focused on managing risk and ensuring regulatory compliance.</p>



<p>Customers Bank continues to do business with major players in the crypto industry, including Circle Internet Financial, <a href="https://coincu.com/203024-us-sec-coinbase-listing-approval/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase Global</a>, <a href="https://coincu.com/180802-rumor-paxos-set-to-exit-canadian-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paxos Trust</a>, GSR, <a href="https://coincu.com/200316-crypto-bank-anchorage-digital-sees-80-jump/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anchorage Digital</a>, and <a href="https://coincu.com/197226-bitgo-wont-buy-back-prime-trust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BitGo</a>. However, the bank is exploring a broader plan to expand its payments business and build stronger customer relationships beyond the crypto sector.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154-1024x683.png" alt="Customers Bank Now Emerges As Favorite Banking Partner For US Crypto Industry" class="wp-image-203491" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1154.png 1260w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Customers Bank Now Emerges As Favorite Banking Partner For US Crypto Industry 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>While the bank&#8217;s role as a banking partner for the crypto industry brings attention from regulators, the bank believes it has measures in place to manage risk effectively. It holds CBIT deposits in US currency and spreads large deposits among multiple banks to ensure FDIC coverage for its depositors.</p>



<p>The emergence of Customers Bank as a leading banking partner highlights the challenges faced by the crypto industry in accessing reliable banking services. The industry is still seeking more alternatives and broader support from traditional fiat banks to address its banking needs.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>UK&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is introducing new social media guidance to combat illegal and non-compliant financial promotions.</em></li>



<li><em>The FCA aims to modernize regulations and address the use of social media in promoting financial products and services.</em></li>



<li><em>The FCA will also collaborate with the Advertising Standards Authority to increase scrutiny over illegal promotions, including those related to cryptocurrencies, and educate consumers about the risks involved.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/social-media-guidance-set-revamp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its intention to enhance regulations surrounding financial promotions on social media platforms.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="587" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-1024x587.jpg" alt="UK Financial Conduct Authority Plans To Strengthen Regulations On Crypto Promotions" class="wp-image-203481" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-1024x587.jpg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-300x172.jpg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-768x440.jpg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-1536x881.jpg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-2048x1174.jpg 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-750x430.jpg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fca-scaled-1-1140x654.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="UK Financial Conduct Authority Plans To Strengthen Regulations On Crypto Promotions 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>The proposed guidance aims to modernize the information provided by firms when advertising financial products or services online, taking into account the evolving landscape of social media advertising in the financial industry.</p>



<p>One of the key objectives of the new guidance is to support the FCA&#8217;s Consumer Investments Strategy, which aims to reduce the number of retail consumers investing in high-risk investments without appropriate risk tolerance or vulnerability characteristics by 2025.</p>



<p>In addition to addressing illegal and non-compliant financial promotions, the FCA will also focus on curbing promotions by financial influencers that may harm consumers. This includes a particular emphasis on influencers promoting cryptocurrency assets on social media platforms.</p>



<p>To tackle these issues, the <a href="https://coincu.com/196130-binance-unregister-in-uk-fca-before-war-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FCA</a> plans to collaborate with the Advertising Standards Authority to increase oversight and scrutiny of illegal financial promotions and advertising practices. The regulators also aim to educate both consumers and influencers about the risks associated with promoting financial products.</p>

<p>Starting from October 8, the FCA will implement several measures, including banning incentives for investing in cryptocurrencies such as &#8220;refer a friend&#8221; bonuses. Firms will be required to provide clear risk warnings and introduce a mandatory 24-hour cooling-off period to allow first-time investors sufficient time to make informed investment decisions.</p>



<p>The FCA&#8217;s efforts to regulate online financial promotions have gained momentum due to the rising influence of &#8220;finfluencers&#8221; and the potential risks associated with online consumer harm. The partnership with the Advertising Standards Authority has already resulted in changes to advertising policies of major technology companies, ensuring that only FCA-approved financial promotions are permitted. The FCA plans to continue engaging with industry stakeholders to strengthen consumer protection measures.</p>

<p>The consultation on the new social media guidance will be conducted over the next eight weeks. This initiative aligns with the FCA&#8217;s commitment to reducing harm and establishing higher standards within the financial industry.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, the FCA <a href="https://coincu.com/167266-uk-fca-issues-warning-letters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> warning letters to against crypto atm operators. The banking watchdog and West Yorkshire Police have teamed together to take on operators of cryptocurrency ATMs in Leeds, in northern England.</p>



<p>The agency also <a href="https://coincu.com/200049-fca-announces-strict-measures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alerted</a> crypto companies about upcoming financial marketing guidelines for UK clients. It said that crypto enterprises in the nation would have four legitimate avenues to comply with its guidelines for digital asset marketing, which will go into effect on October 8, 2023.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Chainlink&#8217;s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) goes live on multiple blockchains.</em></li>



<li><em>CCIP enables decentralized finance protocols and SWIFT connectivity for international transfers.</em></li>



<li><em>The protocol also offers simplified token transfers and an ARM Network for added security.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Chainlink&#8217;s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is now live for early-access users on multiple blockchains, including Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1147.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="577" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1147-1024x577.png" alt="Chainlink&#039;s New Protocol Is Now Live For Seamless Blockchain Interaction" class="wp-image-203475" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1147-1024x577.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1147-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1147-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1147-1536x865.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1147-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1147-1140x642.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1147.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Chainlink&#039;s New Protocol Is Now Live For Seamless Blockchain Interaction 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>The protocol, <a href="https://blog.chain.link/ccip-mainnet-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">designed</a> to facilitate cross-chain applications and services, has been tested by partners such as Aave and Synthetix and is now transitioning to mainnet general availability.</p>



<p>On July 20, all developers will be able to access CCIP through five testnets: Arbitrum Goerli, Avalanche Fuji, Ethereum Sepolia, Optimism Goerli, and Polygon Bombay.</p>



<p>CCIP allows for seamless interoperability between different blockchains, enabling decentralized finance protocols and other applications to adopt cross-chain functionality. It has been a key element in Chainlink&#8217;s partnership with SWIFT, the global banking network used for international money transfers, which plans to connect with various blockchains using CCIP.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148-1024x538.png" alt="Chainlink&#039;s New Protocol Is Now Live For Seamless Blockchain Interaction" class="wp-image-203476" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148-1140x599.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1148.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Chainlink&#039;s New Protocol Is Now Live For Seamless Blockchain Interaction 11"></a></figure></div>


<p>The protocol offers simplified and programmable token transfers, making it easier for tokens to be securely transferred and managed across different chains. Simplified Token Transfers provide a plug-and-play solution with audited token pool contracts, handling tasks such as burning, minting, locking, and unlocking tokens across chains while ensuring token sponsors retain control over their Token Pool contract. This enhances the security and composability of native tokens within protocols.</p>



<p>Programmable Token Transfers enable additional instructions to be included with token transfers, allowing for actions such as swapping or staking assets upon arrival at the destination chain. This ensures that tokens can be utilized immediately according to predefined instructions, enhancing the efficiency and functionality of cross-chain transactions.</p>



<p>To ensure the integrity and security of cross-chain operations, Chainlink has implemented an Active Risk Management (ARM) Network. The ARM Network acts as an independent layer that continuously monitors and validates the behavior of the primary CCIP network. It utilizes a separate implementation of the Chainlink node software in Rust, providing client diversity and minimizing external dependencies to prevent supply chain attacks.</p>



<p>Chainlink&#8217;s CCIP aims to solve the challenge of interoperability in the blockchain ecosystem, allowing applications and protocols to seamlessly interact across different chains. By providing simplified and programmable token transfers, along with an independent security layer through the ARM Network, CCIP offers a robust and secure cross-chain solution for the decentralized finance space and beyond.</p>

<p>As CCIP moves towards wider adoption, Chainlink is actively working on payment models to support the monetization and long-term sustainability of its services. These models aim to reduce payment friction for users and provide a greater amount of fees to support Chainlink&#8217;s service providers. Additionally, as Chainlink Staking expands, a portion of user fees for services like CCIP will be directed to stakers, enhancing the crypto-economic security of the network.</p>



<p>With the launch of CCIP on multiple blockchains and the growing adoption by leading protocols, Chainlink is further solidifying its position as a key player in the blockchain interoperability space. The protocol&#8217;s ability to facilitate cross-chain applications and services opens up new possibilities for decentralized finance and other blockchain-based ecosystems, fostering innovation and collaboration across different networks.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://coincu.com/198659-chainlink-data-feeds-go-live-on-celo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, Chainlink data streams are now available on the Celo mainnet, allowing developers to construct powerful DeFi apps by providing access to crucial data and services. This advancement is likely to significantly alter the DeFi ecosystem by providing additional chances for developers to implement creative solutions. Additionally, integrating Chainlink data feeds into Celo&#8217;s blockchain would improve platform security by guaranteeing that data is securely delivered straight to the blockchain.</p>

<p>In May, Pika Protocol&#8217;s Discord server fell victim to a compromise orchestrated by scammers. By posting a malicious link in the server&#8217;s announcements channel, they managed to steal over $220,000. A similar pattern emerged with Orbiter Finance, where scammers used a phishing attack to access a team member&#8217;s Discord token and subsequently siphoned off more than $760,000.</p>

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/196353-jeffrey-huang-refuted-zachxbts-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZachXBT</a> further alleges that Soup, who inadvertently revealed his wallet address (0x21bc8046245880e9d3ec5ed808048a93518e933a), profited significantly from these illicit activities. Soup reportedly confessed to having made around $1 million, while his partners profited even more. Despite the financial harm inflicted on projects and individuals, Soup appears to show little remorse.</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1678384917657296898" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous investigations</a> into crypto-related crimes, including allegations against YouTuber Blue, ZachXBT has established a reputation as a crypto crime fighter. After being sued by Jeffrey Huang, also known as <a href="https://coincu.com/196939-machi-big-brother-stated-zachxbt-framed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Machi Big Brother</a>, for making allegations about &#8220;pump and dump&#8221; schemes, ZachXBT <a href="https://coincu.com/196101-the-war-between-jeffrey-huang-zachxbt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> substantial donations for legal defense.</p>



<p>ZachXBT has shared additional information about Soup with the victims in the hope that legal action can be taken against the scammer. The exposed activities shed light on the ongoing challenges posed by phishing scams within the crypto community and the importance of remaining vigilant against such threats.</p>

<p>US Senator Elizabeth Warren has sent a letter to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to request an investigation into Elon Musk&#8217;s Tesla&#8217;s connection to Twitter. The letter raises concerns over potential conflicts of interest, misappropriation of corporate assets, and negative impacts to Tesla shareholders. Warren specifically calls for a probe into Tesla&#8217;s board of directors regarding the lack of independence from Musk and possible violations of securities laws and exchange rules.</p>



<p>The nine-page letter was sent on Monday to SEC chair Gary Gensler. Warren&#8217;s concerns echo similar ones she expressed to Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm in 2022. She notes that the inaction and incomplete disclosures raise questions about possible violations of securities laws and exchange rules, which fall under the SEC&#8217;s jurisdiction.</p>



<p>Warren expressed concern about Tesla&#8217;s use of employees from Tesla and SpaceX to aid the social media platform, stating that it could represent possible violations of state and federal labor laws. She also stated that Tesla had failed to properly inform shareholders of how the two companies would work in connection.</p>



<p>Although a new Twitter CEO has been appointed, Warren believes that Musk still maintains control as the CTO and executive chairman of Tesla. Thus, maintaining the conflict of interest.</p>

<p>While the cryptocurrency community was taken aback by the revelation, some skeptics argue that the claim comes as no surprise given Sun&#8217;s reputation in the industry.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Archblock Founder Claims Justin Sun Was Secret TUSD Acquirer in Lawsuit (Not exactly a shocker) <a href="https://t.co/ybTPmSOmtk" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/ybTPmSOmtk</a></p>&mdash; db (@tier10k) <a href="https://twitter.com/tier10k/status/1680959101814161409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 17, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>According to the lawsuit, the founder of <a href="https://www.archblock.com/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.archblock.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Archblock</a>, whose identity remains undisclosed, asserts that Sun acquired TUSD, a popular stablecoin, through covert means. The lawsuit alleges that Sun utilized various entities and individuals to carry out the acquisition, deliberately concealing his involvement. If proven true, such actions would raise serious concerns about Sun&#8217;s transparency and integrity within the cryptocurrency space.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1139.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="482" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1139-1024x482.png" alt="image 1139" class="wp-image-203452" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1139-1024x482.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1139-300x141.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1139-768x361.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1139-750x353.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1139.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Archblock Founder Claims Justin Sun Was Secret TUSD Acquirer In Lawsuit 18"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The lawsuit further accuses Sun of manipulating the cryptocurrency market through his undisclosed acquisition of TUSD. By secretly amassing a significant amount of the stablecoin, Sun would have had the power to influence its value and potentially manipulate other related markets. This revelation, if substantiated, could have far-reaching implications for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>



<p>Although these allegations are yet to be proven in a court of law, they have sparked intense discussions within the crypto community. Many individuals argue that Sun&#8217;s past controversies, including the canceled lunch with Warren Buffett and allegations of plagiarism, have already cast doubt on his credibility. As such, the claims made in the lawsuit do not come as a complete shock to those who have been following his career closely.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1140.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="385" height="1024" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1140-385x1024.png" alt="image 1140" class="wp-image-203453" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1140-385x1024.png 385w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1140-113x300.png 113w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1140.png 546w" sizes="(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px" title="Archblock Founder Claims Justin Sun Was Secret TUSD Acquirer In Lawsuit 19"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>However, it is important to note that Justin Sun and his legal team have not yet responded to the allegations. Until the evidence is presented and thoroughly examined, it is crucial to approach the situation with caution and maintain a neutral standpoint.</p>



<p>This lawsuit serves as a reminder of the need for transparency and accountability within the cryptocurrency industry. As the market continues to mature, investors and users alike expect leaders and influencers to uphold the highest ethical standards. Should the allegations against Justin Sun be proven true, it would undoubtedly have a significant impact on his reputation and potentially reshape the way he is perceived within the crypto community.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Uniswap recently announced the launch of a new blockchain protocol called &#8220;UniswapX&#8221;. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1024x576.png" alt="UniswapX" class="wp-image-203444" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="UniswapX Launches: Empowering Traders with Next-Level Cross-AMM Capabilities 21"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This new protocol has been designed to allow trading across automated market makers (AMMs) and other liquidity sources. The details of this project were released through a press release, while Uniswap Labs CEO, Hayden Adams, was scheduled to make an announcement about it on Monday at the EthCC conference in Paris.</p>



<p>According to DefiLlama, Uniswap currently has around $3.8 billion of collateral or &#8220;total value locked&#8221;. Uniswap has stated that<a href="https://uniswap.org/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://uniswap.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener"> UniswapX</a> addresses many of the problems that are faced by on-chain trading and self-custody swapping. The features of UniswapX include &#8220;better prices&#8221; through the aggregation of liquidity sources. The press release also claims that UniswapX offers gas-free swapping, protection against maximal extractive value (MEV), and no cost for failed transactions.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="800" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1.jpeg" alt="UniswapX 1" class="wp-image-203445" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1.jpeg 800w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1-75x75.jpeg 75w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1-350x350.jpeg 350w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-1-750x750.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="UniswapX Launches: Empowering Traders with Next-Level Cross-AMM Capabilities 22"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Uniswap has announced that in the coming months, UniswapX will expand to gas-free cross-chain swaps. UniswapX will initially be launched in &#8220;opt-in beta&#8221; on the Uniswap Labs interface for the main Ethereum network, with plans to expand to other chains and the Uniswap wallet &#8220;in the near future&#8221;. However, the company has not yet announced when a final version of UniswapX will be available.</p>



<p>Liquidity pools are a lifeline for swappers looking to execute trades on DEXs, but these pools can sometimes dry up. UniswapX aims to solve this problem by engaging with third-party fillers that can fill swaps directly or route users to appropriate AMM pools. These third-party fillers will have to compete with Uniswap itself, which will help to drive down prices for traders.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-2.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-2.png" alt="UniswapX 2" class="wp-image-203446" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-2.png 800w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-2-300x225.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-2-768x576.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UniswapX-2-750x563.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="UniswapX Launches: Empowering Traders with Next-Level Cross-AMM Capabilities 23"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Fillers will cover the gas fees on behalf of swappers, which removes the need for swappers to own a blockchain&#8217;s native network token, such as ETH or MATIC, to participate in trading. This also removes any financial responsibility for unsuccessful transactions. According to Uniswap, fillers incorporate gas fees into overall swap prices. They also have the option to reduce transaction costs by aggregating multiple orders, thereby fostering a competitive environment for achieving the most favorable price.</p>



<p>Uniswap has promised that UniswapX will help to thwart MEV – a scheme that is usually loathed by swappers. This is done by allowing network operators to capitalize on their ability to preview queued transactions.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Digital asset investment products attracted significant inflows of $742 million over the past four weeks.</em></li>



<li><em>Bitcoin dominated the inflows, representing 99% of the total with $140 million, while short bitcoin products experienced ongoing outflows.</em></li>



<li><em>Ethereum faced outflows despite price appreciation, while minor inflows were observed for altcoins like Solana, Polygon, and Litecoin.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a recent report by <em><a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-140-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-9f970fceec21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinShare</a></em>, digital asset investment products experienced significant inflows in the past week, reaching a total of $137 million, with Bitcoin accounting for a large proportion.</strong></h5>

<p>This marks a continuation of a strong trend, with the last four weeks seeing a cumulative inflow of $742 million, the highest since the final quarter of 2021. Bitcoin remains the dominant asset, attracting the majority of inflows, while Ethereum faced outflows despite its recent price appreciation. Let&#8217;s delve into the details of the latest investment trends.</p>



<p>The majority of inflows were concentrated in North America, with the United States and Canada accounting for $109 million and $28 million, respectively. Europe, on the other hand, experienced minor outflows, with only Switzerland witnessing minor inflows.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/202133-bitcoin-futures-traders-losing-interest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> continued to be the preferred choice for investors, capturing 99% of all inflows with a total of $140 million. However, short Bitcoin investment products faced their 12th consecutive week of outflows, totaling $3.2 million. As a result, assets under management for short bitcoin products declined from their peak of $198 million in April to a mere $55 million.</p>



<p>Despite the recent price appreciation of <a href="https://coincu.com/202925-ethereum-rejects-2000-price-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>, the cryptocurrency experienced outflows of $2 million last week. Notably, Ethereum has consistently witnessed the highest outflows year-to-date among digital assets. In contrast, altcoins such as Solana, Polygon, and Litecoin observed minor inflows, ranging from $0.3 million to $0.5 million.</p>

<p>Trading volumes on investment products remained robust, exceeding the year average of $1.4 billion and reaching $2.3 billion last week. These volumes accounted for a larger proportion of total crypto volumes, representing 11% compared to the average of 2%.</p>



<p>The digital asset market continues to attract substantial investment, with significant inflows recorded in the past week. Bitcoin remains the dominant choice for investors, while Ethereum faced outflows despite its price appreciation. As trading volumes on investment products remain high, the market showcases resilience and investor interest in the crypto space.</p>



<p>While the lawsuit is far from over, the true story of the week was <a href="https://coincu.com/202849-ripple-is-bringing-new-excitement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple</a>&#8216;s legal triumph against the SEC. A court concluded that selling XRP tokens to the general public did not violate securities regulations, something the sector has long claimed. This is also the driving reason behind the recent surge in the cryptocurrency market.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>XRP surpasses Bitcoin in trading volume: XRP, the &#8220;liberated&#8221; token, has become the highest volume asset in the crypto market, capturing 21% of all trade volume since last week&#8217;s court ruling.</em></li>

<p>This groundbreaking development is credited to the recent court ruling that declared XRP as a non-security, which sent shockwaves through the industry. According to a report by smart data portal<a href="https://www.kaiko.com/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.kaiko.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Kaiko</a>, XRP has been responsible for a staggering 21% of all crypto trade volume since the ruling.</p>

<p>XRP&#8217;s triumph over Bitcoin that is impressive, but the fact that it managed to capture a fifth of the multi-billion-dollar market within a matter of days. This unprecedented growth in trading volume is evident as almost two billion XRP tokens were traded on the Binance spot market within three hours of the announcement.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-Overthrown-XRP-Takes-Command-Claims-20-of-Crypto-Market.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-Overthrown-XRP-Takes-Command-Claims-20-of-Crypto-Market-1024x768.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Overthrown XRP Takes Command Claims 20 of Crypto Market" class="wp-image-203435" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-Overthrown-XRP-Takes-Command-Claims-20-of-Crypto-Market-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-Overthrown-XRP-Takes-Command-Claims-20-of-Crypto-Market-300x225.jpg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-Overthrown-XRP-Takes-Command-Claims-20-of-Crypto-Market-768x576.jpg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-Overthrown-XRP-Takes-Command-Claims-20-of-Crypto-Market-750x563.jpg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-Overthrown-XRP-Takes-Command-Claims-20-of-Crypto-Market-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitcoin-Overthrown-XRP-Takes-Command-Claims-20-of-Crypto-Market.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bitcoin Overthrown: XRP Takes Command, Claims 20% of Crypto Market 28"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Just a day before this monumental achievement, based on the same Kaiko data, that XRP had climbed to become the third largest digital asset by trading volume. This upward trend was fueled by investors&#8217; anticipation that the lawsuit would soon be resolved, and their expectations proved accurate.</p>



<p>While some may attribute this seismic shift in XRP trading to the prevailing low volatility in the market at that time, it is important to note that the Bitcoin Volatility Index (BVOL), a benchmark of the crypto market, measured at a mere 14.78 on Thursday — comparable to levels seen in December, late April and June. Following the news of XRP&#8217;s surge, the BVOL value skyrocketed by more than 5% in the following days, a significant jump. All in all, it is an exciting time for XRP and the crypto market as a whole.</p>
