<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>FTX CEO John Ray III considered a plan to restart the bankrupt crypto exchange.</em></li>



<li><em>A recent court filing revealed that there is a bidder list that is likely to include investors interested in FTX 2.0.</em></li>



<li><em>The bankruptcy exchange&#8217;s native token, FTT has surged more than 17% following the latest developments.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>According to a filing filed earlier today with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the County of Delaware, John Ray III charged the company&#8217;s bankruptcy estate more than $290,000 for his services. In addition, FTX had to pay an additional $1.3 million to other employees in the bankrupt unit that took over the platform.</p>



<p>While the majority of his services involve day-to-day administrative and legal work, some of the activities mentioned in the filing reveal that the CEO is working on a plan to restart FTX 2.0. These plans regarding the possible restart of the crypto exchange were shared by Sullivan &amp; Cromwell in bankruptcy court last month.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">FTX CEO John Ray III confirms FTX 2.0 plans. <a href="https://t.co/FeCXOvdrt0" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/FeCXOvdrt0</a></p>&mdash; FTX 2.0 Coalition (@AFTXcreditor) <a href="https://twitter.com/AFTXcreditor/status/1660753728792584195?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 22, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>These activities include advising cybersecurity firm Sygnia to strengthen its international crypto platform, reviewing the terms sheet for an exchange restructuring plan, exploring the following steps to launch the exchange, and reviewing and finalizing the FTX 2.0 document for distribution to investors.</p>



<p>CEO Ray also reviewed the summary of steps submitted by investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners LP regarding the restart plan. The CEO regularly contacted the investment bank to discuss the restart plan throughout the weekend.</p>



<p>Court filings further reveal that John Ray III reviewed the list of bidders for FTX 2.0. As previously reported, venture capital firm Tribe Capital expressed interest in restarting the bankrupt crypto exchange.</p>



<p>The latest development sent the native token&#8217;s FTT price up 17%, reaching a peak of $1.16 before dropping to its current trading price of $1.14.</p>

<p>Core Science&#8217;s bankruptcy judge said at Monday&#8217;s hearing that the company should shorten its restructuring timetable by at least a month as creditors have urged the company to speed up its exit from bankruptcy proceedings according to Chapter 11.</p>



<p>Core Scientific&#8217;s attorney said the company could reach its restructuring plan by September 25.</p>



<p>The company&#8217;s creditors have argued for months over the mining company&#8217;s bankruptcy proceedings. The proceedings, which began in December 2022, were expected to last just six months but are likely to last for more than a year &#8211; a fact that has left some creditors on the company&#8217;s long list to worry.</p>



<p>However, the Core Scientific advisor argues that it takes more time to draft a business plan that adapts to the changing reality of the volatile crypto-mining landscape that has seen the price of Bitcoin and hash rate increase as electricity prices fall.</p>



<p>Ronit Berkovich, an attorney representing the debtors, said a confluence of those factors made mining more profitable, allowing Core Scientific to generate more revenue to pay off its $6 million debt.</p>



<p>Once the crypto industry&#8217;s biggest miner, Core Science suffered a rapid collapse last November when the bitcoin price tumbled amid the crypto exchange scene. FTX&#8217;s death exploded in mid-November. The company went public with a $4.3 billion valuation in 2021, but its market capitalization had dropped to $78 million by the time it filed for bankruptcy last December.</p>

<p>The Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission officially issued a warning to investors on May 18 that the Gemini Foundation, a derivatives exchange run by cryptocurrency trading platform Gemini Trust Co. launched last month, is operating illegally in the country.</p>



<p>The regulator said that Gemini Trust Co., Ltd. was not registered in advance, so the issue and/or sale of securities as derivatives violated relevant regulations and were illegal.</p>



<p>Penalties for violating these regulations include criminal prosecution and up to 21 years in prison or a fine of 5 million Philippine pesos ($89,562). The agency advises the public to refrain from investing and stops all current investments in the platform.</p>



<p>Gemini launched its non-U.S. derivatives platform Gemini Foundation in May, with the Philippines listed as a supported region. The exchange offers Bitcoin and ethereum perpetual futures contracts denominated in the exchange&#8217;s stablecoin GUSD.</p>

<p>However, the country&#8217;s regulators claim the exchange has no legal right to operate in the country as it is not approved for its products.</p>



<p>The SEC added that the cryptocurrency exchange marketed derivative products, which are essentially securities in the Philippines and are not approved by regulation to sell securities.</p>



<p>&#8220;Gemini Trust Company LLC&#8217;s lack of prior registration with the Commission makes their activities of offering and/or selling securities in the form of derivatives illegal in violation of the provisions of the SRC.&#8221; According to the Philippines SEC.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Hybrid zkRollup?</h2>



<p>The data on Ethereum is open to the public, however, many data and transactions need confidentiality. Aztec created a transparent + privacy hybrid zkRollup based on this. Everyone is aware of the notion of a hybrid vehicle, which uses both gasoline and electricity to power a vehicle.</p>



<p>Aztec recently developed the hybrid zkRollup idea after the closure of Aztec Connect. The network plans to connect Ethereum smart contracts with zk encryption execution in the future. Assume the prior Aztec Connect was just for private digital asset exchanges. In that situation, Aztec zkRollup&#8217;s future application scope will be broader, including the privacy computation and transfer of all data.</p>



<p>Many argue that the unexpected move is because the project is concerned about many harsh policies directed at privacy projects when many governments are concerned that these products can support illegal transactions. As can be seen, Aztec&#8217;s Hybrid zkRollup approach is partly to mitigate the effects if there are any unexpected changes to the law in the near future.</p>



<p>Aztec will include all of the functionality of Ethereum smart contracts, as well as the security features of programmable anonymity, data privacy, and confidentiality contracts. Aztec significantly broadens the scope of what may be done on the blockchain by permitting public-private collaboration.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Roadmap</h2>



<p>Aztec has begun the deployment of the basic contract (Milestone1.0), and the present components of the local development environment have achieved great progress. In Q3 2023, developers will have access to a local testnet, and consumers will have access to a complete public testnet in early 2024.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1107.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="598" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1107-1024x598.png" alt="What&#039;s Remarkable About Aztec&#039;s Hybrid zkRollup?" class="wp-image-189094" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1107-1024x598.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1107-300x175.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1107-768x449.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1107-750x438.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1107-1140x666.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1107.png 1340w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="What&#039;s Remarkable About Aztec&#039;s Hybrid zkRollup? 14"></a></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How does it work?</h2>



<p>Aztec leverages prior Connect architecture work and vastly enhances its breadth and capabilities. Connect formerly used an encrypted UTXO design. The same idea will be used in Aztec, but with one important difference: UTXO may represent any data, not only &#8220;token value.&#8221; Smart contracts may now be stored entirely in UTXOs.</p>



<p>Connect previously only supported three custom circuits. In both public and private states, thew network can enable arbitrary smart contract logic. As a result, developers will have access to the whole set of Ethereum use cases, as well as totally new cryptographic applications. Connect is exclusively meant for DeFi, while Aztec considerably increases creativity.</p>



<p>The public and private state environments in Aztec are entirely composable, which means that any function may call any other function. This gives rise to totally new blockchain paradigms, such as privacy-to-privacy function calls, in which the logic of a smart contract is transparent to blockchain observers and may contact other contracts with invisible logic.</p>



<p>Aztec is constructing a complete privacy ecosystem: a network of smart contracts capable of fetching and writing to whatever ledger is most convenient:</p>



<p>A transparent, public ledger to enable native protocols that need transparency, such as AMMs and loan protocols.<br>An invisible private ledger that allows for the development of private decentralized government, money, identification, and games.</p>



<p>Aztec maintains the same separation of viewing and spending keys as Connect, but extends viewing key rights to each contract for fine-grained data access management.</p>



<p>Since it provides for contract-by-contract permissioning, compliance may be done in a variety of ways using novel blockchain primitives such as decentralized identification, third-party verification, and view key sharing.</p>



<p>The network provides a complete range of programmable private rights, eliminating the need for all-or-nothing methods in applications.</p>



<p>It broadens the design area for what you can develop… You can create apps where the purpose isn&#8217;t merely privacy, but where you need to hide information to perform what you need to do.</p>



<p>Gambling, like private voting in DAOs or conducting private trades on public automated market makers, might be one of these things (AMMs).</p>



<p>The company is also building its own privacy-focused smart contract programming language, called as &#8220;Noir,&#8221; to assure the enabling of private smart contract computing.</p>



<p>Noir will be a universal zero-knowledge circuit language meant to validate any cryptographic backend. It will be totally open source.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Not a zkEVM. Why?</h2>



<p>The project says Aztec is an environment for processing transactions, integrated with Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology. However, Aztec insists that it has no intention of moving in the direction of zkEVM (like many notable recent projects).</p>



<p>Ethereum is, at its core, a state machine. It starts with a state, then organizes transactions by block, and transitions the state deterministically. Aztec enlarges the global state machine to include private states. This hybrid public-private state machine supports both public and private smart contract logic execution. Simultaneously, it no longer performs transactions like a typical blockchain but rather verifies the validity of already computed transactions. To put it another way, Aztec is a zero-knowledge execution environment but not zkEVM.</p>



<p>Explaining the &#8220;Hybrid&#8221; approach, Aztec said it combines the scalability of applications thanks to Ethereum&#8217;s account-based network management and UTXO mechanism, which helps ensure protect the privacy of many classic blockchains like Bitcoin. With this combination, programmers can write contracts similar to the experience on Ethereum but still ensure security features.</p>



<p>An early conclusion was obtained when exploring privacy smart contracts at Aztec Labs: privacy is incompatible with the EVM. The brilliance of Rollup technology is that it does more than merely replicate Ethereum.</p>



<p>Aztec provides the potential to secure anonymity at the base layer while still providing the security assurances of Ethereum. At the time of its creation, Ethereum sacrificed anonymously in exchange for public consensus. It wasn&#8217;t until Zac Williamson and Ariel Gabizon released Plonk, the first zkSNARK with wide applicability for blockchain applications, in 2018 that it became viable to accomplish trustless, private execution using sophisticated zero-knowledge cryptography.</p>



<p>However, account-based public blockchain models like Ethereum are unable to enable native privacy, while UTXO-based privacy solutions are unable to support the ecosystem of apps and tools developed for public smart contract platforms.</p>



<p>Aztec integrates public and private execution into a single zkRollup, allowing for the seamless composition of encrypted and non-encrypted transactions. If Ethereum&#8217;s innovation is the ability to read and write to the public state, Aztec&#8217;s innovation is the ability to read and write to both the public and private states. Mixing public and private Rollups into a single hybrid Rollup allows use cases for secrecy and audibility such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Private Voting for Public DAOs</li>



<li>Private Game Sessions</li>



<li>Trades in Private on Public AMMs</li>
</ul>



<p>Aztec formerly only enabled private asset transactions, but it now also enables private smart contract execution, and smart contracts are more flexible in terms of compliance and viewing rights.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Users may now implement private contracts on Aztec&#8217;s local system, with the public side of the technology still under development.</p>



<p>Hybrid combines application scalability owing to Ethereum&#8217;s account-based network management with the UTXO mechanism, which offers the privacy guarantee of many traditional blockchains like Bitcoin. With this combination, programmers may build contracts that are to the Ethereum experience while yet comparable security features. Regarding its performance, we still need time to review.</p>

<p>According to <em><a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/05/22/veteran-crypto-traders-bitcoin-denominated-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortune</a></em>, Singapore-based crypto hedge firm BXB Capital intends to create a Bitcoin-focused fund in July 2023. BXB took a different strategy with the new fund, aiming to raise funds entirely in Bitcoin, with an ultimate objective of up to 1,000 BTC (about $27 million). Investors have already given the startup 400 BTC, or almost $10 million.</p>



<p>This is BXB&#8217;s first serious effort to raise outside cash. Although they declined to identify the investors, BXB co-founders J.J. Petersen and Alex Friedberg said that they are high-profile crypto personalities.</p>



<p>Investors, according to Petersen, obtain exposure to Bitcoin without being engaged in lending operations. As a result, the profits are distributed in Bitcoin rather than dollars and euros.</p>



<p>BXB Capital was created in 2017 as a trading business only focused on profiting from arbitrage, taking advantage of the differential in bitcoin prices in South Korea and abroad.</p>



<p>The company&#8217;s business has grown over time to encompass a variety of opportunistic trading tactics. Through their firm BxB Inc., Petersen, and Friedberg also established the South Korean won-backed stablecoin KRWb, which was eventually bought by Binance and integrated into a joint venture to launch Binance&#8217;s stablecoin BKRW and Binance Korea. Binance Korea, on the other hand, shut down less than a year after its start owing to liquidity and transaction volume difficulties.</p>



<p>The debut of this new fund comes with a deteriorating market, notwithstanding Bitcoin&#8217;s recent increases. Tether, the creator of the biggest stablecoin USDT, has stated that it would spend a portion of its income in Bitcoin, abandoning US government bonds in favor of cryptocurrencies.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Strike, a Bitcoin Lightning Network-based payments platform, has introduced support for Tether&#8217;s USDT, the world&#8217;s biggest stablecoin.</strong></h5>

<p>According to a press release <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-usdt-to-be-integrated-onto-strike-leading-global-money-app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> on May 22, the integration intends to facilitate quick, secure, and efficient payments for Strike users while also increasing the usage and acceptance of USDT.</p>



<p>Strike is a payment platform based on the Bitcoin lightning network that allows users to send BTC to anyone in the globe at lightning speed. By including USDT, the money app allows its customers to transfer their cryptocurrencies without fear of volatility.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;By combining the stability and utility of Tether&#8217;s digital currency with Strike&#8217;s innovative payment solutions, users will experience a new era of secure and efficient transactions. This collaboration signifies a significant leap toward mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, as it addresses several key challenges faced by the industry,&#8221; the company said in its blog post.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The news comes only two days after Strike <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188741-strike-expands-bitcoin-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> its app in 65 additional countries, expanding beyond its former base in the United States, Argentina, and El Salvador. Using the Lightning Network, the software enables users to send and receive Bitcoin in real-time. Users may also transfer money and acquire Bitcoin over the site.</p>



<p>Tether&#8217;s CTO, Paolo Ardoino, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“This is a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry as it signifies the growing acceptance and recognition of stablecoins as a reliable and efficient digital payment solution. We believe this collaboration will foster the widespread adoption of digital currencies, driving innovation and creating a more inclusive financial ecosystem for all.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>USDT, a stablecoin linked to the US dollar, provides consumers with a dependable and predictable value for their transactions. According to the documents furnished by the company, Strike will keep &#8220;cash&#8221; quantities belonging to customers situated outside of the United States in USDT rather than any other fiat currency as part of the agreement.</p>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/188151-tether-uses-net-profits-purchase-btc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tether</a>&#8216;s integration adds numerous important capabilities to the Strike platform. Strike&#8217;s Lightning Network compatibility, combined with Tether&#8217;s stability, bridges the gap between established financial institutions and cryptocurrencies, advancing the integration and adoption of digital assets.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;PokerGO&#8217;s extensive experience in poker entertainment combined with the cutting-edge Web3 development at Gala Games is a perfect marriage. Together, we have been able to build a superior social poker game that players everywhere will love.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As part of the agreement, PokerGO Play will become a major sponsor of PokerGO, obtaining marketing possibilities throughout its content portfolio, which includes the World Series of Poker.</p>



<p>Gala developers revealed on May 18 that they had destroyed over 21 billion GALA tokens worth around $640 million after the protocol&#8217;s v2 airdrop.</p>



<p>Gala Games was dealing with a token bridge exploit in November 2022, which resulted in an estimated $4.5 million being stolen from their liquidity pool. Notwithstanding these obstacles, Gala Games and PokerGO remain committed to their aim of launching exceptional events from PokerGO&#8217;s dedicated Las Vegas studio and, eventually, revolutionizing the online poker market.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>MicroStrategy said that it supports the FASB&#8217;s proposal to let enterprises utilize fair-value accounting for Bitcoin held on their balance sheets.</em></li>



<li><em>The corporation presently owns 140,000 Bitcoin, worth almost $4 billion at current market levels.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>MicroStrategy <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/content/dam/website-assets/collateral/bitcoin-downloads/microstrategy-incorporated-FASB-ED-comment-letter_5-22-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a> to the Financial Accounting Standards Board&#8217;s (FASB) proposed accounting rules for crypto assets in a letter on Monday.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1097.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="512" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1097-1024x512.png" alt="MicroStrategy Supports The FASB To Back Fair Value Accounting For Bitcoin" class="wp-image-189068" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1097-1024x512.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1097-300x150.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1097-768x384.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1097-1536x768.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1097-360x180.png 360w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1097-750x375.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1097-1140x570.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1097.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="MicroStrategy Supports The FASB To Back Fair Value Accounting For Bitcoin 27"></a></figure></div>


<p>In response, the corporation backed the authority&#8217;s efforts to encourage fair value accounting for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>According to MicroStrategy, it is the biggest public firm holding Bitcoin. MSTR reported that it has 140,000 Bitcoins as of March 31, 2023. It said that the corporation purchased these Bitcoin for $4.17 billion at the time of purchase.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We appreciate the rigorous process the FASB is undertaking,&#8221; the company said in a letter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The corporation must utilize the initial purchase price and then record cumulative impairment charges using current accounting standards known as the indefinite-lived intangible asset accounting model. It implies its bitcoin assets are only reflected on its balance sheet at $2 billion, or half its fair market worth.</p>



<p>MSTR&#8217;s Bitcoin assets were valued at about $3.986 billion at the time. This is more than double the amount it had in its Bitcoins on the consolidated financial sheet. <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188530-microstrategy-research-ordinals-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MicroStrategy</a>, which supports the FASB&#8217;s proposed air value model, said that it would allow them to deliver more relevant information to investors.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Reporting crypto asset holdings under a fair value model, as proposed by the FASB, would enable us to provide investors with a more relevant view of our financial position and the economic value of our bitcoin holdings, which in turn would facilitate the ability of investors to make informed investment and capital allocation decisions,&#8221; the company added.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The FASB decided on the proposal last year, and the amendments are now out for public comment.</p>



<p>Despite the market&#8217;s increasing spectrum of crypto assets, MicroStrategy supported FASB&#8217;s intention to first confine the scope criteria. Yet, it argues that there are several complications associated with non-fungible or wrapped tokens, among other things.</p>

<p>Existing BitMEX customers based in Hong Kong will no longer be able to use HDR Global Trading Limited&#8217;s services through the present website or API connections as of May 29, 2023. The unique service will function under a transitional structure in order to prepare for the impending Hong Kong VASP system.</p>



<p>Hong Kong Users will be moved to HDR BMEX Ltd, their associated Hong Kong firm, to enable a smooth transition. They will only get service via the BitMEX Hong Kong mobile app, which is accessible for download, beginning on the specified date.</p>



<p>The \ Hong Kong app has a plethora of options that provide customers with complete control over their portfolios. Users may buy and sell cryptocurrencies instantaneously utilizing 11 trading pairs, as well as purchase cryptocurrencies safely using over 30 currencies.</p>



<p>The developing regulatory climate in the area influenced the decision to start BitMEX Hong Kong. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/184581-hong-kong-allowing-crypto-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hong Kong</a> has been working hard to develop strong standards for digital assets, a move that the exchange fully embraces and supports.</p>



<p>With the goal of becoming a key participant in the crypto scene, Hong Kong wants to issue comprehensive criteria for crypto exchanges planning to launch operations in the territory this month. Tomorrow, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission will hold a news conference on virtual asset trading platforms.</p>



<p>Existing BitMEX customers in Hong Kong, according to the notification, would no longer be able to access services supplied by HDR Global Trading Ltd through the current website or API connections, including services accessible at www.bitmex.com. Any unfulfilled orders and unfinished quotes or conversion requests will be canceled at 13:00 HKT on May 29, 2023.</p>



<p>Further verification or KYC checks will not be needed for verified Hong Kong users.</p>



<p>The exchange informs its customers that withdrawals from the trading platform will be possible until the transfer date. After May 29, 2023, any leftover account balance will be automatically transferred to BitMEX Hong Kong accounts without deduction or cost. Customers who have previously completed verification or KYC checks will not need to do so again, but they will need to use the new Hong Kong mobile app to use the services.</p>



<p>Hong Kong issued a statement on the regulation of the country&#8217;s cryptocurrency industry in October of last year, suggesting that it intends to apply standard financial regulations to crypto exchanges. Christian Hui, Hong Kong&#8217;s Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury said in March that the new system will take effect in June 2023.</p>

<p>Samuel Westrich, the CTO of Dash Core Group, noted a difficulty with v19 activation in a recent Twitter post.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There was a problem during v19 activation of Dash Core. The chain is stalled and currently not producing blocks. We have everyone investigating the issue. I will continue with updates on Twitter as we have more information.</p>&mdash; Samuel Westrich (@SamWestrich) <a href="https://twitter.com/SamWestrich/status/1660513873546596354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 22, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Westrich adds that the chain has paused and is now not creating blocks until the matter is being investigated. He promises additional updates on Twitter as more information becomes available.</p>



<p>Binance has also <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-pool-will-temporarily-suspend-distribution-of-dash-mining-rewards-36be22ff4bbf43d6b3857e634a2cb7c4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">halted</a> the payout of DASH mining incentives for the time being. According to an official blog post, the dialogue was as follows:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Due to the situation following the v19 activation of Dash Core, the Dash (DASH) network has temporarily paused the production of new blocks. As such, Binance Pool will temporarily suspend the distribution of DASH mining rewards until the network resumes block production. No further announcement will be posted.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On May 15, Dash Core Group&#8217;s CTO, Samuel Westrich, unveiled substantial enhancements for the Dash network, including the release of Dash Core v19 and the Dash Platform v0.24.</p>



<p>DashCore v19.0 was a significant release that was required for all master nodes, miners, and users. Dash 19.0 provides various new features and improvements, including the BLS scheme migration, high-performance master node implementation, wallet upgrades, and several Bitcoin backport changes.</p>



<p>At the time of publication, no more information on the status of block manufacturing has been released.</p>



<p>Dmitry Korniychuk, the developer of PirateCash, said that using independent software does not enable restarting the blockchain. The network of the privacy-focused cryptocurrency grinds to a standstill due to desync and erroneous blocks.</p>



<p>DASH&#8217;s price did not respond to the failure throughout the day, and the token is now trading at about $43.5.</p>
