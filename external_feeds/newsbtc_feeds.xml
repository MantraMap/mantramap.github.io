					<description><![CDATA[Filecoin (FIL) made a positive start in July. The cryptocurrency has been experiencing a substantial price increase over the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, FIL has increased in value by 16.47% in the past day, propelling its price to $4.73.  FIL is the native token of the decentralized Filecoin network, an open-source cloud storage protocol designed for easy data storage and retrieval. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Leads With Highest Number of Fake Twitter Followers, Data Reveals Filecoin In June &#8211; Price Action The FIL price started the month trading at $4.693. The token&#8217;s value dipped after touching the $5 price level, losing as much as 34% before June 10. However, the FIL price has steadily risen since this sharp decline, gaining more than 52% in the past few weeks. It is worth noting that Filecoin moved sideways towards the end of June, with the token&#8217;s price hovering around $4. That said, FIL appears to have resumed its bullish course, having soared more than 20% since the beginning of July. Most of this price increase is due to today&#8217;s spike, which has pushed Filecoin to reclaim its price level seen in early June. As of this writing, Filecoin (FIL) changes hands at $4.73, according to data from CoinGecko. The cryptocurrency has a 24-hour trading volume of over $530 million, representing a 434% surge in the past day. The recent price upswing of Filecoin (FIL) has also positively impacted its market capitalization, with a market cap of more than $2 billion USD. What&#8217;s Next For FIL? It remains to be seen how long this current price rally will last, especially as the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) nears the overbought zone. The RSI is a momentum indicator that tracks a token&#8217;s oversold and overbought levels. When the RSI enters the oversold region, it signals that the token&#8217;s price is losing momentum, and a reversal might be on the horizon. Additionally, Filecoin is at the key resistance level of $4.8 on the daily timeframe. If FIL breaks this threshold, the token is expected to continue its bullish run, leading to further price appreciation. On the flip side, if FIL fails to break the $4.8 resistance level, we could see the coin fall to the $2.941 support level.   Meanwhile, the 200 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) also acts as a dynamic resistance for the Filecoin price, posing a barrier to upward movement, as seen on the chart below. Hence, the bullish run may not continue until the price of FIL moves above the 200 EMA.  FILUSD at the $4.8 resistance zone &#124; Source: FILUSD chart from TradingView Related Reading: Historical Litecoin Bearish Signal Goes Off, Correction Incoming?

					<description><![CDATA[The price of Avalanche (AVAX) has shown positive momentum, but it remains range-bound. In the past 24 hours, the altcoin saw a 1.8% increase. However, on the weekly chart, it has retraced all its gains due to the lack of significant movement within the range. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Leads With Highest Number of Fake Twitter Followers, Data Reveals AVAX is struggling to surpass the $14 level, which has historically acted as a significant resistance. If AVAX manages to break above this resistance level, a rally is possible. However, the price movement of AVAX is closely tied to Bitcoin&#8217;s performance, as other altcoins have exhibited similar patterns. If Bitcoin drops to the $31,000 range, AVAX might find surpassing the $14 mark challenging. From a technical perspective, the outlook for AVAX favors the bulls, but the momentum is not particularly strong. Demand and accumulation indicators suggest that buying strength is slowly increasing. The market capitalization of AVAX has seen growth, which is a positive sign. However, if Bitcoin starts retracing on its chart, AVAX could turn bearish. Avalanche Price Analysis: One-Day Chart As of the time of writing, AVAX was trading at $13.30. The altcoin recently formed a lower high at this level, indicating a resistance point. The immediate resistance level for AVAX is slightly higher at $13.90. The price needs to break above this resistance to initiate a rally and surpass the $14 mark. However, before reaching $13.90, AVAX might encounter another resistance level of around $13.40. The coin must sustain trading above these levels for a considerable period to gain significant upward momentum. On the downside, support is seen at $13. If the price falls below this support level, it may decline to $12.80, invalidating the bullish scenario. Technical Analysis Following the bounce from the $13 support level, AVAX has seen an increase in buying interest. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is slightly above the 50-mark, suggesting that sellers have temporarily retreated and buyers are gaining control. Additionally, AVAX has moved above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating a return of demand and that buyers are currently driving the price momentum in the market. AVAX has shown continued buying strength, with buy signals forming on the daily chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which measures price momentum and shifts, has displayed green histograms associated with bullish signals. Related Reading: Historical Litecoin Bearish Signal Goes Off, Correction Incoming? This suggests a positive momentum and potential upward movement in the price. The Bollinger Bands, which measure price volatility and fluctuations, have opened up and moved upwards, indicating that the price may attempt to rise on the upside.

					<description><![CDATA[Despite Revolut, a platform that provides numerous services, including banking and crypto trading, planning to delist Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC) from its trading platform in the United States by September 18, the three coins have started July firmly, bottoming up from June 2023 lows. As an illustration, SOL is up roughly 50% from June 2023 lows when it had sunk to as low as $13. Meanwhile, ADA has soared 17% while MATIC is up 25% in the past two weeks, reading from the performance in the daily chart. Cardano, Solana, Polygon Prices Firm While their prices are relatively firm but in a bearish formation considering the sharp losses in June 2023, the three coins are still some of the most liquid in crypto. ADA, for instance, is perched at seventh, trailing XRP. The coin has a market capitalization of $10.2 billion and is in the top 10.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Leads With Highest Number of Fake Twitter Followers, Data Reveals SOL is also at 10th in the market capitalization leaderboard with a market capitalization of $7.6 billion. On the other hand, MATIC is steady, in an uptrend, adding 6.3% in the last trading week. Polygon had a market capitalization of $6.5 billion when writing on July 3.  The cryptocurrencies that Revolut intends to delist have high liquidity and can be traded on major global exchanges such as Binance and KuCoin, even at their current valuations. In an email, Revolut said clients in the United States would be barred from trading the three tokens and have to sell their assets by September 18. Specifically, Revolut cited shifting laws around cryptocurrencies in the United States. The email read in part: Our US crypto services provider has decided to delist these tokens due to the changing laws and regulations around cryptocurrency in the US. Because of this, we’ll no longer be able to process your buy and sell orders for these tokens. SEC Alleges ADA, SOL, And MATIC Are Unregistered Securities While the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) cited SOL, ADA, MATIC, and other coins, including Algorand (ALGO), as examples of unregistered securities, forcing several providers in the country to remove them from their platforms. Revolut also appears to be following in the steps of Baktt, a digital asset platform founded by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Days after the SEC’s comments, the platform said they would stop supporting the three coins mid-June. Related Reading: Maker (MKR) Gains 30% In 7 Days, What’s Next?

					<description><![CDATA[Over the last month, a coordinated attack against altcoins by the US SEC caused Bitcoin dominance to surpass 50%. Above the psychological level makes BTC more valuable as a whole than the entire crypto market. However, a technical signal has appeared that in the past put in a peak in BTC.D and suddenly sparked a reversal in altcoins. Here is a closer look at the signal and why a surprise alt season could be right around the corner. Bitcoin Dominance Beats All Other Crypto Combined Bitcoin dominance is a metric that measures the top cryptocurrency’s market cap against the weight of everything else in the space. It is often used as a barometer of health in altcoins, specifically when it’s better to be in BTC, or in alts like Ethereum, Litecoin, or Solana. When BTC.D is falling and the market is healthy, altcoins outperform Bitcoin in terms of alpha. But as high beta assets, alts are significantly more volatile. As a result, when the market is crashing, they suffer much more drawdown by comparison and BTC’s market share becomes increasingly dominant. Related Reading: Bitcoin Starts To Bite Back Says Reptilian Technical Signal This is precisely the case all throughout 2023. Altcoins have taken a beating, but Bitcoin has held its ground. This divergence across the different types of cryptocurrencies has caused the total market cap of BTC to surpass all other coins combined. 50% dominance is clearly an important level. However, it’s a reading on the Relative Strength Index that’s particularly notable. Will dominance be rejected? &#124; BTCUSD on TradingView.com The BTC.D Signal Hinting At A Surprise Altcoin Season The Relative Strength Index is a momentum measuring tool, which tells traders when an asset is overbought or oversold. In crypto, assets can stay overbought or oversold for extended periods of time. But in BTC.D, on weekly timeframes, historically it hasn’t spent much time at overbought conditions. In fact, it has only reached overbought a handful of times. This latest push into overbought territory has reached a reading that in the past put the peak in for Bitcoin dominance and immediately turned around into an epic altcoin season. This setup last appeared in late 2019 when BTC.D was at 70%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reaches Longest Stretch Ever Without A Bull Run With such overbought conditions, combined with an Elliott Wave count indicative of a five-wave move coming to an end, an altcoin season might not be as far away as most are expecting. Although altcoins outperform in an alt season, hence the name, they require a bullish Bitcoin to bait retail to the market. With BTC beginning to show bullish signs once again, how long until altcoins follow and ultimately outperform? This chart originally appeared in Issue #10 of CoinChartist (VIP).

					<description><![CDATA[Last week, the likes of Ethereum in the crypto market were shaken when the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC0 revealed that it found the Bitcoin Spot ETF filings of giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity, among others, inadequate. This news saw the price of cryptocurrencies declines rapidly. But as the new week opens, investors have shaken off the effect of the announcement and bulls have begun to take over. Ethereum Sets Sight On $2,000 Level Ethereum’s recovery following the SEC announcement has been encouraging for investors, leading to a return of positive sentiment around the digital asset. Following this, ETH is now looking toward the $2,000 level despite the bears currently mounting significant resistance at this point. Related Reading: Litecoin Bull Case Grows Stronger As Hashrate Touches New All Time-High The digital asset has already reclaimed the $1,950 resistance which is now serving as support. As a result, this could provide the much-needed bounce-off point as the cryptocurrency attempts another rally. Such a rally from here could easily see ETH re-take $2,000 once more. Fortunately, Ethereum continues to trade well above its 50-day and 100-day moving averages, both of which have helped the digital asset to solidify its bull momentum for the short term. As long as buyers continue to dominate the market, the break above $2,000 is programmed and will likely be achieved before the week runs out. ETH sitting close to $2,000 &#124; Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com Factors That Could Propel ETH Forward One thing that could serve as a catalyst for a rally toward $2,500 for Ethereum would be approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Spot ETF filings that have been made by the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity have already propelled the market forward. But this is only a fraction of what is possible if one or more of the ETFs are approved. Such approval will likely see billions of dollars from institutional investors flow into the market as they rush to take advantage and gain exposure to assets such as Bitcoin. And as seen before, it would not be long until an Ethereum Spot ETF follows.

					<description><![CDATA[The crypto market has been on a rollercoaster this year, with prices fluctuating wildly and regulatory pressures causing significant drops. However, recent developments have given investors renewed confidence in the market, leading to a total crypto market cap recovery. On June 15th, the total crypto market cap hit a low point of $972 billion, following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) regulatory pressure on the industry. But since then, the market has rebounded. This recovery has been driven partly by the entrance of major financial players into the crypto space. Several applications for a Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) by major financial players such as Blackrock and Fidelity have been filed, indicating that they are interested in betting on cryptocurrencies.  This has helped to rebuild investor confidence in the market, leading to increased investments and a rise in the total crypto market cap. Crypto Market Cap&#8217;s Moment Of Truth Cryptocurrency investors are closely monitoring the total crypto market cap as it attempts to break through a significant resistance level. According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital, if the market can successfully breach this level, it could pave the way for continued upward momentum and potentially significant gains for the overall market. At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap is around $1.17 trillion, with Bitcoin making up the lion&#8217;s share of this value. However, the market has been trading in a relatively tight range over the past few weeks, with many investors looking for a catalyst to drive prices higher. Rekt Capital believes that a breakout above the current resistance level could be just the catalyst that the market needs to see a sustained uptrend. Rekt Capital suggests that the market could see gains of between 10% and 23% over time if this breakout occurs. As depicted in the chart, the immediate resistance levels for the global market cap of the cryptocurrency industry are currently at $1.18 and $1.25. The latter represents the highest level achieved in 2023. Related Reading: Historical Litecoin Bearish Signal Goes Off, Correction Incoming? However, certain conditions must be met for the market to break through these levels. Firstly, there needs to be an improvement in current market conditions, including a relaxation of crypto regulations by regulators globally, particularly in the US. Additionally, there needs to be a resolution of the ongoing Bitcoin Spot ETF applications by major financial players with the SEC. If these conditions are met, it could lead to an influx of financial players and investors into cryptocurrency. Many investors are looking to cryptocurrencies as a hedge against inflation, and greater regulatory clarity and the approval of a Bitcoin ETF could make the industry more attractive to traditional investors. Cryptocurrency Trading Volume Drops To 2020 Levels  Crypto trading volumes have reached their lowest levels since 2020, despite the ongoing rally in June. According to a report by crypto market data provider Kaiko, spot trade volumes have significantly declined in Q2, with Binance registering the strongest drop in trading activity. Binance, one of the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchanges, saw volumes fall by nearly 70% after the exchange reintroduced fees for its most liquid Bitcoin pairs. This move, aimed at reducing market manipulation, appears to have significantly impacted trading activity on the platform. However, Binance was not the only exchange to see a significant decline in trading volumes. Other popular exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, OKX, and Huobi, also saw volumes decline by over 50% in Q2. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Dominate, But Expert Warns Of Potential $20,000 Retest The decline in trading volumes is surprising, given the recent rally in the crypto market. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has been bullish in June, reaching a high of over $31,000. Despite this, trading volumes have remained subdued, suggesting that investors are not as active in the market as they have been.

<p>Crypto trading volumes have reached their lowest levels since 2020, despite the ongoing rally in June. <a href="https://marketing.kaiko.com/whats-driving-bitcoins-rally-1?ecid=AOKeC1ZsxplPoISj8-MxfRcQE_Oll4kxJQNtgSOc4UfLGw-sOayRHTHK0ewe4KlZd97Wv-_Vkdtk&amp;_hsmi=73538787" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According </a>to a report by crypto market data provider Kaiko, spot trade volumes have significantly declined in Q2, with Binance registering the strongest drop in trading activity.</p>
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-540940" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot_7.jpg" alt="Crypto" width="647" height="318" srcset="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot_7.jpg 647w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot_7-460x226.jpg 460w" sizes="(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px"/>
<p>Binance, one of the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchanges, saw volumes fall by nearly 70% after the exchange reintroduced fees for its most liquid Bitcoin pairs. This move, aimed at reducing market manipulation, appears to have significantly impacted trading activity on the platform.</p>
<p>However, Binance was not the only exchange to see a significant decline in trading volumes. Other popular exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, OKX, and Huobi, also saw volumes decline by over 50% in Q2.</p>

<p>The decline in trading volumes is surprising, given the recent rally in the crypto market. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has been bullish in June, reaching a high of over $31,000. Despite this, trading volumes have remained subdued, suggesting that investors are not as active in the market as they have been.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has recently dominated the headlines with massive gains in the current overall crypto market rally. Its price recently surged over 200% this month after being listed on EDX Markets, a new exchange backed by major institutions.  Trading also spiked on Upbit, a major Korean exchange. This led to a significant increase in the total hash rate and mining difficulty as miners migrated to the blockchain to chase profits.  Bitcoin Cash Hash Rate Reaches Highest In Two Years According to data from CoinWarz, the BCH hash rate jumped to over 5.45 EH/s in the closing hours of June, reaching its highest point in over two years. The increased hash power means the BCH network has become increasingly secure as miners move to the blockchain. Mining difficulty also followed suit, jumping to 494.8 G in less than a day.  Related Reading: Historical Litecoin Bearish Signal Goes Off, Correction Incoming? While frequent difficulty adjustments can impact mining profits in the short run, the heightened interest in mining Bitcoin Cash is a good sign for the network. BCH mining difficulty touches two-year highs &#124; Source: CoinWarz The rally in Bitcoin Cash’s price and mining metrics has put pressure on those short-selling BCH futures contracts. The total amount of money lost on BCH-tracked futures shorts and longs combined was over $25 million, which is the largest in over two years.  All of this comes ahead of the Bitcoin Cash Halving, an event that is expected to happen in May 2024, cutting block rewards in half. The rapid rise in mining difficulty and hash rate could be linked to this. However, given that it is almost a year away, it is more likely that the altcoin&#8217;s recovery and price movements over the last week are the culprit. BCH Price Action The future price outlook for Bitcoin Cash remains highly uncertain, given that the current rally came as a surprise to many investors. The next several weeks will be extremely important in determining whether or not this rally has sufficient energy to drive Bitcoin Cash to new highs in 2023 or whether or not it fizzles out.  BCH holds steady at $288 &#124; Source: BCHUSDT on TradingView.com Currently, BCH seems overbought from various indicators like the Relative Strength Index. Overbought means an extended price move to the upside. Price action seems to have become calm, as the cryptocurrency is now facing rejection around $300.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Leads With Highest Number of Fake Twitter Followers, Data Reveals The 50-day and 200-day MAs seem to suggest that the price increases may continue. However, if the current momentum stalls and BCH faces a strong rejection, the BCH price could erase most of its recent gains.  BCH is now trading at $288 and is down 1.31% in the past 24 hours. BCH’s price rise saw its market cap jump to over 5.58 billion, making it the 14th-largest cryptocurrency in the space. Featured image from Finbold, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[According to on-chain data from DefiLlama, Ethereum liquid staking derivatives have grown in total value in recent months, with the total crypto locked closing in on record numbers. Liquid staking derivatives platforms now have more than 10 million ETH locked, making the total value locked (TVL) close in on $20 billion across various protocols. ETH Liquid Staking Derivatives With Ethereum 2.0 staking now live, many ETH investors have turned to liquid staking derivatives like Lido and Rocket Pool. Liquid staking has gained massive popularity as it introduces an innovative way for ETH holders to earn a yield on their holdings while having access to funds to carry out other activities.

With Ethereum moving to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, validators have to lock their digital assets through staking to participate in the consensus process and continue adding blocks to the blockchain. This has led to the growth of “liquid staking” derivatives that allow holders to stake their ETH while still maintaining liquidity.

					<description><![CDATA[In a market of ever-changing dynamics, Litecoin (LTC), one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies, is caught in an interesting situation. The digital asset&#8217;s price direction has recently been the subject of analysis by a renowned crypto expert, Ali, who is well-known for his crypto predictions and insights. His analysis, drawn from a key market indicator, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, may shed light on Litecoin&#8217;s immediate future. Ali’s forecast derives from the 30-day MVRV for Litecoin, which presently stands at around 35%. This metric serves as an instrument for tracking the disparity between the market value and realized the value of the digital asset. Related Reading: Litecoin Up 18% In Past 24 Hours, Is Halving Rally Here? Ali&#8217;s recent observation adds a significant dimension to the market&#8217;s perception of Litecoin, suggesting that history might be gearing up to repeat itself. The History Of Litecoin MVRV And Price Corrections As Ali highlighted in a recent tweet, Litecoin’s history since 2018 shows a distinctive pattern. Whenever the 30-day MVRV exceeds the 30% threshold, a sharp price correction ensues. Such corrections have typically led to a decline in LTC&#8217;s price ranging from 30% to 40%. This pattern has persisted over the years and lends credence to Ali&#8217;s prediction about a possible downturn. Currently, #Litecoin MVRV 30D hovers around 35%. Historically, each time $LTC MVRV 30D exceeds the 30% mark since 2018, a sharp price correction typically follows! This usually translates to a #LTC price drop ranging from 30% to 40%. pic.twitter.com/R5oMMaKWGc — Ali (@ali_charts) July 2, 2023 The rationale behind this is straightforward. When the MVRV ratio is high, it indicates that holders have accrued significant profits and may decide to sell, resulting in a price drop. However, it’s important to remember that while historical trends provide an indication, they are not a guaranteed predictor of future events. LTC Latest Price Action On June 30, Litecoin experienced a significant price hike, recording a sizeable green candlestick. This surge propelled LTC to the high of $109 at the time of writing, reflecting a nearly 24% increase over the last seven days. In addition, Litecoin has exhibited a minor decrease of 1.8% within the last 24 hours. The asset&#8217;s market capitalization has also seen a 22.5% surge in the past week, moving from a low of $6.4 billion last Monday to as high as $8 billion as of today. This has ranked the altcoin as 8th among the largest crypto by market capitalization. Litecoin&#8217;s daily trading volume has also recorded a significant surge from the $462 million volume seen late last month to stand above $1 billion in the past 24 hours. LTC currently has a 24-hour low of $108 and a 24-hour high of $114. Related Reading: Litecoin Surging Adds 20% Ahead of Halving Event, DigiToads Gains 370% In Presale It is worth noting that LTC&#8217;s recent surge can be attributed to the upcoming halving which is to take place in the next few weeks. This has served as a catalyst for investors to accumulate the altcoin. However, despite the LTC surge, the asset is still 72% down from its peak of $412.

<p>Litecoin&#8217;s daily trading volume has also recorded a significant surge from the $462 million volume seen late last month to stand above $1 billion in the past 24 hours. LTC currently has a 24-hour low of $108 and a 24-hour high of $114.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that LTC&#8217;s recent surge can be attributed to the upcoming halving which is to take place in the next few weeks. This has served as a catalyst for investors to accumulate the altcoin. However, despite the LTC surge, the asset is still 72% down from its peak of $412.</p>
