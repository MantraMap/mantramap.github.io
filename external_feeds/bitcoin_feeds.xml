These markets have outperformed dollar-denominated debt due to the behavior of currencies like the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso, which have appreciated against their U.S. counterpart.</strong></p>
<h2>Emerging Market Debt Investors Flee to Local Currency Bonds</h2>
<p>Investors in emerging market debt have taken interest in local currency-denominated instruments, while abandoning dollar-based bonds, according to data provided by EPFR Global, a fund flow and allocation data provider. Numbers indicate that monetary flows have moved from bonds denominated in hard currency to local currency bonds, given that these have outperformed their dollar-denominated counterparts.</p>
<p>EPFR Global found that during the first four months of the year, investors withdrew $2.65 billion from emerging market bonds denominated in U.S. dollars. During the same period, the money flows to local currency-denominated emerging market debt rose by $5.23 billion.</p>
<p>Analysts believe this move will continue, as the strength of the dollar is being threatened by a possible debt <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-insists-us-could-default-on-june-1-goldman-sachs-estimates-real-deadline-is-a-week-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">default</a> and interest rate volatility. Paul Greer, emerging markets debt portfolio manager at Fidelity International, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bb3d58ca-3584-4027-84d9-714a96651dbb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Local markets are far outperforming external debt. Frankly, I think that trend will probably continue for the rest of the year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, Thanos Papasavvas, chief investment officer at ABP Invest, stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have seen a clear divergence between emerging market local and hard currency bonds over the past few quarters with local currency debt looking more attractive on a fundamental and valuation basis.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Reasons for Abandoning Dollar-Denominated Bonds</h2>
<p>There are several reasons for this trend. First, some local currencies have appreciated compared to the U.S. dollar. This is true for the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real, which have appreciated more than 10% against the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Also, the early actions of some central banks in emerging countries, which raised their interest rates due to inflation, have improved the real yield that some of these bonds offer. Brazil and Mexico are examples of this again, with the former having an interest rate of 13.75% and year-over-year inflation of 4.15% in May, and the latter having an 11.25% interest rate compared to a 5.3% inflation rate in April.</p>
<p>However, other analysts state that confidence in the market is very low and that investors are hoarding cash waiting for signals to start putting funds in these instruments again.</p>

<h2>Shuvalov Discusses New Payment System for BRICS and SCO</h2>
<p>The chairman of Russia&#8217;s national economic development institution VEB.RF, Igor Shuvalov, has urged China and Russia to accelerate the establishment of an efficient payment system for members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and the BRICS economic group.</p>
<p>VEB.RF is a Russian state development corporation and investment company. It is a non-profit organization with no shareholders. Shuvalov previously served as First Deputy Prime Minister in Dmitry Medvedev&#8217;s Cabinet. He was appointed chairman of VEB.RF in May 2018 by Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>Speaking at a Russian-Chinese Business Forum in Shanghai on Tuesday, Shuvalov stressed that Russia and China should speed up the creation of an efficient system for payments in the Russian ruble, the Chinese yuan, and the currencies of SCO and BRICS member nations, Tass reported. The BRICS comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The SCO was established in 2001 as a political, economic, and defense alliance; it is the world’s largest regional organization.</p>
<p>Shuvalov was quoted by the news outlet as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Trade and economic cooperation overall between the Russian Federation and China will only rise and expand. And we, together with CDB (China Development Bank), will deepen our cooperation, the coordination of our actions on this path.</p></blockquote>
<p>He added that his own organization, the CDB, and other financial institutions of the SCO and the BRICS could aid such efforts.</p>
<p>Shuvalov proceeded to emphasize the need for a new, “cutting-edge” payment infrastructure for the two nations to deepen their trade and economic cooperation. He stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>We urge the government of the Russian Federation and our Chinese partners to act as actively as possible. An independent and efficient infrastructure of payments is necessary not only for ensuring the ‘ruble/yuan’ pair, but also for carrying out the most serious transactions in SCO and BRICS currencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said Tuesday that the relations between Russia and China are getting stronger.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Russian-Chinese Business Forum during a meeting with members of the Russian business community, he said: &#8220;Over 1,200 people are taking part in the forum, including representatives of numerous Russian public and private-sector companies, which is good news.”</p>
<p>Mishustin added: &#8220;Our relations with China keep getting stronger. This longstanding relationship is based on historical roots, mutual respect, and friendship.”</p>

<h2>UN Secretary-General Calls for Reform of Global Financial System</h2>
<p>United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, who served as the prime minister of Portugal from 1995 to 2002, has called for a reform of the global financial system.</p>
<p>He shared during a press conference on Sunday in Hiroshima, Japan, where he attended the Group of Seven (G7) summit: “My message to G7 leaders is clear: while the economic picture is uncertain everywhere, rich countries cannot ignore the fact that more than half the world — the vast majority of countries — are suffering through a deep financial crisis.”</p>
<p>The UN secretary-general added:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a systemic and unjust bias in global economic and financial frameworks in favor of rich countries, which is naturally generating great frustration in the developing world.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Rich countries recovered from the economic impact of the pandemic with expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. Trillions and trillions were spent. Basically, they printed money and spent their way out of trouble,” Guterres continued. “But developing countries, many with substantial debts, were unable to do so. If they did, they would have seen their currencies sinking.”</p>
<p>Emphasizing “the needs for reform of the international financial system,” the UN secretary-general explained that “the Bretton Woods system and the Security Council reflect the power relations of 1945.” However, he stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>This has changed. The economy has grown &#8230; The global financial architecture became outdated, dysfunctional, and unfair.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;What I believe is clear. It’s that there is a growing conscience in developed countries — and I felt it in the G7 — that not enough is being done, both to reform outdated institutions and, at the same time, to &#8230; remove the frustration of the Global South [Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania] by an effective policy of solidarity with the Global South,&#8221; the UN secretary-general concluded.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you agree with the UN secretary-general that the current financial system is “outdated, dysfunctional and unfair”? Let us know in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

Russia’s head of state now wants his government to cap such purchases on the domestic forex market. </strong></p>
<h2>President Putin Orders Russian Authorities to Limit Foreign Currency Purchases</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has tasked the federal government and the central bank in Moscow to introduce a $1 billion monthly limit on the purchase of foreign currency meant to be used in transactions with entities and individuals in other countries.</p>
<p>According to an <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/acts/assignments/orders/71178" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> by the Kremlin, the restrictions will apply to Russian residents buying other nations’ currencies in the domestic foreign exchange market for transfers abroad within government-approved settlements, the RIA Novosti news agency reported.</p>
<p>The order is part of instructions issued after a meeting on economic matters held on April 11 but published only last week. The measures will affect transactions crediting “accounts opened with banks located outside the territory of the Russian Federation.”</p>
<p>The deadline for imposing the limit has been set at June 1, 2023. Putin also asks the Bank of Russia and the Ministry of Finance to draft a list of cases in which the restriction would not apply.</p>
<p>Russia has been dealing with heavy Western <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-expands-unprecedented-global-sanctions-on-russia-with-over-300-new-targets/">sanctions</a> imposed in response to its invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022, including freezing of its foreign currency reserves abroad and restricting its access to banking and financial services.</p>
<p>To prevent shortages of convertible currencies like the U.S. dollar and the euro as well as flight of capital, Russian authorities introduced foreign <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-banks-told-to-track-crypto-related-transactions-amid-currency-restrictions/">currency restrictions</a> last spring and have been considering ways to circumvent the sanctions, including by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/de-dollarization-has-already-started-says-russias-foreign-minister-lavrov/">de-dollarization</a> of international trade and working on <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-actively-working-on-swift-alternatives-foreign-ministry-official-says/">SWIFT alternatives</a>.</p>
<p>Moscow has been also taking steps to legalize cross-border <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-russia-to-test-international-crypto-payments-with-companies/">crypto payments</a>. In November, Putin himself called for international settlements based on blockchain and digital currencies. In mid-May of this year, the head of the parliamentary Financial Market Committee, Anatoly Aksakov, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-companies-actively-using-crypto-russia-to-adopt-4-relevant-laws-official-says/">unveiled</a> that Russian lawmakers are preparing to adopt four bills related to cryptocurrencies by the end of July.</p>

As of the time of writing, 552 blocks have been confirmed since the incident. Despite the onchain resolution provided by Dash Core 19.1.0, individuals have expressed complaints regarding mining on a different chain.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Complaints Arise as Dash Network Restarts Block Production</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
On May 22, 2023, the Dash blockchain halted block production at chain height <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dash-blockchain-halts-after-upgrade-attempt-possible-fork-detected/">1,874,879</a>. As of the time of writing, the current block height stands at <a href="https://blockchair.com/dash/blocks">1,875,431</a>. Samuel Westrich, CTO of Dash Core Group, addressed the community on May 23 at 11:52 a.m. Eastern Time.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;We are approaching 80% of network updated to v19.1.0,&#x201D; Westrich <a href="https://twitter.com/SamWestrich/status/1661037312149716993?s=20">tweeted</a>. &#x201C;Chain locks are forming again. Thanks to the quick response by Masternode Owners the Dash network is fixed and stable again.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Currently, the Dash network boasts an estimated dedicated hashrate of approximately 3.77 petahash per second (PH/s). On Tuesday, the leading Dash mining pools were Poolin, Viabtc, and F2pool. However, after the 19.1.0 fix, not all individuals were satisfied with the situation. <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DASH/">Dash (DASH)</a> is currently trading for $43.39 per unit, down 0.34% over the past 24 hours.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
One person <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveSokolowsk2/status/1660966394404519936?s=20">asserted</a> that the incident constituted a rollback, resulting in costing &#x201C;Prohashing&#x2019;s miners huge amounts of lost money.&#x201D; The individual said that Dash was not immutable like bitcoin, and he would be &#x201C;reviewing whether to continue using or mining Dash in any way.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you were mining <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DASH" 312026  target="_blank">DASH</a> on X11 yesterday, please see the following forum post for information on a hard fork issue that occurred yesterday: <a href="https://t.co/0kMb9coXll">https://t.co/0kMb9coXll</a></p>
<p>&#x2014; PROHASHING (@ProHashing) <a href="https://twitter.com/ProHashing/status/1660977875892183040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The Twitter account known as &#x201C;Dash Community&#x201D; issued a response to the individual&#x2019;s accusation, <a href="https://twitter.com/Dash_Community/status/1660972518604427264?s=20">stating</a>: &#x201C;This is not true. Dash did not roll back the blockchain and no transactions were lost. All that happened was the [transaction]&#x2019;s were delayed being added to the blockchain and the v19 hard fork was postponed.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Westrich also replied to the rollback comment and <a href="https://twitter.com/SamWestrich/status/1661066663297712128?s=20">remarked</a>:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>Rolling back a chain happens when there is consensus on mined blocks. In this case there was not consensus. Less than 1/4th of the network agreed that chain was correct. A chain lock on Dash makes a block immutable and this chain received no chain locks.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
The individual remained dissatisfied with the comments made by the Dash Community Twitter account and Westrich&#x2019;s statement. He <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveSokolowsk2/status/1660984628830781440?s=20">insisted</a> the mining pool Prohashing &#x201C;mined lots of blocks after restarting its daemons to fix the stuck blockchain.&#x201D; Additionally, in response to Westrich&#x2019;s remark, the person <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveSokolowsk2/status/1661070026374299656?s=20">stated</a>, &#x201C;Regardless of the network design, there&#x2019;s still a major problem here. We&#x2019;ve never had another coin where you just restart the daemon and it wastes hundreds of dollars.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Upon receiving the complaints, a Dash Core developer named Pasta extended an apology to the miner. &#x201C;Sorry you [and] Prohashing had these issues,&#x201D; Pasta <a href="https://twitter.com/DashBoost_Pasta/status/1661060127175196675?s=20">wrote</a>. &#x201C;We were trying to reach out to all the mining pool that we could; we noticed immediately once a pool started mining invalid blocks.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In addition, the Dash network is anticipated to experience a reward reduction in around 30 days. The reduction, which is similar to a halving but not a half cut, will see rewards reduced from 2.76371046 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DASH" 312026  target="_blank">DASH</a> to 2.56630257 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DASH" 312026  target="_blank">DASH</a>. The Dash reward reduction is expected to occur on or around June 23, 2023.&#13;<br />

<h2>FTX&#8217;s Revival Prospects Surface as New CEO Explores Reboot Plans and Bidder List</h2>
<p>The current CEO and main restructuring officer of FTX appears to be examining the possibility of relaunching the exchange, as indicated by a court document detailing the company&#8217;s staff and compensation report for the period from April 1, 2023, to April 30, 2023. This isn&#8217;t Ray&#8217;s initial mention of such a plan, since he discussed rebooting in his <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-ftx-ceo-discusses-possibility-of-rebooting-defunct-crypto-exchange-in-first-interview-since-taking-over/">first interview</a> following FTX&#8217;s collapse in mid-January 2023.</p>
<p>In April, FTX&#8217;s present operators uncovered <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-finds-7-3-billion-in-liquid-assets-lawyers-consider-rebooting-shuttered-crypto-exchange/">$7.3 billion in liquid assets</a>, and legal professionals debated resuming the exchange later as a potential means to restructure its debt. It seems that Ray has been engaging with certain organizations to assess relaunch possibilities. For example, on April 4, Ray deliberated an &#8220;exchange fortification&#8221; proposal with cybersecurity firm Sygnia.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-589879 size-full" title="Bankrupt Crypto Exchange FTX Continues to Explore Potential Relaunch, Court Records Reveal" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bidder22222.jpg" alt="Bankrupt Crypto Exchange FTX Continues to Explore Potential Relaunch, Court Records Reveal" width="1280" height="80" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bidder22222-300x19.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bidder22222-1024x64.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bidder22222-768x48.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bidder22222.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Ray examined a &#8220;2.0 next steps&#8221; summary and a &#8220;2.0 reboot of exchange material&#8221; on April 14 and April 19. The court record also references a &#8220;2.0 bidder list,&#8221; implying that the restart endeavor could be sold to another cryptocurrency market player.

As part of the settlement, Bitcoin of America will pay $86,000 in restitution, and the firm will be required to cease operations in Connecticut.</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto ATM Operator Bitcoin of America Settles with Connecticut Regulator</h2>
<p>2023 has been a challenging year for the crypto ATM industry. General Bytes, a prominent ATM manufacturer, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/major-cryptocurrency-atm-manufacturer-general-bytes-hacked-over-1-5m-in-bitcoin-stolen/">experienced a hack</a>, resulting in a loss of $1.5 million. Moreover, digital currency ATMs across the United States have been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-with-highest-number-of-closed-bitcoin-atms-in-negative-growth-year/">rapidly shutting down</a>.</p>
<p>In February, the United Kingdom <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/uk-police-raid-crypto-atm-sites-regulator-says-no-crypto-atms-have-been-approved/">initiated crackdowns</a> on crypto ATM operators, conducting raids on various sites. The enforcement on unauthorized crypto ATM operators was further <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/uk-widens-crackdown-on-unauthorized-crypto-atms/">expanded</a> by the U.K. the following month.</p>
<p>Connecticut&#8217;s Department of Banking <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/DOB/Newsroom/2023/Banking-Commissioner-Announces-Settlement-with-Bitcoin-of-America">recently announced</a> that Bitcoin of America will be discontinuing its crypto ATM business in the state. According to the banking regulator, four consumers in Connecticut were allegedly scammed out of tens of thousands of dollars through the use of these kiosks.</p>
<p>“This case highlights the need to be cautious when using virtual currency kiosks,” the state’s banking commissioner Jorge Perez stated. “Scammers are preying upon consumer’s vulnerabilities and tricking them into depositing cash into kiosks, which can be found throughout the state. The department is taking steps to be sure that the owners and operators of these kiosk are properly licensed and adhere to the law.”</p>
<p>The complaint additionally states that Bitcoin of America was obligated to pay a settlement of $86,000 for consumer losses in Connecticut. The banking regulator asserts that Bitcoin of America was &#8220;mandated to obtain a money transmitter license.&#8221;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the banking regulator provided specifics that it has collaborated with the Connecticut State Police to advance a bill known as <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2023/BA/PDF/2023HB-06752-R01-BA.PDF">HB 6752</a> — &#8220;An Act Concerning Digital Assets.&#8221; This bill would grant the banking commissioner of Connecticut the authority to establish regulations pertaining to the virtual currency industry.</p>

This platform update introduces a suite of new features and an improved user experience, including the expansion of yield farming opportunities with support for Bitcoin.com&#x2019;s Verse DEX decentralized exchange.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first farming opportunity to be launched under this collaboration is the </span><a href="https://app.harvest.finance/ethereum/0xf7754c2Bb15e565D185eF6378fbE1D23c3A5e065"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VERSE-ETH farm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, swiftly followed by the anticipated launches of WBTC/<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> and USDC/<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> farms.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvest 3 is the first to offer farming opportunities on Verse DEX with the unique ability for users to utilize any token in their wallet as liquidity. </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Users also benefit from Harvest&#x2019;s auto-compounding feature which optimizes farming yields. By pooling assets and streamlining network costs, Harvest enables anyone to maximize returns while minimizing gas expenses.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To enhance the user experience, Harvest incorporated the </span><a href="https://www.joinwido.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wido</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Router, enabling users to effortlessly deposit any token into any Verse farm. There is no need for LP tokens, as the Wido Router efficiently handles the conversion of a user&#x2019;s token into the corresponding LP and subsequently deposits it.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To improve transparency, Harvest 3 offers detailed APY, Balance, and TVL charts, allowing users to preview them in different time frames and gain insight into the historical performance of their investments.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, dedicated farm URLs have been implemented to facilitate tailored campaigns for Harvest and its partners, driving targeted traffic and boosting marketing efforts for each farm.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to these features, Harvest is intensifying its focus on Arbitrum by integrating Arbitrum farms within the native app and unveiling plans to extend its flagship token, iFARM, and bootstrap liquidity on the Arbitrum network.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As Harvest&#x2019;s vaults transition to the ERC-4626 standard, the platform becomes more composable with the broader DeFi ecosystem. Harvest Finance continues to lead the way in delivering innovative and accessible DeFi solutions, with no lock-up periods or withdrawal constraints. Users can effortlessly access and manage their funds while enjoying the benefits of Harvest 3&#x2019;s enhanced features and capabilities.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#13;<br />

Additionally, similar to the BRC20 token economy, the Bitcoin Stamps concept has provided users with the ability to mint fungible tokens with a standard called SRC20.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Stamps Inch Closer to 50,000; SRC20 Tokens Enter the Picture</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
While there has been significant attention on <a href="https://ordinals.com">Ordinal inscriptions</a> and the BRC20 economy, the Bitcoin Stamps trend is still relatively unknown. As of May 23, 2023, there are currently 46,578 Bitcoin Stamps recorded on the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> blockchain, approaching the 50,000 milestone. The current number of stamps can be viewed at <a href="https://stampchain.io/">stampchain.io</a> and <a href="https://www.rarestamp.xyz/0">rarestamp.xyz</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a href="https://www.rarestamp.xyz/collection">Popular collections</a> include the Pixel Gods, 3GGS, Eternai Rare, Stamp Punks, Stamp Wizards, Stamp Pepes, Stamp Pepes Not, and Classic Arcade. These collections have been available for a considerable period and are sold through rarestamp.xyz&#x2019;s marketplace. A new concept has recently emerged alongside the Bitcoin Stamps trend, known as <a href="https://stampchain.io/src20/">SRC20</a> tokens. Similar to BRC20s, this <a href="https://crypt0biwan.github.io/src20/">token concept</a> enables users to mint fungible token supplies using the technology.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;SRC20 is a bleeding edge protocol on Bitcoin Stamps,&#x201D; the website stampchain.io details. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re working hard to build indexing tools and form partnerships with marketplaces. However, it is early. You&#x2019;re not going to see these tokens in your wallet just yet.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Rarestamp.xyz offers an <a href="https://www.rarestamp.xyz/minting/src20">SRC20 minting page</a> on its web portal, allowing users to issue a token supply, and assign a ticker symbol. Stampchain.io also offers an <a href="https://stampchain.io/src20/">SRC20 minting tool</a>. According to statistics, there are currently over <a href="https://stampsrc.github.io">300 SRC20 stamps</a> available today. Some of the SRC20 tokens include coins like &#x201C;kevin,&#x201D; &#x201C;stamp,&#x201D; &#x201C;pepe,&#x201D; &#x201C;bobo,&#x201D; &#x201C;shib,&#x201D; &#x201C;punks,&#x201D; and &#x201C;rare.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
At this time, there is no available data on the market valuation of the SRC20 token economy, while the BRC20 economy is valued at <a href="https://brc-20.io">$447 million</a>. Furthermore, alongside BRC20s and SRC20s, the token standard <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/drc20-tokens-take-dogecoin-community-by-storm-driving-record-breaking-daily-transactions-on-the-network/">DRC20</a> has been developed on the Dogecoin network. Stampchain.io says that a community member built a basic indexer for the coins but it cannot guarantee the accuracy of the tool.&#13;<br />

The meme coin rose by as much as 2% in today&#x2019;s session, as the global crypto market cap surged by the same amount. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> was another notable gainer today.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Shiba inu (SHIB) rose to a multi-week high in today&#x2019;s session, as bullish sentiment returned to cryptocurrency markets.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a low of $0.000008759 to start the week, SHIB/USD jumped to a peak of $0.000009067 earlier in the day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As a result of the move, SHIB climbed to its strongest point since May 10, when price hit a high of $0.00000930.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
One of the catalysts of the surge appears to be a breakout which took place on the relative strength index (RSI).&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The index moved beyond the ceiling of 40.00, and as of writing is now tracking at 40.83.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Should bulls continue to control sentiment, there is a chance they target an upcoming ceiling of 46.00 on the index.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a></h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> was another notable gainer on Tuesday, as prices rebounded from a key support level.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a>/USD rose to an intraday high of $315.21 in today&#x2019;s session, 24 hours after hitting a low of $309.13.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Overall, this recent run, which has seen <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> climb for two consecutive days, comes after a failed breakout of a floor at $302.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Due to today&#x2019;s uptrend, the RSI is now on the verge of colliding with a key resistance of 49.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As of writing, the index is tracking at 48.95, with earlier bulls possibly preparing to take profits.&#13;<br />
