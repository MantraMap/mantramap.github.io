This followed a &#8220;successful&#8221; meeting between French President Emmanuel Macron and Chinese President Xi Jinping.</strong></p>
<h2>China and France to Strengthen Relations</h2>
<p>State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang held talks with French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Catherine Colonna in Paris last week, according to a statement by China&#8217;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>According to the Chinese foreign ministry, both Qin and Colonna view French President Emmanuel Macron’s state visit to China as “a complete success,” stating that the French leader &#8220;had an in-depth exchange of views with President Xi Jinping during his visit to China and deepened his understanding of China.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Chinese foreign minister stated: “China is ready to work with France to follow through on the important common understandings reached by the two heads of state, accelerate the advancement of exchanges and cooperation in various fields, work for continuous development of the close and enduring comprehensive strategic partnership between China and France.” He emphasized, “China’s resolve to promote high-quality development and high-standard opening up is unwavering,” elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>China stands ready to work with France and other countries to make the pie of cooperation bigger and share development opportunities.</p></blockquote>
<p>“China has always regarded Europe as a comprehensive strategic partner, consistently and unequivocally supported Europe in strengthening its strategic autonomy and playing an active role in the international arena, and advocates that the China-Europe relationship is not targeted at any third party, nor is it subjugated to or controlled by any third party,&#8221; Qin continued. “China, France and the EU should pursue win-win cooperation by expanding two-way opening up and build a more stable China-EU supply chain partnership of mutual trust.”</p>

<p>The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs further detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>France-China relations are of vital importance. The two heads of state have made clear the direction, and the two sides should make joint efforts to work for greater development of bilateral relations.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the ministry, France places significance on its economic relations with China, considering them as “interdependent, mutually beneficial as well as complementary, open, and transparent.” Additionally, the ministry stated that Colonna expressed France&#8217;s willingness to strengthen communication with China on “major international and regional issues to seek more common ground.”</p>

<h2>Harvard Professor of Economics Kenneth Rogoff on U.S. Default and Global Financial Crisis</h2>
<p>Harvard economics professor Kenneth Rogoff shared his view on the U.S. economy, a possible U.S. default, and a global financial crisis in an interview with ET editor Srijana Mitra Das, published Thursday. Rogoff is a professor of Economics and Maurits C. Boas Chair of International Economics at Harvard University. From 2001–2003, he served as Chief Economist and Director of Research at the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>He was asked whether the current U.S. debt crisis and its potential default could &#8220;bring back the risks of a global recession.&#8221; Rugoff replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>Absolutely. The risks exist anyway but if this worsens, it could pose a global financial crisis. I hope it won’t come to that — but it’s a very perilous situation and we are in unknown waters.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Generally, when you navigate government spending, you consider one bill at a time. You look over all its details and then negotiate how to work these out,” he explained. However, he stressed that the Republicans are trying to get everything all at once, emphasizing that “No country runs its fiscal policy that way.”</p>
<p>He cautioned: “Typically, these negotiations do get resolved at midnight but there is a two to three percent chance at the moment here that we will discover what a U.S. default looks like.”</p>

<h2>How the U.S. &#8216;Defaulted&#8217; in the Past</h2>
<p>Rogoff further detailed that the U.S. has “defaulted” in the past but “in a different way.” One example was in the early 1930s when American debt used to be payable in gold. President Franklin Roosevelt changed the gold price from $20 to $35. “We defaulted on the gold clause while we paid the debt in dollars, which was worth a lot less,” the Harvard professor noted.</p>
<p>Another example was “after the Revolutionary War when the U.S. was forming,” the economics professor described. “Alexander Hamilton, the first secretary of the U.S. Treasury, only paid some of the inherited colonial debt,” Rugoff explained, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve also had high inflation recently — so, if you’re a U.S. debt holder, the value of your holding has reduced markedly in the last two years. That is a kind of default since you weren’t expecting the loss of value but it is much less disruptive than this situation which is like facing a black hole.</p></blockquote>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that the Treasury may not be able to pay all of the government’s bills as early as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-warns-us-could-default-on-its-debt-by-june-1/">June 1</a> “if Congress does not raise or suspend the debt limit before that time.” However, some believe that raising the debt ceiling will make the problem worse, including economist <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-us-will-default-on-its-debt-raising-debt-ceiling-will-make-problem-worse/">Peter Schiff</a>.</p>
<p>Like Yellen, the Congressional Budget Office similarly warned that the government could default on its debt in the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-government-faces-significant-risk-of-default-in-june-congressional-budget-office-warns/">first two weeks of June</a>. The IMF cautioned last week that a U.S. default would have &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/imf-warns-of-very-serious-repercussions-if-us-defaults-on-debt-obligations/">very serious repercussions</a>.&#8221; Meanwhile, former President and 2024 presidential candidate <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/donald-trump-urges-republicans-to-let-us-default-on-debt-if-democrats-dont-agree-to-spending-cuts/">Donald Trump</a> has urged Republican lawmakers to let the U.S. default on its debt if the Democrats do not agree to spending cuts.</p>

Druckenmiller’s forecast comes as American consumer spending remains low, and is largely driven by credit card usage. Druckenmiller, a seasoned investment mogul, warns that it would be foolish to ignore the possibility of a &#8220;really, really bad&#8221; scenario unfolding.</strong></p>
<h2>Druckenmiller Cites Drop in Consumer Spending and Banking Industry Turmoil as Recession Indicators</h2>
<p>At the 2023 Sohn Investment Conference in San Francisco, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/stan-druckenmiller-bitcoin/">Stanley Druckenmiller</a> sounded the alarm on the U.S. economy. While others may be optimistic about a &#8220;soft landing,&#8221; the seasoned hedge fund manager is bracing for impact, <a href="https://www.westernstandard.news/news/thomas-us-on-the-brink-of-recession-canada-will-follow/article_8a0327ec-f02e-11ed-b734-23c27a4ce8f5.html">predicting</a> a &#8220;hard landing&#8221; instead.</p>

<p>Druckenmiller, who has enjoyed 30 years of success in the hedge fund industry, cited the <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/there-goes-us-consumer-card-data-reveals-first-drop-household-spending-two-years-upper">sharp drop in consumer spending</a> and the recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/analysts-warn-of-more-bank-failures-possible-recession-and-global-repercussions-caused-by-first-republic-bank-collapse/">banking industry turmoil</a> as key factors behind his forecast. Druckenmiller&#8217;s warnings about the U.S. economy are echoed by other notable figures in the financial world.</p>

<p>Other famed investors, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/billionaire-barry-sternlicht-warns-of-hard-landing-says-economy-is-going-to-implode/">Barry Sternlicht</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-david-rosenberg-warns-of-crash-landing-and-recession-citing-fed-data/">David Rosenberg</a>, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/billionaire-bond-king-jeffrey-gundlach-warns-of-painful-outcomes-in-next-recession/">Jeffrey Gundlach</a>, have also expressed concerns about a &#8220;hard landing&#8221; in the United States. At the Sohn conference, Druckenmiller elaborated on his prediction, citing rising unemployment, a 20% drop in business profits, and a surge in bankruptcies as key indicators of a recession.</p>
<p>However, he was quick to clarify that he doesn&#8217;t anticipate a crisis worse than the 2008 financial meltdown. Druckenmiller said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am not predicting something worse than 2008. It’s just naive not to be open-minded to something really, really bad happening.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Druckenmiller Remains Optimistic About Post-Recession Opportunities</h2>
<p>While some experts, such as Goldman Sachs Global Investment <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/gs-research/2023-us-economic-outlook-approaching-a-soft-landing/report.pdf">Research</a> and Wendy Edelberg of The Hamilton Project, are <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/2023/03/23/are-we-headed-for-the-soft-ish-landing-projected-by-cbo-and-the-fed/">predicting</a> a &#8220;soft landing&#8221; for the U.S. economy, Druckenmiller has an entirely different outlook. Druckenmiller is bracing for a recession, but he&#8217;s also optimistic about the future.</p>

<p>In fact, he believes that there will be &#8220;unbelievable opportunities&#8221; in the coming years, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Druckenmiller sees the post-recession landscape as a fertile ground for innovative technologies and cutting-edge solutions “present themselves.”</p>
<p>Druckenmiller stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>AI is very, very real and could be every bit as impactful as the internet — AI could eventually spawn $100-billion [in] companies.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the Sohn Investment Conference, Stanley Druckenmiller didn&#8217;t mince words when it came to his opinion of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s current policy. Druckenmiller believes that the U.S. central bank has exhausted its resources in the fight against inflation and recession. &#8220;We basically wasted all our bullets,&#8221; he lamented.</p>

The cumulative value of NFT sales amounted to $149.31 million from April 29 to May 6, 2023. Nevertheless, the most recent week exceeded anticipations, as sales skyrocketed by 31.22%. Throughout the seven-day interval, NFT sales attained $208.17 million. The substantial rise in this week’s NFT sales can be credited to the appearance of NFTs originating from the Bitcoin blockchain.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin-Based NFT Sales Gain Significant Momentum</h2>
<p>Bitcoin NFT sales have emerged as a key contributor in the digital collectible sales landscape, among 21 distinct blockchains as per <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io">cryptoslam.io data</a> documented on May 14, 2023. Ethereum NFT sales continued to reign supreme with $111.26 million in NFT sales; however, the runner-up position was held by Bitcoin-based NFTs, also known as Ordinal inscriptions.</p>

<p>Data demonstrates that Bitcoin NFT sales secured $53,433,451 and clinched the second-place position regarding blockchain sales out of the 21 chains. Bitcoin&#8217;s NFT sales leaped by 187.54% compared to the prior week.</p>

<p>Mythos blockchain&#8217;s NFTs also experienced a sizable boost as NFT sales climbed by 69.66% to claim $11.73 million this previous week. The ascent propelled Mythos into the third-largest rank considering top blockchains by NFT sales volume.</p>
<p>Solana, which formerly occupied the second-largest spot, now stands at fourth in terms of NFT sales per blockchain. In the last seven days, Solana recorded $8,789,106 – a reduction of 21.16% compared to the previous week. The fifth blockchain with the greatest sales volume for this past week was Polygon’s $7.79 million, decreasing by 7.07%.</p>

<p>Regarding NFT collections, cryptoslam.io data discloses that &#8220;Uncategorized Ordinals,&#8221; essentially random Ordinals not part of any collection, achieved the top collection status in sales this week. Uncategorized Ordinals managed to register $15.62 million in NFT sales.</p>
<p>Ethereum&#8217;s Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) claimed the second spot this week with $13.80 million in overall sales within the past seven days. The Mythos chain&#8217;s Dmarket collection secured third place, and the majority of Mythos&#8217; NFT sales stemmed from the Dmarket collection&#8217;s transactions.</p>

<p>In fourth place, ORDI BRC-20 NFTs documented $11,044,110 in weekly sales, while Ethereum&#8217;s Milady Maker NFT collection amassed $10,376,102 in sales during the identical timeframe and ranked fifth this week. A notable climber this week concerning NFT sales was Bitcoin-based Space Pepes with $4,607,834 accrued over the past seven days – a spike of 2,142.35% compared to the previous week.</p>
<p>Moreover, a single NFT from the series was sold for $4.5 million, making it the most expensive sale of the week. Interestingly, the remaining top five most valuable NFT sales in the past week all belonged to the Uncategorized Ordinals category.</p>

As the battle against inflation in the U.S. rages on, the Biden administration appointed Philip Jefferson as the new vice chair to replace Lael Brainard. The American president stated that his nominees will play a &#8220;crucial role&#8221; in maintaining price stability and overseeing the country&#8217;s financial institutions.</strong></p>
<h2>Fedwatch Tool Points to Low Chance of Rate Hike</h2>
<p>Just over a week ago, on May 3, 2023, the U.S. central bank <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-raises-interest-rate-by-25bps-insists-us-banking-system-is-sound-and-resilient/">raised</a> the federal funds rate to 5.25% after a quarter-point rate hike. Fed chair <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-chair-warns-of-uncertain-and-adverse-consequences-of-us-debt-default-wed-be-in-uncharted-territory/">Jerome Powell</a> was quick to emphasize that inflation was still a major concern and that the FOMC was committed to bringing the inflation rate back down to the 2% target. However, the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.htm">report</a>, released on May 10, revealed that over the past 12 months, &#8220;the all items index increased 4.9%.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last Friday was a <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/markets">rough day</a> for the stock market, with the S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite, and Russell 2000 Index all closing in the red. The <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/">crypto economy</a> has also been experiencing a downward trend, while precious metals like gold and silver have been <a href="https://www.kitco.com/market/">trading sideways</a>.</p>
<p>The next FOMC meeting is shaping up to be a nail-biter, with the latest data from the CME Fedwatch tool <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html">indicating</a> that there&#8217;s an 84.5% chance the interest rate will remain unchanged. However, there&#8217;s also a slim chance of a quarter-point rate hike to 5.50%, with the Fedwatch tool showing a probability of roughly 15.5%.</p>

<h2>Biden&#8217;s New Fed Vice Chair Faces High Expectations</h2>
<p>Forbes journalist Simon Moore <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2023/05/13/what-to-expect-from-the-feds-next-meeting/?sh=55f8bce2fd29">reports</a> that most policymakers favor keeping interest rates at their current level, according to the latest data from March. However, Moore says a few believe rates should be closer to 6%, and one participant predicts rates will not remain at their current level by the end of the year.</p>
<p>According to the reporter, the question on every market investor&#8217;s mind is whether or not the central bank will pivot this year. In addition to the expectations concerning the next FOMC meeting, president Joe Biden has also made some <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/12/president-biden-announces-nominees-to-the-federal-reserve-board-of-governors/">major changes</a> to the Fed&#8217;s leadership.</p>

<p>With fresh blood at the helm, many are wondering how this will impact the central bank&#8217;s policies and priorities moving forward. Powell will now have a new second-in-command as president Biden appointed Philip Jefferson as the new vice chair. Biden stated that Jefferson was confirmed by the Senate with a strong bipartisan vote of 91-7 and stressed that he looks forward to his &#8220;swift confirmation&#8221; as vice chair.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/12/biden-names-historic-fed-picks-as-inflation-fight-wears-on-00095468">Reports</a> suggest that Jefferson is aligned with Powell&#8217;s efforts to curb inflation and is unlikely to push back against the Fed&#8217;s current policies.</p>

On May 7, 2023, the number of unconfirmed transactions reached an all-time high of over 500,000 transfers, causing a major backlog. However, as of today, that number has been reduced to 263,406. Currently, 184 blocks need to be cleared to process the majority of transactions that are still stuck in the network&#x2019;s mempool. </strong></p>
<h2>Congestion Woes Ease on Bitcoin Network</h2>
<p>The long queue of transactions is finally starting to subside as bitcoin miners have started catching up with some of the backlog. As we <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-network-starts-to-clear-congestion-onchain-fees-drop-by-90/">reported</a> three days ago, Bitcoin.com News noted the beginning of the congestion-clearing process, with unconfirmed transactions dropping from over 500,000 on May 7 to just above 300,000 on Thursday, May 11.</p>

<p>According to mempool.io statistics, high-priority transactions were priced at $3 per transfer, while low-priority transactions cost $2.23 per transfer at that time. <a href="https://archive.ph/V6rfE">Current statistics</a> on May 14 show that onchain fees have significantly subsided on the Bitcoin blockchain over the past three days. Just a few days ago, a high-priority transaction would have cost $3, but today, that fee has dropped to $0.83.</p>

<p>A medium-priority transfer is now priced at $0.79, while a low-priority transaction can cost around $0.75. This is a significant improvement, with high-priority onchain fees sliding by 72.33% over the past 72 hours. Additionally, the number of unconfirmed transactions stuck in the queue has reduced to 263,406, which is just above half of what it held on May 7.</p>

<h2>Lightning Network Capacity and Channels Drop</h2>
<p>On May 9, the number of transactions was around <a href="https://archive.is/Qgg6l#selection-1875.1-1875.8">413,420</a>, which means that 36.28% of the backlog has been cleared in the past five days. While fees skyrocketed to roughly $30 per transaction on May 7 and have been quite volatile lately, the <a href="https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-capacity">Lightning Network&#x2019;s capacity</a> did not improve. In fact, the number of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> locked into the Lightning Network dropped from 5,463 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> on May 5 to today&#x2019;s capacity of 5,415 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> on May 14.</p>

<p>The dip indicates that roughly $1.28 million in value left the Lightning Network amid the transaction backlog chaos. On May 8, the Lightning Network boasted <a href="https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-channels">73,352</a> unique channels. However, that number has since decreased to the current <a href="https://mempool.space/lightning">71,286</a> unique channels. According to mempool.space&#x2019;s Lightning Network metrics, roughly 5,057 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> in capacity is on clearnet, while 253 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> of capacity is using Tor. The remaining Lightning Network capacity is identified as &#x201C;other.&#x201D;</p>

For merchants, Web3 payments come with the added benefit of what Miller called protection from &#8220;fraudulent chargebacks.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Payments Trump Traditional Payment Methods</h2>
<p>To back his assertions, Miller claimed many of the merchants that are presently experimenting with or encouraging their customers to use Web3 payments are doing so because they are seeking a better deal than what they are getting from traditional payment providers.</p>
<p>Miller, however, conceded that Web3 payments are still at their infancy stages and as such they come with certain limitations which hinder their adoption. In his written responses to questions from Bitcoin.com News, Miller also highlighted the security challenges that users of Web3 payment methods must expect. In addition, the Fuse senior executive also reiterated the argument that self custody of private keys is the most ideal and safe method of storing one&#8217;s digital assets.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin.com News (BCN): What are Web3 payments and why should online merchants care about Web3 payments at all?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Robert Miller (RM):</strong> Web3 payments refer to payments made using cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Online merchants should care about Web3 payments because they offer several benefits over traditional payment methods.</p>
<p>Firstly, cryptocurrency payments are faster and more secure due to the immutable nature of blockchain technology. Secondly, they have lower transaction fees, which can significantly increase a merchant&#8217;s profit margins. Thirdly, they allow for global reach and expand the customer base beyond geographic locations. Fourthly, accepting cryptocurrency payments can increase customer loyalty, as cryptocurrency enthusiasts prefer to support merchants who accept their preferred form of payment. Finally, in a world where money is being reinvented, accepting Web3 payments can enhance a merchant&#8217;s brand image as an innovative business that values cutting-edge technology and customer privacy.</p>
<p>Using a Web3 payments solution, we’re cutting off the middleman to our transactions – the banks, the payment processors, and the brokers. Web3 payments are entirely peer-to-peer and are built on trustless logical systems, meaning no one has to rely on a third party to facilitate the transaction. More vitally, businesses and online merchants allow instantaneous, borderless transactions with low fees depending on the amount sent or received.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: Can you explain why an online buyer should opt for crypto payments over say Visa, Stripe or other traditional payment methods that are supported by merchants?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> Buyers should do whatever is most beneficial to them as a consumer at the time. If the offer is the same as yours and you prefer to use Visa, then you should use Visa. The merchant, in this case, will pay 3.5% on the transaction. Consider a business doing $1M/year in revenue &#8211; this is a potential $35,000 in Visa transactions fees alone, which is an insane amount of money.</p>
<p>This is why merchants are increasingly opting to experiment with Web3 payments, often offering discounts or loyalty programs through NFTs or tokens to encourage consumers to use the payment option that helps them save money and enhance the user experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p><strong>BCN: The Bitcoin network has of late seen the number of unconfirmed transactions climb to over 200,000, something that has pushed the average network fee to nearly $20. Some have said such high fees render moot the argument supporting the use of crypto as a means of payment. Do you agree with this assertion?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> The high fees and long confirmation times of Bitcoin transactions have been a source of criticism for the cryptocurrency. However, it&#8217;s important to note that Bitcoin was not designed primarily as a payment system, but rather as a decentralized store of value.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s true that the high fees and slow transaction times may make Bitcoin less attractive for small and everyday transactions, there are still many use cases where it can be valuable. Additionally, there are other cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks that are specifically designed for fast and low-cost transactions, such as Fuse, Polygon and Binance Smart Chain. These networks are more suitable for payment use cases.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: Your blockchain project Fuse is said to be aiming to enable seamless and affordable crypto payments in daily life. From your standpoint, what do you think are the benefits of accelerating the mainstream adoption of Web3?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> When big companies like Starbucks, Nike, Adidas, and Mcdonald&#8217;s announce plans to experiment with Web3 payments, they typically throw down a multi-million dollar POC (proof of concept) budget and assign a dedicated team to run the project without it necessarily impacting other parts of the business in a big way. SMBs and startups cannot do this. So how do they ensure they participate in the paradigm shift of money?</p>
<p>Fuse provides simple-to-deploy, end-to-end integrated products, including a wallet SDK, ready-to-use APIs, and mobile wallet tools and infrastructure to level out the planning field and ensure that businesses that are the backbone of the economy can play a role.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: What advantages do Web3 native solutions such as yours have over those offered by giants like Visa, Paypal, and Stripe?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> The future of digital payments lies in Web3 payment services. They offer a range of benefits over legacy payment systems, including reduced transaction fees, faster settlement times, increased security, borderless payments, and greater transparency and privacy. As Web3 payments continue to gain traction and become more widely adopted, they have the potential to transform the way we conduct transactions, making them more efficient, secure, and accessible.</p>
<p>Compared to traditional point-of-sale (POS) systems, accepting crypto payments offers several benefits, including lower transaction fees, merchant protection from fraudulent chargebacks, increased sales potential, and increased customer convenience. Additionally, there is a level of anonymity with crypto payments that some merchants and customers may find appealing.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://fuse.io">Fuse</a> ecosystem includes 100 integration partners and has been built over three years to provide vital services and infrastructure designed to create a robust platform for mainstream crypto and Web3 payments adoption.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: Your startup is said to have recently launched a $10 million Ignite Funding Program. What is the purpose of this fund and who are the intended beneficiaries?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> As part of our ongoing mission to bring Web3 payments to mainstream business adoption, we are dedicated to supporting both real-world and defi projects. The Ignite program comprises two main funding areas. The first is an on-chain defi incentives fund of $10 million, designed to improve the general financial health of the fuse ecosystem. The second is to support early-stage real-world builders on Fuse. The strong on-chain economic activity supports innovation aligned with our north star of achieving mainstream crypto adoption with payments. Innovation, in turn, supports strong economic growth and activity, creating a fly-wheel effect.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: Just like any technology that is still in its infancy stages, Web3 payment platforms are susceptible to security threats and high costs. What is your word of advice for those using Web3 payment solutions for the first time?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RM:</strong> Web3 payments are still in their early stages and have certain limitations that must be considered before using them. Web3 payments may be prone to security threats and high transaction costs as several networks are yet to deal with these issues successfully. Luckily, Fuse does not have these issues and can process transactions in under 5 seconds for a cost of less than a cent.</p>
<p>Furthermore, acceptance by merchants is still a challenge, and there is a lack of understanding of the importance and impact of blockchain-related concepts. Scams and fraudulent activities occur everywhere, and staying safe and vigilant is essential while dealing with Web3 payment solutions. Never share private keys, double-check wallet addresses and networks before sending any crypto, and look out for scams or fake sales on social media.</p>
<p>Additionally, centralized exchanges may disappear and take your crypto with them, so owning your keys and using non-custodial wallets is vital. Finally, taxation is essential, and everyone dealing with Web3 payments must know how it is taxed in their region.</p>

The agency is providing the Ukrainians access to a Chainalysis tool as well as specialized training to Ukrainian law enforcement.</strong></p>
<h2>IRS Offers Ukraine Tools From Chainalysis to Trace Russian Blockchain Transactions</h2>
<p>The criminal investigation division of the United States Internal Revenue Service announced it’s stepping up collaboration with counterparts abroad as part of efforts to identify persons and entities evading Western sanctions.</p>
<p>The agency revealed it’s working with blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis and Ukrainian investigators to track Russians who might be using cryptocurrencies to conceal their assets amid financial restrictions imposed over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>According to a report by Bloomberg, the IRS is sponsoring Ukraine’s access to a Chainalysis tool facilitating crypto-related probes. It has also organized training sessions for the country’s law enforcement, both virtual and in-person, on tracing blockchain transactions.</p>
<p>These efforts are expected to improve information-sharing and case development between the U.S. and Ukraine, the revenue service explained in a statement. Commenting on the cooperation, IRS Criminal Investigation Chief Jim Lee emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sharing tools not only safeguards the U.S. financial system, but the global economy.</p></blockquote>

<p>Authorities around the world have issued warnings that sanctioned countries like the Russian Federation and Iran may be using crypto to bypass international restrictions. Another Bloomberg report recently revealed that the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-reportedly-investigated-in-us-for-russia-sanctions-violations/">facing an investigation</a> by the U.S. Justice Department over suspected violations of Russia sanctions.</p>
<p>According to Michael Gronager, co-founder and chief executive of Chainalysis, crypto is still too illiquid to support mass sanctions evasion but this does happen on a smaller scale. Work to establish how much Russian oligarch money is flowing through Ukraine is continuing, he added.</p>
<p>Gronager also noted that cryptocurrency is playing an unprecedented role in the war through <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ukraine-raises-more-crypto-than-russia-in-year-of-war-analysis-unveils/">donations</a> in support of both sides. Around $5 million have been transferred this way to approximately 100 pro-Russia groups over the past year, he pointed out as an example. Most crypto assets sent from wallets sponsoring Russia reach centralized exchanges, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/most-crypto-sent-from-wallets-sponsoring-russia-in-ukraine-war-reaches-cexs-binance-research-shows/">research</a> showed in March.</p>
<p>Ukraine and the United States have been working together on other crypto-related fronts. Supported by U.S. law enforcement, Ukrainian police disrupted a network of crypto exchange services suspected of laundering criminal proceeds from ransomware attacks and fraud schemes, announcing the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ukraine-us-shut-down-9-cryptocurrency-exchanges/">shutdown</a> of 9 of such platforms earlier in May.</p>

Meanwhile, Russian companies are already using digital assets in cross-border settlements, the official noted.</strong></p>
<h2>Russian Legislature to Vote on Crypto Laws by End of July</h2>
<p>The State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, plans to adopt four crypto-related laws during its spring session which ends on July 30, according to Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the parliamentary Financial Market Committee.</p>
<p>The bills are tailored to regulate cryptocurrency <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-parliament-postpones-adoption-of-crypto-mining-bill/">mining</a>, cross-border crypto payments, taxation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital assets</a>, and liability for their illegal use, the lawmaker detailed, quoted by the Interfax news agency. He emphasized that the draft laws are well thought through.</p>

<p>Aksakov remarked that large Russian companies are already actively using cryptocurrency in foreign trade settlements, but they want to see legislation outlining the legal framework for such transactions. Speaking at the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum, he stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now we have come to the point where four bills are in the stage of practical adoption … It is quite possible that we will adopt all the laws in the spring session.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anatoly Aksakov also said that the authorities want to take into account the opinions of market participants regarding tax rules. “Most likely, the norms applicable to DFAs will be taken into account as much as possible here, since this is a similar instrument,” he elaborated.</p>

<p>The law “On Digital Financial Assets” (<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/digital-assets-for-1-billion-rubles-issued-in-russia-in-a-month/">DFAs</a>), which went into force in January 2021, covers only some crypto-related activities, in particular those that involve digital assets with an issuing entity, like tokenized traditional assets or utility tokens, for example.</p>
<p>At the same time, transactions with decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are yet to be comprehensively regulated in Russia. Pressed by Western sanctions over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian authorities have stepped up their efforts in this direction.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you think Russia will regulate crypto transactions by the end of July? Tell us in the comments section below. </strong></em></p>
