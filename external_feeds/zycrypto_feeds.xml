<p>Solana, one of the largest “Ethereum Killers”, has surpassed the latter to become the network with the most transactions.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Nansen shared a <a href="https://twitter.com/nansen_ai/status/1653581937620164609">tweet</a> comparing April&#8217;s most active on-chain addresses. According to the firm, Solana came in second after BNB Chain, becoming the network with the most active address by chain at 5.1 million in April.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-4-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80473" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-4-1024x576.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-4-300x169.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-4-768x432.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-4.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>And despite that figure dropping by around 12% from March, the cryptocurrency network still managed to outdo Ethereum, which had 4.9 million active addresses in April.</p>



<p>Solana also surpassed Ethereum by non-vote transactions last month. Non-vote transactions are transactions that do not involve any voting or decision-making by token holders. They typically involve the transfer of cryptocurrency between wallets or accounts and are the most common type of transaction on most blockchain networks due to their simplicity. According to Nansen data, as of April 30, Solana’s total non-vote transactions stood at 24.3 million compared to Ethereum’s 974,972.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="705" height="663" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80474" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-5.png 705w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-5-300x282.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px" /></figure>



<p>Solana’s attractive growth can be attributed to various factors, including a surge in developers and users due to its attractive transaction speeds and costs. Apart from announcing various developments that go into improving the network, including a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sol-jumps-over-8-as-solana-makes-groundbreaking-entry-into-ai-with-chatgpt-plugin/">Chat GPT plugin</a> and a web3 phone, Solana’s ballooning transactions have also been propelled by NFTs.</p>



<p>Recently, Mad Lads, a new project launched on Solana, became the most traded collection generating $17 million compared with $11 million for Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club collection during the last week of April. This is despite the Solana facing a major setback following the exit of y00ts and DeGods,&nbsp;two of its most popular collections, earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Launched roughly a month ago, Mad Lads is a unique type of NFT that falls in a category called xNFTs. Ideally, xNFTs combine the features of traditional NFTs and executable code, meaning users can use them to conduct other activities such as gaming and chatting.</p>



<p>That said, Solana&#8217;s native token SOL has <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-predicts-why-solana-could-bounce-back-even-better/">also performed well</a>, soaring by over 116% since January 1. This is compared to Bitcoin, up 70%, and Ether, up just over 50% year-to-date.</p>



<p>At press time, SOL was trading at $21.47, down 3.36% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. On the other hand, Ether rose by 1.66% in the same period and was exchanging hands at $1,851.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cardano’s transaction volume surges to new highs not recorded in past months as the wider market also witnesses improved activity.&nbsp;</li>



<li>ADA’s price plunged further after losing its stance going below the $0.4 mark in May, trading at $0.38.</li>



<li>The future of Cardano’s development looks strong as the network rolls our new upgrades in preparation for the much anticipated Voltaire era.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-whales-are-taking-no-days-off-as-ada-transactions-hit-rooftop/">Cardano</a> (ADA) has been debated within crypto circles due to its huge developments lined up this year, coupled with a huge leap in price. </p>



<p>Transaction volumes on Cardano have been up this week together with the total number of active wallets on its network. According to a recent report by Input Output Global, the organization responsible for the network’s growth, Cardano processed 65.4 million transactions in the past seven days.</p>



<p>The network has also recorded a massive inflow of new wallets bringing the total number of wallets to over 4 million as of March 2023. The volatility of ADA this past month has been a significant concern for pundits despite the latest wins in transaction volume.</p>



<p>The current trend can be linked to reports of increased <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-primed-for-massive-boom-as-ada-whales-network-activity-heats-up/">whale activity</a> on the network. The accumulation of coins in whale addresses points to a growth in the confidence of bigger players, which often ignites bull runs.</p>



<p>Cardano’s futures market is also showing bullish signs as increased transactions are recorded on the network. According to a chart from IntoTheBlock, transaction volume fell below 10B ADA in January before growing above 20B ADA.</p>



<p>ADA currently exchanges hands at $0.38 and has surged by a staggering 58% this year, with bulls expecting more gains to clear huge losses in the bear market. Although the year has been good, ADA is still 49% down from May 2022.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-community-can-feel-voltaire">The community can feel Voltaire</h2>



<p>Voltaire, described as the last phase of Cardano’s evolution, primarily aims to create a completely decentralized decision-making platform. Among the developments to flag off Voltaire is the Conway Ledger and CIP-1694.</p>



<p>CIP-1694 improved the governance of the network, making it more decentralized with any user having powers to submit governance actions which will go through three groups: The Constitutional Committee, Delegation of Representatives, and Stake Pool Operators.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the Ledger Team has added new technologies, including Plutus v3, in addition to the Haskell Code and API receiving new updates.</p>

<ul>
<li>Balaji Srinivasan has settled a high-stakes BTC bet he made in March by donating $1.5 million to charity and similar projects.&nbsp;</li>



<li>He bet on what he termed a buzz of “<em>hyperbitcoinization” </em>sweeping the financial markets in the United States.</li>



<li>With the safe haven narratives springing up once more, Srinivasan landed blows on fiat as they “<em>head towards hyperinflation.”&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Balaji Srinivasan took his Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiasm to the next level by making a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/black-swan-author-nassim-taleb-weighs-in-on-balajis-1-million-bitcoin-price-prediction/">controversial bet</a> on the future price of Bitcoin in March. </p>



<p>On May 2, Srinivasan, an investor and former CTO of Coinbase announced that he has settled the bet he entered into by mutual agreement. He will now donate $1.5 million and states that it was done to prove a point because of the bad shape of the economy.</p>



<p>In March, Srinivasan coined the term “<em>hyperbitcoinization” </em>to describe the potential mass adoption that will flock to web3 due to a rapid change in global finance. The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/former-coinbase-cto-makes-massive-bet-that-bitcoin-will-rampage-past-1-million-within-90-days/">bet was made</a> with Twitter web3 pundit James Medlock with the terms that should BTC fail to hit $1 million within 90 days, Srinivasan would pay $1 million in USD Circle.</p>



<p>From the mutual agreement, Srinivasan would donate $500,000 to Give Directly, $500,000 to Medlock, and another $500,000 to BTC core developers. Settling the bet ahead of time he <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1653449321185169409?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">stressed</a> that he did so for the public good while criticizing public finance experts for not being reliable anymore.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“So, I settled the bet ahead of time and donated even more than I had committed. I spent my own money to send a provably costly signal that there’s something wrong with the economy and that it&#8217;s not going to be a ‘soft landing’ like Powell [Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell] promises but something much worse,” </em>he added.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hyperinflation-claims-could-drive-btc-adoption">Hyperinflation claims could drive BTC adoption</h2>



<p>Pundits have tipped Bitcoin as a store of value to counter fiat inflation when things get bad. Srinivasan is among those commentators and has stressed that the American economy will hit hyperinflation, making Bitcoin a safe haven.</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-maximalist-matthew-kratter-asserts-1-million-value-for-btc-counters-balajis-forecast/">He estimates</a> a potential BTC market cap of $19.3 trillion after the period of hyperbitcoinization. Bitcoin currently has a market cap of $548 billion and exchanges for $28,325, which means, according to his projection, BTC will skyrocket by 3,369% to hit $1 million per coin. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-3-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80442" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-3-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-3-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-3-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-3-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-3-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>While many have called this a long shot, in 2013, BTC was valued at $122, meaning the market leader surged over 23,000% in the last decade.</p>

<p>Business intelligence firm MicroStrategy has vowed to continue purchasing Bitcoin, despite cryptocurrency prices fluctuating wildly of late.</p>



<p>This assertion was made by Phong Le, Chief Executive Officer of MicroStrategy, while announcing the firm’s Q1 financial results Monday. </p>



<p><em>&#8220;As you all know, our strategy is to acquire and hold Bitcoin, and we plan to continue to accumulate Bitcoin over time using our excess cash and with the net proceeds of capital markets transactions,&#8221;</em> said Le during the earnings call noting that Microstrategy&#8217;s core business is not impacted by near-term Bitcoin price fluctuations.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;We remain committed to our Bitcoin acquisition strategy with a high degree of conviction,&#8221;</em> he added.</p>



<p>MicroStrategy has had a long-term focus and a risk-managed approach for its Bitcoin strategy. Since 2020 the firm has continued to purchase Bitcoin, with the most recent foray being for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategy-spends-29-million-buying-more-bitcoin-as-btc-eyes-30000/">1045 Bitcoins</a> earlier last month. Microstrategy currently holds 140,000 Bitcoins with an aggregate cost of $4.2 billion or an average of approximately $29,800 per Bitcoin. This makes MicroStrategy the world&#8217;s largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Le also reassured investors of the firm’s financial health, noting that it had repaid its $205 million Bitcoin-backed loan from Silvergate last year at a 22% discount. In March, MicroStrategy disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it used part of the proceeds from a $339.4 million public sale of its shares to pay back the loan.</p>



<p>According to Le, following the repayment, MicroStrategy recovered 34,619 Bitcoins that were serving as collateral for the loan, which is now unencumbered. As of March 31, 2023, only 11% of MicroStrategy&#8217;s total Bitcoin holdings were pledged as collateral for debt.</p>



<p>MicroStrategy&#8217;s decision to invest heavily in Bitcoin has been controversial, with some investors expressing concerns about the cryptocurrency&#8217;s volatility. However, Michael Saylor, now the company’s Executive Chairman, has remained bullish on Bitcoin, saying it&#8217;s “100% better than gold”. He has also argued that Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation and a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty.</p>



<p>That said, despite MicroStrategy&#8217;s Bitcoin stash remaining in the red for roughly a year, its bold investment has recently paid off handsomely, with the holdings <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategys-bitcoin-stash-now-in-the-green-as-crypto-assets-soar/">increasing in value</a> as the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price surged in recent months. According to ‘Saylor Tracker’ a service that tracks MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin purchases, the firm’s Bitcoin stash value is currently at a loss of $203 million. That said, it remains to be seen whether Bitcoin prices can rise for those holdings to turn green or if the cryptocurrency will continue plunging.</p>



<p>At press time, BTC was trading at $28,762, up 2.08% in the past seven days, as per CoinMarketCap data. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization traded mostly flatly Tuesday, gaining only 0.53% in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>As the crypto world eagerly awaits District Judge Analisa Torres&#8217;s ruling in the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-john-deaton-highlights-4-likely-outcomes-in-ripple-vs-sec-suit-as-case-takes-surprising-turn/">landmark case</a> between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs, pro-XRP attorney John E. Deaton is hinting that the San Francisco-based enterprise blockchain company could agree to new settlement terms. Deaton, however, emphasized that this will depend on the ruling in the lawsuit.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-expert-s-opinion-regarding-a-likely-ripple-sec-settlement"><strong>Expert’s Opinion Regarding A Likely Ripple-SEC Settlement</strong></h2>



<p>John Deaton has taken to Twitter to highlight various scenarios that could influence Ripple’s decision on whether or not to settle.</p>



<p>Deaton’s comments come amid chatter among the community of a secret meeting between Ripple and the SEC. In his opinion, the terms of a potential settlement would depend on the specifics of the outcome of the ongoing litigation.</p>



<p>One important consideration would be whether leading U.S.-based digital assets exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken would immediately restart XRP trading on their platforms or wait for a possible appeal by the SEC. Coinbase delisted XRP in January 2021, immediately after the SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">launched </a>its lawsuit against Ripple. Despite vocal appeals by the XRPArmy, Coinbase has remained unmoved.</p>



<p>Another key consideration would be whether major Ripple partner, Bank of America, would feel comfortable about the court verdict or wait to see if Judge Torres gets overturned in the event the SEC appeals her decision.</p>



<p>Deaton notes that the SEC could possibly file a notice of appeal and later withdraw it, leaving room for more negotiations.</p>



<p>The XRP amicus curiae also pinpointed a theoretical scenario in which the U.S. securities regulator told Ripple it would issue a public statement that all future sales of XRP don’t constitute securities and not appeal Judge Torres’ ruling if the payments firm agrees to pay $50 million. Deaton says, in this case, Ripple boss Bradley Garlinghouse would swiftly sign off on the settlement as this would provide the certainty the company has long clamoured for and return liquidity to the U.S. market.</p>



<p>Still, if Judge Torres rules that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripples-q1-2023-xrp-markets-report-shows-xrps-super-bullish-trajectory-despite-sec-lawsuit/">Ripple</a> did not violate federal securities laws and subsequently revives liquidity to U.S. markets without causing businesses to worry about being in the SEC’s crosshairs if they utilize the XRP cryptocurrency, then Ripple will ultimately decide to refrain from a settlement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After two gruelling years in the Southern District of New York, a ruling in the XRP lawsuit could further define what crypto assets are considered securities in the United States.</p>

<p>Could digital asset firms be facing a de-banking crisis? Potential coordinated efforts to de-bank the digital asset ecosystem are being investigated by CryptoUK, the Blockchain Association (BA), and now three Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee.</p>



<p>On March 21, 2023, CryptoUK wrote letters to the Financial Conduct Authority and the Payment Systems Regulator over concerns about the increasing number of new blanket bans and restrictions on transfers from United Kingdom (U.K.) banks to crypto asset platforms as well as seeking potential solutions. CryptoUK is an independent industry body that works directly with policymakers and market players to identify and promote use cases for digital and crypto assets.</p>



<p>CryptoUK is concerned that other banks and Payment Services Providers would take similar action. CryptoUK said that these actions had the potential to undermine the Government’s ambition to become a crypto asset hub.</p>



<p>On March 16, 2023, the Blockchain Association (BA) submitted a request for information from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve System (Fed), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) over potential de-banking of crypto firms in the United States.</p>



<p>The Blockchain Association is a collective voice of industry players promoting blockchain technology. The BA also requested impacted crypto industry participants to submit any de-banking allegations for further investigation.</p>



<p>On April 14, 2023, the Blockchain Association submitted additional information requests to Investigate the de-banking of Crypto Firms to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).</p>



<p>On April 25, 2023, three Republican members of the United States House of Representatives Financial Services Committee sent letters to the heads of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, seeking information on possible coordinated efforts taken against digital asset firms.</p>



<p>The information requested related to compliance by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on the Interpretive Letter #1179 issued in November 2021 on whether it was permissible for national banks and Federal savings associations to engage in certain crypto-related activities.</p>



<p>The US lawmakers also requested information on the compliance to a January 2023 joint statement on crypto-asset risks to Banking Organizations issued by the Fed, the FDIC, and the OCC that banking organizations need to be aware of.</p>



<p>The debate on the coexistence of digital asset firms and banking organizations appears far from over.</p>

<p>Coinbase today announced the launch of a global derivatives platform as the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange faces harsh regulatory crackdown at home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new facility, Coinbase International Exchange (CIE), follows regulatory approval from the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) and will start trading by listing bitcoin and ether perpetual futures.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-coinbase-rolls-out-offshore-perps-exchange-with-5x-leverage"><strong>Coinbase Rolls Out Offshore Perps Exchange With 5X Leverage</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase has set up shop in Bermuda as it battles regulators in the U.S., its home market.</p>



<p>The firm said Tuesday that it would allow international clients to trade perpetual futures out of Bermuda via an application programming interface (API) in eligible, non-U.S. jurisdiction. Dubbed Coinbase International Exchange, the new venture will not be open to U.S. users.</p>



<p>The platform will first let traders bet on the price of Bitcoin and Ether through so-called perpetual futures with leverage capped at 5%. All trading on the new platform will be settled in the USDC stablecoin.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Very excited to see <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@coinbase</a> International Exchange launch.  Highly competitive, excellent execution and product quality, and USDC as the sole native digital dollar used for funding, collateral and trading.

</div></figure>



<p>The move marks Coinbase’s latest foray into crypto perps trading, one of the most popular sectors accounting for nearly 75% of global crypto trading volume in 2022, according to a blog post by the firm.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional futures, where buyers and sellers are forced to enforce the deal on a specified date despite the prevailing market conditions, perpetual futures don’t have an expiration period, meaning that traders can hold their positions infinitely.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Regulatory Shakeup In The U.S.</strong></h2>



<p>There have been recent headwinds in the regulatory regime in the U.S. Coinbase has been publicly feuding with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since the watchdog agency <a href="https://zycrypto.com/insider-trading-former-coinbase-employee-pleads-guilty-to-charges-as-sec-clamps-down-on-the-cryptosphere/">charged </a>former Coinbase product manager Ishan Wahi and his brother Nikhil with insider trading in July 2022 — and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-action-against-coinbase-triggers-ballistic-reaction-from-crypto-community/">sent </a>the exchange a Wells Notice in March.</p>



<p>The publicly-traded company emphasized that it is still committed to the United States, but noted that countries across the globe are increasingly moving forward with responsible, crypto-forward regulatory rulebooks as they endeavor to fortify their positions as themselves as hubs for crypto.</p>



<p><em>“We would like to see the U.S. take a similar approach instead of regulation by enforcement, which has led to a disappointing trend for crypto development in the U.S.,” Coinbase stated. “The Coinbase International Exchange is an expansion, bringing the safest, most trusted name in crypto to the global market.”</em></p>



<p>The ongoing regulatory crackdown in America has forced other exchanges to expand overseas. Bittrex recently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-community-in-shock-as-bittrex-exchange-shuts-down-u-s-operations/">shuttered </a>its stateside operations shortly before being sued by the SEC. And today, rival Gemini also announced that it would offer derivatives trading to customers in 30 countries and territories.</p>

<p>After performing moderately well in April, albeit all the FOMO and regulatory scares, Bitcoin stepped into May with its head down, dropping over 5% during the first half Monday, May 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>



<p>Over the past six or so weeks, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has had difficulties pushing above the $30,000 resistance range despite showing a lot of strength in the first week of April as such price has been trapped in a tight squeeze.</p>



<p>Various market pundits have been trying to project Bitcoin’s behaviour this month, even as the cryptocurrency’s fundamentals <a href="https://zycrypto.com/data-highlights-massive-btc-accumulation-by-whales-as-extreme-fear-grips-bitcoin-price/">continue improving</a>. According to seasoned markets analyst Peter Brandt, Bitcoin currently sits on a &#8220;huge significance&#8221; level. On Saturday, Brandt noted that the price had reached the upper band of a range pattern, stating that a decisive break out of a particular range could significantly impact Bitcoin&#8217;s future.</p>



<p>According to Brandt, the current range pattern suggests that there is a certain price level that Bitcoin has struggled to surpass in the past two years. However, if Bitcoin breaks above this level, it could signal a major shift in the market.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;The confining range has been in place for some time now, but a decisive breakout would have huge significance,</em> “he said, adding, <em>“My bias is that Bitcoin will bury all pretenders eventually. There will be only one &#8216;King of the Hill&#8217;, and it will be Bitcoin.”</em></p>



<p>And Brandt is not alone in his analysis. Caleb Franzen, a research analyst at Cubic Analytics, also noted that Bitcoin needs to break out decisively or get rejected at its current range before he can make any major decisions.</p>



<p>“<em>People are predicting that Bitcoin dominance will skyrocket. Here&#8217;s my take: I don&#8217;t know yet b/c we haven&#8217;t seen a decisive breakout or rejection on this range. Once we get clarity around this major resistance level, I&#8217;ll listen to what the market is telling me,”</em> Franzen tweeted Sunday.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="575" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1024x575.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80395" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1024x575.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-300x168.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-768x431.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image.png 1430w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Today, crypto pundit “Titan of Crypto” shared a Bitcoin % Dominance chart, forming a monthly “W bullish structure”. According to him, the structure suggests dominance could soon break out of the range. He further noted that if April’s monthly candle closes above the range (which it has), Bitcoin’s dominance could increase, tagging along with the price. He, however, warned that as Bitcoin’s season starts, “alts might suffer a bit.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, as the week starts, some analysts expect Bitcoin to falter further due to the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting Wednesday, which will likely raise interest rates by 25 basis points.</p>



<p>At press time, Bitcoin was trading at  $28,110, down 4.45% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin’s weekly average transactions reached its highest point since Dec 2017, totalling about 396,000 this past week, according to IntoTheBlock.</li>



<li>This stat comes after Bitcoin Ordinals hit a daily mint record of 223,000 in April, with text-based inscriptions dominating the network.</li>



<li>Grayscale and several other firms have backed the Ordinals project to shape the bullish trend of Bitcoin in Q2 2023.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/ordinals-project-surpasses-11000-nft-mints-in-weeks-amid-criticisms-from-bitcoin-maxis/">Bitcoin (BTC) Ordinals</a>, popularly referred to as Bitcoin non-fungible tokens (NFTs), are steering a new pathway for the growth of the Bitcoin network despite the harsh criticism from a section of the community in its development phase.</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s average weekly transactions have hit levels not recorded in six years, according to new data from crypto analytics firm IntoTheBlock. On Sunday, the seven-day <a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1652553421323399171?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">average</a> of BTC stood at 396,000, its highest mark since Dec 2017.</p>



<p>The surge in transaction volumes can be linked to the rising popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals, a project launched five months ago amid widespread criticisms. Daily inscriptions on Ordinals hit a new record on Saturday with over 223,000 NFTs, according to a Dune report.  </p>



<p>This daily figure above 200,000 was the first after showing string signs in April, breaking its record four times, including 72,000 daily inscriptions and 193,000 inscriptions on April 2 and April 23rd, respectively. </p>



<p>Text-based Ordinals inscriptions also dominated the ecosystem compared to image-based which differs from the popular Ethereum NFT model. On Saturday, out of the 233,000 inscriptions 99.,8% were text-based, while 273 inscriptions, 0.1, were image-based.</p>



<p>Within its first five months, the total number of Bitcoin Ordinals crossed 2 million on April 26 and further passed 2.5 million Ordinals 2 days later.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-path-for-bitcoin">A new path for Bitcoin</h2>



<p>Despite criticisms from Bitcoin Maxis and other commentators on the development of NFTs on the Bitcoin network, the Ordinal project has proved doubters wrong, with many tipping marking it as ‘instrumental’ in the next bull run.</p>



<p>Digital asset investment firm Grayscale has marked increased miner fees and developer enthusiasm as two positive ways Ordinals could impact the network.</p>



<p>“<em>The advent of ordinals has led to an increase in total fees paid to miners, which could potentially establish a sustainable baseline level of transaction fees to incentivize miners,” </em>the firm wrote.</p>



<p>The total amount now paid to miners stands at $6.6 million at press time, giving miners the necessary boosts at survival. The firm also believes the project would be key to attracting a new user base to the network, just like NFTs in Ethereum.</p>



<p>“<em>We believe the emergence of ordinals is likely to promote a development-oriented community and culture in support of the Bitcoin network.”</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Digital asset exchanges have recorded a net inflow of 17,500 ETH worth about $375 million a few days after the Shanghai upgrade.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Coinbase has recorded $28 million worth of ETH sales since allowing its users to apply for their staked assets following the upgrade.&nbsp;</li>



<li>ETH surged past $2,100 days after Shapella before falling below $2,000, leaving both bullish and bearish analysts at loggerheads. </li>
</ul>



<p>Ethereum (ETH) slipped from its 11-month high above $2,100, now struggling below $2,000 with more users accessing their staked assets on exchanges.</p>



<p>According to recent data from CryptoQuant, a total of 1,101,079 ETH were deposited into digital asset exchanges, while 921,579 ETH was withdrawn in four days post-Shanghai. The net inflow of 179,500 tokens between April 13 to 17 becomes the largest recorded in a four-day window.</p>



<p>Huge transfers of assets to exchanges are an indicator of investors&#8217; preparation to sell, which reduces the asset’s value, although this is not always the case.</p>



<p>The Shanghai upgrade, also known as Shapella, was implemented on the Ethereum network on April 12, giving validators access to their staked assets and rewards for the first time since the Merge event of last year, which transitioned it to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network. </p>



<p>With over 18 million ETH worth approximately $36 billion staked on the network, several analysts expected a price drop as validators get access to their assets for the first time in months. The reverse happened after ETH hit an 11-month high above $2,100.</p>



<p>A price drop below $2,000 coupled with investors transferring assets to exchanges may have a bearish outlook to many. However, several others opine that in the long run, more assets will be staked following Shanghai.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-withdrawals-expected">More withdrawals expected&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Sequel to the price jump of ETH days after the upgrade, users sold their assets across several platforms. Coinbase, among the first exchanges to give users access to their staked assets following the upgrade, has recorded over $28 million in sell orders. </p>



<p>Due to the legal challenges, Kraken faced with the SEC leading to a $30 million settlement, including shutting down its staking service, Kraken now leads the de-staking queue. On-chain data shows that the exchange leads the pack with over 60% of withdrawal requests. </p>



<p>Digital asset market research platform Kaiko stated that as Binance now allows users to withdraw staked assets, it could “<em>result in more sale pressures.”</em> On April 19, Binance began processing user requests to withdraw staked ETH on its platform. </p>

<p>On April 27, Ripple released the <a href="https://ripple.com/insights/q1-2023-xrp-markets-report/">Q1 2023 XRP Markets Report</a>, highlighting several key developments in the crypto industry. Below are the key takeaways from the report.</p>



<p>XRP sales by Ripple saw a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/metrics-point-to-strong-bullish-cases-for-xrp-in-2023-as-landmark-ruling-in-ripple-v-sec-lawsuit-nears/">massive increase</a> in Q1 2023, with net sales reaching a whopping $361.06 million compared to the previous quarter&#8217;s $226.31 million. And that&#8217;s not all – XRP Ledger on-chain activity also experienced a surge, with decentralized exchange volumes increasing by 34% to $115 million in Q1 compared to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripples-on-demand-liquidity-soars-to-record-highs-as-xrp-army-eager-to-receive-verdict-on-sec-lawsuit/">Q4 2022</a>. Meanwhile, XRP&#8217;s average daily volume on centralized exchanges jumped 46% to $1 billion from $698 million.</p>



<p>But the excitement doesn&#8217;t stop there. The EU, UK, and UAE have proposed new regulatory frameworks for crypto that could change the game for the entire industry. The Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA) has been <a href="https://zycrypto.com/industry-leaders-upbeat-as-eu-parliament-passes-much-anticipated-mica-regulation/">passed</a> in the EU, resulting in a brand new licensing regime in the 27 member states. The UK government has introduced comprehensive regulatory proposals for a new regulatory regime for crypto, building on prior proposals focusing on stablecoins and the financial promotion of tokens. And in the UAE, a new law governing virtual assets has been passed, setting up the country’s initial regulatory regime for cryptocurrencies at the federal level.</p>



<p>Despite the broader financial turmoil, XRP markets saw an impressive 46% increase in volumes in Q1, likely due to a combination of market recovery and large volatile events that tend to spike volumes. BTC and ETH spot volumes were up 12% and down 12%, respectively, QoQ, while derivatives volumes for BTC and ETH were up 14% and 20%, respectively, QoQ.</p>



<p>Regarding global regulation, several countries are moving forward with new legislation and licensing regimes to clarify crypto. Australia’s central bank and Treasury held private meetings with international crypto industry executives on the nation&#8217;s future of crypto and regulation. Hong Kong and Australia also opened public consultations on proposed requirements for virtual asset trading platform operators and token mapping.</p>



<p>The US&#8217;s approach to crypto regulation focused on regulation by enforcement instead of rulemaking, as Coinbase and Paxos received Wells notices from the SEC alleging various securities laws violations and lack of registration. SEC Chair Gensler issued a broad warning to yield-earning crypto platforms to comply after Kraken shuttered its staking service, to which Commissioner Peirce denounced her agency&#8217;s actions.</p>



<p>In Q1, Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature, and Credit Suisse faced critical blows, revealing the extent of the opacity and interconnectedness across global financial and crypto markets. The fall of SVB and the unexpected shutdown of Signature Bank meant that much of the crypto world was de-banked in the US overnight. USDC had a short-term liquidity-driven de-peg down to $0.85 on some exchanges, recovering to $1 within a few days, but market confidence in essential on-off ramps was shaken.</p>



<p>Despite the turmoil, those who build on a battle-tested foundation of prudent risk management and real-world utility will continue growing once the world emerges from the current climate. Macro uncertainty is set to continue in Q2, but many in the industry have lauded Europe&#8217;s efforts to regulate crypto responsibly.</p>



<p>And last but not least, developers have proposed a new interoperability standard (XLS-38d) for the XRP Ledger, enabling users to transfer digital assets and data between blockchains regardless of underlying protocol or programming language. The future is looking bright for XRP and the crypto industry as a whole!</p>

<p>Despite being off to a good start this month, Ethereum has witnessed a significant pullback.</p>



<p>Mid this month, the cryptocurrency surged to a ten-month high of $2,140 thanks to the hype around the Shapella upgrade before collapsing by roughly 17%. Nonetheless, whereas such pullbacks are historically appreciated, especially considering investors often “buy the rumour and sell the news”, some signs suggest it might be a temporary decline.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sharks-and-whales-splurge-on-ether"><strong>Sharks And Whales Splurge On Ether</strong></h2>



<p>According to crypto analytics firm Santiment, there has been significant growth in the number of whales and sharks in the past 12 months. In a Friday <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1651707112505090048">tweet</a>, the firm noted that there are now 380 more addresses holding 1,000 or more Ethereum (ETH) compared to last year, representing a 5.7% rise in large-volume investors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="633" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-23-1024x633.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80350" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-23-1024x633.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-23-300x186.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-23-768x475.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-23-356x220.png 356w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-23-712x440.png 712w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-23.png 1428w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In the past, such high accumulation levels have often signalled significant price movements, typically in a favourable direction. Additionally, this surge in accumulation usually occurs at the same time as price bottoms.</p>



<p>The increase in ETH whales and sharks can be attributed to the current market conditions. Ethereum&#8217;s price is still 60% down since its all-time high in May 2021, creating a prime opportunity for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/institutional-staking-for-ethereum-soars-post-shanghai/">institutional investors</a> and high-net-worth individuals to accumulate more of the digital asset at a discounted price.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Liquid Staking Soars</strong></h2>



<p>Moreover, the overall market volatility and the recent Shanghai upgrade have resulted in a noteworthy change in investor attitude towards Ethereum, recognizing the blockchain network&#8217;s potential for the future. On April 28, crypto analytics firm IntoTheBlock shared the chart below showing that liquid staking derivatives have been on the rise post-Shanghai. This week, Lido and RocketPool saw significant gains in ETH staking market share, while several US-based CEXes experienced declines.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="925" height="654" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-22.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80349" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-22.png 925w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-22-300x212.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-22-768x543.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-22-100x70.png 100w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-22-200x140.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px" /></figure>



<p>Furthermore, data from Dune Analytics shows that investors have deposited over 571,000 ETH tokens worth over $1 billion into staking contracts. According to crypto analysts, most of these deposits were made through institutional staking service providers and also from investors reinvesting their rewards after withdrawing them.</p>



<p>With Shanghai behind, investors are even more stoked about what lies ahead for the world&#8217;s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Apart from numerous upgrades aimed at improving the scalability, security, accessibility and efficiency of Ethereum, developers seem to be stopping at nothing to tackle one of the network&#8217;s biggest problems-gas fees.</p>



<p>Builders have been focusing on scaling solutions such as the zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM), which allows some data (particularly signatures) not to be included on-chain, saving on gas costs. In a recent <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/03/31/zkmulticlient.html">blog</a>, Vitalik Buterin noted that “the first steps of the transition may happen sooner than we expect” once we switch to Verkle trees and clients start gradually using ZK-EVMs.</p>



<p>At the time of reporting, Ether was trading at $1,906, up 0.43% in the past 24 hours. The price needs to surge and close above the $2,100 resistance for more upside. </p>

<p>The SEC may have played its cards wrong in its move against <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripples-chief-legal-officer-explains-reason-for-absence-of-xrp-in-the-liquidity-hub/">Ripple</a> about three years ago, J.W. Verret, associate professor of law at George Mason Law School, has said.</p>



<p>In an interview with Crypto Law founder and pro-Ripple lawyer John Deaton, Verret expressed his admiration for Ripple’s defence team, particularly praising CEO Brad Garlinghouse for his determination to face the SEC head-on.</p>



<p><em>“I don’t think they saw that coming,</em> and I think they probably expected there would be a settlement,<em> and I think they underestimated the fight inside of Brad,”</em> Verret said on Thursday when asked about his opinion as to why the SEC picked the fight with Ripple.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>I’ve learned there’s a lot of sand inside that fella, and I admire that. And he’s doing a service for everyone in crypto,”</em> he added.</p>



<p>And Verret might be right. In a July 2022 interview, Brad Garlinghouse recognized the financial burden that the company had faced due to its ongoing legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time, Garlinghouse revealed that Ripple&#8217;s legal expenses might exceed $100 million by the time the lawsuit concludes. He, however, expressed his commitment to carry on, noting that the expenses are worth it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-supreme-court-could-tame-sec-s-overreach-on-crypto"><strong>Supreme Court Could Tame SEC’s Overreach on Crypto</strong></h2>



<p>Meanwhile, Verret further shared his thoughts on <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-john-deaton-highlights-4-likely-outcomes-in-ripple-vs-sec-suit-as-case-takes-surprising-turn/">what lies ahead</a> as the high-stakes securities lawsuit continues. According to him, no matter how it resolves, there&#8217;s a good chance it&#8217;ll be appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) by both parties.</p>



<p>The pundit, however, suggested that the crypto industry would stand to gain more if the matter is resolved by the highest court, noting that judges there would offer a remedy to all the regulatory uncertainty brought by regulators.</p>



<p><em>“I think it’s a perfect fit if you (ripple) are willing to go the distance to go SCOTUS. I think the supreme court will be willing to&nbsp; take a look at crypto and use the SEC&#8217;s overreach in this area as a vehicle to transform administrative law itself,” </em>he went on.</p>



<p>During a separate interview on the Unchained Podcast Friday, Verret noted he expects the lawsuit to conclude in the district court “relatively soon, in a matter of months or weeks.” According to him, Ripple could lose or win based on the fair notice defence, in which case it wouldn&#8217;t have a lot of implications for the rest of crypto” and the SEC lets it lie. However, if the firm wins on the Howey test, the SEC is “certainly going to appeal,” he said.</p>

<li>Venture Capital firm Andreessen Horowitz has stressed that the government’s stance toward cryptocurrency regulation in the country is stifling innovation in the industry.</li>



<li>The United States, home to 40% of digital asset developers in 2018, has seen that number slide below 30% in 2022. </li>



<li>The firm tips clearly defined regulations and an approach by regulatory agencies that protect users while encouraging innovation in the sector.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>As more digital asset firms become victims to the bottleneck approach of United States regulators, several industry experts have bemoaned the current reality, with some accusing regulators of ‘killing the sector.’</p>



<p>In its periodic State of Crypto report, a16z, the investment arm of Andreessen Horowitz, stated the recent string of enforcement actions by regulators is gradually taking digital asset innovation away from the United States. The report highlights how dwindling leadership leads to uncertainty in the space. </p>



<p>According to the report, the U.S. was the fore of crypto innovation in 2018, hosting 40% of developers. That figure has since dropped over the years and is under 30% in 2022 as more creators look elsewhere to protect their investments. </p>



<p>Attributing the decline to poor regulation, the report pointed out that innovators are now moving out of the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Banning new business models or technologies undermines American values and drives innovation and jobs elsewhere. Legal businesses and their customers deserve access to financial services and lawful protections, from banking relationships to data privacy,” </em>the report stated.</p>



<p>Furthermore, traffic from digital asset websites based in the US dropped for the third consecutive year. In 2022, websites like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko recorded only 15% of website visits from the US, dropping from 23% in 2019.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-solution-to-the-predicament">A solution to the predicament&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Regulators must protect investors and rid the market of scams and dubious players. However, the method by which this is done can lead to more problems. This is the current reality in the US as industry executives continue to accuse regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of ‘killing innovation’ in the sector. </p>



<p>An example of this is the SEC&#8217;s decision to go after digital asset staking, which led to the Commission slamming Coinbase with a Wells Notice and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-crackdown-on-krakens-staking-program-puts-other-players-on-notice/">placing</a> a $30 million fine on Kraken for its staking-as-service program. To solve these problems, the report calls for new regulations and agencies&#8217; guidance.</p>



<p>A dearth of wholesome regulations has led to both the SEC and executives being at loggerheads leading to unending litigations like the SEC and Ripple saga.</p>
