<ul>
<li>Ethereum (ETH) is marginally up at $1,270 at press time</li>
<li>Ethereum holders who own between 100 and 1 million ETH added 561,000 ETH worth about $690 million</li>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ethereum-eth-sees-another-bull-favoring-element-as-on-chain-analytics-indicate-increased-blockchain-activity/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> is marginally up at $1,270 at press time. Data from Santiment reveals that Ethereum whales who own between 100 and 1 million ETH added 561,000 ETH worth about $690 million between December 5 and 6. In its insights report, onchain analytics firm Santiment observes that Ethereum&#8217;s key shark and whale addresses paint an interesting picture. Over the past year, just like Bitcoin, millionaire addresses have mainly shed much of their supply while conditions have looked poor. But one month ago, these large ETH addresses began to change their tune for the first time in a long time. Since November 7, Ethereum addresses holding 100 to 1 million coins have accumulated back 1.36% of the overall supply and added 2.09% more overall ETH (than they had previously) to their bags.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $1,700, $1,500, $1,300<br />Support Levels: $1,200, $1,000, $800</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/eth-price-analysis-eth-usd-supported-as-markets-stay-in-the-oversold-territory-after-successful-merge/">ETH/USD</a> softened after the bulls lifted its price toward the daily moving average (MA 50). On the daily chart, the pair has been grinding up along the moving average. For the bears, November’s low of $1,073 may prove to be a tough level to crack. A ranging RSI indicates a slowdown in the upward momentum.<br /><br />An initial break below $1,200 might trigger the first round of profit-taking, turning it into fresh resistance. $1,300 is the immediate level to gauge follow-up bids, and its breach would send the price to $1,500. After hitting as low as $1,071, the $1,000 handle now looks rather vulnerable. In any case, the near-term outlook might stay bearish.</p>
<h4>ETH/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63474 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-4-hour-Dec-10.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-4-hour-Dec-10.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-4-hour-Dec-10-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-4-hour-Dec-10-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-4-hour-Dec-10-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-4-hour-Dec-10-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-4-hour-Dec-10-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><br />Ethereum has been losing some downside momentum, as seen in the 4-hour RSI. It’s trying to draw support from $1,265 as well as the moving average of 50. There is no clear sign of a rebound yet. On the upside, a break of the $1,300 resistance will indicate short-term bottoming and bring a stronger rise toward the $1,500 horizontal level.<br /><br />However, a break of the 50-day moving average will open up a deeper decline to a $1,200 handle and possibly lower. The next move will depend more on development in the overall crypto market. As long as the $1,200 resistance turned support holds, the anticipated uptrend will resume at a later stage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The year 2022 was a difficult year across the board marked by industry failures as well as falling prices brought on by Fed’s aggressive monetary tightening policies. A vast majority of crypto assets have underperformed so far in the year.<br /><br />The bulls might try to turn things around with a last-minute end-of-year surge. Polkadot (DOT), Stellar (XLM), and Monero (XMR) appear to be in the midst of an intriguing setup, according to on-chain analytics company Santiment, which could result in price hikes in the near term. <br /><br />While the price of Bitcoin continues to decline, support is slowly developing just below the $17,000 mark. The fluctuating range price action of Bitcoin, however, seems to be motivating traders to follow a few intriguing setups in a few altcoins.<br /><br />Santiment reports that as the weekend has begun, traders are betting against some altcoins to profit from price decreases. Polkadot, Monero, and Stellar all have substantial short positions on exchanges, according to the on-chain analytics company, which means that short positions are predominant. <br /><br />It continues by stating that under such circumstances, price increases and liquidations are more likely to occur. As investors who have bet against these assets are likely to cover their short positions, which can result in what is known as a &#8220;short squeeze,&#8221; crypto assets with a high ratio of short bets are expected to rise in value during market rallies.<br /><br />In contrast to the previous year, when SHIB concluded strong with thousands of percent gains, SHIB is down 75% so far this year. To end the year in the black, SHIB needs to post a climb of about 80% over the next 18 days. At the time of publication, SHIB was up 1.5% at $0.00000932. Also, SHIB remains well correlated with bitcoin- thus keeping an eye on the general market trend might help predict SHIB’s next moves.</p>
<h2>Here Are Bitcoin Predictions</h2>
<p>In a recent tweet, Glassnode revealed that realized losses for Bitcoin holders over the previous 365 days totaled $213 billion. This is in contrast to the $455 billion gained during the bull market from 2020 to 2021. As of the apex of the 2018 bear market cycle, this is comparable to a 47% realized loss on the gains from the previous bull run, according to Glassnode.<br /><br />Notably, this occurred at the same time as the cycle&#8217;s price bottom.<br /><br />Il Capo of Crypto who has recently made several accurate forecasts stated in his most recent tweet on November 28 that he is still confident that Bitcoin will reach $12,000. As a result, the trader has decided to hold off on posting until his bias is established or disproved.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Bitcoin Price has established a range between $17,200 and $16,800 in the interim. Although Bitcoin was going for roughly $17,178 at the time of publication, trading near the upper end of the range.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the past week, Ripple filed its redacted reply to the SEC’s opposition to Ripple’s motion for summary judgment.<br /><br />Ripple general counsel, Stuart Alderoty wrote, &#8220;This is our final submission where we ask the court to grant judgment in our favor. After two long years, Ripple is proud of the defense we’ve mounted on behalf of the entire crypto industry. We have always played it straight with the Court. Can’t say the same for our adversary’<br /><br />Now that the last submission has been made, the judge&#8217;s decision is awaited.<br /><br />Attorney Jeremy Hogan, Partner at the law firm of Hogan &amp; Hogan, predicts how the case might turn out. Attorney Hogan stated today in a YouTube video that Ripple had a 50.12% chance of triumphing in its legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission. <br /><br />He noted that the likelihood of Judge Torres ruling in favor of the SEC is 29.88%. He claimed, however, that Ripple might also post a marginal win in this situation if the SEC is determined to be the victor.<br /><br />Hogan further predicts that there is a 19.11% possibility that the case will result in a tie for both the SEC and Ripple with a trial set for the summer of 2023.<br /><br />It is believed that the absence of clear laws in the U.S. crypto business has hampered its development. Leading industry figures, including the CEO of Ripple, have urged the SEC to establish clear regulations so that the American crypto economy can flourish.<br /><br />Recall that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse blasted the SEC for advocating regulation by enforcement rather than going through the arduous process of creating &#8220;a new set of crypto regulations&#8221; during the 2022 Collision Conference in Toronto.</p>
<h2>Parties Seek New Deadline in Lawsuit</h2>
<p>As all the briefings for summary judgment motions are now completed, what remains pending now is the sealing issues.<br /><br />According to an earlier timeline in the lawsuit, The date to file omnibus motions to seal all proposed redactions to all summary judgment materials was expected to be December 22.<br /><br />Now, parties are requesting the Court set a deadline of January 4, 2023, by which non-parties(that is neither SEC nor Ripple) must ask to seal any portions of the summary judgment materials.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ethereum merge in mid-September has been over for almost three months. In conclusion, traders are unsure of how to evaluate the second-largest crypto asset by market cap. On the one hand, the important whale accumulation is showing promise. However, the utility and real on-chain activity continue to be underwhelming.<br /><br />Whether the potential for a price rebound&#8230; Onchain metrics forecast what to expect in terms of ETH pricing, including whether sub-$1,000 ETH might once again be a possibility.</p>
<h2>Here Is What Onchain Metrics Suggest</h2>
<p>The major shark and whale addresses for Ethereum are reportedly creating an intriguing picture, according to onchain analytics company Santiment. Millionaire addresses have primarily lost a sizable portion of their supply during the previous year, much like Bitcoin when things appeared bleak.<br /><br />However, huge ETH addresses started to change their tune for the first time in a while one month ago. Since November 7th, Ethereum addresses holding 100 to 1 million coins have amassed 1.36% of the total supply and 2.09% more total ETH (than they had previously) in their bags. This surge in large address interest in ETH again makes this measure an optimistic one.<br /><br />Like other assets, the amount of conversation about Ethereum has also decreased as time has passed since its record-breaking peak in November 2021. This is a natural evolution of weak hands leaving crypto in general, so it&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />However, what is interesting is seeing Ethereum talked about so little relative to other top assets. Since December 2020, the amount of discourse about ETH in relation to the top 100 crypto assets has dropped to its lowest level in late October. This suggests that the second-ranked cryptocurrency asset is currently flying somewhat under the radar.<br /><br />This indicator is optimistic since the lack of interest after the merge suggests that whales, as previously noted, might drive prices up with little pushback.<br /><br />Third, there is still a lot of pain, as indicated by the long-term (365d) addresses&#8217; average return over the past year. Prior to a sharp drop in value 13 months ago, Ethereum prices were just shy of $5,000. Many folks still have percentage losses of -50% or higher on their ETH investments.<br /><br />As long as the 365-day trading returns are at -25% or more (and it&#8217;s currently at -30%), then there is a cap on how much further downside there can be, based on seven years of ETH history.<br /><br />On the other hand, mid-term traders could still see prices moving either way. Late November is when prices bottomed out, and the asset is actually +17% since November 22nd. To many, it certainly doesn&#8217;t feel this way, however. <br /><br />Because of the long-term upside indicated by MVRV, this metric points to bullishness. At the time of publication, ETH was changing hands at $1264, down 1.69% in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>FTT, the native cryptocurrency of the collapsed FTX crypto exchange, soared on Friday after Sam Bankman-Fried, the platform&#8217;s founder, expressed support for a plan to revive the exchange put up by crypto influencer Ran Neuner.<br /><br />In response to Neuner&#8217;s suggestion to restart FTX by releasing a new FTT token and giving it to creditors and depositors, Bankman-Fried tweeted, &#8220;I continue to think that this would be a productive path for parties to investigate! I *hope* that the teams in place will do so.&#8221;<br /><br />Neuner, the host of CNBC&#8217;s &#8220;Crypto Trader&#8221; show, which debuted in 2020, suggested giving token holders 100% of profits, saying that the suggestion would restore FTX&#8217;s dominance and make users whole.<br /><br />Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader at crypto asset management company Blofin, claimed that Neuner&#8217;s approach &#8220;is the same as a debt restructuring plan.&#8221; &#8220;Sam&#8217;s backing for the same appears to have rekindled investor optimism about getting their money back.&#8221;<br /><br />Not everyone supports this decision with some saying it was another leg of the scam technique. Following the tweet, the FTT token increased by as much as 47% to $1.97, its highest level since November 16. <br /><br />At the time of publication, FTX was up 19% at $1.63. Trading volume for the FTT token also spiked as much as 1090%.</p>
<h2>FTX Collapse</h2>
<p>Early last month when reports surfaced that FTX&#8217;s sister company Alameda Research was holding a significant quantity of the illiquid FTT tokens, indicating an unusually close bond between the two businesses. This is when FTX&#8217;s problems started.<br /><br />Leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance responded by announcing the sale of its FTT token holdings, which forced FTX to freeze customer withdrawals and cause a situation akin to a bank run. FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on November 11.<br /><br />In November, FTT plunged 94% to $1.31, wiping off billions of dollars in investor value.<br /><br />The collapse of FTX, dubbed by many as cryptocurrency&#8217;s Lehman moment, has eliminated several titans of the sector, including the lender BlockFi.</p>

At the time of publication, HBAR was marginally up in the last 24 hours at $0.047. Investment company abrdn has joined the Hedera Governing Council as the first buy-side finance and asset management company on the Council. abrdn plc is a global investment company with £508 billion in assets under management and administration and over 5,000 employees located globally. abrdn believes that distributed ledger technology (DLT) has the potential to transform structural inefficiencies that exist in the fund management industry. It sees Hedera as the technology of choice for this shift due to its interest in strong governance, operational efficiency, and the environmental sustainability of Hedera’s best-in-class energy efficiency. abrdn is currently examining prospects for the tokenization of investment funds, using Hedera, to list these on a digital exchange.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $0.0674, $0.0553, $0.0500<br />Support Levels: $0.0456, $0.0400, $0.0350</p>

Upticks should stay capped by a falling daily MA of 200 ($0.0650) to keep bears intact.<br /><br />On the daily chart, the technical structure remains bearish as negative momentum accelerates and the moving averages form a full bearish setup with a bull trap, further pressuring near-term action. Fresh bears might find a temporary foothold at $0.0456 support, with signs of extended consolidation while the price holds above this level.</p>
<h4>HBAR/USD 4-Hour Chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63459 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Dec-9.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Dec-9.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Dec-9-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Dec-9-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Dec-9-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Dec-9-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HBARUSD-4-Hour-Dec-9-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><span style="color: #999999">HBAR/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></h6>
<p>HBAR/USD recovery might continue higher on a close above the 4-hour MA 50 at $0.0480, showing that the path of least resistance remains up. More traders may look to buy into strength as the pair claws back gains. <br /><br />The RSI’s consolidation condition may cause a limited recovery. Selling could be expected around the resistance level of $0.0500, which is a major cap that is likely to keep the price under. A new round of selling would send the price to a 12-month low and at the psychological level of $0.0400.</p>

<p>In response to the recent market chaos, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/sample-letter-companies-regarding-crypto-asset-markets#_ftnref2">released</a> new rules for firms making financial disclosures that require them to provide a more thorough record of their exposure to the crypto industry.<br /><br />The regulations, which are listed in a sample letter, cover more than just the quantity of cryptocurrencies listed on the balance sheet.<br /><br />Guidelines are also provided in the letter regarding exposure to third-party <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/crypto-market-crippled-in-afghanistan-by-taliban-study-claims/">crypto market</a> participants, liquidity risks for firms, financing risks for firms, and risks associated with &#8220;legal proceedings, investigations, or regulatory impacts&#8221; within the crypto markets.<br /><br />The regulator cited Exchange Act Rule 12b-20 and Securities Act Rule 408 when describing the most recent guidelines. Companies may be required to provide additional disclosures  “as may be necessary to make the required statements, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading” according to these rules.<br /><br />Firms were also urged to talk about the &#8220;downstream effect&#8221; of how their company, as well as their partners and customers, have been impacted by the bankruptcy of some third-party companies.<br /><br />In a broader sense, the letter prompted firms to reveal any &#8220;reputational harm&#8221; that might result from recent market disruption.</p>

<h3>1. Cloud mining</h3>

<h3>2. Referral program: Earn bonuses by referring friends</h3>
<p>You can earn money through various bitcoin <a href="https://bytebus.com/referralprogram?kryptomoney">referral program</a> by directing customers to their website or app. Referral program membership is free. After making an account, you will be given a unique URL. Spreading the URL on websites, blogs, forums, and social media is up to you. You will be compensated whenever someone signs up or purchases through your link. The ability to get started quickly and make money is the main advantage. Furthermore, money would keep coming in for days, weeks, months, and even years after you put in all that effort.

<h3>3. Airdrops</h3>
<p>What are Airdrops? In short, crypto airdrops allow a cryptocurrency company to share its crypto for free to increase the company&#8217;s name. Airdrops are part of their marketing.</p>
<p>Here, We will share a trick to get airdrops that are easy to sell.</p>
<p>Usually, to get free crypto from a company that does airdrops, you will have to do a few things. Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liked Facebook page</li>
<li>Liked Youtube page</li>
<li>Liked Twitter page</li>
<li>Liked Instagram page</li>
<li>Follow the Telegram channel</li>
</ul>
<p>However, people participating in airdrops cannot immediately or instantly get these tokens. Usually, the company will distribute its tokens within two months or so for the vesting period (vesting period ).</p>
<p>These tokens usually cannot be sold immediately because no well-known exchanges register the crypto coin. Tokens are very rare to be directly listed on a crypto exchange.</p>
<h3>4. Coinmarketcap</h3>
<p>Who would have thought this site also gave free crypto? No responsibility; you sign in and immediately get crypto as a diamond.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are several steps you have to take to get free money.</p>
<p>The diamond cannot be sold or exchanged for Bitcoin or another crypto. However, you can still get free Bitcoins.</p>
<p>Check this link to see what items can be exchanged for Coinmarketcap Free Diamonds.</p>
<p>If you have seen, Diamond from Coinmarketcap can give you NFT that can be sold for thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Not only giving away free Bitcoins, but CoinMarketCap is also giving away free money and another crypto with the Learn-to-Earn feature, and you can earn money.</p>
<h3>5. Staking</h3>
<p>What is Staking?</p>
<p>Staking can be likened to a deposit in a bank. You save, and you will earn the crypto.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>If you are staking BTC, you will also be rewarded with BTC.</p>
<p>The best platform for staking right now is Binance. But, unfortunately, other brokers lost far from the number 1 crypto broker.</p>
<p>The results of Staking cannot be underestimated. For example: Currently, Binance is providing 40% APY Staking for $CAKE tokens (pancakeswap).</p>
<p>Imagine if you have 1000 CAKE, you can make 400 $ CAKE, which can be sold for the equivalent of US $ 1600.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Staking also has a drawback, namely price. You must have the capital to get a lot of cryptos.</p>
<p>Another drawback is the price when selling. For example, the cost of $CAKE is selling at $20 in 2021; if you stake and don&#8217;t sell, you will lose because in 2022, in September, the price of $cake is only $4.</p>
<p>Considering you are reading this, you are a beginner. If you&#8217;ve signed up on Binance, no matter how small your coins are and you can stake them, do it immediately.</p>
<h3>6. Bounty</h3>
<p>Bounties are rewards when you do something at a cryptocurrency company.</p>
<p>Usually, you will be rewarded with crypto if you write or promote the company&#8217;s token.</p>
<p>The easiest thing as an Indonesian is to promote the crypto company in your telegram group or translate their White-Paper into Indonesian.</p>
<p>The bounty rewards are also quite large; some can give you $200 worth of their tokens.</p>
<h3>7. Admin Telegram</h3>
<p>Working is one way of getting free Bitcoins in the crypto world. How come? Almost all crypto companies are overseas; with cryptocurrency payments, they can save on transaction fees as well as costs.</p>
<p>Almost all big companies need their admin on Telegram because the platform is a gathering place for the crypto world.</p>
<p>Admins on Telegram are usually paid using company tokens to save their fees.</p>

<h4>MATIC/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>

<p><br />The MATIC price has been in a broadly sideways range since late July. On November 8, the price dropped to a low of $0.076, initiating a downside consolidation. <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/matic-price-analysis-here-are-key-levels-to-watch-nike-to-mint-nft-apparel-on-polygon-after-web3-platform-launch/">MATIC/USD</a> price is currently in a battle with the MA 50 barrier at $0.925 following a day-high. <br /><br />The price could rise to $1.113 after the MA 50. MATIC&#8217;s successful move above the MA 200 ($0.795) and prior&#8217;s days&#8217; high of $0.919 lends support to an upside move for the pair.</p>
<h4>MATIC/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63441 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-8.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-8-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-8-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-8-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-8-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MATICUSD-4-Hour-Dec-8-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><span style="color: #999999">MATIC/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></h6>
<p>On the 4-hour time frame, the MA 50 and 200 intersection at $0.925 could halt bullish movements in this region. However, a move higher might enable MATIC&#8217;s price to surpass the $1.00 psychological zone set. <br /><br />Meanwhile, selling interest below current levels may find support around the $0.800 level, which was taken from the most recent low before falling lower. The RSI indicator has risen past the neutral 50 level, which points to potential consolidation.</p>
