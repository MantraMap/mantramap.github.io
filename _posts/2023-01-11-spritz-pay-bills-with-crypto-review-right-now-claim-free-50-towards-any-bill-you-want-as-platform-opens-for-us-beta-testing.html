They plan to add even more blockchain networks soon.<br /><br />Obviously, it can't be a coin with a $2 daily volume, but if they can trade it, you can probably pay your bills with it.</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><blockquote style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i><b>"Any bill.
