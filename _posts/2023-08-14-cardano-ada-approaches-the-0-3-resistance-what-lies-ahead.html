The journey of Cardano (ADA) toward reclaiming the $0.3 price level seems to be growing more challenging in the days ahead, as the cryptocurrency grapples with persistent bearish pressure. After successfully managing to hold the line at $0.3 during the latter part of July, the digital asset encountered a setback in early August when this crucial support level split, potentially paving the way for further price declines. The $0.3 mark not only signifies a March low but also acted as a pivotal resistance point during the months of June and July. This level demonstrated its resilience by transforming into a support level in late July and early August. Nevertheless, the breach experienced in early August did not immediately send ADA into a downward spiral.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Steals The Spotlight, Leaving Bitcoin Behind In A Week Of Price Surges However, recent price analysis reveals a concerning development: a retest of this level followed by a price rejection has formed a bearish order block (OB) on the daily chart. Founder&#8217;s Jab At Ethereum Adds Intrigue Amidst ADA Struggles Meanwhile, Charles Hoskinson, the visionary founder of Cardano, has thrown shade at Ethereum, a primary rival in the cryptocurrency landscape. I remember when we were brutally mocked by the ETH Devs about the design of Ouroboros. Goodtimes — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) August 12, 2023 Hoskinson&#8217;s remarks were sparked by a video clip in which Ethereum developer Justin Drake commented on staking, likening it to sausage-making and suggesting that understanding the intricate process could lead to disillusionment. Hoskinson&#8217;s use of the colloquialism underscores his perspective on Ethereum&#8217;s staking mechanism. Some interpreted his comment as a candid critique of the opacity surrounding Ethereum&#8217;s staking process, hinting at potential undesirable aspects hidden beneath the surface. Ethereum&#8217;s own founder, Vitalik Buterin, has previously expressed reservations about staking Ether due to security and operational complexities, providing a backdrop to Hoskinson&#8217;s dig. ADA market cap currently at $10.19 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Cardano Market Performance At present, ADA is trading at approximately $0.290, according to CoinGecko data. Over the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency has remained flat, while its value has decreased by a measly 0.5% over the past seven days.  Cardano price action today.
