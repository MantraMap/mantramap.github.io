<p>As Avalanche (AVAX) leaves investors wondering about its future price, analysts are pointing to Cosmos (ATOM) and Collateral Network (COLT) as projects worth investing in. But which one takes the crown? </p>

<p class="s9">Collateral Network (COLT)</p>
<p>Collateral Network (COLT) is the world&rsquo;s first Web3 decentralized lending platform for real world-assets on the blockchain. These assets include luxury watches, rare collectibles, gold, and vintage cars. </p>
<p>The way it works is simple. To get the funds you need, you send your asset to Collateral Network (COLT), where the team uses AI to evaluate it and stores it in its highly-securevault. Then, Collateral Network (COLT) mints an NFT of the asset and fractionalizes it to allow multiple lenders to fund the loan and receive weekly fixed-interest payments. </p>
<p>Once the borrower pays off the loan, Collateral Network (COLT) will burn the 100% asset-backed NFT and redeem the asset from the vault.</p>
<p>Additionally, Collateral Network (COLT) will hold online private auctions where lenders can buy distressed assets below market value, ensuring that even if a borrower defaults, Collateral Network (COLT) investors can recover their funds.</p>
<p>Currently, the Collateral Network (COLT) is in its public presale, and the Collateral Network (COLT) token price is $0.014. However, experts say the token has a 3500% growth potential, delivering 35x gains to Collateral Network (COLT) holders along with benefits like staking, governance rights and more!</p>

<p>April has been an overall good month for Avalanche (AVAX). Namely, Avalanche (AVAX) has seen growth in the Avalanche (AVAX) daily users, which soared to a six-month high.</p>
<p>However, as April ends, the Avalanche (AVAX) token shows both bullish and bearish indicators, currently consolidating around the $17 price level.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the Avalanche (AVAX) token is trading at $16.98, with a 0.17% price increase in the last 24 hours. However, the Avalanche (AVAX) trading volume decreased by 1.06% in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="s9">Cosmos (ATOM)</p>
<p>As the Cosmos (ATOM) token drops to key $10.58 support, experts believe that Cosmos (ATOM) bulls can take charge and spark a Cosmos (ATOM) price recovery. However, Cosmos (ATOM) sustained fluctuating funding rates in the past week, leading analysts to expect wavering demand in the future markets.</p>
<p>However, experts believe that a potential Cosmos (ATOM) recovery is still viable, as the Cosmos (ATOM) RSI 40-mark rejection points to higher buying pressure.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the Cosmos (ATOM) token is trading at $10.76, with a 0.04% decrease in the last 24 hours. Additionally, the Cosmos (ATOM) trading volume decreased by 8.17% over 24 hours.</p>
