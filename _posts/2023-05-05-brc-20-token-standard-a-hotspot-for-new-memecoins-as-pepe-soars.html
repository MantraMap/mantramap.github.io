The memecoin ecosystem has once again brought magic to crypto investors as PEPE the frog records massive gains and unbelievable numbers. The now popular PEPE meme token based on Ethereum was originally inspired by the Bitcoin BRC-20 PEPE which launched earlier in March, 2023. PEPE&#8217;s exponential price growth in its barely first month recorded close to 38,900% ROI for early investors. This has led to crypto enthusiasts and developers to explore the original BRC-20 token standard version with which the first PEPE was created on. The BRC-20 is a new and unique token standard that has recently gained massive popularity and exposure due to the successes of the Ethereum based PEPE.

This new token standard was created by a pseudonymous on-chain analyst called Domo. Domo created the BRC-20 token standard in March 2023 to facilitate transfers of fungible tokens across the Bitcoin network. This new experimental standard would also enable developers and programmers to create and send fungible tokens, including memecoins, via the Bitcoin ordinals protocol. While several token standards are present in the blockchain industry, the BRC-20 was modeled after the popular Ethereum ERC-20 standard, although there are some fundamental differences. The ERC-20 standard which requires using smart contracts to launch a token is quite different from the BRC-20. The latter simply requires a Bitcoin wallet to mint and create tokens without using smart contracts. Related Reading: SUI Gets A Bear Introduction On Day 2, Will Sell Pressure Continue? PEPE Sets A Precedence For Newer Memecoins Recently, there has been a frenzy of newer memecoins launching into the crypto market using the BRC-20 token standard due to its popularity. According to data reports from Coinmarketcap, 8,500 tokens, including memecoins, have been minted and launched using this standard. This has resulted in a massive surge in the BRC-20 token market capitalization and transaction volume which were reported to outperform Bitcoin by over 50% between April 29 and May 2, 2023. We can see that in the last 10 days number of BRC20 tx has largely surpassed that of ordinals. They might even soon overload the bitcoin network and cause issues. pic.twitter.com/FSGzkfeTJT &#8212; Crypto Koryo (@CryptoKoryo) May 2, 2023 The increasing transaction volumes and market capitalization of BRC-20, have drawn the interests of many investors who explore a variety of tokens created using this new token standard. However, it is important to note that the BRC-20 standard is still in its experimental phase, and as such, caution should be exerted when exploring tokens based on it.
