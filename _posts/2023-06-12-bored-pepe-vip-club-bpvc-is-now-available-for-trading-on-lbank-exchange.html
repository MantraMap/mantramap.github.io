The primary benefit provided is access to PEPE LOUNGE, a collaborative graffiti board. Furthermore, the community has the ability to unlock future areas and perks through the activation of the roadmap.</p><p>Every Bored Pepe is distinctive and algorithmically created from a pool of over 70 potential traits, such as expression, headwear, clothing, and more. While all pepes are appealing, some are rarer than others. The pepes are held as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and are hosted on IPFS for guaranteed proof of ownership and authenticity (See Record and Proof).

In order to gain access to members-only areas like the PEPE LOUNGE, holders of Bored Pepe will need to be signed into their Metamask Wallet.</p><p>Upon purchasing a Bored Pepe, one isn't simply acquiring an avatar or a provably rare piece of art.

A Bored Pepe can act as a digital identity and unlock virtual opportunities for its owner.</p><p>The BPVC Lounge, an exclusive area for Pepe holders, will become operational once the sale period concludes. It features a canvas that is only accessible to wallets that contain at least one pepe. As one might expect in any quality bar, this is the place for users to draw, jot down thoughts, or write expletives.</p><p>Every fifteen minutes, each pepe-holder is granted the privilege to paint a pixel on the bathroom wall. This can be seen as a collective art experiment in the cryptosphere: a members-only canvas for the sophisticated minds of crypto Twitter.</p><p>About BPVC Token</p><p>Based on ERC-20, BPVC has a fixed total supply of 1 trillion (i.e. 1,000,000,000,000).
