<ul>
<li><em>The primary court in Montenegro once again granted Do Kwon&#8217;s bail request.</em></li>

<li><em>Previously, the court canceled the bail order of more than $400,000 for Kwon and his companion.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to the Financial Associated Press, the Court of Montenegro again granted bail from failed Terraform Labs crypto executive <a href="https://news.coincu.com/190624-do-kwon-hired-super-large-law-firm-dentons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Do Kwon.</a></strong></h5>

<p>On June 3, a primary court in Montenegro once again agreed to the bail request of Do Kwon, co-founder of Terraform Labs, and his associate Han Chang-joon. Although it is unclear why the case was overturned, the country&#8217;s prosecutors will have three days to appeal the ruling.</p>



<p>On May 12, the Basic Court in Montenegro agreed to a $436,000 bail for Terraform Labs co-founder and CEO Do Kwon and Terra CFO Han Chang- joon with the same condition. At the time, the court ordered that the men be placed under house arrest in Montenegro pending trial.</p>



<p>However, two weeks later, the decision was revoked after prosecutors appealed the decision. It is known that when the judgment was revoked, the Court of Montenegro had not yet received bail from the two defendants.</p>



<p>Kwon and Chang-joon have been charged with forging official documents after attempting to fly to Dubai from Podgorica in March with alleged fake Belgian and Costa Rican passports. In the trials, both men have asserted that the passports are genuine.</p>

<p>In addition to the tampering charge, Kwon also faces criminal charges in the US and South Korea. Since September, South Korea has had an arrest warrant for Kwon, alleging that he violated capital markets laws.</p>



<p>In February, the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges against Kwon for violating securities and exchange practices&#8217; registration and anti-fraud regulations.</p>



<p>The May 2022 collapse of the Terraform Lab ecosystem, including the TerraUSD algorithmic stablecoin and the Terra governance token (LUNA), caused panic across the industry as established companies collapsed.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Celsius is making headlines with its move to stake nearly $1 billion of cryptocurrencies in staking Ethereum (ETH).</em></li>



<li><em>The transfer extended the already long queue for setting up new validators on the Ethereum network to 44 days and 11 hours.</em></li>



<li><em>So far, the bankrupt lending platform has deposited over $600 million in ETH &#8211; but they still need to be done.</em></li>

<p>Right at the time it was allowed to withdraw staking ETH, Celsius held about 460,000 ETH – now worth $870 million – staking with liquidity staking platform Lido Finance and around 160,000 tokens – around $300 million la at current prices – implemented in its staking pool. They kept this ETH in the &#8216;Unstaking&#8217; wallet for two weeks, instead declaring their intention to stake with institutional provider Figment.</p>



<p>About 24 hours ago, Celsius split the ETH from the unsecured wallet into two separate deposit wallets. One wallet is marked as a Celsius ETH2 deposit wallet, while the other is labeled &#8220;ETH deposited&#8221; and deposited in Figment. Celsius&#8217;s staking wallet has seen over $400 million worth of ETH inflows in the past 24 hours, with ongoing deposits being made every few minutes.</p>



<p>Tom Wan, the analyst at 21Shares crypto investment product manager, noted that the transfer extended the already long queue for setting up new validators on the Ethereum network to 44 days and 11 hours, with Celsius potentially causing almost an extra week.</p>

<p>Wan predicted that if Celsius commits to staking all 428,000 tokens, it will add six days and 15 hours to the waiting period, increasing to 45 days.</p>

<p>The transfer happened as the company restructured after filing for bankruptcy protection in July 2022 when it succumbed to liquidity problems caused by plummeting cryptocurrency prices and a wave of withdrawals. Use. Last week, the US bankruptcy court auctioned off the lender to the winning bidder Fahrenheit, an Arrington Capital-backed investment group that will take over the company&#8217;s assets, including its institutional loan portfolio institutions, staking cryptocurrencies, and cryptocurrency mining units.</p>



<p>Staking allows lenders to earn rewards for holding digital assets while a withdrawal freeze on user deposits is in effect. However, it also significantly strains the already crowded queues for adding new validators on the Ethereum network.</p>

<p>As reported by Blockwork, US Republican Representative Patrick McHenry and Pennsylvania Republican Representative Glenn Thompson introduced <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/AG/AG00/20230606/116051/HHRG-118-AG00-20230606-SD002.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">draft legislation </a>on Friday, focusing on token classification, CFTC, and SEC jurisdictions, and available encryption for transactions.</p>



<p>The draft proposes a more precise division of crypto regulatory powers between the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191053-former-coinbase-settles-charges-with-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), providing certainty about regulation for digital asset companies.</p>



<p>The bill establishes a process for token issuers to claim their currency to be treated as a commodity as long as the project is fully decentralized. The CFTC will be tasked with overseeing digital goods, but the SEC could attempt to classify tokens as securities if the agency can successfully make that case.</p>



<p>The draft also allows for the trading of digital goods on the secondary market and allows digital asset trading platforms to register as alternative trading systems.</p>

<p>The chairs of the House Committees on Agriculture and Financial Services, Reps. McHenry and Thompson, think the present regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies stifle innovation and fall short of &#8220;adequate consumer protection&#8221;. Although the draft has yet to be formally submitted to parliament, the initial response from the industry has been positive.</p>



<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have launched a total of more than 100 enforcement actions against crypto asset market participants. However, if the bill is passed, it is possible to expect the issuance of a specific rule on the cryptocurrency industry soon.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Crypto has a number of challenges, according to Mike McGlone, a senior macro analyst at Bloomberg.</em></li>



<li><em>He believes that Bitcoin&#8217;s worst is yet to come, citing current patterns, fundamental reasons, and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s bias.</em></li>



<li><em>Moreover, McGlone questions Bitcoin&#8217;s capacity to weather a slowdown in the US economy, citing the cryptocurrency&#8217;s youth and status as a high-risk asset.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Bloomberg&#8217;s Senior Macro Strategist Mike McGlone, cryptocurrencies face a number of challenges, including the possibility of a US recession, a stock market crash, watchful central banks, and high interest-rate competition.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-167.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="960" height="540" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-167.png" alt="Bloomberg Strategist Warning Down Risk For Bitcoin In The Near Time" class="wp-image-191906" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-167.png 960w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-167-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-167-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-167-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" title="Bloomberg Strategist Warning Down Risk For Bitcoin In The Near Time 14"></a></figure></div>


<p>McGlone forecasts further suffering for <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191826-bitcoin-holds-27000-may-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> and the larger cryptocurrency sector in his newest <a href="https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/rvmeqat0afb4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>, &#8220;Crypto Outlook, June 2023.&#8221; He contends that, notwithstanding a price recovery in 2023, the risks for the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index remain skewed negative. These facts, together with the speculative excesses that led to the 2021 high, indicate that the crypto market&#8217;s forecast is gloomy.</p>



<p>McGlone notes that Bitcoin&#8217;s weakness in May, along with copper and Chinese stocks, is exceptional when contrasted to the robust Nasdaq 100 Stock Index. Although the Nasdaq has the capacity to raise all boats, it may clash with the Fed&#8217;s still-rising rate-hike expectations.</p>



<p>Moreover, McGlone believes that BTC, which is sometimes referred to as digital gold because of its perceived role as a store of value, may be unable to beat the conventional safe-haven asset in the event of a US economic slowdown. This is due to the fact that BTC is still in its infancy in comparison to gold, which has been used as a store of value for thousands of years. As a consequence, during times of economic uncertainty, investors may go toward gold rather than emerging assets like Bitcoin.</p>

<p>According to McGlone, the month of June will indicate if the first half&#8217;s bias for growing risk assets, such as Bitcoin, will persist or whether it will lead to a U.S. recession. The analyst favors the latter possibility, noting the market&#8217;s upbeat outlook as a consequence of the continuous aggressive central bank rate rises. Moreover, considering current patterns, underlying reasons, and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s bias, he warns that the worst may not be over for BTC.</p>



<p>The expert highlights the grounds for future BTC price declines, pointing out that the cryptocurrency traded near $7,000 at the end of 2019 before witnessing a big liquidity pump, raising worries about possible reversion risks.</p>



<p>McGlone&#8217;s gloomy projection casts doubt on Bitcoin&#8217;s rebound and raises serious concerns about the currency&#8217;s future direction. While the crypto market navigates the difficult terrain, it remains to be seen whether McGlone&#8217;s thesis is correct or whether BTC will defy the odds and resume its positive momentum.</p>

<p>The Blockchain Association has submitted an amicus brief in support of Coin Center&#8217;s ongoing action against the Treasury Department and its sanctions inspector, the Office of Foreign Asset Control.</p>



<p>In action, Coin Center claims that the US Treasury Department&#8217;s broad restrictions against cryptocurrency mixer <a href="https://news.coincu.com/189755-tornado-cash-users-set-up-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tornado Cash</a> damaged Americans and their ability to interact secretly on the Ethereum network.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;It&#8217;s critical to recognize that Tornado Cash is simply a tool – punishing the tool itself simply because it can be used by anyone, including bad actors, runs contrary to the values this country was founded upon,” Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith said in a statement.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the Treasury&#8217;s OFAC in August, claiming that North Korean hackers have laundered hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency via the mixer since its inception. According to the federal authorities, around 20% of Tornado Cash&#8217;s total transaction volume was linked to one or more hacks.</p>



<p>Crypto proponents, notably the Washington, D.C.-based policy group Coin Center, reacted angrily to the action, filing a lawsuit against the Treasury Department over the fines.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-165.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-165.png" alt="Blockchain Association Criticizes US Treasury Tornado Sanctions In New Court Filing" class="wp-image-191900" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-165.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-165-300x225.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-165-768x576.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-165-750x563.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Blockchain Association Criticizes US Treasury Tornado Sanctions In New Court Filing 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>The litigation was the advocacy group&#8217;s second against the Treasury Department and the second against Treasury over its Tornado Cash restrictions.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Blockchain Association stands with Coin Center, advocating for the responsible and lawful use of blockchain technology. Regulatory actions should only be targeted at bad actors who abuse this tool for illegal purposes,&#8221; Smith added.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, is supporting yet another complaint against the government over the penalties. In that case, the Blockchain Association has also submitted an amicus brief.</p>



<p>Both cases contend that the government exceeded its jurisdiction by targeting software rather than individuals or entities, among other things.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>According to Justin Sun, Huobi might be approved as a crypto trading service in Hong Kong before the end of the year.</em></li>



<li><em>Sun said that regulators have up to 18 months to accept or disapprove specific petitions.</em></li>



<li><em>He also remarked on the Canadian regulatory landscape, stating that Huobi has no ambitions to join the Canadian market.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to an <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/02/huobi-could-have-hong-kong-license-in-six-to-twelve-months-justin-sun-on-coindesk-tv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> on <em>CoinDesk TV</em> on Friday, Tron founder and adviser to the exchange Justin Sun indicated that Huobi might get a Hong Kong crypto license in six to twelve months.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-160.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-160-1024x683.png" alt="Justin Sun Reveals Huobi Now Is Seeking License In Hong Kong In Next 6-12 Months" class="wp-image-191891" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-160-1024x683.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-160-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-160-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-160-750x500.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-160-1140x760.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-160.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Justin Sun Reveals Huobi Now Is Seeking License In Hong Kong In Next 6-12 Months 22"></a></figure></div>


<p>Sun specifically informed Coindesk that the exchange registered last week to become a virtual asset service provider (VASP).</p>



<p>He also spoke about the VASP application&#8217;s procedure. It is said that permission comes with an 18-month grace period during which regulators might make a decision on the application. He did, however, indicate that he believes the crypto exchange would have an answer before the end of the year.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Right now we predict probably we will have the license in the next six to 12 months,&#8221; Sun said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Moreover, he said that other exchanges, including OKX, Gate.io, Bitget, and ByBit, might apply for the license.</p>



<p>Other crypto exchanges that have sought a similar license have not been verified. Sun, on the other hand, predicted that five to six additional exchanges will follow suit.</p>



<p>One of the most important implications of the administrative region&#8217;s crypto-friendly stance is that cryptocurrency exchanges may apply for licenses if they want to sell crypto-trading goods to regular investors.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-161-1024x597.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="597" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-161-1024x597.png" alt="Justin Sun Reveals Huobi Now Is Seeking License In Hong Kong In Next 6-12 Months" class="wp-image-191892" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-161-1024x597.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-161-300x175.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-161-768x448.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-161-750x438.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-161.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Justin Sun Reveals Huobi Now Is Seeking License In Hong Kong In Next 6-12 Months 23"></a></figure></div>


<p>He mentioned the application&#8217;s 18-month grace period as he discussed the situation of crypto legislation during Hong Kong&#8217;s deployment of a much-lauded crypto framework. Both the crypto business sector and private investors view this as a positive development. Being one of Asia&#8217;s numerous crypto centers, Hong Kong reflects the region&#8217;s rising reputation as a worldwide destination for blockchain and crypto.</p>



<p>Sun said that regulators have up to 18 months to accept or disapprove specific petitions. During this time, the crypto sector will learn about the framework&#8217;s intricacies, including as compliance requirements for client withdrawals and AML.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The details of the regulation will come out in the next 18 months, for example, how to comply with customer withdrawals and anti-money laundering requirements. In the next 18 months, we have a grace period so Huobi Hong Kong can operate in Hong Kong, take customers, get our banking, and serve our customers,” he added.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Huobi recently relocated its headquarters from Singapore to Hong Kong with the aim of establishing Huobi Hong Kong as soon as this summer after the city stated its intention to become a virtual asset center.</p>



<p>Sun, on the other hand, was questioned about welcoming possible competition in the Canadian market. After that, he cited the country&#8217;s high regulatory norms as the reason that wouldn&#8217;t happen.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ll work on all the friendly jurisdictions first,&#8221; Sun stated. Specifically referring to the Caribbean, Hong Kong, and Japan.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Kenya has discovered that people are not enthusiastic about the concept of digital money.</em></li>



<li><em>According to the central bank, nations that issued CBDCs experienced implementation challenges.</em></li>



<li><em>The bank said that it would continue to monitor CBDC developments to inform future evaluations.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>As governments and central banks around the world investigate central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), Kenya&#8217;s central bank <a href="https://twitter.com/CBKKenya/status/1664579975255654402" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on Friday that while the issuance of a digital currency is not a &#8220;compelling priority,&#8221; it will continue to monitor developments in the area to help future decisions on issuance.</strong></h5>

<p>In February 2022, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) released a discussion paper on CBDCs, requesting public for comment on the prospective release of a CBDC in Kenya to assist the CBK in better making policy choices.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Implementation of a CBDC in Kenya may not be a compelling priority in the short to medium term.

<p>The central bank said that nations that have issued a CBDC, which is a digital token issued by a central bank, had encountered challenges that delayed adoption, and that recent volatility in the cryptocurrency market had heightened worries. Nigeria, for example, has had difficulties with adoption, while the Bahamas central bank said in May that it was working on a plan to increase CBDC acceptance three years after its inception.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Further, central banks that were first to roll out CBDCs have recently faced challenges that have hampered implementation. Additionally, recent instability in the global crypto assets market has amplified concerns and the need for a careful review of the innovation and technology risks,&#8221; the bank said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The central bank went on to propose that additional creative ideas based on the current ecosystem might solve the pain points in Kenya&#8217;s payments system. This would be compatible with the CBK&#8217;s aim of a payments system that is safe, rapid, efficient, accessible to, and functional for Kenyans. Kenya may rely on current technology to solve any payment issues, according to the report.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Vertex Labs&#8217; founder said he would encourage AGB to publicize its treasury address and handle treasury assets in a multi-signature format.</em></li>



<li><em>After then, the AGB team reacted, stating that 15% of the AGB in circulation had been moved to an address.</em></li>



<li><em>The company also said that all community members have the authority to oversee the usage of these 15% tokens.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On June 2, Ander Tsui, founder of Vertex Labs, <a href="https://twitter.com/AnderTsui/status/1664606170676338688" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that he would urge Apes Go Bananas (AGB) team to publish its treasury address and manage treasury assets in a multi-signature form.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-153.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-153-1024x576.png" alt="AGB Team Clarifies 15% Of Totally Community Controlled Tokens" class="wp-image-191874" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-153-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-153-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-153-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-153-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-153-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-153.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="AGB Team Clarifies 15% Of Totally Community Controlled Tokens 30"></a></figure></div>


<p>The team then <a href="https://twitter.com/AGBCoin/status/1664626391101460484" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a>, saying that 15% of the AGB in circulation had been transferred to the address 0xD81A0929890b7f15c818bEF0B4487f4b90668B5f and that all community members had the right to supervise the use of these 15% tokens.</p>



<p>At the same time, the DAO organization will be established, and influential tokens, BAYC, HAPE holders, and supporters will be absorbed as core members to jointly promote community governance.</p>



<p>Apes Go Bananas is a community based and 100% decentralized meme coin. This coin was initiated by members of the BAYC and HAPE communities. The community believes that meme coins should not only be unique in terms of going viral but should also be associated with meaningful financial activities. So, AGB introduced the concept of an NFT prize pool in its token design. At each stage, AGB will purchase the lowest-priced “BAYC” and “HAPE” NFTs from Opensea.</p>



<p>Users can participate in the lottery using their tokens. Lottery results are determined by the last 6 digits of the transaction hash. At the end of each lottery period, the user with the largest last 6 digits will receive one NFT from the total prize pool. Lottery progress is determined by the number of tokens the user has consumed. The lottery period ends when enough AGB tokens have been consumed to purchase the lowest-priced NFT “BAYC” or “HAPE” on Opensea.</p>

<p>AGB is the native token of the Apes Go Bananas ecosystem, created in 2023 on the Ethereum Blockchain platform with the ERC-20 utility token standard. The maximum total supply of the token is 819,200,000,000. The token was born to serve a number of activities of the Apes Go Bananas ecosystems, such as a transaction fee on the platform, rewards in the Airdrop program, and liquidity. Users can use AGB to buy, sell, exchange, and store value. </p>



<p>AGB was initiated by the NFT holders of BAYC and HAPE, and the whole project is community-driven by these two communities. The goal is to increase the liquidity of BAYC and HAPE NFT and make it more cost-effective for everyone to buy NFT.</p>



<p>It is reported that Ander Tsui said that he is very supportive of AGB&#8217;s NFT liquidity solution.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>CleanSpark has published its unaudited Bitcoin mining and operations report for the month of May 31, 2023.</em></li>



<li><em>In May, the company mined 609 Bitcoins, up from 524 the previous month.</em></li>



<li><em>The company raised funds for expansion and operations by selling 471 Bitcoins.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CleanSpark, a Bitcoin mining firm, <a href="https://www.cleanspark.com/blog/cleanspark-releases-may-2023-bitcoin-mining-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> an update on Bitcoin mining and operations in May.</strong></h5>



<p>According to CEO Zach Bradford, 609 Bitcoins were produced in May, 3,004 Bitcoins have been produced so far in 2023, and 471 BTCs were sold for approximately $12.9 million in May to cover operating and growth expenses, thanks to increases in operational efficiency and a brief, albeit significant, increase in transaction fees.</p>

<p>Costs were raised for five days in May because of increasing demand in ordinals on the blockchain, he said.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;At its peak, our bitcoin production jumped to nearly 30 bitcoins in a single day, almost double our normal daily production of about 18 bitcoins. Since then, transaction fees have normalized.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Cipher Mining, another Bitcoin miner, credited its 21% rise in May BTC output to a substantial spike in transaction fees throughout the month.</p>



<p>The corporation has a deployed fleet of about 67,196 BTC miners with a mining capacity of 6.7 exahashes per second (EH/s).</p>

<p>The total number of BTC holdings as of May 31 was 451. CleanSpark now has 67,196 latest-generation Bitcoin mining rigs with a total computational capacity of 6.7 EH/s installed.</p>



<p>The 50MW expansion project is scheduled to begin operations in the second part of June. The projected Sandersville extension will increase CleanSpark&#8217;s mining activities by more than 6 EH/s.</p>



<p>CleanSpark has <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191476-cleanspark-adds-12500-new-miners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a $40.5 million acquisition of 12,500 Antminer S19 XP Bitcoin mining rigs. The computers were purchased for $23 per terahash, which is less than the current market average. According to the purchase agreement, 6,000 machines will be delivered in June, with the remaining 6,500 arriving in August.</p>
