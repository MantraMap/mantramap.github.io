<p class="s5">The AI tool built by Google, known as Bard, has made waves across the Web3 space as a lot of users are using it for price prediction. One of the most notable altcoins to get a significant level of attention due to the bullish outlook of Google Bard is Shiba Inu, and today, we will explore why it thinks that the crypto has high-growth potential.</p>
<p class="s5">The presale-stage project Tradecurve has increased by 25% in the past week, and it has its own AI system as well that can change the way investors make decisions when trading.</p>

<p class="s8">Google Bard Makes Prediction Surrounding Shiba Inu&rsquo;s Future Value</p>
<p class="s5">Google Bard was consulted to get the price predictions for the Shiba Inu cryptocurrency, as users on a global scale are using AI to check the future value of their favorite cryptocurrencies. Note that the price predictions that are made by the Google Bard AI might not always be 100% accurate or correct. However, they will provide much-needed insights into the potential future direction a cryptocurrency's value might be headed to. When Shiba Inu was released in 2020, it was dubbed the "Dogecoin Killer" and experienced a massive 1,500% increase after it was released. This excessive increase resulted in the crypto community speculating on the different scenarios, and one of them predicted that SHIB could climb to $1.</p>
<p class="s5">However, according to Google Bard, $1 is highly unlikely at this point. Bard's projection for the future of Shiba Inu is still optimistic, however. As of May 29, 2023, Shiba Inu trades at $0.00000883. Bard predicts that the maximum value for the cryptocurrency in 2023 is at $0.0000259, an increase of 193.32%. Aside from Shiba Inu, one other cryptocurrency caught the attention of crypto traders as well, and that project is Tradecurve.</p>

<p class="s5">Tradecurve has transitioned from Stage 2 of its presale, where one TCRV token was worth $0.012, to Stage 3, where its price increased by 25%, and now trades at $0.015. Analysts and investors are eyeing the Tradecurve platform as it also implements AI to make trades, users can access hundreds of algorithmic and AI-driven trading systems and create AI-oriented bots to optimize the performance of their portfolio.</p>
<p class="s5">This hybrid platform requires no KYC, features Proof of Reserves (PoR), and allows anyone to make trades just by depositing crypto and then using it as collateral when trading other cryptocurrencies or any other derivative.</p>
<p class="s5">According to the Tradecurve whitepaper, the platform will feature high leverage beginning at 500:1, a VIP account service, zero requirements for FIAT payments, exclusive deposit bonuses, a dedicated Trading academy, and negative balance protection.</p>
<p class="s5">The team estimates that they will make $20 million during the presale and that they can onboard 100,000 new users at launch. TCRV will also get listed on Tier-1 exchanges and on Uniswap, and as a result, Google Bard predicts that TCRV can climb 100x by the end of 2023.</p>
