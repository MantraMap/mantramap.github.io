<p>Arbitrum (ARB) has notably impacted Ethereum&rsquo;s scalability, and analysts expect it to continue playing an essential role in the growth of blockchain-based applications and the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Yet, as the short-lived increase in the Arbitrum (ARB) trading volume dies down, investors turn their heads over to a game-changing altcoin &ndash; one that is set to revolutionize the lending industry.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s8">What Is Arbitrum (ARB)?</p>
<p>Offchain Labs developed Arbitrum (ARB) in 2018. It is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that aims to improve the network&rsquo;s scalability and speed while reducing transaction costs.</p>
<p>Arbitrum (ARB) uses the Optimistic Rollups technology to bundle multiple transactions together off the main Ethereum chain, thus improving the overall performance.</p>
<p class="s8">Is Arbitrum (ARB) A Viable Investment?</p>
<p>In the last few days, Arbitrum (ARB) surpassed Bitcoin in transaction fees and BNB in trading volume. Arbitrum (ARB) reached an all-time high in the number of users, currently at 5 million.</p>
<p>However, after Arbitrum&rsquo;s (ARB) boom, the ARB token is facing price reductions. At the time of writing, Arbitrum's (ARB) price is at $1.32, down by 0.43%, Arbitrum&rsquo;s market cap, currently down by 0.24%, and trading volume, currently down by 29.09%.</p>
<p>Arbitrum (ARB) investors and analysts predict its price to rise by a dollar by the end of this year, but many are also selling their ARB coins after the recent boom it experienced.</p>

<p class="s8">Why Are ARB Investors Turning to COLT?</p>
<p>Collateral Network (COLT) is a decentralized lending platform set to change how we get funds and loans. Thanks to COLT, people can get loans much easier and faster, while investors can finance loans and get fixed interest payments weekly.</p>
<p>You can send real-world assets, like watches or jewelry, over to Collateral Network (COLT). Then, Collateral Network (COLT) will value it and give you a loan by minting your asset into an asset-backed NFT and selling fractions of it to Collateral Network (COLT) holders. The Collateral Network (COLT) holders that finance portions of the loan will get fixed interest payments weekly, and if the borrower fails to pay the loan, investors can buy the asset at below-market value.</p>
<p>Once the borrower pays the loan, Collateral Network (COLT) will burn the NFT and return the asset to the borrower. While the loan is repaid, the asset is held in Collateral Network&rsquo;s (COLT) vault.</p>
<p>Collateral Network (COLT) is currently in public presale, and even now, it&rsquo;s faced with outstanding growth predictions of 35x during presale only!</p>
<p class="s8">Can COLT Reach Its Projected 100x Growth?</p>
<p>Chances are, Collateral Network (COLT) will reach its forecasted 100x growth once it enters major exchanges, such as CEX and DEX, and here&rsquo;s why:</p>
● Collateral Network has the first-mover advantage in the market, potentially disrupting the pawnbroking industry and reinventing peer-to-peer lending.
● It solves market issues, such as difficulty obtaining loans for non-traditional assets, geographical barriers to credit, and the red tape associated with short-term loans.
● Offers a borderless, permissionless, and transparent system for borrowing against alternative assets, with fair borrowing terms stored on the blockchain.
● Grants investors the necessary security through asset-backed loans.
● Collateral Network&rsquo;s robust ecosystem includes a marketplace, auctions, and crowdlending features.
● The token offers discounts, auction access, staking, and governance rights to its holders.
● The project has a clear token distribution plan with locked team tokens, a locked liquidity pool, and an audited smart contract.

Investors and experts expect it to grow by 35x during presale and 100x once it lists on major exchanges. Early COLT investors have already gained 40% ROI, and this number is only set to increase due to COLT&rsquo;s strong foundation, doxxed team, and long-term roadmap!</p>
