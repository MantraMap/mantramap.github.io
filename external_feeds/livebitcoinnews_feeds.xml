<li>Ripple price started a downside correction from the $0.5450 zone against the US dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading below $0.520 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.530 on the 4-hours chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).</li>
<li>The pair could start a major increase above the $0.530 resistance.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ripple price is consolidating near $0.520 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-soon-revisit-28500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. XRP price must stay above the $0.4850 support to remain in a bullish zone.</em></p>
<h2>Ripple Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In recent days, Ripple price saw a strong increase above the $0.500 resistance against the US Dollar. The XRP/USD pair even climbed above the $0.52 resistance to move into a positive zone.</p>
<p>There was a steady increase and the price climbed toward the $0.532 resistance. A high was formed near $0.5411 and the price recently corrected lower. There was a move below the $0.520 and $0.500 levels. It tested the $0.4750 zone.</p>
<p>A low is formed near $0.4752 and the price is now rising. It broke the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ripple-price-analysis-bulls-in-control-above-0-50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">$0.50 resistance zone</a>. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5411 swing high to the $0.4752 low. XRP price is now trading below $0.52 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is facing resistance near $0.520 or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5411 swing high to the $0.4752 low. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.530 on the 4-hours chart of the XRP/USD pair.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $0.540 level. A clear move above the $0.540 resistance zone might start a strong increase. In the stated case, the price could even surpass the $0.550 resistance.</p>
<p>Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5800 resistance. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5010 level. The next major support is near the $0.485 level. Any more losses could lead the price toward the $0.4750 level, below which the price might even test $0.4500.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A senior citizen in British Columbia, Canada is the latest victim of a cryptocurrency <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/scam/" data-wpel-link="internal">scam</a>. It’s estimated that the victim, who remains unnamed, has lost more than $7 million.</p>
<h2>British Columbia Citizen Conned Out of Tons of Crypto</h2>
<p>British Columbia authorities have stated <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/b-c-senior-defrauded-of-7-5-million-in-sophisticated-cryptocurrency-scam/ar-AA1asvry" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">this is arguably one of the</a> worst digital currency scams of its kind. The illicit actors in question pulled what they’re calling a “double barreled” approach. First, they stole the old woman’s money. From there, they stole more by claiming to be a team of people that could help her get the money back.</p>
<p>Corporal Philip Ho with the RCMP’s Economic Crime Unit in British Columbia made the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fraudsters are often changing tactics. In this case, it appears they were able to tailor the scam to target this victim in using information about her career and business history to first build trust and friendship. These scammers went to great lengths over many months to defraud this senior and convince her these were legitimate investments. These types of frauds often go unreported, but it’s important that victims come forward to police so we can investigate and help support victims, who are at a higher risk of being re-victimized once they have been defrauded by a scam.</p></blockquote>
<p>The scam began in the spring of 2022. The fraudsters reached out to the woman and said they were looking for data regarding her personal business history. To be fair, this should have been a huge red flag. When was the last time you were contacted and asked questions about this? These kinds of calls don’t normally happen unless you’re enduring a job interview, meaning it was a huge mistake to believe the questions were real.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the scammers initiated a conversation and built trust in the victim, chatting with her in Chinese via email, phone calls, and even by text. From there, they convinced her to invest millions of dollars into a new digital currency project online, and she would be able to check the ongoing balance of her account through (phony) apps the scammers provided to her.</p>
<p>Eventually, she sought to take some money out of the account when she saw she had allegedly made some returns, though this is when the scammers cut off all communication. Interestingly, a police report suggests that <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/canada/burnaby-senior-loses-7-5-million-in-elaborate-cryptocurrency-scam-police-say/ar-AA1arJOF" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">despite being threatened multiple</a> times throughout her chats with the scammers, the woman continued to invest money in the platform. The report said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The victim, who was pressured and threatened throughout the course of the scam, invested more, but unfortunately, this was also a scam.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Even More Funds Disappear</h2>
<p>The scammers later got in touch with her again and pretended to be a team that could help her recover the lost funds.</p>
<p>This resulted in even more money being lost.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto fans need to understand something once and for all: the government is not here to help you, and it is clearly incapable of accomplishing anything major within a reasonable period.</p>
<h2>Crypto Players, It&#8217;s Time to Wake Up!</h2>
<p>This warning applies to all parties and corners of the present political system, whether it&#8217;s democratic, republican, or independent. There are so <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/republicans-arent-happy-with-the-sec-and-gary-genslers-approach-to-crypto-regulation/" data-wpel-link="internal">many committees and</a> so many organizations and so many general players taking up space in the political arena, and yet so few of them seem to finish or achieve anything of significance to the point that it’s almost humorous.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">FTX</a> collapsed seven months ago. It was November of 2022 that the company fell into a heaping pile of bankruptcy and fraud. Since then, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/biden-voices-support-for-crypto-regulation/" data-wpel-link="internal">there have been ongoing</a> calls for digital currency regulation and clarity when it comes to present laws. Any reasonable person should have been working on these aspects the day the collapse occurred. We are now in June, and virtually nothing has been changed or recorded to the present rule books.</p>
<p>Despite the ongoing calls, despite people continuing to trade, and protections still (supposedly) not being in place, we cannot say that Congress or any member of America’s political system has done anything lasting or important. Instead, they are once again concerned with <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/manhattan-grand-jury-voted-whether-indict-trump-rcna73588" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">prosecuting Donald Trump</a> for the umpteenth time and wasting everyone’s resources on phony indictments and garbage that is going to make no difference in the nation’s future.</p>
<p>If this should teach crypto fans anything, it’s that the American political system – as it presently stands – is practically useless. There really shouldn’t be any more calls for regulation or calls for political players to get involved in important matters such as where crypto goes from here. What traders and investors need to concern themselves with is keeping their assets and their practices safe and watching out for themselves and each other.</p>
<h2>So Little Done Thus Far</h2>
<p>It’s been months upon months of criticism from each side <em>for</em> each side. It’s been months of infighting and foolish arguments and childish games that have ultimately led the U.S. into a serious state of decay that will likely take years to recuperate from. The economy is tanking, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/a-key-inflation-gauge-tracked-by-fed-remained-high-in-march/ar-AA1atuxE?OCID=ansmsnnews11" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">inflation is again reaching</a> a new high, and the ringleader of this circus – Joe Biden – is completely incapacitated both mentally and physically, and what’s scary is that nobody wants to talk about it.</p>
<p>And even if this wasn’t the case, even if Congress and other political players were proving themselves entirely capable, calls for regulation in crypto may be a bit overwrought given the industry was designed to push all regulators and prying eyes out of the picture in the first place. If crypto fans want to remain tough and resilient, they will place more focus on themselves and less on government step-ins.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its head Gary Gensler are bullies. They are bullies to the crypto industry and to everyone who tries to issue digital currencies to the common public.</p>
<h2>Republicans Grill the SEC and Gary Gensler</h2>
<p>The actions of Gensler have ultimately <a href="https://www.pionline.com/washington/lawmakers-grill-secs-gensler-cryptocurrency-climate-rule-making" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">made him the subject of wrath</a> amongst various members of Congress who don’t like that he’s persecuting rather than regulating players in the industry. They think he’s using the power he was given through his present position in an abusive way, and Gensler was recently grilled by various members of the House of Representatives, which is currently controlled by republicans.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/gary-gensler/" data-wpel-link="internal">Gensler</a> was quick to defend himself and his actions in the hearing, claiming that members of the crypto arena have been among the most non-compliant ever. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Investors in the crypto market should benefit from the compliance with (the law). It&#8217;s the law. It&#8217;s really not a choice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite his conviction, many republican members of the House weren’t buying his words and were quick to point out that when it comes to regulation, the crypto arena has long been the victim of low or non-existent clarity. They also said that Gensler and the SEC have been following the path of “regulation by enforcement,” and that they haven’t done enough to make the rules understandable.</p>
<p>They stated that the SEC is working to enforce laws on companies that they, themselves, either don’t know exist, or don’t assume will apply to them. It is thus the agency’s job to ensure that these laws are clear to all players. Chairman Patrick McHenry of North Carolina said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Regulation by enforcement is not sufficient nor sustainable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Prior to the hearing, republican lawmakers sent a letter to Gensler and his team criticizing the agency for having a simple, “come in and register” attitude for all digital currency companies. The letter reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>Without clear rules of the road, your push for firms to &#8216;come in and register&#8217; is a willful misrepresentation of the SEC&#8217;s non-existent registration process. The only entity to blame for the lack of registrants is the SEC itself.</p></blockquote>
<h2>We&#8217;ve Done Well!</h2>
<p>Despite this clear distaste towards his actions, Gensler was quick to jump to his own defense and say that he and his staff have done well when it comes to keeping the crypto industry in check. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m very proud of what we&#8217;ve done. We put out 46 proposals to date… and on average, it&#8217;s been more than 70 days from the time we vote it out, we put it on our website, and we have a formal end to a comment period, but then we get comments after that, and we [have] meetings after that, and we engage actively with trade associations and market participants.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican Senator from Texas Ted Cruz says he <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/04/28/crypto-price-warning-china-biden-and-the-fed-could-be-about-to-destroy-all-value-of-bitcoin/?sh=662bc0664631" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">doesn’t want a digital</a> dollar or any central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) entering the fray. He believes they’ll bring about an end to bitcoin, a cryptocurrency he has a lot of respect and admiration for.</p>
<h2>Ted Cruz Is Confident a CBDC Would Hurt BTC</h2>
<p>In a recent statement, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ted-cruz/" data-wpel-link="internal">Cruz</a> said the following about CBDCs:</p>
<blockquote><p>We see China moving forward with the intention of using a CBDC to destroy all value of bitcoin, to destroy anonymity, to destroy decentralization. Joe Biden, early in his presidency, issued an executive order directing the Federal Reserve to study creating a CBDC, and the New York branch of the Fed is working on doing exactly that.</p></blockquote>
<p>One can understand his fear. Central bank digital currencies go against everything bitcoin and its initial altcoin counterparts are going for. Initially, they were all designed to serve as decentralized forms of payment for individuals across the globe. Those who couldn’t gain access to products and services in the traditional financial arena could gain them through bitcoin, which only needs a wallet and an internet connection to function and be transferable.</p>
<p>However, with central banks in the mix, these notions would ultimately become null and void. These banks would be the ones issuing the currencies in question, not miners or developers. They would decide who could use them and who would gain access to them. These currencies would destroy all that the first cryptocurrencies stood for and bring about an end to the crypto industry as we know it.</p>
<p>In addition, CBDCs would likely give rise to a new wave of governmental power. Regulators around the world would be able to spy on us and see what we were using our money for. They could look in on our activities and potentially get in the way anytime they wanted.</p>
<p>Cruz thinks CBDCs are wrong for a modern and free world. When discussing how a CBDC could be used against people through government protocols, he stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think that&#8217;s exceptionally dangerous. I&#8217;m very concerned about the risk of a CBDC.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Trying to Keep the Danger Out</h2>
<p>He is also very confident that a CBDC used nationally by everyone would make bitcoin less unique, and thus cause the father of all crypto to become virtually obsolete. He has no doubt that the issuance of a digital dollar or other CBDC would cause the currency to lose all its value. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The same people that want to see a CBDC, they hate bitcoin, and they hate cash. Let&#8217;s be clear: they don&#8217;t like cash for exactly the reason I like cash because it is not subjected to centralized control that is not subject to constant surveillance.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2022, Cruz submitted legislation that if passed, would prevent the establishment of a digital dollar in America.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jack Dorsey is creating what he’s calling the “Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund” that will, according to a recent statement, ensure <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/jack-dorseys-bitcoin-legal-defense-161256117.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">the open-source nature</a> of all bitcoin’s code.</p>
<h2>Jack Dorsey to the Rescue!</h2>
<p>The idea behind bitcoin is that it should help those who cannot gain access to standard financial products and services. Bitcoin doesn’t care about your history or your financial credit. All it needs is an internet connection and a wallet, and from there, it will perform its magic and keep you autonomous and independent when it comes to your monetary situation.</p>
<p>However, Jack Dorsey is worried that these days could come to an end thanks to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/craig-wright/" data-wpel-link="internal">Craig Wright</a>, an Australian computer scientist who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the man behind the world’s number one digital currency by market cap. He is presently suing 11 separate crypto developers. Wright filed the suit against them after he said that it was their job to prevent all hacks and compromises of his personal network.</p>
<p>When his system was indeed overtaken by cyberthieves several years back, he allegedly had his private keys stolen from him, resulting in him being cut off from billions of dollars in BTC he says he owned. Dorsey is using his new bitcoin legal fund to defend those that Wright is going after. The case was initially dismissed, but an appeals court is now allowing the case to move forward in 2024.</p>
<p>Lord Justice Birss – who oversaw the appeals situation – said bitcoin’s academic literature alone is enough to question the fully decentralized nature of blockchain. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the decentralized governance of bitcoin really is a myth, then in my judgment, there is much to be said for the submission that bitcoin developers, while acting as developers, owe fiduciary duties to the true owners of that property.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dorsey and some of his team have since penned a letter challenging these findings. It reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>Litigation and continued threats are having their intended effect. Individual defendants have chosen to capitulate in the absence of legal support. Open-source developers, who are often independent, are especially susceptible to legal pressure. In response, we propose a coordinated and formalized response to help defend developers.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Bitcoin Is Designed for Open-Source Purposes</h2>
<p>One of the big things that appears to be working in the defendants’ case is that bitcoin was potentially released under an open-source MIT license, which at the time of writing, states:</p>
<blockquote><p>In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dorsey thus argues that a win for Wright would bring about the end of all bitcoin’s initial design factors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to crypto, Congress – especially members of the House of Representatives – appear to be split right down the middle. Some <a href="https://www.pionline.com/cryptocurrency/lawmakers-clash-over-need-new-cryptocurrency-laws" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">want strict laws in place</a>, while others – such as various members of the democrat party – believe there are already sufficient statutes in place designed to keep the space stable and customers protected.</p>
<h2>Whether You&#8217;re a Democrat or Republican, Crypto Regulation is Rough</h2>
<p>One of those people is Stephen F. Lynch, a Massachusetts democrat. In an opening statement before the Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion Subcommittee, Lynch said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It seems unnecessary to reinvent the rules when we already have a regulatory regime that is, indeed, effective.</p></blockquote>
<p>Agreeing with him is Maxine Waters, a democrat representative from California. She serves as the top democrat on the House Financial Services Committee. She said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite what those across the aisle may say, we do not need to create an entirely new and special framework for crypto. We already have one.</p></blockquote>
<p>Others, however, were quick to say otherwise. French Hill – a republican from Arkansas and the subcommittee chairman – commented that one of the biggest problems the crypto arena is constantly having to contend with is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) constantly being at war with each other regarding who should “rule” over the industry.</p>
<p>So long as rules are not set in place designating which areas should be controlled or overseen by which federal agencies, things are always going to be hairy. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>The SEC and the CFTC have created an impossible situation where the same firms are subject to competing enforcement actions by the two different agencies. Absent legislation, our regulators are only pushing entrepreneurs, developers and job creators offshore out of the U.S. system. We have a responsibility to protect our constituents. There are glaring gaps in consumer and investor protections, and regulation by enforcement does nothing to fill that gap.</p></blockquote>
<p>House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry – a republican from the state of North Carolina – is concerned that overly strict regulation will push crypto exchanges and similar platforms out of America and cause them to set up shop on international land. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Congress doesn&#8217;t act, the rest of the world will.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Losing Companies?</h2>
<p>The U.S. is already at risk of losing its main crypto exchange player Coinbase, which recently took out a business license to operate on <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/04/19/coinbase-gets-bermuda-license-plans-to-launch-offshore-exchange-in-coming-weeks/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">the shores of Bermuda</a>. The company is concerned about the country not getting it together when it comes to clear regulation.</p>
<p>The calls for crypto regulation have increased over the last six or seven months given the dire state of the industry in 2022 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">fateful collapse of FTX</a>, which at one time, was considered one of the largest and most prominent trading platforms around.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Birla Cellulose is a company that’s utilizing blockchain technology to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/birla-greentrack-powered-blockchain-technology-131120821.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">ensure all customers know</a> where their products are coming from, where everything is sourced, and that everything is sustainable.</p>
<h2>Birla Cellulose Is Using Blockchain for Traceability of Fashion Products</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/blockchain/" data-wpel-link="internal">Blockchain</a> is designed to give everything full transparency. It’s mostly used in crypto transactions to record all the data and give everyone full awareness of who’s involved and where the money is going, but there are many industries in which blockchain is now being applied so that consumers and businesses partners can see where products and services derive from and where they wind up.</p>
<p>Birla Cellulose focuses on sustainably sourced, man-made cellulosic fiber products certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI). The goal is to have proof of record for every product showing that they do, indeed, stem from the manufacturing plants and warehouses of Birla Cellulose.</p>
<p>Vaishali Kamble – assistant general manager of business development at the company – gave the following statement about blockchain use:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sustainability in textiles is a growing trend in the fashion industry as consumers are more conscious and aware of the environmental impact. Consumers are shifting their behavior to buy and use clothing that is sustainable and kind to the environment.</p></blockquote>
<p>The blockchain helping the company in its present endeavors is one produced by Kamble and his fellow executives. Known as Green Track, the network fully captures the traceability of each item, starting with the origin and ending with the final product. All this information is indiscriminately shared with both stakeholders and shareholders alike. Kamble continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>The textile industry is considered to be self-reliant because products at each stage are used as the raw material for the next stage of production, but the process of tracing each step of the clothes manufacturing process, from sourcing of the raw materials to the factories where those materials are made into garments, was missing.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Keeping Things Clean and Clear</h2>
<p>Tiana Quinny – manager of fiber traceability at Birla Cellulose – commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Current chain-of-custody processes fall short in physical or material authentications, which may lead to false claims and the sourcing of fibers and materials with unchecked environmental risks. Green Track allows real-time access to the raw material journey at every stage of the production process across the complex textile value chain. The technology was built to have two-fold provenance tracking: value chain traceability and source verification through a molecular tracer. The traceability feature improves accountability for the value chain, thus encouraging the brands to adopt the technology… Green Track provides a platform for traceability and transparency that helps to strengthen the… consumers’ connections. The consumer can scan the code and get the complete visibility from forest to fashion, which helps them choose the proper product and expand adoption of the Aditya Birla Group’s cellulosic fibers.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aria DiMezzo has been sentenced to 18 months in prison <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/aria-dimezzo-of-crypto-6-sentenced-to-18-months-for-bitcoin-scam/ar-AA1alvM6" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">after she was charged</a> with running an unlicensed crypto exchange. The platform was ultimately used by scammers who defrauded elderly individuals in ongoing <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/romance-scams/" data-wpel-link="internal">romance scams</a>.</p>
<h2>Aria DiMezzo Will Serve Her Time in Prison</h2>
<p>DiMezzo was one of six people charged following the raid of a home by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the town of Keene, New Hampshire. Known as the “Crypto 6,” these individuals have also faced charges of money laundering and tax evasion.</p>
<p>DiMezzo and the rest of her crew would often call the elderly individuals in their area and feign romantic interest. They would then work to develop relationships with their victims online or over the phone and seek to gain their trust. From there, they would tell the people they were defrauding about some kind of financial trouble they were enduring and ask if they could wire crypto to their wallets. From there, the money received would be laundered and converted to other assets to hide the activity.</p>
<p>Seth Aframe – an assistant United States attorney – commented on the case in an interview, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Because it wasn’t a safe business, people were hurt. People gave money to Ms. DiMezzo’s business, and they were defrauded.</p></blockquote>
<p>Initially, DiMezzo was facing a maximum penalty of 37 months or just over three years in prison. She and her lawyer argued that only one year was necessary, and that the sentence should occur via home confinement. The argument was that she had no idea scams were taking place.</p>
<p>The present sentence is a situation in which both sides appear to be meeting on middle ground. While the sentence is not the maximum and only a little longer than the requested period, DiMezzo will be required to serve her time in an eight-by-nine cell.</p>
<p>Richard Guerriero – the defendant’s attorney – explained to the judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>As misguided as she was about the licensing issue, she wasn’t trying to defraud anyone. The only thing she did wrong was not have a license.</p></blockquote>
<p>Prosecutors, however, argued that she was in full control and had full awareness of what she was doing in that she earned more than $3 million engaging in said activity in 2020 alone. In addition, they pointed members of the court towards a video in which she refers to one of the victims as “stupid” and “an idiot.” Aframe said:</p>
<blockquote><p>That’s a recipe for disaster and makes the crime more aggravated than simply not getting a license.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Feelings of Remorse</h2>
<p>In a statement, DiMezzo said she felt bad about her actions, claiming:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have nothing but regret… I thought we were making banks frustrated. My goal was to bring down the banks.</p></blockquote>
<p>She also said she will not appeal the decision and will serve her time in jail.</p>
