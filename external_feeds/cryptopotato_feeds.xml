			            <description><![CDATA[Huobi Korea wants to be an independent exchange. It will buy all of its shares and rebrand to distance itself from Huobi Global.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On January 9, reports circulated that the cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Korea announced plans to sever its relationship with its parent company Huobi Global.</p>
<p>According to the statement shared by <a href="https://www.news1.kr/articles/4919434" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">News1</a>, Huobi Korea will change its name to divorce itself from Huobi Global, as they have been facing a lot of problems due to domestic regulations.</p>
<p>Huobi Global is a cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2013 by Du Jun and Leon Li, the company&#8217;s current CEO. At the time, Huobi was one of the largest exchanges in the world, competing head-to-head with Binance and Coinbase. It currently ranks 16th among the top exchanges, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<h2>Huobi Korea To Buy All Shares Held By Huobi Global</h2>
<p>According to News1, Cho Kook-bong, the current chairman of Huobi Korea, is making all the arrangements to buy all the shares of Huobi Korea, the vast majority (about 72%) of which are owned by Leon Li.</p>
<p>Once all the shares are purchased, Huobi Korea will rebrand to &#8220;draw a line with Huobi Global.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Huobi executives did not touch on the issue of the company&#8217;s native HT token, it is noticeable that it has dropped nearly 25% in the past 30 days following rumors of the company&#8217;s insolvency and the announcement of massive layoffs.</p>
<figure id="attachment_232375" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-232375" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HTUSDT_2023-01-09_21-25-39-1.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-232375 size-large" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HTUSDT_2023-01-09_21-25-39-1-1024x537.png" alt="Price of Huobi Token.

Image: Tradingview</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Huobi Korea Has Faced Multiple Problems Due To Its Link With Huobi Global</h2>
<p>One of the most important reasons why Huobi Korea decided to distance itself from Huobi Global is due to regulations, as in 2021, the exchange had to suspend all transactions for five months to comply with regulations following a change in Huobi Global&#8217;s corporate location.</p>
<p>Huobi Korea wants to prove that it can be a safe &#8220;domestic exchange&#8221; by dropping its image of &#8220;Chinese exchange,&#8221; according to an employee currently working for the exchange.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Huobi Korea has suffered from foreign exchanges, especially because of the image of a &#8216;Chinese exchange&#8217;. It can be interpreted as trying to show that it is a &#8216;domestic exchange&#8217; that is as safe as it is.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Huobi Global is working to regain the trust of its users.</h2>
<p>As CryptoPotato recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/trons-justin-sun-confirms-20-layoff-at-huobi/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a>, Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain and current member of Huobi Global&#8217;s advisory board, confirmed rumors of mass layoffs of the company&#8217;s staff, urging people to ignore all the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/huobi-reportedly-plans-mass-layoffs-and-salary-cuts/" data-wpel-link="internal">FUD about the company&#8217;s insolvency</a> that caused multi-million dollar withdrawals at the end of December 2022.</p>
<p>On January 8, Huobi Global <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1612133935013826563" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">announced</a> a bounty program using Sun&#8217;s image to tackle the communication problems that caused many investors to leave the company.</p>
<figure id="attachment_232376" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-232376" style="width: 674px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-5.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-232376 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-5.png" alt="" width="674" height="708" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-5.png 674w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-5-286x300.png 286w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-5-48x50.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-232376" class="wp-caption-text">Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1612133935013826563" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Twitter</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to Sun, Huobi Global users will be able to directly ask Huobi&#8217;s technical support any questions &#8220;about the assets, functions, and operations&#8221; of the exchange at any time.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The team will regularly evaluate criticisms and suggestions on various aspects, such as experience, and those who adopt the implementation will be rewarded with great gifts and reward packages.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Although the layoffs are happening, Huobi Global is working to regain users&#8217; trust, which right now is the most important thing for any exchange, especially after the multi-million dollar collapse of FTX.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency firms raised over $21 billion last year, nearly $16 billion less than the amount in 2021.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cryptocurrency projects obtained 42.5% less funding in 2022 compared to what they received in 2021.Â </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Still, last year&#8217;s capital was significantly higher than the figures in 2018, 2019, and 2020.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Funding in 2022Â </span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The crypto winter that hit the digital asset industry in 2022 has triggered a major market decline, an outflow of investor interest, and halted the expansion plans of some companies. According to a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/crypto-funding-over-time" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">CoinGecko study</a>, such firms had raised $21.26 billion last year, and almost half was secured during Q1, when the sector was in much better shape.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The numerous collapses of cryptocurrency projects by the middle of the year, such asÂ </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/4-valuable-lessons-from-terras-collapse-opinion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">the Terra crash</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Â and the bankruptcies ofÂ </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/three-arrows-capital-ordered-into-liquidation-by-a-birtish-virgin-islands-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Three Arrows Capital (3AC)</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, and Celsius Network, affected the investors&#8217; sentiment and the raised capital in Q3 was just $3.61 billion.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In comparison, cryptocurrency entities completed fundraisers worth over $37 billion in 2021. The bull market back then and the fact that most digital assets, including bitcoin, charted all-time high prices seemed to have stimulated record investments.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite the decline in 2022, last year was more successful than 2018 ($16.22 billion raised), 2019 ($4.48 billion), and 2020 ($4.40 billion). Coingecko explained the possible reason behind this:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The relatively better funding performance in 2022 points to the cryptocurrency industry&#8217;s growth over the last five years, supported by more projects securing financial backing and increasing interest from institutional investors.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Flare â a layer 1 oracle network â has initiated its FLR token airdrop across multiple major exchanges including Binance, OKX, Kraken, Bithumb, UpBit, Kucoin, and BitBank, among others.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With 4.279 billion FLR tokens distributed to millions of users, the airdrop marks one of the most large-scale token distributions in crypto history.Â </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">According to a press release, Flareâs initial airdrop represents 15% of the FLRâs total token distribution. It took place at 23:59 UTC on January 9.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The remaining 85% of tokens will be distributed over the next 36 months according to the community vote on </span><a href="https://flare.network/fip01/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Flare Improvement Proposal 01</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">If passed, the proposal would place a hard cap on FLRâs annual inflation at 5 billion tokens per annum.Â </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Flare network is designed to allow developers to build apps that are interoperable with the internet and other blockchains.Â </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The network leverages its State Connector to let smart contracts securely interact with information sourced from other blockchains.Â </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, the Flare Time Series Oracle provides prices and data series to dapps without relying on centralized data providers. Flare describes it as a âhighly decentralized data feed oracleâ that sources data from nearly 100 independent data providers.Â </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Â âFor the blockchain industry to flourish, we need more useful decentralized applications,â said Hugo Philion, CEO &amp; Co-founder of Flare. âFlare is tackling this through data, not just prices but transaction details, Web2 events etc, so that developers can build applications that provide more utility to a larger group of users.â</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hugo added that Flare could usher in new use cases such as triggering a smart contract through a transaction on another blockchain or allowing non-smart contract tokens to be bridged to Flare.Â </span></li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Smartphone-based blockchain mining project Pi Network has issued another clarification on the unauthorized listing of Pi coins, saying they are not available for trading yet. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Pi Network has been in existence since 2018 and launched its Pi coin for mining by its community members, called âPioneers,â in March 2019. These assets can be traded once Pi Network upgrades to Open Mainnet. </span></p>
<h2>Pi Network Disclaimer</h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Right now, the network is in the Enclosed Mainnet state, which makes its interaction with any third-party âtechnically impossible.â</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The blockchain project issued a similar disclaimer on December 29, in which it said it was aware of reports that several unauthorized exchanges sought to list Pi or other products purported to be the native cryptocurrency.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">âIt is important to reiterate that Pi is currently in the Enclosed Network and is not approved by Pi Network for listing on any exchange or for trading, and Pi Network was not involved with any of these purported postings or listings,â the December 29Â </span><a href="https://minepi.com/announcements/2022-12-29" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">announcement</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Â said.</span></p></blockquote>
<h2>What is the Whole Fuss About?</h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Pi Network, which claims to have about 35 million members who have been mining Pi coins on its smartphone-based blockchain mining app, is slated to upgrade to Open Mainnet. Right now, itâs processing the KYC of its members to onboard them to the upgraded network where they can trade their Pi coins.</span></p>

On November 15, the network said it has crossed two million </span><a href="https://twitter.com/PiCoreTeam/status/1592310991614021632" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">followers</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Â on Twitter, a sign of its growing popularity.Â </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">But, officially, Pi coins are neither available for listing nor for purchasing. Those interested must join the network and mine them.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Anticipating a brighter outlook for the Pi coin, some crypto exchanges have reportedly listed the asset on their platforms. Justin Sunâs Huobi is reportedly one of them, as </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hackapreneur/status/1611292694499962883" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">revealed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by crypto journalist Justin Wu in a tweet.</span></p>
<h2>Unauthorized Listing</h2>

<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ââ¦ Pi Network has no association with any of these exchanges, which are acting without the consent, authority, or involvement of the network.</span> Further, the products being traded on these exchanges are not the real Pi tokens,â it added.</p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The unauthorized listing of purported Pi coins by some exchanges comes close on the heels ofÂ <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/alameda-research-reportedly-frontran-new-token-listings-on-ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">news</a>Â that Alameda Research frontran tokens before their listings on exchanges.Â </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The CFTC isnât buying Eisenbergâs argument that his attack on Mango Markets was a legal act.Â ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has charged Mango Markets exploiter Avraham Eisenberg with violating federal commodities laws during his $110 million manipulation attack in October.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The commission seeks various forms of penalties and relief from the attacker, some of which include trading bans, restitution, and disgorgement.</span></p>
<h2>Eisenberg&#8217;s Crime</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Per the </span><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66707334/1/unknown-case-title/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">complaint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> filed on Monday, the CFTC said that Eisenberg misappropriated over $100 million from the Mango Markets platform by engaging in a âmanipulativeâ and âdeceptiveâ scheme to inflate the price of swaps on the platform.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During the </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/hacktober-finished-with-657-million-losses-from-crypto-exploits/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">October</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> exploit, Eisenberg manipulated the price of MNGO â the platformâs native token â such that he was able to âborrowâ copious funds from the platform that he had no intention of repaying. He did this by initially purchasing 400 million MNGO-USDC Swaps on Mango Markets for roughly $19 million. Due to the relative illiquidity of MNGO, this purchase caused the tokenâs price to skyrocket fromÂ  $0.04 to $0.54 apiece within 30 minutes.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Using the protocolâs Oracle reflecting this newly inflated MNGO price, Eisenberg was able to âborrowâ â or drain â the protocol of all available liquidity. This included $114 million of far more liquid and popular cryptos, such as Bitcoin, Ether, and Tether. This left Mango Markets, and its other users with smaller position sizes, âholding a mostly empty bag.â</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">âThrough this conduct, Defendant has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act,â explained the commission.Â </span></p></blockquote>
<h2>Admitting to the Act</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While most DeFi hackers take care to keep their identities private, Eisenberg publicly bragged about his exploit of Mango Markets shortly after committing his attack. Weeks afterward, he referred to his exploit as a âprofitable tradeâ while </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/mango-markets-exploiter-says-profitable-traders-like-him-attract-jealousy-and-hate/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">accusing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> his critics of being âjealous.â</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">âI believe all of our actions were legal open market actions, using the protocol as designed, even if the development team did not fully anticipate all the consequences of setting parameters the way they are,â he said at the time.Â </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the CFTC argued the opposite in its filing, saying the exploiter&#8217;s actions âconstituted blatant manipulation of spot prices and swaps.âÂ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eisenberg was </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/mango-markets-110m-exploiter-arrested-faces-charges-in-new-york/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">arrested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> late last year in Puerto Rico by the Justice Department on similar charges levied in New York. In a signed deposition, FBI special agent Brandon Racz stated that Eisenberg may have secretly known his actions were illegal, based on his departure to Israel within 24 hours of exploiting the Defi exchange.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eisenberg and his team were later responsible for launching a </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/mango-markets-exploiter-launches-shitcoin-to-abuse-bots-warns-twitter-community/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">short attack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on Aave, which ultimately failed and led to significant losses on his part.Â </span></p>

<li>The asset was quick to react to the news, spiking by over 68% (for the past 24 hours).Â Still, its current valuation of around $0.04 is far below the all-time high of almost $0.80 registered in November 2021.</li>
<li>&#8220;The Rock&#8221; (famous for playing in &#8220;Fast and Furious&#8221; and &#8220;Jumanji&#8221;) and Wahlberg (starring in blockbusters like &#8220;The Departed&#8221; and &#8220;The Fighter&#8221;) have not yet commented on their collaboration with Gala Games.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[The bug only impacted the nodes run by the foundation.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Solana Foundation&#8217;s Remote Procedure Call (RPC) endpoints went offline on January 8th as a result of a bug in the Validator clientâs test release 1.14.</p>
<p>According to an update by Solana Status, the bug <a href="https://twitter.com/SolanaStatus/status/1611952767576178690" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">affected</a> those nodes that adopted the latest test release and advised those operating on the node to change over to 1.13. RPC endpoints are essentially the nodes that connect decentralized applications (DApps) and wallets to the blockchain.</p>
<ul>
<li>The incident, however, did not impact Solanaâs block production as opposed to previous cases of outages that froze the network&#8217;s ability to produce block for hours.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Mainnet beta Explorer and Solana Foundation Public RPC endpoints are currently offline as RPC node software is upgraded, following a bug in test release 1.14. Block production has not been impacted and the Solana network has not been impacted.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The bug only affected the RPCs run by the foundation, while the private ones offered by firms, including Triton, QuickNode, and Alchemy, on the other hand, remained operational.</li>
<li>While clarifying that the affected RPCs represent just a tiny subset of Solana&#8217;s RPC infrastructure, Austin Federa, Solana Foundation&#8217;s Head of Strategy &amp; Communications, stated,</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Solana Foundation&#8217;s RPCs are a severely rate-limited service that&#8217;s not meant for anything production-grade, just testing and casual use. Solana Foundation&#8217;s RPC infra is intentionally on the bleeding edge of release candidates to do just this &#8211; find bugs in low-impact situations.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Solana <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/solana-suffers-major-setback-as-development-activity-plunges-sol-dumps-hard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">suffered</a> a handful of outages and transaction stops last year amidst the crushing crypto winter, dragging SOL&#8217;s price down massively.</li>
<li>2023, however, started off on a fairly positive note for the native token. In fact, SOL saw the best first week of the year out of any top-20 crypto-assets by market cap.</li>
<li>Over the past 24 hours alone, SOL was up by 22% and is currently trading at above $16.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Sam Bankman-Fried just lost over $400 million of his Robinhood equity, despite prior objections.Â ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) and his former right-hand, Gary Wang, are unable to retain ownership of almost half a billion dollars worth of Robinhood shares, according to a court document dated January 6th.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has seized the executivesâ holdings in response to charges of wide-ranging fraud against Bankman-Fried and FTX, with which the equity investments may be involved.Â </span></p>
<h2>No More Robinhood Shares</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><a href="https://www.pacermonitor.com/view/CUWLH7I/BlockFi_Inc__njbke-22-19361__0203.0.pdf?mcid=tGI4TONY" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">document</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, filed in a New Jersey bankruptcy court, revealed that the DOJ had seized 55,273,469 shares of Robinhood, alongside another $20,746,713.67 from ED&amp;F Man Capital Markets â a holding company controlled by both SBF and Wang. With each Robinhood share trading at $8.50 at writing time, the total value of the seized stock and cash is roughly $490 million.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the Department, the seized assets count as property and proceeds involved in violations of various criminal statutes, including wire fraud and money laundering. Last month, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned an eight-count indictment charging SBF with such crimes, alongside conspiracy to commit securities fraud, commodities fraud, and campaign finance violations.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Â âThe Government expects that the evidence will show that Bankman-Fried </span><span style="font-weight: 400">defrauded FTX customers by misappropriating their funds for his personal use, including to invest for his own account, to make undisclosed venture investments,â wrote the DOJ.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The DOJ </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-government-to-seize-465m-worth-of-robinhood-shares-linked-to-sbf-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">showed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> intent to seize the shares last week â 90% of which were owned by Bankman-Fried, and 10% by Wang. Bankman-Friedâs lawyers </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sbf-wants-to-keep-control-of-450-million-worth-of-robinhood-shares/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">objected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to the potential seizure at the time, claiming it was âinappropriateâ to automatically assume those shares were bought with illegitimate funds.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Testifying to Congress last month, FTXâs bankruptcy lawyer and new CEO, John Ray, stated that FTX comingled user assets with Alameda Research, where those assets were used for margin trading.Â </span></p>
<h2>What Does SBF Have Left?<b><br />
</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During an interview at Dealbrook Summit in November, SBF claimed to only have $100,000 left in his bank account â an inkling of his multi-billion dollar net worth prior to FTXâs collapse.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bankman-Fried was extradited to the US from the Bahamas on the DOJâs order in December but was later </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sam-bankman-fried-released-on-a-250m-bail-can-stay-at-parents-house/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">released</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on $250 million bail. He is locked in the Northern District of California while awaiting trial and disallowed from taking out any new lines of credit until then.Â </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Shanghai upgrade will include withdrawals only. EOF did not make the cut. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shanghai upgrade&#8217;s tentative timeline is set for March 2023, and the Ethereum developers are scaling back and targeting early February to launch its public testnets.</p>
<p>The high-profile upgrade seeks to enable validator staking withdrawals. This feature is currently lacking in the Ethereum network, and the devs deem it the highest priority for the first quarter of 2023. Following the planned hard fork, the users will be able to access coins that have been staked on the network. It is important to note that these assets in question became briefly inaccessible as part of the Merge in September.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Developers aim to launch public testnets for the Shanghai/Capella upgrade next month and tentatively schedule a mainnet launch for the upgrade sometime in March 2023.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the incorporation of an additional feature set is now off the table. Instead, ETH withdrawals, which are currently being tested on a developer-focused test network, are prioritized over code changes.</p>
<h2>Debate Over EOF</h2>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.galaxy.com/research/insights/ethereum-all-core-developers-execution-call-152/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">call</a>, the developers agreed to remove EOF from the Shanghai upgrade and is likely to be shipped later. Additionally, any additional Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) from Shanghai in place of the EOF EIPs were also rejected to ensure that the timeline for staked ETH withdrawals does not get delayed.</p>
<p>EOF, which stands for EVM Object Format, essentially introduces various modifications to the code execution environment of Ethereum. However, the developers working on EOF implementation met twice during the holidays to discuss EIP specifications. They agreed to remove EIP 6206 due to its complexity and make the data section in these EIPs mandatory, instead of optional, in a bid to marginally enhance the simplicity of data parsing.</p>
<h2>Hot Take on EIP-4844</h2>
<p>EIP-4844 has also been a controversial proposal that aims to introduce a new kind of transaction type to the network. It accepts &#8220;blobs&#8221; of data to be persisted in the beacon node for a short period of time and does not become permanently etched in the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>The EIP-4844 is not only expected to facilitate an ecosystem-wide move to rollups but also focuses on bringing fees down significantly and enabling Ethereum to remain competitive without sacrificing decentralization.</p>
<p>The debate surrounding Ethereum stakers&#8217; ability to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/talking-ethereum-2-0-with-consensys-pm-matt-nelson-when-can-eth-validators-unstake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">withdraw</a> the coins has received significant attention. For certain devs like PÃ©ter SzilÃ¡gyi, EIP-4844 is more important than the deadline as well as withdrawals. SzilÃ¡gyi <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8jZ11_CQGo&amp;t=1721s" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">said</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Withdrawals brings absolutely nothing to make Ethereum better. Whereas with 4844 you actually have the capacity to make it better.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Buterin&#8217;s Take</h2>
<p>But for many, including Ethereum Founder, Vitalik Buterin, letting the target slip is not an option. Expressing his thoughts on the EOF upgrade, Buterin <a href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eof-proposal-ban-code-introspection-of-eof-accounts/12113/16" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">proposed</a> to ban &#8220;code introspection,&#8221; which essentially refers to the ability to run code to inspect or examine other code that is also running on the EVM. This is expected to develop more complex contracts that rely on the characteristics of other contracts.</p>
<p>As such, no other features will be introduced instead of enabling withdrawals in Shanghai. The EOF could be coupled with EIP-4844 and shipped three or four months later, in the summer.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[History suggests that bitcoin could be heading for a volatile week. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The consumer price index excluding food and energy (core CPI) numbers will be released by the United States government on Thursday, January 12.</p>
<p>Although the most recent months saw a decline in the inflation rates compared to the peaks in the summer of 2022, the estimates still show a painful picture.</p>
<h2>Here Are the Expectations</h2>
<p>The upcoming CPI numbers will play a crucial role in the US Federal Reserve&#8217;s decision on whether to continue its current monetary policy of raising interest rates. Given how 2022 went and the increase to 4.5% within a year, it would be wise to assume that more hikes are coming.</p>
<p>This is also supported by the general estimations of what the CPI numbers for December will be. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2023/01/03/whens-the-january-cpi-report-and-what-to-expect-from-it/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">According</a> to the Cleveland Fed, the month-over-month for December could clock in at 0.5%, while the YoY should go above 6%.</p>
<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/us-cpi-will-help-determine-size-of-next-fed-rate-hike-eco-week-1.1866950" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">quoted</a> more modest data, saying the MoM increase will be 0.3%, which would put the yearly rise at 5.7%. Nevertheless, this would still represent the highest CPI jump for December in over 41 years.</p>
<blockquote><p>âThe favorable inflation developments arenât a result of Fed rate hikes &#8211; theyâre mostly explained by Chinaâs ugly exit from Covid-zero and unusually warm winter. Still, the decline in energy prices has helped to sharply reduce near-term inflation expectations and has made inflation risks more two-sided. If this trend continues, it could be the âcompellingâ evidence the Fed needs to see before it pauses or considers cutting rates.â &#8211; commented two Bloomberg economists.</p></blockquote>
<h2>What About Bitcoin?</h2>
<p>Bitcoin has had a favorable start in 2023, gaining almost $1,000 in just over a week. This resulted in the asset <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cardano-ada-skyrockets-17-bitcoin-breaks-17k-after-1-month-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">breaking above</a> $17,000 for the first time in about a month.</p>
<p>Given its <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/why-does-bitcoin-go-crazy-whenever-cpi-numbers-are-published/" data-wpel-link="internal">history</a> with major US announcements, including the CPI numbers, though, it&#8217;s safe to assume that BTC could face a volatile end of the working week. In fact, there are some analysts <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-reclaims-17k-but-final-capitulation-may-not-be-in-yet-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">predicting</a> that bitcoin could head toward $20,000 on better-than-expected CPI numbers, especially if the US stock market pumps as well.</p>
<p>Whether higher or lower, each previous example has shown that bitcoin reacts with <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/major-bitcoin-and-ethereum-volatility-as-us-inflation-cpi-clocks-in-at-8-3/" data-wpel-link="internal">immediate price movements</a>, which makes the Thursday announcement even more important for the entire cryptocurrency market.</p>
