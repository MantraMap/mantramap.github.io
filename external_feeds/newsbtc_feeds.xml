					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price climbed further higher above $18,500. BTC tested the $19,000 resistance zone and is currently consolidating gains. Bitcoin climbed further higher above the $18,000 and $18,500 resistance levels. The price is trading above $18,200 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support near $18,600 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could correct lower towards the $18,500 and $18,350 support levels. Bitcoin Price Tests $19K Bitcoin price remained well bid above the $18,000 zone. BTC formed another bullish breakout and was able to surge above the $18,500 resistance zone, unlike ethereum. The price cleared the $18,800 resistance zone and even spiked above the $19,000 level. A high is formed near $19,098 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $18,900 level. The price declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $17,927 swing low to $19,098 high.

The next major resistance is near the $19,200 zone, above which the price might start another steady increase. In the stated case, the price may perhaps rise towards the $19,500 level. Any more gains might send btc price towards the $20,000 level. Downside Correction in BTC? If bitcoin price fails to clear the $19,000 resistance, it could start a downside correction. An immediate support on the downside is near the $18,650 level. The next major support is near the $18,500 level and the trend line. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $17,927 swing low to $19,098 high. The main support is now forming near the $17,800 level, below which the price might retest $17,000. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $18,650, followed by $18,500.

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum has rallied above $1,400 today as on-chain data shows ETH sharks have been busy accumulating recently. Related Reading: Altcoin Volume Dominance At Highest Since Jan 2021, Trouble For Bitcoin? Ethereum Shark Addresses Have Grown By 3,000 In the Last Two Months As per data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the current number of shark addresses in the market is the highest since February 2021. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;ETH Supply Distribution,&#8221; which tells us which coin groups have how many wallets. These coin groups are ranges that define the number of coins the addresses currently hold in a particular group. For example, the 1-10 coins cohort includes all wallets holding at least one and at most 10 ETH. The Supply Distribution metric for this group would then track the total number of addresses falling inside this range. In the context of the current topic, the coin group of interest is the 100-10,000 coins cohort (which is made up of two separate groups, 100-1,000 coins, and 1,000-10,000 coins; they have just been merged). Now, here is a chart that shows the Supply Distribution data for this Ethereum coin group: It looks like the value of this metric has observed some uptrend in recent weeks &#124; Source: Santiment on Twitter This coin group&#8217;s lower and upper bounds convert to around $140,000 and $14 million. The Ethereum investors who hold amounts in this range are called the sharks, and although they aren&#8217;t as crucial as the whales, movements from these holders can still have significant implications on the market. As shown in the above graph, the Ethereum sharks were taking profits during September and October last year as their total number of addresses declined to a low. However, over the past few months, accumulation has rapidly taken place in the market as 3,000 new shark addresses have been created on the network. ETH has been rallying in recent days as these sharks have been accumulating, and for now, these investors aren&#8217;t showing any signs of stopping either. The total number of addresses belonging to this cohort is 48,556, the highest level the indicator has seen since February 2021, almost two years ago. If these sharks budge here and take some profits while the prices are high, the rally might lose steam and end. However, if these investors keep this accumulation up instead, it would be a bullish sign for Ethereum, and the rally may continue.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price made a 5% move today, poking above $19,000 momentarily. It is currently the largest daily climb of 2023 and since the FTX collapse.  More significantly, the sharp rally tagged a level that triggered a possible trend change according to the weekly Parabolic SAR. In the past, the technical indicator has lived up to its name. What could it mean this time? Bitcoin Makes Biggest Move Of 2023 The start of 2023 has been positive for altcoins. But up until today, Bitcoin has been mild by comparison.  Following today’s CPI data release coming in at 6.5% and Biden’s victory lap on inflation, Bitcoin price soared by $1,000, taking the top cryptocurrency above $19,000 briefly.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: What Elliott Wave Theory Suggests Is Next For BTC More importantly than what happened today, was what occurred on the weekly timeframe. BTCUSDT (Binance) weekly tagged the Parabolic SAR for the first time since May 2022.

					<description><![CDATA[Polkadot has finally managed to break past the rigid price resistance mark of $5. Over the last 24 hours, DOT increased by more than 6%. In the past week, the coin has secured double-digit gains. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Climbs 5% To Take Out Hurdles, Is Bottom Really In? Bitcoin moved into its daily chart&#8217;s $18,000 price zone, pushing altcoins on their respective charts. Although DOT rallied in the last 24 hours, the altcoin is still not out of the woods. The altcoin must remain above two price levels. The technical outlook still sided with the bulls, but there was a fall in the accumulation on the daily chart, indicating that there has been a fall in demand. The demand, however, secured by DOT reached a multi-month high. Usually, after being overvalued, the coin starts to retrace on its chart. Indicators showed that if buyers do not remain consistent, DOT will depreciate on its chart over the subsequent few trading sessions. The altcoin market capitalization fell slightly in the last 24 hours, which meant demand for the altcoin dipped. At the moment, DOT was trading 90% below its all-time high of 2021. Polkadot Price Analysis: One-Day Chart DOT was trading at $5.09 at the time of writing. The coin was trading within an ascending parallel channel (blue). The ascending parallel channel marked a bullish force in the market. At the time of writing, Polkadot broke above the ascending parallel channel, indicating that DOT might consolidate over the subsequent trading sessions before it starts to retrace. Immediate resistance for the coin stood at $5.30; if it managed to breach that level, it could rally to $5.40. On the other hand, if Polkadot loses its momentum, it will fall to $4.80. The altcoin has to remain above the $4.80 mark, or the bears will take over completely. Technical Analysis The altcoin was still in the bullish zone despite a slight fall in demand. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was above the 60 mark with a minor downtick; this indicated that although demand fell, the price was under bullish control. Similarly, the asset price was seen above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA), which indicated that the bulls were driving the price momentum in the market. As RSI secured a multi-month high, the altcoin traveled above the 50-SMA (yellow) line. With increased demand, technical indicators pointed out traders could have a buying opportunity. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence suggests price momentum and reversals. Related Reading: Avalanche Impresses With 32% Rally – Will AVAX Sustain This Ascent?

					<description><![CDATA[The crypto rally that greeted the new year has definitely brought gains to the world of altcoins. According to CoinMarketCap data, most huge gains were made by altcoins in the past 30 days. AVAX, native token of the Avalanche blockchain, is one of them with gains of up to 32% in the seven days.  The rally came as major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum all registered gains and increased investor sentiment. Although the fear, uncertainty, and doubt of the last year’s bear market is still present, the increasing chance of a recession still gives investors some worry. As of writing, AVAX is trading at $15.96, up 28% in the last 24 hours, data from Coingecko show. What Supported The Avalanche Rally?  The Avalanche ecosystem has been bullish. Recently, Shopify partnered with Avalanche to allow Shopify merchants to sell their NFTs. According to public information, users don’t need to handle any cryptocurrencies to buy NFTs.  Venly, one of the numerous blockchain partners of Shopify, created a no-code tool for sellers to create NFTs. In a recent interview, Venly co-founder Tom Dierckxens said that this evolution in NFT technology is an evolution which can be adopted in the mass market. This is only the most previous on-chain development for the ecosystem. On a previous tweet by Axaholic, a Twitter account dedicated to Avalanche updates, the ecosystem partnered up with Re Protocol which tokenizes the reinsurance industry, empowering business through blockchain solutions.  On-chain developments also led to Avalanche experiencing a strong uptick in development activity and price as seen on data provided by Santiment.  Also, the world&#8217;s largest cloud provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has joined forces with blockchain technology firm Ava Labs to speed up and broaden the use of blockchain across different types of industries.

Image: Phemex Will AVAX Maintain Its Momentum? The current momentum seems to be profit-taking behavior before another bullish leg up. With the markets anticipating lower Consumer Price Index levels, AVAX might have a needed boost in the coming release on Thursday.   However, with its high correlation with Bitcoin, it could follow the top crypto in any direction. Bitcoin, as of writing, has broken past the $18,000 mark and trading at $18,229, up 8.2% in the last seven days, based on data by Coingecko.

The Bollinger Bands in the middle of the chart are a measure of the volatility of the price swings over a given time period (daily or weekly) and are shown in gray. Volatility goes up when the space between the bands (or the amount of gray area) extends. -Featured Image: Cointribune]]></description>

<p>Venly, one of the <a href="https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/digital-service-product/nfts/blockchain-app-partners" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">numerous</a> blockchain partners of Shopify, created a no-code tool for sellers to create NFTs. In a recent interview, Venly co-founder Tom Dierckxens said that this evolution in NFT technology is an evolution which can be adopted in the mass market. </p>

<p>This is only the most previous on-chain development for the ecosystem. On a previous <a href="https://twitter.com/avaxholic/status/1610124275327078401?s=20&amp;t=6BL_oNwC5cRjy9ywIYMijA" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">tweet</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/avaxholic" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Axaholic</a>, a Twitter account dedicated to Avalanche updates, the ecosystem partnered up with Re Protocol which tokenizes the reinsurance industry, empowering business through blockchain solutions. </p>
<p>On-chain developments also led to Avalanche experiencing a strong uptick in development activity and price as seen on data provided by <a href="https://app.santiment.net/s/xHE24U_N" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Santiment</a>. </p>
<p>Also, the world&#8217;s largest cloud provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has joined forces with blockchain technology firm Ava Labs to speed up and broaden the use of blockchain across different types of industries.</p>

<p>With this collaboration, Avalanche, Ava Labs&#8217; layer-1 blockchain, will be more accessible to individuals and businesses, and node administrators will have more control over the network&#8217;s performance and functionality.</p>

<h2><strong>Will AVAX Maintain Its Momentum?</strong></h2>
<p>The current momentum seems to be profit-taking behavior before another bullish leg up. With the markets anticipating lower Consumer Price Index levels, AVAX might have a needed boost in the coming release on Thursday.  </p>
<p>However, with its high correlation with Bitcoin, it could follow the top crypto in any direction. Bitcoin, as of writing, has broken past the $18,000 mark and trading at $18,229, up 8.2% in the last seven days, based on data by Coingecko.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-515835 size-full" src="https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-31.png" alt="AVAX" width="577" height="309" srcset="https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-31.png 577w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-31-460x246.png 460w" sizes="(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px" /></p>


<p>Meanwhile, the chart above contrasts the token&#8217;s price adjustment and volatility over the past 24 hours (left) with that during the last seven days (right).</p>
<p>The Bollinger Bands in the middle of the chart are a measure of the volatility of the price swings over a given time period (daily or weekly) and are shown in gray.</p>
<p>Volatility goes up when the space between the bands (or the amount of gray area) extends.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[XRP has been on the front lines of crypto news for the past couple of weeks as Ripple’s lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) heats up. The increased attention has translated to more market movement, and whales are looking to take advantage of this. Whales Move Into XRP XRP’s trading volume saw a spike on Tuesday following the upward rally in the crypto market. This saw an increase in the price of the digital asset but perhaps most important for the day was the fact that Binance Smart Chain whales were actually more interested in the coin. Related Reading: Bullish Signal: Bitcoin Whales Go On 20,000 BTC Buying Spree Whale tracking website WhaleStats reported that XRP had become the most traded token among the top 100 BSC whales for the day.

XRP in the top five gainers &#124; Source: Coinmarketcap This increase in price has now pushed the price of XRP above its 20-day moving average. The breakpoints to a short-term bull trend for the digital asset, at least for the week. The most important now is for the digital asset to break the resistance at $0.037, as this will propel it above its 50-day moving average of $0.379. Once this is achieved, then a rally above $0.4 will be locked in for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Why Are Liquid Staking Cryptocurrencies Seeing Double-Digit Gains?

					<description><![CDATA[Avalanche and its dApp ecosystem shall now be supported by Amazon Web Services (AWS), which also comprises one-click node deployment through the AWS marketplace. With this partnership with AWS, Ava Labs can help customers deploy custom offerings linked to over 100,000 partners spread across 150 countries. Related Reading: Bitcoin Currently More Stable Than Gold, DXY, Nasdaq, Here’s What Could Happen Next Technically, the Avalanche node operators can operate in AWS GovCloud for the FedRAMP compliance use case, which is an essential pre-requisite for many enterprises and governments. This partnership will help scale blockchain adoption among many enterprises, government organizations, and other institutions. Howard Wright, the VP and Global Head of startups at AWS, stated: Looking forward, web3 and blockchain are inevitable. No one can call the time or date or quarter that it’s going to happen and it’ll be mainstream, but we’ve seen the cycles of growth before. The velocity of this one seems like it’s accelerating and we’re just excited to be a part of this. Through the partnership, individuals will find it much easier to launch and manage nodes on Avalanche; additionally, it will strengthen and make the network more flexible for developers to work on. This new development has positively affected the altcoin&#8217;s price, but it is yet to be seen if the coin can sustain this price sentiment. Avalanche Technical Analysis The news of AWS being incorporated into the Avalanche ecosystem has instantly spiked investor interest. The daily chart of AVAX displays a 6.6% gain, which can be termed a rally. This has made the coin break past the $13.60 resistance level, and now AVAX is valued at $14.40. It is yet to be seen if the coin manages to breach the $15 mark, acting as a resistance mark for the coin. A fall from the current price will bring the altcoin down to $13.70. The Relative Strength Index was overbought, which means the asset was overvalued. The overvalued condition can be attributed to the newest development. Usually, once the asset is overbought, the price corrects itself. Due to bullish sentiment, AVAX shot past the 20-Simple Moving Average line (SMA), indicating that buyers have been driving the price momentum in the market. Not just the 20-SMA, the altcoin was parked above the 50-SMA due to excessive demand. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence suggests price momentum and a trend reversal. The indicator formed a few green histograms, which are buy signals for the coin. The most recent histogram increased in size, anticipating the rise in the price of the asset. Investors could quickly take this as a signal for entry as the price would increase over the next few trading sessions before it started to retrace.

The +DI line (blue) was above the -DI line (orange). The Average Directional Index (red) was near 20 with a slight uptick, confirming that although the price witnessed a northbound movement, the price direction lacks substantial strength.

Howard Wright, the VP and Global Head of startups at AWS, stated:

<blockquote><p>Looking forward, web3 and blockchain are inevitable. No one can call the time or date or quarter that it’s going to happen and it’ll be mainstream, but we’ve seen the cycles of growth before. The velocity of this one seems like it’s accelerating and we’re just excited to be a part of this.</p></blockquote>
<p>Through the partnership, individuals will find it much easier to launch and manage nodes on Avalanche; additionally, it will strengthen and make the network more flexible for developers to work on. This new development has positively affected the altcoin&#8217;s price, but it is yet to be seen if the coin can sustain this price sentiment.</p>

<p>The news of AWS being incorporated into the Avalanche ecosystem has instantly spiked investor interest. The daily chart of AVAX displays a 6.6% gain, which can be termed a rally.</p>
<p>This has made the coin break past the $13.60 resistance level, and now AVAX is valued at $14.40. It is yet to be seen if the coin manages to breach the $15 mark, acting as a resistance mark for the coin. A fall from the current price will bring the altcoin down to $13.70.</p>
<p>The Relative Strength Index was overbought, which means the asset was overvalued. The overvalued condition can be attributed to the newest development. Usually, once the asset is overbought, the price corrects itself.</p>
<p>Due to bullish sentiment, AVAX shot past the 20-Simple Moving Average line (SMA), indicating that buyers have been driving the price momentum in the market. Not just the 20-SMA, the altcoin was parked above the 50-SMA due to excessive demand.</p>

<p>The Moving Average Convergence Divergence suggests price momentum and a trend reversal. The indicator formed a few green histograms, which are buy signals for the coin. The most recent histogram increased in size, anticipating the rise in the price of the asset.</p>
<p>Investors could quickly take this as a signal for entry as the price would increase over the next few trading sessions before it started to retrace.</p>

<p>The Directional Movement Index reads the price direction, and it was bullish. The +DI line (blue) was above the -DI line (orange).</p>
<p>The Average Directional Index (red) was near 20 with a slight uptick, confirming that although the price witnessed a northbound movement, the price direction lacks substantial strength.</p>
