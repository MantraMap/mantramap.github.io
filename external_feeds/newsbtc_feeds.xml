					<description><![CDATA[Just over a year after launching its crypto fund, venture capital firm Sequoia is now rolling back its investments and taking more of a more careful approach. The firm was making some serious waves when it launched its crypto fund last year in February, signaling that crypto was ready for mainstream VC backing. But now the company has reportedly downsized its cryptocurrency fund by 65% as the crypto winter rages on.  Sequoia Pulls Back On Its Crypto Funding Sequoia Capital, one of Silicon Valley&#8217;s most prestigious VC firms, is scaling back its ambitions in the crypto space. After launching a dedicated $585 million crypto fund last year, Sequoia recently announced they’re slashing it by 65% to $200 million.  Related Reading: European Central Bank Follows US Fed’s Footsteps With 25 BPS Hike The firm has also reduced its ecosystem fund by 50%. The fund, which invests in other smaller venture funds and solo investors, is now at $450 million, down from $900 million. Insiders close to the situation said this is a result of the bear market, which has affected projects across the industry and pulled down prices significantly over the last year. Why Is Sequoia Taking This Step Now? Sequoia is known for making investments in crypto companies and had initially announced its funds as part of a larger restructuring effort to increase its investments in the crypto space. The crypto market, however, has seen most projects take a big hit over the last few months and Sequoia wasn&#8217;t left out, as it has seen a major part of its investment take drastic losses.  The company was particularly affected by the crash of FTX, as it had a $214 million investment in the failed crypto exchange. Rather than spray and pray with a large fund, Sequoia is now tightening its focus.  Total market cap at $1.14 trillion as VC investments slow down &#124; Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com According to the report, the company&#8217;s new investment plan is to pivot toward smaller crypto players. The smaller cryptocurrency fund will now focus more on a select group of startup companies.  With the crypto market taking a major downturn since the announcement of its funds, it&#8217;s no surprise that Sequoia has decided to scale back. Crypto projects, in particular, haven&#8217;t done well in recent times.

While it shows a lack of faith and reflects the growing trend among venture capital firms, the pullback doesn&#8217;t mean Sequoia is abandoning the space altogether. The venture capital firm began its crypto journey in 2014 and has a history of backing innovative technologies early on. Featured image from CryptoPotato, chart from Tradingview.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) has continued to occupy center stage, drawing varied reactions from different financial pundits. One of these voices is billionaire investor Mike Novogratz, who has yet again reiterated his support for the top cryptocurrency despite the unsettling dynamics in the United States economy. The Growing Concern: Skyrocketing Interest Payments The US is currently experiencing an unprecedented increase in debts as its interest payments reach $970 billion. This figure represents a leap of $41 billion in the second quarter alone. Observers anticipate that the rising trajectory could soon see the country&#8217;s debts surge resulting in the interest payments hitting the $1 trillion milestone, which has set off alarm bells in financial circles. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retreat Below $30,000: A Threat To Crypto’s 2023 Dominance Over Stocks? To clarify, interest payments are the actual payments that the borrower makes to the lender, typically on a regular schedule, to repay the interest on a loan or debt. The amount of each payment is determined by the interest rate and the terms of the loan. As such, the sustained upsurge of interest payments in the US economy has triggered growing unease among financial experts. Tax receipts are currently failing to keep pace with the ballooning sovereign debt. Consequently, the issuance of more debt to fund interest payments is becoming an increasingly common occurrence. This scenario has created a vicious cycle, causing concern about the potential repercussions on the nation&#8217;s fiscal health. In light of this, Mike Novogratz has once again expressed his firm support for Bitcoin. His latest advocacy came to the forefront recently when he urged investors to buy Bitcoin as the US national debt spiked by $1 trillion between June and July. Buy $BTC!!! https://t.co/UyGNaGXzyI — Mike Novogratz (@novogratz) July 27, 2023 Novogratz&#8217;s Stance: Bitcoin As A Safe Haven Despite expressing caution regarding the broader economy, Novogratz holds a sanguine view of Bitcoin&#8217;s prospects. He envisions that the cryptocurrency is on the cusp of another growth cycle, following a consolidation phase oscillating between the $28,000 to $32,000 range. However, Novogratz maintains that a significant shift in policy by the Federal Reserve, specifically a reduction in interest rates, is key for this expected surge to come to fruition. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital Founder Anticipates BTC Price Surge Due To This Reason Meanwhile, recent indicators suggest that the central bank may have different intentions. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s current stance seems to diverge from the conditions that Novogratz believes are necessary for a Bitcoin rally. Despite this, the experienced investor continues to champion Bitcoin, viewing it as a potential safe haven amid economic uncertainties. In the meantime, Bitcoin&#8217;s valuation is still persistently working to rise above the recent downward trend. The digital asset experienced a slight dip of 1% in the last day and now has a market cap of $567.5 billion. BTC&#8217;s market price currently stands at $29,309, at the time of writing. This price action follows the asset&#8217;s unsuccessful endeavor to reclaim the $30,000 mark earlier this week.  Featured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ARK Invest CEO and crypto proponent Cathie Wood says that Bitcoin is set to grow massively as a store of value following the recent bank collapses. She believes that Bitcoin’s stability and a huge rally in the wake of US regional banks collapsing is a major testament to the fact that Bitcoin is the future of money. Cathie Wood Remains Bullish On Bitcoin In a recent interview with Barron&#8217;s, Wood maintained that she remains bullish on digital assets and highlighted three reasons she won’t be backing down on her investments. According to her, Bitcoin stood tall and rose by 60%, from $19,000 to $30,000, when regional banks like First Republic, SVB, and Signature Bank collapsed. She attributed this run to investors seeing the asset as a safe alternative for storing their wealth.  Related Reading: European Central Bank Follows US Fed’s Footsteps With 25 BPS Hike Wood explained: We see three revolutions taking place because of crypto. Bitcoin will dominate the first one, the money revolution. The biggest proof is that when regional-bank stocks were falling apart earlier this year, Bitcoin went from $19,000 to $30,000. That was a flight to safety, and we expect it to accelerate. The centralized monetary system we have today is an aberration. We could be going back to the future – before the Federal Reserve existed – under a digital, rules-based monetary system with no government oversight. The other reasons for her bullishness on digital assets relate to decentralized finance (DeFi) and digital property rights involving tokenizing several physical assets in real estate and other relevant industries.  “The second revolution is in financial services, or the so-called DeFi, which will be Ethereum-based. There are a number of infrastructure providers out there. It’s the survival of the fittest, and I’m excited to see who wins,” the CEO said. Last but not least, according to Woord, “is digital property rights, or what many call NFT or the metaverse. People are already buying real estate in virtual worlds. Our young research associates come into the office wearing jeans and T-shirts with no logos, but they are getting their status in the virtual world.” BTC bulls struggle to keep bears at bay &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Weighing In On Coinbase’s Battle With SEC During the interview, Cathie Wood also discussed Coinbase’s ongoing battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Wood’s ARK holdings are one of the largest holders of Coinbase’s stock. She believes that the crypto exchange will ultimately get victory in the SEC’s lawsuit against it for the sale of unregistered securities.  According to her, the court will rule that the SEC has gone beyond its regulatory purview, and in the long run, the US Congress will pass crypto-friendly bills.  “Meanwhile, the legislative branch has awakened to the fact that crypto is a new asset class and we might need new legislatures to give the regulators some guidance,” the ARK Invest CEO added.

					<description><![CDATA[DeFi protocol, Hector Network, has closed its official Discord server, leaving many investors in the dark. The move comes amidst growing suspicions of a $16 million rug pull engineered through a so-called hard rug, a process where funds are quickly moved, leaving investors with shitcoins. This comes after a controversial rage-quit vote organized by the project’s DAO.  DeFi Protocol Hector Network Leaves Investors In Limbo Hector Network investors woke up to the news that the DeFi protocol had cut off communications on its official Discord server. The Discord server was the only means of communication between the network’s team and its investors which was established after the Hector Network team censored them from the official server in April.  Related Reading: Lacoste Unveils Exclusive Ethereum-Based Virtual Store For NFT Holders The server was meant to run parallel to the official Discord, preserving data from the latter. Since then, it has become the only means of communication among DAO members. The move has left the network’s investors in a state of shock since they no longer have any means of communication with the network’s team. This has led to a lot of backlash, and according to Libagscientist, an investor and vocal critic of the platform, “there is no backchannel open anymore.”  In the absence of any official communication, dejected investors are accusing the network of siphoning the $16 million left in its treasury.  According to investors, the team embezzled the project’s funds over an 18-month period starting in 2021. According to records of DAO votes, the Hector team received over $51 million in salaries during this period without delivering on any meaningful milestone. An aggrieved investor identified as Jintu said, “..not one thing has actually moved forwards.” A Story of Sheer Incompetence and Greed The Hector Network is part of several Olympus DAO forks, a prominent cryptocurrency reserve currency project that peaked during the DeFi summer of 2021.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DeFi protocol, Hector Network, has <a href="https://www.dlnews.com/articles/defi/hector-network-shuts-down-discord-server/" rel="nofollow">closed</a> its official Discord server, leaving many investors in the dark. The move comes amidst growing suspicions of a $16 million <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/encryption-a-l-rug-pulls-2-million-repay-300000-crypto-gambling-debt/" rel="nofollow">rug pul</a>l engineered through a so-called hard rug, a process where funds are quickly moved, leaving investors with shitcoins. This comes after a controversial rage-quit vote organized by the project’s DAO. </p>
<h2>DeFi Protocol Hector Network Leaves Investors In Limbo</h2>
<p>Hector Network investors woke up to the news that the DeFi protocol had cut off communications on its official Discord server. The Discord server was the only means of communication between the network’s team and its investors which was established after the Hector Network team censored them from the official server in April. </p>

<p>The server was meant to run parallel to the official Discord, preserving data from the latter. Since then, it has become the only means of communication among DAO members.</p>
<p>The move has left the network’s investors in a state of shock since they no longer have any means of communication with the network’s team. This has led to a lot of backlash, and according to Libagscientist, an investor and vocal critic of the platform, “there is no backchannel open anymore.” </p>
<p>In the absence of any official communication, dejected investors are accusing the network of siphoning the $16 million left in its treasury. </p>
<p>According to investors, the team embezzled the project’s funds over an 18-month period starting in 2021. According to records of DAO votes, the Hector team received over $51 million in salaries during this period without delivering on any meaningful milestone. An aggrieved investor identified as <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1116358879702417448/1116358880327385090/1132192275338907658" rel="nofollow">Jintu</a> said, “..not one thing has actually moved forwards.”</p>
<h2><b>A Story of Sheer Incompetence and Greed</b></h2>
<p>The Hector Network is part of several Olympus DAO forks, a prominent cryptocurrency reserve currency project that peaked during the DeFi summer of 2021. The Hector Network, like other Olympus DAO forks, promised huge annualized yields of about 100,000% in the beginning, and the early successes of Olympus DAO attracted many investors hunting for massive returns. </p>
<p>During its hay days, Hector Network’s native token, HEC reached $357 in late 2021. However, the platform&#8217;s challenge lies in the fact that its inflationary yield needs to be supported with a steady influx of investor cash to keep the HEC token valuable and maintain its high yields. </p>

<p>Following the crypto winter that began in November 2021, the platform has been unable to recover. Aggrieved investors believe that the team should have applied the funds held in its treasury toward developing value for token holders. </p>
<p>Many have now accused the team of being greedy and unconcerned about meeting the targets of the network and the current saga might eventually end up in the courts. However, investors’ top priority remains to recoup their funds. Hector Network has declined requests for comments but has unequivocally rejected the allegations in a <a href="https://medium.com/@Hector_Network/community-update-addressing-recent-security-incidents-at-hector-network-2fcf4d5c12a2" rel="nofollow">statement</a> released on June 14.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In a thought-provoking blog post titled &#8220;Moai,&#8221; Arthur Hayes, co-founder of the renowned crypto exchange BitMEX, delves into the potential impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the future of economic organization and the role of Ethereum. Hayes argues that the rise of AI-driven Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) will revolutionize the global economy and propel Ethereum to new heights. The Critical Role Of DAOs In The AI Era Hayes contends that the current economic progress and per capita wealth of global civilization can be attributed to the efficient self-organization of human societies. He emphasizes that traditional company structures, empowered and regulated by the state, have been the primary vehicles for economic development. However, he highlights the limitations of these structures when it comes to AI-driven entities. He states, &#8220;An AI has no reason to follow any laws. It cannot be coerced by the state, and therefore, exchanges that trade tokens issued by AI-powered DAOs will likely become natural monopolies.&#8221; Related Reading: Lacoste Unveils Exclusive Ethereum-Based Virtual Store For NFT Holders Hayes lays out a compelling argument for why DAOs, relying on smart contracts executed on public blockchains like Ethereum, are the ideal organizational structure for AI-driven entities. These smart contracts provide transparency, immutability, and cryptographic verification of transactions and agreements. Consequently, DAOs can operate efficiently and securely without the need for third-party intermediaries or costly auditing processes. He envisions a future where AI-powered DAOs will raise capital and trade their tokens on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Ethereum rather than traditional centralized exchanges. This will create truly global capital markets accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Hayes predicts that DEXs will become natural monopolies due to the advantages they offer in terms of trust, security, and ease of use. The BitMEX founder presents a hypothetical example of &#8220;PoetAI,&#8221; an AI-powered DAO that aims to fundraise and produce original poetry for profit. He envisions how PoetAI could issue its tokens, called &#8220;POET,&#8221; through a smart contract with specific attributes, such as revenue sharing and voting mechanisms. Investors can confidently invest in PoetAI DAO knowing that its financial statements are continuously available on the public blockchain, eliminating the need for traditional auditors. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Avoid More Downsides If It Closes Above One Key Level Moreover, Hayes explains that DAOs can raise capital by issuing debt, enabling economic time travel by borrowing from the future to stimulate present economic activity. The enforceability of contracts in DAOs can be facilitated through smart contracts on public blockchains, ensuring that investors are protected. Hayes’ Bull Case For Ethereum Hayes concludes, &#8220;Ethereum transactions will grow exponentially as DAOs proliferate. As a result, the price of ETH should skyrocket in anticipation if this AI DAO hypothesis is widely believed.&#8221; He also suggests that identifying and investing in Ethereum based governance tokens of DEXs facilitating AI-driven DAO trading will lead to significant profits. Furthermore, Ethereum middleware layers that enable visualization of AI DAO accounts will become essential for the smooth functioning of these capital markets. While these ideas represent bold predictions about the future of AI and the role of Ethereum, Hayes presents a compelling case for the potential disruptive power of AI-driven DAOs. Hayes is one of the great thinkers of crypto space and his thesis a narrative to watch. At press time, the Ether (ETH) price was at $1,863, just below the mid-range resistance.

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin price is currently in an uncertain situation. After BTC broke below the one-month trading range between $29.800 and $31.500, the bulls have so far failed to recapture this area. A first attempt failed on Wednesday at $29.725, a second effort on Thursday at $29.600. On the other hand, the bears currently also fail to push the price below the critical support at $29.000. In which direction the next movement will go is, as always, pure speculation, but data can give indications. Bullish Signal 1: Decreasing BTC Supply On Exchanges Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared an intriguing bullish chart, revealing that only 2.25 million BTC are currently held in known crypto exchange wallets. This is the lowest Bitcoin supply on trading platforms since January 2018. The data suggests that investors and long-term holders are refraining from selling and are instead choosing to keep their BTC off exchanges. This &#8220;hodling&#8221; behavior indicates a positive sentiment BTC holders. Bullish Signal 2: Lack Of Inflows From Bitcoin Whales Head of Research at CryptoQuant, Julio Moreno, pointed out another bullish sign when he shared a chart showing a lack of inflows from large investors with 1,000 to 10,000 BTC (aka Bitcoin whales) into exchanges. Moreno stated, “&#8221;Not really seeing Bitcoin whale inflows into exchanges.&#8221; Additionally, the same trend is observed among smaller investors, indicating a reluctance to deposit BTC into centralized exchanges. Commenting on the exchange deposit transactions (7-day SMA) chart, Moreno added, “indeed, seems nobody wants to deposit into centralized exchanges.&#8221; Related Reading: Don’t Change The Channel! Why Bitcoin Could Target $42K If Uptrend Holds Such behavior suggests that significant holders and institutions are holding onto their BTC assets, potentially anticipating future price increases. Bearish Signal: Short-Term Holder (STH) MVRV Metric On-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr. addressed the short-term holder (STH) MVRV metric, saying: &#8220;STH MVRV is actively falling and we may see something similar to what happened in the two previous corrections.&#8221; The chart shown by Adler reveals that the STH MVRV fell either close to 0 or even below during the lows of the sharp Bitcoin price corrections in mid-March and mid-June. Currently, the STH MVRV is still somewhat elevated, so a last pullback in the Bitcoin price triggered by short term holder selling may be necessary for the MVRV to reset to 0. Adler also remarked that there isn&#8217;t a substantial Inflow to futures exchanges at the moment like there was in March and June. &#8220;Don&#8217;t expect a sharp breakthrough upwards or downwards,&#8221; added Adler. BTC Binance Spot Liquidity Analysis Analyst @52kskew shared a comprehensive analysis of BTC Binance spot liquidity, highlighting an interesting observation. The bid liquidity (bids &#62; asks) and spot asks moved lower towards price due to low volatility. He added, “note the difference in volume leading to previous selloff &#38; current falling volume &#38; minimal decline.” Related Reading: Fed’s No Recession Claim Boosts Bitcoin And Crypto, Historical Data Contradicts Given the bid liquidity between $29,000 and $28,500, this area could be the point for buyers to step in if BTC experiences a pullback. In a bullish scenario, spot buying would occur in this area, followed by a rotation out of shorts. New longs get opened and price migrates towards spot supply near $30,000. In a sell off scenario, price grinds through spot bid liquidity and forced selling occurs, says Skew. Potential Impact of Economic Data On Bitcoin In addition, it is crucial to keep an eye on macroeconomic factors that could influence Bitcoin&#8217;s price. The release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) at 8:30 am EST today is of particular importance. During Wednesday&#8217;s FOMC press conference, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stressed the importance of core inflation, which is proving sticky. Therefore, the Core PCE in particular, needs to continue falling to alleviate the Fed&#8217;s inflation concerns. If the 4.2% expectation for core PCE is exceeded, a bullish reaction from Bitcoin can be expected. At press time, the Bitcoin price stood at $29,210.

The altcoin remains below a strong resistance level, but a potential breakthrough could lead to a 20% price appreciation. Related Reading: PEPE Whales Load Up Their Bags As Memecoin Jumps 13% In the last 24 hours, SOL saw a modest surge of 2.2%, but its performance on the weekly chart shows minimal upward movement. Despite the challenges, there are two essential bullish signals to consider: the morning star reversal sign and a bullish pennant formation. These signals suggest that if SOL surpasses the immediate resistance, the coin might aim for a rally back to levels it reached two weeks ago. In the broader market context, Bitcoin&#8217;s re-entry into the $29,000 price level has caused retracements in altcoins on their respective charts. Therefore, for SOL to surpass the immediate resistance, it will require strong support from the broader market. The market capitalization of SOL has also experienced a decline, indicating a slight weakening in buying strength. Solana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, SOL was valued at $24.90. The coin tried to reach the $32 level, but the bulls faced resistance and could not sustain it. Subsequently, SOL has been striving to breach the immediate resistance level at $26. A successful move above $26 could propel the coin&#8217;s value to $28. It may encounter a potential price ceiling at that level. If this level is surpassed, the coin could rally further to reach $30. On the other hand, there is a downside risk. If SOL fails to hold above the $26 level, it might face a decline to $21. A further fall below this mark could result in a drop to $18. The price movement remains crucial for SOL&#8217;s future trajectory. Technical Analysis The market exhibited bullish signals, with the bulls taking control despite a slight dip in buying strength. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicated buyers dominated the market, as it remained above the half-line. Moreover, the price movement above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line highlighted the influence of buyers in driving the price momentum. Should the price maintain its position above the 20-SMA, increased demand is anticipated to propel the asset&#8217;s value above the immediate resistance line. This could potentially lead to further bullish movement in the market. Despite the continued dominance of buyers, SOL presented sell signals on the daily chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) formed red signal bars, suggesting a potential slight dip in the price before any attempt to breach the $26 mark. This indicator reflects the price momentum and its shift. Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was below the half-line, indicating that capital inflows were lower than capital outflows.
