<ul><li>MicroStrategy reported revenue of $120 million and gross profit of $93 million in Q2 ‘2023.&nbsp;</li><li>The company incurred an impairment charge of $24 million on its 152,333 BTC worth $2.3 billion.&nbsp;</li><li>The Michael Saylor-led firm acquired 12,800 BTC in the second quarter of 2023.&nbsp;</li><li>The company’s stock rose as much as 3% in after-hours trading.</li></ul>



<p>U.S.-based business intelligence firm <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/microstrategy-stock-7-berenberg-bitcoin/">MicroStrategy</a> has reported a revenue of $120.4 million for the second quarter of 2023. The Michael Saylor-led firm, which is the largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoins, acquired 12,888 BTC in the second quarter for $361.4 million at an average price of $28,233 per Bitcoin. </p>



<h2><strong>MicroStrategy Stock Up 3% In After-Hours Trading</strong></h2>



<p>The second quarter <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230801942986/en/" rel="nofollow noopener">financial results</a> released by MicroStrategy earlier today showed that the firm recorded a gross profit of $93.3 million, with a gross margin of 77.5%. The company managed to return to profitability thanks to the recent surge in Bitcoin’s price. </p>



<p>However, MicroStrategy reported a $26.7 million loss from operations along with a net income of $26.7 million. The company also incurred impairment charges of $24.1 million on its Bitcoin holdings, which marked a 97% decline from the impairment charges of Q2 ‘2022.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“We efficiently raised capital through our at-the-market equity program and used cash from operations to continue to increase bitcoins on our balance sheet. And we did so against the promising backdrop of increasing institutional interest, progress on accounting transparency, and ongoing regulatory clarity for bitcoin.” </p><cite>Andrew Kang, Chief Financial Officer at MicroStrategy</cite></blockquote>



<p>As of June 30, 2023, MicroStrategy held approximately 152,333 Bitcoins valued at $2.3 billion, which were purchased at an average price of$15,251. This amount reflected the cumulative impairment losses of $2.19 billion since acquisition. The company has spent a total of $4.53 billion to accumulate the BTC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MicroStrategy beat the earnings per share (EPS) expectations by a whopping 249%. The company’s share price closed at $434 and gained nearly 3% in after-hours trading.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A scam targeting stranded customers of &lt;a href=&quot;http://&lt;!&#8211; wp:paragraph &#8211;&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/voyagers-payback-customers-35-of-claims/&quot;&gt;Voyager Digital&lt;/a&gt; lawyer Darren Azman, the available amount represented nearly 80% of the funds that were available for the bankruptcy payout process. The scam reportedly occurred during the court-supervised liquidation process as the customers were being paid out. &lt;/p&gt; <!-- /wp:paragraph -&gt;"&gt;-->Voyager Digital</a> has become the latest development in the defunct crypto lender’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The customers were reportedly hit with scams as they attempted to access the bankruptcy payouts on the recently opened platform. </p>



<h2><strong>Scammers Used Fake Websites To Target Voyager Digital’s Customers</strong></h2>



<p>Voyager Digital recently reopened its app to allow its customers to view the payout amount that they were eligible for and withdraw the same. The firm’s customers, who had been stranded since July last year, had a 30-day window to withdraw approximately $490 million worth of Voyager’s remaining assets, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-01/voyager-bankruptcy-may-have-been-hacked-to-get-customer-data#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a> reported. </p>



<p>During a recent court hearing, Azman told the judge overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings that the scams were designed to gain access to the digital wallets of customers who accessed Voyager’s platform to retrieve funds. As per the lawyer, the scammers set up fake websites that lured the customers in by offering higher payouts to those who linked their non-Voyager crypto wallet to a new account offered by the. The wallets were drained once the customer signed up for the new account.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>It’s disgraceful. I don’t know what to say. After everything these folks have been through.” </p><cite>US Bankruptcy Judge Michael Wiles</cite></blockquote>



<p>The Voyager Digital lawyer stated that the scammers had managed to steal funds from very few customers so far. Law enforcement agencies and bankruptcy officials overseeing Voyager’s liquidation are looking into the scams. The platform’s native token, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/voyager-token/" rel="nofollow noopener">VGX</a>, has lost over 10% of its value over the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, VGX was trading at $0.17.</p>

<ul><li>Justin Sun’s Tron Group has posted a profit of $85 million for the second quarter of 2023.&nbsp;</li><li>The group saw a growth of 183% in its quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) profit thanks to cost-cutting measures.</li><li>Sun projected revenue of $200 million for Q3, with a quarterly profit of $100 million.&nbsp;</li><li>Meanwhile, Huobi Global recorded a significant loss in Q2 and is expected to break even in the third quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Justin Sun’s Tron Group has recorded a profit of $85 million in the third quarter of 2023. The group saw a quarter-on-quarter profit growth of 183% after enforcing cost-cutting measures. Sun, who took to <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1686371227089436672" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today to share Tron’s performance with the community, expects the group’s revenue to reach $200 million in the third quarter. </p>



<h2><strong>Justin Sun Expects Huobi To Breakeven In Q3 ‘2023</strong></h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/trx-expands-ethereum-bittorrent-bridge/">Justin Sun</a>, Tron Group’s second-quarter revenue came in at $193 million. With an expenditure of $108 million, the group was left with a quarterly profit of $85 million, as compared to $30 million in the first quarter of 2023. The revenue did not include investment gains and losses of the firm. </p>



<p>Some of the Q2 metrics were lower than Sun had <a href="https://twitter.com/sunyuchentron/status/1645366519260655616" rel="nofollow noopener">projected</a> at the end of the first quarter. While the revenue exceeded the projected $187 million, the group failed to limit its expenditure to $76 million, which prevented it from reaching the projected profit of $111 million. </p>



<p>Sun told his followers that the firm’s efforts to increase revenue and reduce costs were visible in the earnings. As for the third quarter revenue, the Tron founder shared a conservative forecast of $200 million. He added that he expected a 7.4% reduction in expenditure, bringing the Q3 projection to $100 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Huobi Exchange, which was reportedly acquired by Justin Sun’s group last year, suffered a significant loss in the second quarter. The crypto entrepreneur expects the exchange business to break even in the next quarter and turn slightly profitable by Q4 ‘2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 8% decline in TVL comes at a time when founder Michael Egorov is selling discounted CRV tokens for USDT in a bid to stave off liquidation of his collateralized loan on Aave, a major DeFi lender.</p>

<h2>Tron&#8217;s Sun And Other Tap Curve Discount</h2>



<p>Per DeFi analysts LookOnChain, Curve founder Michael Egorov has sold 39.25 million CRV in exchange for $15.8 million USDT. The transactions were reportedly part of OTC deals with investors like Tron founder Justin Sun, market maker DWF Labs,  crypto trader DCFGod, and DeFi platform Cream Finance. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>According to reports, Egorov and the buyers agreed on lock-up periods ranging from three to six months. These investors can also sell their CRV should the price rise to $0.80. </p>



<p>Egorov&#8217;s flurry of OTC deals is purportedly a move to cushion his $60 million on Aave collateralized by $175 million in CRV tokens. Liquidation of the founder&#8217;s Aave loan could trigger a domino effect of bad debt across several DeFi lending services, potentially plunging the decentralized lending ecosystem into disarray. </p>



<p>This scenario only plays out should CRV&#8217;s price plunge significantly below $0.3 thus liquidating Egorov&#8217;s massive Aave loan. Concerns regarding the possibility were <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/curve-finance-warns-arbitrum-exploit/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/curve-finance-warns-arbitrum-exploit/" rel="noreferrer noopener">raised</a> after factory exploits on Curve Finance liquidity pools and the ensuing CRV price decline. </p>

<p>The platform launched on Tuesday with 34 cryptos available for spot trading, the largest digital asset assortment of any crypto exchange in Japan. BNB, Binance&#8217;s native exchange token, is among the tokens offered. This marks the first time crypto users in Japan can trade BNB. </p>



<p>Japanese crypto users will be able to sign up for accounts starting today while existing users with accounts on Binance&#8217;s global exchange have the option to migrate to Binance Japan by August 14. Migrating users will be able to use the new exchange from December 1, the company said. </p>



<p>August 1 marks the crypto exchange&#8217;s return to Japan after cameos in 2018 and regulatory skirmishes in 2021. At the time, Japan&#8217;s Financial Services Agency (FSA) warned Changpeng Zhao&#8217;s exchange to cease operating without a license. </p>



<p>CZ&#8217;s company said the exchange did not solicit Japanese customers or offer its services to local users.</p>



<h2>Binance Secures Dubai License</h2>



<p>The leading crypto exchange was recently <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-operational-mvp-license-dubai/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-operational-mvp-license-dubai/" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> an operational minimum viable product (MVP) license from Dubai&#8217;s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). Binance FZE, the company&#8217;s Dubai subsidiary, became the first crypto exchange in the region to receive such a license. </p>



<p>While the crypto exchange solidifies its foothold in Asia and the Middle East, the company&#8217;s European affairs are another matter. The De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/16/binance-to-exit-the-netherlands-as-it-fails-to-get-regulatory-approval.html" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/16/binance-to-exit-the-netherlands-as-it-fails-to-get-regulatory-approval.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">booted</a> Binance from the Dutch market after the company failed to register. </p>



<p>The company is also winding down its services in Belgium, Cyprus, and the United Kingdom. </p>

<p>A federal judge in New York has allowed the Securities and Exchange Commission to pursue its fraud lawsuit against Terraform Labs and its disgraced founder, Do Kwon. However, in allowing the securities regulator to proceed, the judge rejected a previous ruling from fellow Manhattan Judge Analisa Torres, who stated that sales of XRP on secondary markets did not constitute an investment contract.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Rejection Of XRP Ruling Foils Do Kwon’s Attempt To Evade Charges</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-31/ripple-ruling-on-crypto-rejected-by-federal-judge-in-terra-case#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff rejected the summary judgment from Judge Analisa Torres and paved the way for the SEC to proceed with its legal case against Do Kwon and Terraform Labs.</p>



<p>Do Kwon’s defense team previously cited Judge Torres’ ruling in an attempt to get the SEC’s lawsuit dismissed. The SEC’s charges included the offering of unregistered securities, including UST, LUNA, and MIR. The lawyers urged the court to refer to the summary judgment, which stated that XRP sold in secondary markets did not qualify as a security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kwon’s lawyers argued that Ripple’s partial victory in the legal battle with the SEC demonstrated the regulator’s lack of legal grounds to categorize the majority of cryptocurrencies as securities. The lawyers highlighted the distinction that Judge Torres made between institutional sales and programmatic sales. However, Judge Rakoff refused to acknowledge the said distinction.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The court declines to draw a distinction between these coins based on their manner of sale, such that coins sold directly to institutional investors are considered securities and those sold through secondary market transactions to retail investors are not.”</p><cite>US District Judge Jed Rakoff </cite></blockquote>



<p>The SEC previously informed the court that it intended to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-appeal-ripple-ruling-xrp-do-kwon/">appeal</a> Judge Torres’ ruling in its lawsuit against Ripple and urged Judge Rakoff to not consider the summary judgment while hearing arguments in the case against Terraform and Do Kwon. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Coinbase’s Layer 2 platform Base experienced a surge in user activity on 30 July as daily traders flocked to the OP-Stack-based platform to trade the newly-launched meme coin Bald (BALD). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although Base remained in testnet and only opened up to developers in mid-July, traders who sought to book quick profits by apeing in on the meme coin found a way around it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While not having any website or a proper doxxing of the developers behind it, BALD amassed a market capitalization of $50 million a few hours after traders caught a whiff of the first tweet where the token was “mentioned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, there were speculations that someone at Coinbase issued the meme coin due to the use of Coinbase staked Ether (cbETH) to fund the same.

<h3><b>The market went on a prowl</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As BALD&#8217;s trading volume climbed, its market capitalization surged significantly. It went as high as $50 million on Sunday afternoon, causing a number of traders to log huge gains. For example, Crypto Twitter user @cheatcoiner, who made the first tweet about the token, recorded over $1 million from a $500 investment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Likewise, on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain found that in just four minutes after BALD began trading, four addresses purchased 50 million worth of BALD tokens for 0.534 $ETH . </span><span style="font-weight: 400">This represented 50% of the total supply of the meme coin’s supply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shortly after, they sold 337 million BALD tokens for $1.04 million, resulting in a remarkable profit of $1 million within a single day with a $1,000 initial investment.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the token’s popularity grew, its market capitalization touched $85 million late Sunday evening, and its value grew by 4,000,000%. </span></p>
<h4><b>All&#8217;s well that ends well</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As BALD trading intensified on Sunday, the project’s developers consistently added Ether tokens to the BALD/WETH liquidity pool. This enabled smooth trading between BALD and the leading alt ETH, and by Monday, the trading pair accumulated more than $32 million in liquidity and recorded a trading volume exceeding $100 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, by mid-day on Monday, data from <a href="https://basescan.org/tx/0xd4fce790ac42a5a801bebb220adc2a6f9d9bf99985de6a824638a269c3e52ade" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Basescan</a> revealed that BALD&#8217;s developers removed $12 million worth of wrapped Ether [WETH] from BALD’s liquidity pool</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> causing BALD’s price to plummet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At press time, the token exchanged hands at $0.002492 dropping by over 90%. Also, the available liquidity on the BALD/WETH liquidity pool stood at $38,000, data from </span><a href="https://dexscreener.com/base/0xe96df8f5ef1a8790415068c798765b07d57643bd" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400">DexScreener</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> revealed. Likewise, the market capitalization that almost touched $100 million was below $3 million at the time of writing. </span></p>

<h4><b>Do you want to bridge to the Base network?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Base’s mainnet release date remains unknown, learning how to move funds to the network to trade on the decentralized exchanges currently housed within it might be imperative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To do this, you must first set up a <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MetaMask</a> wallet and have some ETH. If you don&#8217;t have MetaMask, you can install it as a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">browser extension</a> or mobile app and then add your ETH to the wallet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once you have your MetaMask wallet set up and funded with ETH, you need to add Base Mainnet to your list of networks in MetaMask. To do this, go to the network selection dropdown in MetaMask and choose &#8220;Custom RPC.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fill in the fields provided with the network details </span><a href="https://docs.base.org/using-base/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400">provided</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by Base. When this is done correctly, Base Mainnet will appear as one of the networks in your MetaMask. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After successfully adding Base Mainnet to your MetaMask wallet, you can proceed with the bridging process. Decide on the amount of ETH you want to bridge to the Base Mainnet network and ensure you have that amount available in your MetaMask wallet. Once confirmed, initiate the transaction to send the chosen amount of ETH to the designated wallet address provided by Base Mainnet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Remember that you can only bridge funds to the Base Mainnet network now, and bridging back remains officially impossible.</span></p>

<ul><li>Stablecoin giant Tether recorded an operational profit of more than $1 billion in the second quarter of 2023 </li><li>The USDT issuer&#8217;s consolidated assets exceed its consolidated losses, leaving an excess reserve of $3.3 billion.</li><li> Most of the stablecoin firm’s profits came from interests on the Treasury bills held in its reserves. </li><li>The USDT issuer had an overall exposure of $72.5 billion to U.S. T-bills at the end of Q2 ‘2023.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/hong-kong-accountant-duped-tether/">Tether</a> Holdings published its attestation for the second quarter of 2023 earlier today. The report showed that the USDT issuer recorded a profit of more than $1 billion between April 2023 and June 2023, marking a quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase of 30%. The attestation was carried out by public accounting firm BDO Italia, which also compiled the stablecoin giant’s Consolidated Reserves Report. </p>



<h2><strong>Tether’s Excess Reserves Topped $3.3 Billion In Q2 ‘2023</strong></h2>



<p>Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino took to <a href="https://twitter.com/paoloardoino/status/1685993811774738432" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today to share the latest attestation report. As per the report, the majority of the stablecoin firm’s operational profit came from interest on the T-bills it held in the reserves that backed its USDT stablecoin. The USDT issuer’s overall exposure to U.S. T-bills was $72.5 billion as of June 30, 2023. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If Tether was a country, with $72.5 Billion overall t-bill exposure it would be the 22nd largest holder of US treasuries, larger than the UAE, Australia and Mexico and just below Germany, Bermuda and Netherlands.<br><br>Excess reserves also reach $3.3 Billion.

</div></figure>



<p>The stablecoin giant also revealed an excess in its reserve amounting to $850 million, which brought its total excess reserves to roughly $3.3 billion at the end of the second quarter. According to the USDT issuer, the excess acted as a counterbalance and ensured more protection for users. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>While these excess reserves are part of Tether&#8217;s own shareholder equity and normally a company would distribute them as dividends, Tether prefers to keep a big portion of these profits on top of the reserves to make its stablecoins products even more resilient.”</p><cite>Paolo Ardoino, Chief Technology Officer at Tether Holdings Limited</cite></blockquote>



<p>As per the <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/vyse88cgwfbl/63oJePOHqIvrcnXWMPZ1M0/4cfaf2e7cdf80c30b17fdc70faaf741f/ESO.03.01_Std_ISAE_3000R_Opinion_30-06-2023_BDO_Tether_CRR.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">Consolidated Reserves Report</a>, Tether’s total assets amounted to $86.4 billion as of June 30, 2023. In addition to the revenue, the USDT issuer also disclosed a share buyback of $115 million that was made to consolidate the shareholder group. The profits earned in the second quarter were also used to finance other energy related-ventures. </p>

<p>What goes up must come down &#8211; the laws of gravity and memecoins. </p>



<p>BALD, a memecoin on Coinbase&#8217;s L2 network Base, fell sharply in price on Monday after developers pulled 6,800 ETH from the coin&#8217;s liquidity pool. </p>



<p>Data from <a href="https://basescan.org/tx/0xd4fce790ac42a5a801bebb220adc2a6f9d9bf99985de6a824638a269c3e52ade" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://basescan.org/tx/0xd4fce790ac42a5a801bebb220adc2a6f9d9bf99985de6a824638a269c3e52ade" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Basescan</a> showed that developers withdrew $12 million worth of wrapped Ether from BALD&#8217;s liquidity pool on decentralized exchange LeetSwap. The action resulted in a liquidity crunch that tanked BALD&#8217;s price from 9 cents to 1 cent before rebounding back around 2 cents at press time. </p>



<p>The sudden price fall means an over 60% decline in token price during Monday trading hours, per <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bald" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bald" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Coingecko</a>. </p>

<h2>BALD Traders Touch The Moon</h2>



<p>Degen traders made staggering gains on BALD over the weekend after the token leaped from a $50,000 market cap to over $85 million on Sunday evening. The coin boasts above $121 million in trading volume for the past 24 hours.</p>



<p>One trader @cheatcoiner&nbsp;saw their $500 investment rise to nearly $2 million in days as degen traders made speculative plays on the Base ecosystem.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the product’ release, Chainlink noted that the web3 ecosystem has expanded to include multiple blockchains at the layer-1 and layer-2 scaling levels.&nbsp;However, these networks currently function independently and encounter challenges when interacting with conventional systems and other blockchains. The CCIP was introduced to address this issue by serving as a bridge, enabling seamless asset transfers and information sharing between different blockchains.</span></p>
<h3><b>Traders filling up their LINK bags</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While LINK traded under $8 at $7.87 at press time, accumulation continued amongst day traders. On a daily chart, momentum indicators remained in uptrends above their respective neutral lines.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For example, LINK’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) rested at 61.15. Likewise, its Money Flow Index (MFI) was spotted at 68.65. These indicators are commonly used to analyze price trends and identify an asset&#8217;s potential overbought or oversold conditions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Further, above the zero center line at press time, LINK’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicated the consistent inflow of liquidity into the market. Typically, A CMF value above the zero line is a sign of strength in the market, as buying pressure exceeds selling pressure.</span></p>
