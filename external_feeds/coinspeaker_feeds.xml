<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-regulatory-approval-taiwan/">Binance Pursues Regulatory Approval in Taiwan via AML Registration</a></p>
<p>Leading global cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> is seeking a regulatory license in Taiwan to enable the company to offer crypto services in the country. According to a recent <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/244320/binance-is-applying-to-get-registered-in-taiwan-for-aml-compliance-sources" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> by The Block citing people familiar with the matter, the exchange has applied to be registered under the country&#8217;s anti-money laundering (AML) rules.</p>
<p>Taiwan is one of the many nations in the world with stringent AML laws. The country&#8217;s financial watchdog, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), introduced the legislation in 2021, making it mandatory for all digital asset service providers to comply with the law.</p>
<p>Despite its close ties with China, the island nation has underlined its distinct crypto policies from those of mainland China, as the Beijing government has enforced a comprehensive ban on crypto-related activities since 2021.</p>
<h2>Binance Seeks to Enter the Taiwanese Market</h2>
<p>Binance is now seeking national regulatory approval as part of the company&#8217;s commitment to compliance with local regulatory authorities. If approved, the exchange can legally enter the Taiwanese Market and provide its business offerings to customers in the region.</p>
<p>Sources familiar with the matter revealed that Binance is actively engaged in registration, aiming to ensure rigorous compliance with AML regulations as stipulated by Taiwan&#8217;s financial authorities. According to local news <a href="https://abmedia.io/binance-taiwan-application" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">media</a>, the FSC disclosed the information during a confidential meeting with domestic crypto exchanges in Taiwan.</p>
<h2>Binance Partners with Law Enforcement Agency in Taiwan</h2>
<p>While Binance&#8217;s full regulatory status in Taiwan remains pending, the exchange currently operates in the country through a registered entity known as &#8220;Binance International Limited Taiwan Branch (Seychelles).&#8221; The Taiwanese government approved the firm in May 2023, with a registered capital of NT$30 million ($944,000).</p>
<p>In addition to its registration within the nation, Binance has joined forces with the Taiwanese authorities to combat cybercrime. The exchange <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-partners-with-taiwan-law-enforcement-agencies-to-fight-cybercrime-7928081762268486180">announced</a> the partnership in June, noting that it is working with the country&#8217;s Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) to share its expertise in tackling digital asset-related crime with more than 200 Taiwanese law enforcement officers.</p>
<h2>Binance Faces Regulatory Hurdles in the US and Europe</h2>
<p>Binance is expanding its presence in Asia. The reports about its potential entrance into Taiwan come after the company re-entered the Japanese market last year. The exchange acquired Sakura Exchange BitCoin in November 2022 to enable it to explore the Asian market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while Binance is expanding its reach in Asia, the exchange faces regulatory hurdles in the United States and Europe. The exchange is battling various legal cases in the US, including one with the Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>).</p>
<p>In Europe, the company has chosen to withdraw from several European jurisdictions, including the Netherlands, due to regulatory concerns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/paypal-stablecoin-pyusd-bank-of-america/">Bank of America: Paypal Stablecoin (PYUSD) Immediate Adoption Might Be Subdued</a></p>
<p>In a recent move that captured the attention of the financial world <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayPal Holdings Inc</a> (NASDAQ: PYPL) announced the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/paypal-paypal-usd-stablecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> of its own stablecoin PayPal USD (PYUSD).</p>
<p>While the launch of PYUSD is expected to drive efficiencies in payments, Bank of America analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss suggested in a recent research <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/08/11/paypals-stablecoin-unlikely-to-see-significant-adoption-in-the-near-term-bank-of-america/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> that the immediate adoption of this stablecoin might not be as substantial as anticipated.</p>
<p>The report highlights a few key challenges that PYUSD could face on its adoption journey. One significant obstacle noted is the growing competition from <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Central Bank Digital Currencies</a> (CBDCs). As governments explore their own digital currencies, the adoption landscape could shift, introducing new variables that could influence the adoption of private stablecoins like PYUSD.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the analysts at Bank of America predicted that yield-bearing stablecoins could sway investor preferences away from PYUSD. This prediction is rooted in the evolving interest rate environment.</p>
<p>When interest rates were nearly zero, non-yield-bearing stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) seemed acceptable to investors. However, the analysts projected that the emergence of yield-bearing stablecoins offering rates above 5% could alter this calculation, diverting interest and investment from PYUSD.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the Bank of America’s research dives into the regulatory aspects of the PYUSD’s introduction. While the introduction of the stablecoin may not significantly affect systemic risk in traditional markets, the paper notes that regulatory issues may arise if non-banks are barred from issuing stablecoins.</p>
<p>The report also suggests a longer-term perspective, acknowledging that while adoption challenges might persist in the short run, the trajectory could evolve as the financial landscape adapts to new offerings. The potential for PYUSD usage may grow as market dynamics alter, provided PayPal handles upcoming difficulties and successfully leverages its large user base.</p>
<h2>The PayPal Stablecoin (PYUSD) Launch and its Promise</h2>
<p>Stablecoins, a category of cryptocurrencies designed to minimize price volatility by pegging their value to a stable asset such as fiat currencies and commodities have gained prominence as a potential bridge between traditional financial and the world of digital currencies.</p>
<p>PayPal&#8217;s PYUSD is pegged to the US dollar and aims to offer users the advantages of cryptocurrencies without the rollercoaster ride of value fluctuations often associated with assets like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> (ETH).</p>
<p>The core promise of PYUSD lies in its potential to streamline payment processes and enhance user experiences. Traditional cross-border transactions are often riddled with delays, fees, and complexities arising from intermediaries and currency conversions.</p>
<p>With PYUSD, PayPal envisions a future where these barriers are dismantled, allowing for near-instantaneous cross-border transactions with minimal costs.</p>
<p>Overall, the introduction of PayPal stablecoin (PYUSD) represents a groundbreaking development in the realm of stablecoins and digital currencies. While immediate adoption might be constrained by emerging competition and evolving interest rate dynamics, the stablecoin&#8217;s potential to enhance payments efficiency and customer experience remains significant.</p>

<p>David Schwartz seems unsurprised that the Fed is reacting negatively to the new stablecoin issued by PayPal.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ripple-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple</a>’s chief technology officer (CTO) David Schwartz has commented on the increased regulatory requirements imposed by the US Fed for the country’s cryptocurrency environment. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Schwartz </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/XRPMythBuster/status/1689682547331014659?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1689740895300763648%7Ctwgr%5E2adb958ecca8fa84343beabc167c8d416a47c9d1%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fu.today%2Fripple-cto-reacts-to-new-fed-requirements-for-paypal-stablecoin-pyusd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">tweeted</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a shady remark, referring to PayPal’s newly launched stablecoin (PYUSD) and whether or not the company had the necessary approvals. In a recent </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1689604991168737280" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">tweet</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, John Reed Stark Consulting President gave some insight into a new </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2308.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">announcement</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> from the Federal Reserve. The apex bank and regulator has now mandated that all state banks under the Federal Reserve system must receive a written supervisory nonobjection from the regulator before dealing with stablecoins. This covers all transactions, including holding, issuing, or otherwise transacting with stablecoins.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The announcement also explains the Fed’s expectation from the process of obtaining the nonobjection. It says:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“To obtain a written notification of supervisory nonobjection, a state member bank should demonstrate that it has established appropriate risk management practices for the proposed activities, including having adequate systems in place to identify, measure, monitor, and control the risks of its activities, and the ability to do so on an ongoing basis.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In response to Schwartz’s comment on the announcement, the Ripple CTO was asked whether or not PayPal received the required approval. Schwartz answered and suggested that the Fed was not on PayPal’s list of regulatory approvals required. Although somewhat slyly, the same account then asked Schwartz about PayPal having the right political connections to be “covered in every aspect.” Schwartz then responded saying “so did they,” presumably another sly response at PayPal.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Schwartz Reaction to Fed Requirements</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Schwartz </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/JoelKatz/status/1689679146736312320" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">described</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the Fed’s issue as a “challenger,” suggesting that the requirements may be problematic. The Fed has identified a few risks and expects banks interested in transacting stablecoins to address these problems. According to the publication, these include operational, cybersecurity, liquidity, illicit finance, and consumer compliance risks. According to the Fed, all banks must notify the regulator before partaking in any activity related to stablecoins, including testing. The Fed also says it will continue a supervisory review and “heightened monitoring” of the activities even after issuing the nonobjection.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Reactions continue to pour in following PayPal’s launch of the PYUSD. Yesterday, Coinspeaker </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-house-committee-paypal-stablecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that the leadership of the Financial Services Committee of the US House of Representatives may feel differently about PayPal’s stablecoin. Both Reps. Maxine Waters and Patrick McHenry have called for a solid regulatory framework to guide these stablecoins. However, Waters has warned of inherent risks.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to her, a regulatory framework is necessary to assure compliance on the part of the company. She also says it is necessary to protect customers. Waters stated that regulation is essential mainly because PayPal, at 435 million customers worldwide, has more than the online accounts of megabanks. On the other hand, McHenry is more in favor. Although he also believes in a regulatory framework, the chairman sees stablecoins differently. McHenry described them as a “pillar of our 21st-century payments system.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/canada-storage-crypto-assets/">Canada to Create Solutions for Storing Seized Crypto Assets</a></p>
<p>In Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and Shared Services Canada (SSC) are collaborating to develop a groundbreaking digital asset solution aimed at streamlining the seizure and storage of crypto and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Non-Fungible Tokens</a> (NFTs) from multiple public blockchains.</p>
<p>On August 10, the RCMP <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/innovative-solutions-canada/en/digital-asset-repository" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a> a tender inviting applications from technology providers capable of developing a centralized repository solution. This move marks a significant stride in adapting law enforcement methods to the evolving digital era.</p>
<h2>The Essential Features of the Crypto Storage Solution</h2>
<p>The tender released by the RCMP outlines a comprehensive list of seventeen key features they seek from the future repository solution. Among these requirements is the capability to process transactions for the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.</p>
<p>This demonstrates a forward-thinking approach, ensuring that the RCMP’s solution remains relevant as the crypto landscape evolves. Recognizing the ever-evolving nature of the digital asset landscape, the RCMP said the solution must not only onboard existing blockchains but also accommodate new ones that may emerge over time.</p>
<p>An equally significant aspect of this initiative is accessibility. The RCMP intends to grant authorized users access to the repository&#8217;s data, enabling efficient collaboration between law enforcement agencies and other stakeholders. Such accessibility could potentially enhance the effectiveness of investigations and asset recovery processes.</p>
<p>While the primary focus is on cryptocurrencies, the RCMP acknowledges the importance of including NFTs in its approach. Consequently, the repository is expected to handle NFTs created on <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> (ETH), Solana (SOL), and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/matic-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polygon</a> (MATIC). This emphasizes the adaptability of the system under consideration and its ability to accommodate various digital asset types.</p>
<p>Other features in the repository include transaction logging, robust security measures, automated verification, and a Web interface.</p>
<h2>The Changing Landscape in Crypto Fraud</h2>
<p>The RCMP’s recent pursuit of a secure digital asset solution is a proactive response to the surge in criminal activities involving cryptocurrencies and NFTs. The rise of cryptocurrencies has ushered in a new paradigm of financial transactions, with both legitimate and illicit applications being recorded.</p>
<p>While cryptocurrencies provide greater privacy and protection for legitimate users, it have also become a favorite way for criminals to participate in activities such as ransomware attacks, internet scams, money laundering, and fraud.</p>
<p>This not only poses a threat to individual financial security but also undermines the integrity of financial systems and erodes public trust in digital assets. Recognizing the urgency of tackling this emerging challenge, the RCMP’s decision to seek an advanced digital asset solution marks a pivotal moment in law enforcement&#8217;s adaptation to the digital age.</p>
<p>Recently, Canadian law enforcement began employing specialist tools from Chainalysis to trace crypto while investigating cybercrime. Local police may now trace blockchain transactions, identify suspects, and discover where funds have been put.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/visa-ethereum-gas-fees/">VISA Allows Users to Pay Ethereum Gas Fees via Credit Card</a></p>
<p>On Thursday, August 10, payments giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/visa-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visa Inc</a> made an important announcement allowing users to pay the on-chain Ethereum gas fees directly in fiat currencies, either using a credit or debit card.</p>
<p>Visa said that it first conducted the test on the Ethereum Goerli testnet by using a paymaster contract in order to sponsor gas fees on behalf of users. Thus, users can send blockchain transactions without having to worry about maintaining an ETH balance. As per Visa, the contracts would make transactions accessible to a wide range of users. Commenting on the development, Visa’s technical team <a href="https://usa.visa.com/solutions/crypto/paying-blockchain-gas-fees-with-card.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Our experiment aims to offer a promising approach to substantially addressing the challenges of blockchain-based transactions. By leveraging the innovative concept of a paymaster, in conjunction with account abstraction and the ERC-4337 standard, we explored the potential for a process that could redefine blockchain-based transactions.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A paymaster contract is a specialized variant of a smart contract in the blockchain ecosystem, intended for overseeing the settlement of gas fees.</p>
<p>The company has proposed that merchants or decentralized applications (Dapps) have the option to implement their own paymaster solution. Alternatively, established wallet and paymaster service providers could present a gas fee payment option using cards in conjunction with their existing paymaster services.</p>
<p>This initiative is a continuation of Visa&#8217;s ongoing efforts in the field. The company has been actively exploring methods to enhance the user-friendliness and accessibility of blockchain-based payments. At the beginning of 2023, Visa started converting digital assets into fiat payments on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<h2>Using Visa Card Payment for Gas Fee</h2>
<p>In the usual Ethereum usage process, individuals acquire <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH</a> through exchanges or on-ramp services. Then, they transfer the acquired ETH to their wallets to ensure they have enough to cover fluctuating gas fees. However, this dynamic gas pricing often leads to situations of overpayment or insufficient ETH supply, introducing complexity and challenges.</p>
<p>Visa&#8217;s solution revolves around Ethereum&#8217;s ERC-4337 account abstraction standard and the utilization of a &#8220;paymaster&#8221; smart contract feature. This approach enables off-chain settlements of gas fees. The five-step sequence is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>A user initiates an Ethereum transaction using their wallet, which forwards the transaction details to the paymaster web service.</li>
<li>The web service calculates the gas fee&#8217;s cost and charges the user&#8217;s Visa card using Visa&#8217;s Cybersource system for payment processing.</li>
<li>Once completed, the web service sends a digital signature back to the wallet, validating the payment. This validation is effective within a specified timeframe.</li>
<li>The wallet attaches this signature to the transaction and submits it to the Ethereum network.</li>
<li>The paymaster smart contract then verifies the signature&#8217;s authenticity and covers the gas fee, facilitating the transaction processing.</li>
</ol>
<p>This series of actions enables users to pay gas fees using their Visa card off-chain. It also eliminates the necessity to hold ETH solely for fee payments. This approach greatly streamlines the user experience, enhancing the convenience of transactions.</p>

<p>Analysts and stakeholders expect gold prices to rise as the year runs out because of macroeconomic factors and recession risks.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/gold-prices-hit-2500-recession/">Gold Prices Expected to Hit $2,500 as Recession Fears Continue</a></p>
<p>There is a general bullishness around gold prices as the yellow metal is on course to an all-time high in 2024. Analysts believe that the new record is likely because of economic uncertainty which indicates a possible recession, and a potential reduction in interest rates.</p>
<p>According to TD Securities’ managing director and global head of commodity strategy Bart Melek, gold will likely hit $2,100 as 2023 ends or early in 2024. Melek believes that a softened stance towards continuously increasing interest rates would be bullish for the yellow metal. Melek is also bullish because gold has performed better than most other assets over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Generally, many people consider gold a safe haven asset and are likely to buy more in times of economic instability. According to a CME Group <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/openmarkets/metals/2023/How-Does-Gold-Perform-with-Inflation-Stagflation-and-Recession.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>, gold performed about 37% better than the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-the-sp-500-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;P 500</a> in six of the last eight recessions. This suggests that gold is likely to soar higher in the event of an official recession.</p>
<p>Another stakeholder believes gold will hit $2,500 in a “couple of years”. According to Randy Smallwood, the CEO of Canadian company Wheaten Precious Metals, a recession would be good for gold. Smallwood is bullish because he expects some drawbacks in the economies of both the US and China.</p>
<p>More bullish predictions continue to pour in for gold. One indicator of a rise in spot prices is the inverse relationship between gold and interest rates. When interest rates increase, people tend to move away from gold to other more attractive investment assets like bonds. This eventually reduces the demand for gold.</p>
<p>Gold is trading at $1,916 as of writing time.</p>
<h2>More Predictions for Gold Prices</h2>
<p>Singaporean banking giant UOB is also bullish on gold prices. According to the head of markets strategy, global economics, and markets research, Heng Koon How, the Fed will likely stop increasing interest rates soon:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Key driver in our positive outlook for gold is anticipated peak in Fed rate hiking cycle as well as upcoming topping out of US Dollar strength.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The UOB exec also predicted higher prices and that a strong demand for gold would come as people regain their economic spending power. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We also see a return of physical gold jewelry demand from China and India as both economies stabilize and retail spending returns.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In a recent report, Citi noted that retail demand for gold from China has been buoyant especially compared to other goods. According to Citi&#8217;s head of commodities strategy Aakash Doshi in a report, gold demand from China was only slightly lower than 200 tons. Doshi notes that this the “strongest seasonal” seen since 2015. The report expects the demand to hit 700 tons by the end of the year. This project would confirm a 22% increase year on year.</p>
<p>Wheaton CEO Smallwood also stated that there is an increase in demand. According to him, customers are getting more gold in all forms, including coins, jewelry, and bars.</p>

<p>Robinhood had earlier motioned for the arguments against it to be completely dismissed.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/robinhood-investors-appeals-court/">Robinhood Beats Investors Again as Appeal Court Upholds Earlier Rule in Meme Stock Trading Suit</a></p>
<p>The federal appeals court of the United States has yet again dismissed a class-action lawsuit against online brokerage firm <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/robinhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robinhood Markets</a>. This follows after 16 investors alleged that the platform did not allow them to buy 13 “meme stocks” during a January 2021 social media frenzy that sent prices to the moon.</p>
<p>According to the complainants, the restriction meant that they could not enjoy any profits. The decision also ended up causing the share prices of these stocks to plunge, they added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the suit, which began in September 2021, only lasted for so long. By January 2022, Robinhood motioned for the complaint to be dismissed, and the court granted that request. In its motion at the time, the firm noted that the plaintiffs failed to state any claim.</p>
<p>Still doubtful about the earlier ruling in the Robinhood case, the plaintiffs then proceeded to the US appeals court in March 2023 to seek redress.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the investors may just have hit another setback. US Appellate Court Judge Britt Grant has <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Juncadelia-v-Robinhood-order-11th-circuit.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">upheld</a> the earlier ruling, claiming that the case lacks legal merit.</p>
<p>Judge Grant clarified that Robinhood, according to its customer agreement, is permitted to restrict any transaction. That is, the platform may decide whether or not to accept a trade offer.</p>
<h2>Is Robinhood Finally in the Clear?</h2>
<p>The court may have established that Robinhood had no hand in the arguments against it. But that is only for the time being.</p>
<p>The investors may decide to take the case up a notch by heading to the US Supreme Court, in what would be a final showdown. To do that, however, they must first file a petition for a “writ of certiorari”, which is a document asking the Supreme Court to review the case.</p>
<p>But out of over 7,000 cases that the Supreme Court reviews, it only takes up about 100-150 cases. Therefore, it is not very likely that the investors will have one more day in court over this case.</p>
<p>As of publication, lawyers from both ends – Robinhood and the plaintiffs, have yet to comment on the development.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/huawei-revenue-h1-2023/">Huawei Reports 3% Revenue Growth and Widened Profit Margin in H1 2023 amidst Sanctions Challenges</a></p>
<p>Chinese tech giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/huawei/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huawei Technologies</a> has released its financial earnings report for the first half (H1) of 2023. The company announced a 3.1% rise in revenue, reaching 310.9 billion yuan ($43.1 billion) for the quarter. The revenue growth comes despite challenges posed by sanctions that have limited access to US processor chips and other technologies. In response to the restrictions severely impacting its smartphone business, Huawei has strategically shifted its focus towards supplying network gear to industries like hospitals, ports, and electric car manufacturers. The move is aimed at reducing vulnerability to sanctions.</p>
<p>The company revealed that its profit margin expanded to 15%, equivalent to approximately 45 billion yuan ($6.5 billion). The figure marks a notable increase from the 4.3% margin reported in the first quarter of the year.</p>
<h2>Huawei Gained $23.2B Revenue from Its Infrastructure Unit in H1 2023</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/news/2023/8/h1-business-results" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announcement</a>, the revenue generated by its ICT infrastructure business stood at 167.2 billion yuan ($23.2 billion), and its consumer sales reached 103.5 billion yuan ($14.3 billion).</p>
<p>Similarly, Huawei&#8217;s cloud <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/huawei-cloud-metaverse-web3-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unit</a> saw a profit of CNY 24.1 billion, while its digital power business stood at CNY 24.2 billion. The firm&#8217;s fledgling automotive unit, responsible for supplying technology for electric cars, generated sales of 1 billion yuan ($138.6 billion).</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s chairwoman Sabrina Meng said the Chinese tech giant has been investing in foundational technology to provide value for customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to thank our customers and partners for their ongoing support. I&#8217;d also like to thank the Huawei team for their solidarity and dedication. Huawei has been investing heavily in foundational technologies to harness trends in digitalization, intelligence, and decarbonization, focusing on creating value for our customers and partners,&#8221; said Meng.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Huawei&#8217;s journey has been marked by resilience and adaptation. The company faced significant challenges after former US President <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> imposed sanctions restricting its access to US processor chips in 2019. Authorities cited security concerns and the company&#8217;s potential for facilitating Chinese espionage as reasons for the sanctions, which Huawei has consistently denied.</p>
<h2>Huawei Demonstrates Resilience Despite Economic Challenges in China</h2>
<p>Despite the US sanctions and the current economic situation in China, Huawei has continued to innovate and diversify. The company remains a dominant global player in the network equipment sector, serving as a significant supplier to phone and internet companies worldwide. While the firm sold its Honor smartphone brand in 2020, it continues to operate within the smartphone market, focusing primarily on its home market in China.</p>
<p>In 2022, the company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/2022-huawei-biggest-annual-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> a 70% decline in profits to 35.6 billion yuan ($5.2 billion) but achieved a 0.9% increase in sales, reaching 642.3 billion yuan ($93.5 billion).</p>
<p>It is important to note that half of Huawei&#8217;s vast employee base of 207,000 individuals is dedicated to research and development. This emphasis on innovation has enabled the company to develop alternatives to US components, including breakthroughs in designing its processor chips.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/dcg-motion-gemini/">Digital Currency Group (DCG) Files Motion to Dismiss Lawsuit by Gemini</a></p>
<p>Venture capital giant Digital Currency Group (DCG) has recently filed a motion for dismissing a lawsuit from crypto exchange Gemini, alleging fraud to the users of its Earn program.</p>
<p>The Digital Currency Group (DCG) submitted its filing to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, on Thursday, August 10. In the motion, DCG CEO Barry Silbert and lawyers note that Gemini&#8217;s lawsuit filing last month was a “continuation of [a] public relations campaign” targeting the firm on social media with “personal, vicious, and false” claims.</p>
<p>Last month, crypto exchange Gemini complained that they are seeking to recover funds as a result of “DCG’s and Silbert’s false, misleading, and incomplete representations and omissions to Gemini” and their role “in encouraging and facilitating Genesis’s fraud against Gemini”.</p>
<p>Genesis, a subsidiary of DCG, managed a cryptocurrency lending initiative known as the Earn program, which was introduced in collaboration with Gemini in 2021. The program offered Gemini users the opportunity to lend their crypto to Genesis, with the commitment of receiving it back along with interest. Regrettably, Gemini suspended withdrawals in November 2022, attributed to &#8220;unprecedented market turmoil&#8221;. Later, the situation ultimately led to the company seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2023.</p>
<h2>DCG Blames the Gemini&#8217;s Winklevoss Twins</h2>
<p>As per the DCG submission, Silbert and the company &#8220;played an insignificant role in the Gemini Earn program&#8221;, and Gemini&#8217;s allegations of fraudulent behavior don&#8217;t hold merit. The filing highlights that the claims made in the Complaint against non-defendant Genesis lack supporting evidence. DCG also pointed out Gemini&#8217;s failure to present these claims during the Genesis bankruptcy, which contradicts their sensational nature. The Digital Currency Group <a href="https://twitter.com/DCGco/status/1689670266752823296" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The lawsuit is a baseless continuation of Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss’ year-long Twitter-based character assassination and public relations campaign to deflect blame from their own mismanagement. DCG looks forward to moving past this ridiculous lawsuit as we continue working towards our mission of accelerating the development of a better financial system.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2022, the downfall of Three Arrows Capital led to a reported $1.2 billion in unsettled funds for Genesis due to bankruptcy issues. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the founders of Gemini, allege that both Genesis and DCG owe the exchange&#8217;s customers $900 million.</p>
<p>Gemini and Genesis are confronting a legal suit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>), filed in January regarding their Earn program. The SEC noted that the program involved the sale of unregistered securities. New York State&#8217;s Department of Financial Services is also investigating the exchange on similar grounds.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/argentina-investigation-worldcoin/">Argentina Launches Investigation into Worldcoin over Privacy Concerns</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Argentina joins Germany, France, and Kenya on the list of governments to investigate the cryptocurrency project <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/worldcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worldcoin</a> over privacy concerns. The country’s Agency for Access to Public Information (AAIP) <a href="https://www.argentina.gob.ar/noticias/la-aaip-investiga-el-tratamiento-de-datos-personales-de-worldcoin-en-argentina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on August 8 that it was looking into the collection, storage, and use of user data at Worldcoin to ensure that it is handled in line with privacy regulations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worldcoin started as a way to distinguish people from bots online and uses retinal scans to verify users, a method that has raised privacy concerns.  The project&#8217;s WRLD token was launched on July 24 with over 2 million accounts already signed up.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AAIP stated that the project has garnered “public notoriety in recent weeks due to the procedure of scanning the faces and irises of numerous individuals in exchange for financial compensation at different locations in Buenos Aires City and the provinces of Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Mendoza, and Río Negro.” It stated that Argentinians “have the right, whenever personal data is provided, to have clear and accessible information in relation to the assignment, use and purpose for which the data is collected and processed, especially with regard to sensitive data, such as biometric data.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expressing similar sentiments, Kenya’s government, through its minister of internal security, announced on August 2 that it was suspending Worldoin operations pending an investigation into the potential risk to citizens. Local media reports state that Kenyan law enforcement raided a Worldcoin office and seized equipment suspected to contain user data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Germany, the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision revealed that it was investigating the project over privacy concerns. The French National Commission on Informatics and Liberty has also described Worldcoin’s data collection methods as “questionable.” The United Kingdom’s Information Commissioner’s Office has also expressed similar concerns, stating that it would examine the project to ensure compliance with data laws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in a </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/10/worldcoin-regulatory-scrutiny-grows-as-argentina-opens-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement to CoinDesk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Worldcoin stated that “the project complies with all laws and regulations governing the processing of personal data in the markets where Worldcoin is available, including but not limited to Argentina&#8217;s Personal Data Protection Act 25.326.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worldcoin was co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and raised $115 million in funding in May from Andreessen Horowitz, Bain Capital Crypto, and Distributed Global.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the criticism of its method and storage of data collection, the project has also been subject to scrutiny over its onboarding of early adopters. A </span><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/06/1048981/worldcoin-cryptocurrency-biometrics-web3/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by MIT Technology asserts that Worldcoin’s first 1 million users were obtained by “deception, cash handouts and exploiting workers” in developing countries. </span></p>
