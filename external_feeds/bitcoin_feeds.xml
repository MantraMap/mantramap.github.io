<h2>Authorities Cracking Down on Cryptocurrency Scams</h2>
<p>Europol announced Thursday that authorities from Bulgaria, Serbia, Cyprus, and Germany, in collaboration with Europol and Eurojust, have taken down &#8220;call centers selling fake crypto.&#8221;</p>
<p>The criminal network, operating through call centers, &#8220;lured victims into investing large amounts of money into fake cryptocurrency schemes,&#8221; Europol explained, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The suspects used advertisements on social networks to lure victims to websites covertly operated by the criminals, which offered seemingly exceptional investment opportunities in cryptocurrencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fifteen people have been arrested in the case while 261 were questioned and 22 locations were searched, including four call centers. The authorities also seized three hardware wallets containing about $1 million in cryptocurrencies, approximately 50,000 euros in cash, three vehicles, electronic equipment, documents, and data backups.</p>

<p>Victims, primarily from Germany, were initially convinced to invest small sums of money. &#8220;Fake price hikes leading to supposedly lucrative profits for investors then persuaded them to make transfers of higher amounts,&#8221; the EU law enforcement agency noted, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Currently, it is estimated that the financial damage to German victims is over two million euro.</p></blockquote>
<p>Europol further revealed that there are also victims in other countries, including Switzerland, Australia, and Canada.</p>

The validator milestone comes as Ethereum core developers prepare for the Shanghai hard fork. Five days ago, Ethereum core developers launched a developer network environment called &#x201C;devnet 2&#x201D; for the upcoming upgrade.</strong></p>
<h2>Ethereum Developers Launch &#x2018;Devnet 2&#x2019; Testing Network for Upcoming Shanghai Upgrade; Network Exceeds 500,000 Validators</h2>
<p>On Jan. 11, 2023, Ethereum developers <a href="https://youtu.be/Z-0z5-7hGvo">launched</a> a new testing network for the Shanghai upgrade, a hard fork that&#x2019;s anticipated to happen in March 2023. The developer&#x2019;s new testing environment is called &#x201C;devnet 2&#x201D; as it follows &#x201C;devnet 1&#x201D; released in Nov. 2022. The new testnet was discussed briefly during the All Core Devs (ACD) meeting held on Jan. 5, 2023.</p>

<p>At that time, Ethereum core developers <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethereum-developers-prepare-to-deploy-shanghai-public-testnet-focus-on-staked-ether-withdrawals/">stressed</a> that the focus remains vigilant on staked withdrawals. It has been 123 days since <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/what-is-the-merge-a-brief-explanation-of-ethereums-transition-from-proof-of-work-to-proof-of-stake/">The Merge</a>, the point in time when the Ethereum blockchain transitioned from a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network. The transition meant that instead of miners and ASIC devices verifying transactions, Ethereum validators now handle the verification of onchain transactions on the main layer.</p>
<p>Following the release of devnet 2, the next day the network crossed a milestone with more than 500,000 validators, according to <a href="https://beaconscan.com/stat/validator">statistics</a> from beaconscan.com. In order to become a validator, an individual or organization must physically manage a validator client on the Beacon Chain and hold 32 <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH/">ether</a>. According to Jan. 16, 2023, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH/">ethereum (ETH)</a> exchange rates, the cost to be a validator with the 32 Ether price alone would be just over $50,000.</p>

<p>Beaconscan.com indicates that as of Jan. 15, 2023, roughly 501,215 validators were recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. On the same day last year, there were approximately 282,249 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> validators, which means the count has increased by 77.58% over the last 12 months. On the day of The Merge, there were 428,438 validators, and today the number is 16.99% higher.</p>

With this solution, institutions can lock a specified amount of crypto with a qualified cold storage wallet, and assets will be mirrored on their Binance exchange account with a 1:1 balance.</strong></p>
<h2>Binance Mirror Allows Institutional Investors Access to Liquidity via Assets Held in Cold Storage</h2>
<p>On Monday, Binance <a href="https://www.binanceinstitutional.com/support/announcements/article/204448334901952512">announced</a> the launch of an off-exchange settlement solution called &#8220;Binance Mirror.&#8221; Essentially, institutional investors can lock collateral by connecting their <a href="https://www.binanceinstitutional.com/qualified-wallet">qualified cold wallet</a> with Binance Custody. The assets can then be mirrored on their Binance exchange account.</p>
<p>Binance notes that assets in the cold storage will be kept safe as long as the mirror position remains open on the Binance exchange, which can be settled at any time. The crypto exchange also detailed that assets held in Binance Mirror &#8220;account for more than 60% of all assets secured on Binance Custody.&#8221; The exchange said Binance Mirror experienced significant growth during the final quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>By using the mirror service, institutional investors have access to the range of products on the Binance exchange, as well as &#8220;institutional VIP Loans.&#8221; Athena Yu, the vice president of Binance Custody, explained that institutions are looking for top-notch security but also &#8220;the deep liquidity that the Binance Exchange offers.&#8221;</p>
<p>“We spent much of last year refining its operations to help our clients unlock the liquidity of their assets held in our cold storage,” the Binance Custody VP said in a statement on Monday. “We’re very excited about where we are today and can’t wait to introduce our upcoming new features that will elevate Binance Mirror’s functionality even further.”</p>

<p>The launch of Binance Mirror follows the exchange gaining <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-now-authorized-in-7-eu-countries-sweden-becomes-latest-member-state-to-give-approval/">authorization</a> in seven European Union countries. At the start of 2023, the company also recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-joins-association-of-certified-sanctions-specialists/">joined</a> an association of certified sanctions specialists. Binance&#8217;s custody subsidiary, Binance Custody, was launched in December 2021 and offers segregated accounts and wallet systems.</p>

Developers detailed on Jan. 15, 2023, that the L2 platform, &#8220;Shibarium beta,&#8221; is about to be launched on top of the Ethereum blockchain to provide better scalability, faster transaction times, and lower fees.</strong></p>
<h2>SHIB Token Market Reacts Positively to Upcoming Shibarium Launch</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/SHIB/">shiba inu (SHIB)</a> meme token community, also known as the &#8220;SHIB Army,&#8221; has been growing excited about the launch of Shibarium, a new layer two scaling solution crafted for the SHIB crypto ecosystem. Hints about Shibarium&#8217;s launch <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/shibs-shibarium-public-beta-is-planned-for-deployment-in-q3/">started</a> last year as it was originally supposed to launch in the third quarter of 2022. In mid-Dec. 2022, SHIB community members <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/shib-community-members-and-countdown-clock-hint-shibarium-launch-is-imminent/">hinted</a> that the project&#8217;s launch was getting closer by the day. On Jan. 15, 2023, the SHIB team published a <a href="https://blog.shibaswap.com/introduction-to-shibarium/">blog post</a> called &#8220;Introduction to Shibarium: Shiba Inu&#8217;s Layer 2 Network.&#8221;</p>
<p>The blog post insists &#8220;Shibarium beta is about to be launched&#8221; and describes what people can expect from the launch. The team stresses Shibarium will be a phased release. The project&#8217;s native token, called BONE, will be leveraged to &#8220;pay for gas transactions and reward validators and delegators within the Shibarium protocol.&#8221; The team also mentions that while there is a supply of 250 million BONE, &#8220;20 million have been reserved to reward validators and delegators in the coming years.”</p>
<p>The ERC20 meme token <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/SHIB/">shiba inu (SHIB)</a> has been rising on the Shibarium news during the last week as <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/SHIB/">SHIB</a> jumped 19.3% higher against the U.S. dollar. In the last 24 hours, BONE is up 11.1% higher and BONE has gained 16.1% this past week. Despite the Shibarium beta launch, a number of other meme tokens have seen bigger rises like floki (FLOKI), which jumped 26.4% this week.</p>

<p>The meme token let&#8217;s go brandon (LETSGO) is up 71.6% during the last seven days, and shibavax (SHIBX) has increased by 55.9%. Metadoge (METADOGE) is up 41.5% this week and hoge finance (HOGE) has risen 30.5%. The godfather of meme coins, dogecoin (DOGE), has seen a moderate increase this week, jumping 13.6% against the U.S. dollar. The <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/meme-token">meme coin economy</a>, in general, is down as a whole, as it has lost 3.5% in value during the past 24 hours.</p>

This solicitation for new capital comes after 3AC co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies were subpoenaed over the social media platform Twitter.</strong></p>
<h2>Pitch Deck Shows Three Arrows Capital Co-Founders Seek New Investment for Crypto Exchange GTX</h2>
<p>There’s a flurry of <a href="https://twitter.com/fintechfrank/status/1614985897358811138?s=20&amp;t=UWDMeIWnyxg8iKEbbuPhow">reports</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Teeird/status/1614988005365944321?s=20&amp;t=UWDMeIWnyxg8iKEbbuPhow">screenshots</a> of an alleged pitch deck and website that claim the two 3AC co-founders, <a href="https://twitter.com/zhusu">Su Zhu</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleLDavies">Kyle Davies</a>, are attempting to raise $25 million from investors. They allegedly want to start a new exchange called GTX. The crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-embattled-crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-files-for-chapter-15-bankruptcy/">filed</a> for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection during the first week of July 2022.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">3AC founders Zhu and Davies are aiming raise $25 million for new crypto exchange &quot;GTX&quot;</p>
<p>What could go wrong?! <a href="https://t.co/vm3NFBYdNZ">pic.twitter.com/vm3NFBYdNZ</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Crypto Crib (@Crypto_Crib_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Crypto_Crib_/status/1614987474014539778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>It is alleged that the company&#8217;s liquidators have had difficulty communicating with the two co-founders. Zhu and Davies were recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/three-arrows-capital-founders-served-subpoenas-via-twitter-in-bankruptcy-process/">served subpoenas via Twitter</a>. Additionally, reports indicate that 3AC is allegedly being <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-bankrupt-crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-probed-by-sec-cftc-for-possible-legal-violations/">investigated</a> for potential legal violations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>
<p>In addition to Zhu and Davies, two Coinflex executives, Mark Lamb and Sudhu Arumugam, are also mentioned as being part of the new team. Coinflex, like Three Arrows Capital, also suffered from financial issues and <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FZvd1VyXoAQpqX3.jpg">filed</a> for restructuring services in Seychelles last August.</p>

<p>Of course, the alleged pitch deck and website screenshots were <a href="https://twitter.com/concodanomics/status/1614991595681579011?s=20&amp;t=UWDMeIWnyxg8iKEbbuPhow">shared</a> on social media, and the 3AC founders were widely <a href="https://twitter.com/bigmagicdao/status/1614981003008933889?s=20&amp;t=UWDMeIWnyxg8iKEbbuPhow">mocked</a>. Both founders have been <a href="https://twitter.com/zhusu/status/1613389245007233026?s=20&amp;t=v99eHAPRLYLrBIcBCg5fng">more active</a> on social media <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleLDavies/status/1614861957806362624?s=20&amp;t=v99eHAPRLYLrBIcBCg5fng">recently</a>, but they have not addressed the recent speculation about them starting a new crypto exchange called GTX.</p>
<p>As of the time of this writing, it has not been officially confirmed whether the 3AC duo is starting a new crypto exchange.</p>

The global cryptocurrency market cap is currently trading 0.98% higher as of writing. Shiba inu also traded close to recent highs, despite declines on Monday. </strong></p>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>Solana (SOL) remained near a two-month high to start the week, despite crypto markets beginning to consolidate recent gains.</p>
<p>SOL/USD hit an intraday high of $24.75 on Monday, which comes less than a day after falling to a bottom of $22.68.</p>
<p>This move means that the token remains close to this weekend’s high of $25.03, which was the strongest point for SOL since November 8.</p>

<p>From the chart, it appears as sentiment in solana is still somewhat bullish, which comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continued to track above a support point at 80.00.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 80.18, with solana trading at the $23.42 price point.</p>
<p>Should the index remain about 80.00 in the coming days, it is likely that SOL could once again move toward $25.00.</p>

<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h2>
<p>Like SOL, shiba inu (SHIB) bypassed today’s price consolidation, maintaining recent highs in the process.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.00001009 on Sunday, SHIB/USD climbed to a peak of $0.00001099 earlier today.</p>
<p>Monday’s action has seen the meme coin continue to trade near the two-month high of $0.00001111, hit last Friday.</p>

<p>Like many cryptocurrencies last week, prices of shiba inu were mostly overbought in recent days, with the RSI falling from a ceiling at 80.00.</p>
<p>Currently, the index is tracking at 73.00, with a floor at the 70.00 mark a possible target for sellers.</p>
<p>However, bulls seem to be rejecting this proposition on Monday, with some eyeing a rally back above $0.00001100 instead.</p>

<h2>Onchain Researchers Track Stolen Ethereum From Harmony Bridge Attack and Help Major Exchanges Freeze Funds</h2>
<p>On June 23 of last year, the Harmony development team <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/harmonys-100m-hack-was-due-to-a-compromised-multi-sig-scheme-says-analyst/">disclosed</a> that $100 million in cryptocurrency funds had been stolen from the Horizon bridge. Reports indicated that the attacker had utilized a multi-signature wallet to gain control of the bridge. Onchain researcher Zachxbt <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1614771861266792449?s=20&t=pTav-1j58fSVAS-_CkThqw">discovered</a> that funds related to the Horizon bridge loss began to move 206 days later, with 41,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> (worth $63.2 million at current exchange rates) being transferred.</p>
<p>&#x201C;North Korea&#x2019;s Lazarus Group had a very busy weekend moving $63.5 million (approximately 41,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) from the Harmony bridge hack through Railgun before consolidating funds and depositing them on three different exchanges,&#x201D; Zachxbt tweeted. The funds were reportedly deposited into OKEx, Huobi, and Binance. Zachxbt added that Huobi and Binance had frozen some of the ethereum sent to the exchanges.</p>

<p>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, commonly known as &#x201C;CZ,&#x201D; confirmed that the funds were indeed frozen. &#x201C;We detected Harmony One hacker fund movement,&#x201D; CZ <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1614887319177428992?s=20&t=pTav-1j58fSVAS-_CkThqw">wrote</a>. &#x201C;They previously tried to launder through Binance and we froze their accounts. This time they used Huobi. We assisted the Huobi team in freezing their accounts. Together, 124 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> have been recovered,&#x201D; the Binance executive added.</p>
<p>The blockchain intelligence firm Elliptic <a href="https://hub.elliptic.co/analysis/the-100-million-horizon-hack-following-the-trail-through-tornado-cash-to-north-korea/">initially linked</a> the funds to North Korea&#x2019;s Lazarus Group. Lazarus Group is accused of carrying out numerous attacks against cryptocurrency projects in recent years. It is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ofac-update-claims-ronin-hack-is-tethered-to-north-koreas-hacker-syndicate-lazarus-group/">believed</a> that the North Korean hacker collective was behind the $620 million Ronin bridge attack as well.</p>

Traders have seemingly moved to secure recent gains, after the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency rose above $21,000 for the first time since November. Ethereum also retreated from recent highs in today&#x2019;s session. </strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) consolidated to start the week, as prices failed to break out of a key resistance level.</p>
<p>Following a high of $21,345.25 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD fell to an intraday low of $20,681.98 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>This drop comes as the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency was unable to move beyond its long-term ceiling at $21,400.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, this was somewhat expected, due to the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) hovering in overbought territory.</p>
<p>As of writing, price strength is currently tracking at 86.65, after failing to move north of the 90.00 mark.</p>
<p>It is likely that further declines could be on the cards this week, with a floor of $20,000 a potential target for sellers.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also retreated from recent highs, which comes after a failed breakout of its own.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD dropped to a bottom of $1,529.79 earlier today, which comes after trading at a high of $1,579.48 on Sunday.</p>
<p>Ethereum failed to sustain a move above a ceiling at $1,580, giving way to a resurgence of some bearish sentiment.</p>

<p>Like with bitcoin, ethereum prices were significantly overbought, with the index at its highest point since January 2021.</p>
<p>Now tracking at 83.46, the next visible floor seems to be at the 70.00 mark, which if hit, could see <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> trading near $1,475.</p>

The operation, carried out in partnership with Bolsa OTC, tokenized almost $2 million in bank credit notes, which were also distributed by Bradesco.</strong></p>
<h2>Bradesco Launches Asset Tokenization Program</h2>
<p>Bradesco, one of the biggest banks in Brazil and Latam, has entered the crypto era, being one of the first institutions that harness blockchain tech in its operations in Brazil. The bank announced on Jan. 13, 2023, that it had tokenized the first batch of bank credit notes, valued at almost $2 million, as part of a pilot program to test the functionality of these technologies.</p>
<p>The operation, which Bradesco claims is the first one supervised and approved by the central bank of the country, was carried out in partnership with Bolsa OTC and using a regulatory sandbox that allows financial institutions to make this kind of test using new technologies.</p>
<p>On the significance of this, Edson Moreto, executive director of Bradesco, <a href="https://valor.globo.com/financas/criptomoedas/noticia/2023/01/13/bradesco-tokeniza-cdula-de-crdito-bancrio-e-entra-para-mundo-cripto.ghtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We continue to work and test the benefits of blockchain technology using its innovation ecosystem, Inovabra, so that new operations are made available to our customers.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The Asset Tokenization Business</h2>
<p>Asset tokenization, the process of representing real-world assets in blockchains, is considered by some analysts the next step in market tech. The technology might become a trend for negotiations in financial markets in the future, with a <a href="https://www.marketsmedia.com/asset-tokenization-to-grow-into-16-trillion-opportunity-by-2030/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> issued in December by BCG and ADDX predicting it will become a $16 trillion business opportunity by 2030.</p>
<p>Bradesco is the second bank in Brazil that is currently experimenting with tokenization and tokenized assets. The first one to do it was Itau Unibanco, which executed a series of tokenization tests issuing assets to employees and customers of the bank back in July.</p>
<p>At that time, Itau also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/itau-unibanco-mulls-offering-crypto-services-opens-tokenization-unit-in-brazil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the creation of its own tokenization unit, which would be focused on offering tokenization services to customers, allowing them to tokenize and sell these assets using a platform built and controlled by the bank.</p>
<p>According to local sources, more banks will be also including tokenization as part of their services portfolio in the future. Many of these institutions were expecting the approval of the recent cryptocurrency law, sanctioned in December, to have a clear panorama on compliance issues to offer these tokenization services.</p>
