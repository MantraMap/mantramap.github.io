<p>BTC/USD Bulls Seek to Hold 29427:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 8 July 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained impacted by bearish technical sentiment early in the Asian session as the pair came off to the 29715.97 area after trading as high as the 31525.10 area, a recent twelve-month high reached a few trading sessions ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;Traders then lifted BTC/USD to the 30363.57 area, a move that represented a test of the 38.2% retracement of the recent depreciating range from 31525.10 to 29715.97.&nbsp; Decent selling pressure recently intensified around the 31142.38 area and this elevates the risk of another test of the 29427 area, representing the 38.2% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 26165.98 to 31443.67.&nbsp; &nbsp;Below that area, the 28604.83 level represents the 50% retracement of that appreciating range.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.</p>
<p>Following recent selling pressure, areas of potential technical support and buying pressure include the 29427, 28886, 28804, 28182, 28096, and 27306 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Technicians are closely watching to see how much technical support develops around the 28095.44 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
