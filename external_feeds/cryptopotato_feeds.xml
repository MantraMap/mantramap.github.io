            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NFT data firm Mnemonic has secured a $6 million seed extension round led by Salesforce Ventures. Other participants of the fundraiser include Polygon Ventures, Orange DAO, FIN Capital, and FJ Labs.</p>
<p>The latest capital infusion will be deployed to accelerate the product roadmap of Mnemonic amid rising demand for deeper on-chain insights by expanding the suite of APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mnemonic&#8217;s CEO and Co-founder, Andrii Yasinetsky, revealed that the capital funds the company&#8217;s &#8220;ambitious vision to unlock Web3&#8217;s full potential&#8221; to drive &#8220;exceptional experiences, personalized rewards, and sticky communities for enterprises of all sizes.&#8221;</li>
<li>As part of the deal, Salesforce plans to tap Mnemonic&#8217;s technology to power its Web3-related CRM products in a bid to assist customers in making better data-driven decisions on critical aspects such as partner selection, Web3 product pricing, and audience targeting for airdrop.</li>
<li>Following the development, Laura Rowson, a senior associate at Salesforce Ventures, was <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/06/14/salesforce-ventures-leads-6-million-round-for-web3-data-analytics-firm-mnemonic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">quoted</a> saying,</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[CoinEx will pay fines and make refunds worth more than $1.7M, and will not be allowed to operate in New York nor accept new customers from the US.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">After being sued for operating illegally in February 2023, CoinEx, a Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange, has reached an agreement with the office of the New York Attorney General, which includes a payment of over $1.7 million and a ban from offering its services in New York.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The recovered funds will go into penalties and refunds to New York investors.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">CoinEx to Refund Over $1 Million</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-recovers-17-million-cryptocurrency-platform-operating" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">press release</a> from the New York Attorney General&#8217;s (NYAG) office CoinEx agreed to pay back more than $1.1 million to over 4,600 New York investors and further pay penalties worth $600,000 to the state of New York. The refund will happen over the next 90 days when users can be paid back in crypto directly from the exchange.</p>
<p>The agreement between CoinEx and the NYAG&#8217;s office will also prohibit the crypto firm from offering, selling, or buying securities and commodities in New York and ban the company from opening new accounts for customers in the U.S. The firm is also mandated to apply geoblocking to restrict access to the CoinEx platform for New York IP addresses.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Commenting on the latest development, NYAG Letitia James said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“Today’s agreement should serve as a warning to crypto companies that there are hefty consequences for ignoring New York’s laws. My office will continue to crack down on crypto companies that brazenly disregard the law, mislead investors, and put New Yorkers at risk.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">The office of the NYAG recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coin-cafe-to-pay-4-3-million-restitution-to-defrauded-investors-nyag/" data-wpel-link="internal">ordered</a> Coin Cafe to refund over $4 million to users on the grounds that the crypto firm defrauded investors with its &#8220;free&#8221; bitcoin wallet storage service, which was not free.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">NYAG Wants Tougher Crypto Regulations</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The development between CoinEx and the office of the NYAG settles a lawsuit brought by the latter against the firm in February 2023. As previously <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ny-attorney-general-sues-coinex-for-selling-securities-without-a-license/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> by <em>CryptoPotato</em>, the New York regulator alleged that CoinEx falsely represented itself as a cryptocurrency exchange and sold tokens labeled as securities and commodities without proper registration.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shortly after the lawsuit, CoinEx announced that it was withdrawing its services from the US market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In May, Attorney General James proposed legislation called the Crypto Regulation, Protection, Transparency, and Oversight (CRPTO) Act that would see more stringent regulatory policies for the cryptocurrency industry. James believes the lack of robust crypto rules makes the industry prone to fraud and other criminal activities.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Sheriff McNamara supposedly remained unfazed by the legal battle started by Bitcoin Depot, saying the company "can go to hell."]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lux Vending &#8211; doing business as Bitcoin Depot &#8211; has reportedly filed a lawsuit against the sheriff&#8217;s office of McLennan County, Texas, accusing it of unlawfully seizing $15,000 from a BTC automated teller machine (ATM).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The authorities confiscated the amount to compensate an elderly victim who had become a victim of a cryptocurrency scam.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin Depot &#8216;Can Go to Hell&#8217;</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to local </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.kwtx.com/2023/06/13/elderly-woman-scammed-into-converting-15k-into-bitcoin-sparks-legal-battle-between-crypto-kiosk-manager-mclennan-county-sheriffs-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">coverage</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the whole drama started at the end of April when an 82-year-old Crawford woman was browsing the Internet for a cooking recipe. While online, she received an email stating she had accidentally activated a &#8220;Ransomware&#8221; computer virus.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The woman contacted &#8220;customer support,&#8221; where she was redirected to a specially-designated &#8220;fraud investigator.&#8221; The latter claimed all her personal data had been compromised, adding that someone had written a $15,000 check to a mysterious construction firm using her details. The wrongdoer advised the victim to make a $15K cash withdrawal from her bank and deposit the money into a bitcoin ATM in Waco, Texas. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The woman said she followed the instructions and that the guy stayed on the phone with her the entire time. The woman said she deposited $15,000, $100 at a time,&#8221; the affidavit reads. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Shortly after, she reported the fraud to the sheriff&#8217;s office, which issued a search warrant on Bitcoin Depot, seized the funds, and returned them to the woman. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The $15,000 she put in the machine was still in the wallet that she had put it in. So we retrieved that $15,000 and brought it back to the office. We photographed it, put it into evidence, and ultimately got it back to the victim so she wouldn&#8217;t be further traumatized by these creeps,&#8221; Sheriff Parnell McNamara asserted. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He described the firm as &#8220;a bunch of vultures&#8221; that wanted to take money that rightfully belonged to the elderly person. The sheriff went even further, saying Bitcoin Depot &#8220;can go to hell.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For its part, the company&#8217;s team maintained that the sheriff&#8217;s office had the right to confiscate the funds but not return them to the woman. The lawsuit also states that Bitcoin Depot was not the scammer, meaning they did not lure the victim into depositing the money. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A hearing has not yet been scheduled. Bitcoin Depot&#8217;s attorney &#8211; MacVane &#8211; said the entity &#8220;pledged to cooperate in any way possible&#8221; to help the investigators in the case. According to the sheriff, the fraudsters are located in another country.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Missouri Citizen Who Shot a BTC ATM</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The aforementioned case of the elderly Texas resident is not the only baffling one involving a Bitcoin ATM. The Missouri citizen Matthew Klinger recently </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/missouri-citizen-sentenced-to-5-years-of-probation-after-shooting-a-bitcoin-atm-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">received </span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">five years of supervised probation after firing five rounds into such a machine. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">His reason behind the act remained unclear, however, he said he destroyed the device &#8220;so that it could not take money from anyone else.&#8221; </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The agency also accused the crypto firm of conducting secret transactions to Binance. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Texas State Securities Board filed an emergency cease and desist order against crypto trading platform Abra and its Chief Executive Officer Bill Barhydt. The watchdog claimed that the company misled its customers and committed securities fraud by offering some of its products, such as Abra Earn.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The regulator added that the firm has been &#8220;secretly transferring assets&#8221; to Binance, noting that the US SEC has recently targeted the world&#8217;s biggest crypto exchange.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Insolvent Since March?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Texas regulator </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.ssb.texas.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/ENF_23_CDO_1873_NOH_Actions.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">maintained</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in its lengthy cautionary letter that Abra deceived the public and engaged in fraud via the offer and sale of unregistered securities. The company supposedly violated existing laws using its yield-earning product Abra Earn.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While it removed that offering in October 2022, the platform later started selling investments through a similar product called Abra Boost. According to the watchdog, the shift was another way to mislead and scam users. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A working group interviewed CEO Barhydt at the end of March this year, estimating that &#8220;parties collectively operating as Abra were collectively insolvent or nearly insolvent.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth mentioning that the organization has already been a target for some of the top financial regulators in the USA &#8211; the SEC and the CFTC. The agencies </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-sec-and-cftc-fine-cryptocurrency-investment-platform-abra-for-illegal-swaps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">imposed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a fine of $300,000 on Abra and Plutus Tech for the alleged sale of illegal &#8220;security-based swaps to retail investors.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Texas State Securities Board also suggested that the entity has been secretly moving funds to Binance. As of February, Abra had assets valued at over $118 million at the crypto behemoth, the order reads. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Binance also has a beef with American regulators. The SEC recently </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-plummets-after-sec-sues-binance-for-securities-violations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">filed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a lawsuit against the exchange, its US affiliate, and CEO Changpeng Zhao, accusing them of offering trading services with unlicensed securities, including BNB and BUSD. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition, Binance.US </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-us-delists-101-trading-pairs-following-sec-freezing-order/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">delisted</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> over 100 trading pairs, including AAVE/USDT, MANA/USDT, BCH/BTC, DOT/BTC, MANA/BTC, and XTZ/BTC after the Commission requested a freezing order.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Abra&#8217;s Rise and Fall</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Found in 2014 in Silicon Valley, Abra gained momentum in 2018 when it added support to 20 additional cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC). Its expansion continued in the following years, reaching a peak during the bull market in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Back then, Abra </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/crypto-platform-abra-raises-55-million-in-series-c-funding" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">secured</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a $55 million fundraiser, supported by some prominent names in the finance sector like American Express. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The trading venue </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/abra-plans-to-launch-a-us-chartered-bank-and-allow-crypto-deposits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">revealed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> its intention to launch two financial institutions, called Abra Bank (focused on American clients) and Abra International (designated for global users), in 2022. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;We believe that for Abra, this is a defining moment that brings us closer to our mission to make financial independence and well-being accessible to everyone, everywhere,&#8221; the firm said at the time.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the prolonged crypto winter, which affected various digital asset organizations, took its toll on Abra, too, and the firm had to dismiss 5% of its staff last summer. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The crypto community has sent roughly $600K as of now in various digital assets. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most popular on-chain crypto sleuths, going by the Twitter handle ZachXBT, said he was being sued for an article he posted last year.</p>
<p>The researcher said he is not wealthy, unlike the person suing him, and needs the community&#8217;s support for his defense. That support has been quite impressive so far.</p>
<ul>
<li>ZachXBT took to Twitter yesterday evening to inform that he was being sued by &#8220;MachiBigBrother&#8221; for an <a href="https://medium.com/@investigationsbyzachxbt/22-000-eth-embezzled-and-over-ten-projects-failed-the-story-of-machi-big-brother-jeff-huang-a1ad073fcfa8" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">article</a> published a year ago. The story itself names Jeff Huang (Machi), who ZachXBT described as a &#8220;former Taiwanese-American musician and tech entrepreneur who embezzled 22,000 ETH from Formosa Financial in 2018.&#8221;</li>
<li>It goes in-depth explaining how Huang managed to defraud investors by launching &#8220;over ten failed pump and dump tokens and NFT projects.&#8221;</li>
<li>Huang has now filed a defamation lawsuit against ZachXBT, which the latter described as &#8220;baseless and an attempt to chill free speech.&#8221;</li>
<li>The researcher further defined the lawsuit as a &#8220;classic David &amp; Goliath story&#8221; due to the supposed wealth difference between the two parties.</li>
<li>He believes his defense could exceed $1 million, which is why he created a crypto donation address to &#8220;assist with legal costs.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">3/ I am creating a donation address to assist with legal costs associated with the defense of this matter, which could easily exceed $1m USD.</p>
<p>All leftover funds will be returned on a pro rata basis to contributors.</p>
<p>— ZachXBT (@zachxbt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1669783721451618304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">June 16, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<ul>
<li>On-chain data suggests that the wallet itself has <a href="https://zapper.xyz/account/0x6eA158145907a1fAc74016087611913A96d96624" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">received</a> nearly $600,000 worth of crypto in 14 hours after publishing the tweet (as of writing these lines). It has $300,000 in ETH, $180,000 in USDC, $67,000 in USDT, and more.</li>
<li>Additionally, other members of the crypto community urged ZachXBT to create BTC wallets for those who do not use EVM chains.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[SOL has reclaimed $15 after a 7% daily increase, BNB is close to $250. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin registered two consecutive days of price increases for the first time in a while as it pumped from under $25,000 to just shy of $27,000 within this timeframe.</p>
<p>ETH&#8217;s performance is rather similar, as the second-largest crypto now sits at $1,750. Most other altcoins are in the green as well.</p>
<h2>BTC Soars to Weekly High</h2>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase took their toll on the cryptocurrency market, with BTC slumping last week to $25,400, even though it wasn&#8217;t even mentioned in the filings. Despite its instant recovery attempts to $27,400, the landscape remained grim for the past week or so.</p>
<p>The US CPI numbers and the subsequent decision by the Fed to pause raising the interest rates didn&#8217;t affect the asset either, at least at first. However, it all changed just hours after the Fed&#8217;s decision as BTC dumped from over $26,000 to a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-drops-to-3-month-low-below-25000-where-to-next/" data-wpel-link="internal">three-month low</a> of under $24,800.</p>
<p>The bulls finally stepped up at this point following positive news from the world&#8217;s largest asset manager &#8211; BlackRock, which filed for a Bitcoin Spot ETF in the States.</p>
<p>BTC went on the offensive and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-shot-up-1k-following-blackrocks-btc-etf-filing-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">jumped</a> by a grand first on Friday. The past 24 hours were even more promising for the asset as it <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/almost-100-million-in-liquidations-as-bitcoin-btc-soared-to-weekly-high/" data-wpel-link="internal">pumped</a> to $26,800 for the first time in over a week.</p>
<p>Its market capitalization has increased to $515 billion, while its dominance over the alts has gone up to 48% on CMC.</p>

<h2>Alts See Green</h2>
<p>Most altcoins suffered even more than BTC, given the fact they were described as unregistered securities by the US SEC in the lawsuits. The past two days, though, have been quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Ethereum&#8217;s multi-month low came during the week at just over $1,600. ETH reacted well since then and is up to $1,750 after a 4% increase in the past 24 hours alone.</p>
<p>Binance Coin, expectedly, dumped hard as well and recently registered a<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-coin-bnb-dumps-to-6-month-low-bitcoin-btc-fails-at-26k-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal"> 6-month low</a> at $222. Now, BNB is close to $250, following a 3% daily jump.</p>
<p>Solana has soared the most from the top 10 (6.5%) to over $15. Cardano, Dogecoin, Tron, Polygon, Litecoin, Polkadot, Shiba Inu, and Avalanche are also in the green.</p>
<p>QNT is the biggest gainer from the top 50 (17%) as of now, followed by Algorand, Aptos, HBAR, and LDO.</p>
<p>The crypto market cap went to a low of $1.010 trillion on CMC but is above $1.070 trillion now, meaning it has added over $60 billion in the past two days.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[QNT has taken the main stage, with a notable 20% surge to $115.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After several days of depressing price movements, bitcoin finally went on the offensive and shot up by almost $2,000 in the past 24 hours to register its highest price tag since June 8.</p>
<p>Expectedly, this has resulted in millions of dollars worth of liquidations, with short positions representing almost 80%.</p>
<ul>
<li>Following the SEC&#8217;s lawsuits against the two largest crypto exchanges &#8211; Binance and Coinbase &#8211; as well as the CPI numbers from Wednesday and the Fed&#8217;s pivot from its interest rate hiking policy, bitcoin&#8217;s price performance was quite underwhelming.</li>
<li>The asset recently charted its lowest price tag in<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-drops-to-3-month-low-below-25000-where-to-next/" data-wpel-link="internal"> three months</a>. The altcoins, though, suffered even more, and the total crypto market cap had declined by $130 billion within less than two weeks at one point.</li>
<li>However, the bulls finally have a cause for celebration. The past 24-48 hours have been significantly more beneficial for the entire market.</li>
<li>BTC had <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-shot-up-1k-following-blackrocks-btc-etf-filing-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">recovered</a> some ground and stood at $25,500 after BlackRock&#8217;s filing for a Bitcoin Spot ETF. After a minor setback yesterday and a dip to $25,200, the cryptocurrency went on a tear and skyrocketed to a 9-day high at $26,800.</li>
<li>Needless to say, most altcoins have mimicked or even outperformed BTC on a daily scale, with Solana, Polygon, Ethereum, Aptos, and Algorand jumping by up to 9%. QNT has soared the most from the larger-cap alts, following a 20% surge.</li>
<li>This has harmed mostly short traders. The total value of liquidated positions stands at over $90 million on a 24-hour scale, while short traders are responsible for more than $70 million (approximately 80%).</li>
<li>Bitcoin and Ethereum have the largest share of the pie, with almost $50 million out of the entire $90 million, <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">according</a> to Coinglass.</li>
</ul>

			            <description><![CDATA[The world’s largest crypto exchange Binance launched a transaction accelerator for Bitcoin miners.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Binance is also preparing a BNB Chain layer-2 scaling solution to improve network transaction speeds and costs.</p>
<p>Separately, the firm announced on June 15 that Binance Pool has launched a “Bitcoin Transaction Accelerator.”</p>
<p>The new solution will allow users to confirm their transactions on the Bitcoin network quicker regardless of any potential network congestion issues, it <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-pool-launches-btc-transaction-accelerator-98c505511bfc489997cf3eb2318c7953" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">noted</a>.</p>
<p>Binance Pool is the exchange’s service platform dedicated to improving the income of BTC miners.</p>
<h2>Binance Teasing a Layer-2</h2>
<p>The Bitcoin network has struggled under demand for block space recently amid the BRC-20 memecoin minting and ordinal inscriptions craze.</p>
<p>In May, regular users suffered from high transaction fees and a backlog of unconfirmed transactions in the Bitcoin mempool.</p>
<p>The new transaction accelerator will only be available for verified Binance Pool users.</p>
<p>Also on June 15, BNB Chain posted a short video teasing a new layer-2 solution. It said the new offering would be “coming soon” on June 19, but no further details were provided.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>— BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN) <a href="https://twitter.com/BNBCHAIN/status/1669253419587227649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">June 15, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Some in the crypto community <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoExpert101/status/1669269753335017475" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">suggested</a> that BNB Chain will <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/polygon-launches-zkevm-scaling-solution-for-web3-adoption/" data-wpel-link="internal">emulate Polygon</a> and launch a zkEVM for layer-2 chains.</p>
<p>A zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine is a fully compatible layer-2 solution that can seamlessly integrate with Ethereum’s smart contract ecosystem.</p>
<p>Binance is currently embroiled in a battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which sued the firm last week for violating securities laws, among other alleged misdemeanors.</p>
<h2>BNB Price Outlook</h2>
<p>The Binance native token BNB has had a roller-coaster ride since the company came under fire from <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-coinbase-and-binance-lawsuits-super-bullish-for-btc-and-eth-opinion/" data-wpel-link="internal">American regulators</a>.</p>
<p>The asset fell to an intraday low of $231 before recovering to trade at $236 at the time of writing. It has lost 22.6% since the SEC <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-ceos-see-wealth-crushed-after-secs-twin-lawsuits/" data-wpel-link="internal">sued the firm</a> on June 6.</p>
<p>BNB is currently down 65.5% from its all-time high of $686 on May 10, 2021. Despite the regulatory war on exchanges, BNB has fared much better than a lot of its brethren. Many of the altcoins, especially those related to DeFi, are down 90% from their peak prices.</p>
<p>Crypto markets, in general, remain flat on the day, with total capitalization at $1.07 trillion at the time of writing.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[There could be some relief for the Korean developer, though, as his lawyers tried to drop charges filed by the US SEC.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The authorities of Montenegro reportedly consider extending Do Kwon&#8217;s custody in the country for another six months before taking an official decision on his possible extradition. The homeland of Terraform Labs&#8217; co-founder &#8211; South Korea &#8211; and the world&#8217;s biggest economy &#8211; the United States of America &#8211; have both requested his deportation.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Montenegrin police arrested the 31-year-old developer in March this year after he was supposedly on the run for several months, changing multiple hiding locations. He faces numerous fraud charges and is accused of having a hand in last year&#8217;s LUNA/UST collapse. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kwon&#8217;s Stay in Europe to Be Extended?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Marija Rakovic &#8211; adviser for public relations of the High Court of Montenegro &#8211; </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.slobodnaevropa.org/a/kralj-kriptovaluta-pritvor-crna-gora/32460870.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">confirmed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to a local media outlet that Kwon received a detention order of half a year. During that period, the magistrates will decide whether to extradite the former crypto tycoon to South Korea. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The authorities of the Asian country have insisted on his deportation, alleging he played a significant role in </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/here-is-what-happened-to-luna-and-why-the-price-can-continue-crashing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">the Terra crash</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> last year that prompted multi-billion dollar losses and undermined the entire digital asset sector. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The USA has also requested Kwon&#8217;s extradition. The US SEC previously asserted that Terraform Labs and its co-founder had orchestrated a massive crypto scam by offering and selling unregistered securities through the use of digital currencies. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">American prosecutors </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/terras-do-kwon-accused-of-running-a-crypto-fraud-by-american-prosecutors-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">pressed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> charges, too, labeling Kwon as the main culprit behind the catastrophe. The officials accused him of committing securities fraud, commodities fraud, as well as conspiracy and demanded a proper punishment.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The legal problems for the South Korean do not stop here. Upon his arrest at the Podgorica airport in March, he was carrying a falsified passport and forged travel documents. A hearing on the matter held in the Basic Court of Podgorica is scheduled for June 16. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition, Kwon will have to answer questions regarding his possible connection with Milojko Spajic &#8211; former Minister of Finance of Montenegro and current leader of the political party Europe Now. The National Security Council disclosed that the individuals had been friends for years, and Kwon financed some of Spajic&#8217;s political campaigns.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Could the US SEC Drop Charges?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The law firm Dentons, which represents Terraform Labs, recently tried to alleviate some of Kwon&#8217;s troubles by eliminating its legal battle with the US SEC. The attorneys filed a motion, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IV7nIPmmdfi3nIPfbS5PtKq0XsVxV6szC4cI7t3PL9Q/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">claiming</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that UST (the algorithmic stablecoin developed by the blockchain firm) is not a security, meaning the regulator should dismiss charges. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The defense, represented by Douglas Henkin, maintained the asset was designed for &#8220;practical purposes and commerce, not as an investment.&#8221; </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;By design &#8230; it&#8217;s pegged one to one to the dollar; it&#8217;s designed not to fluctuate. That&#8217;s for commerce &#8230; that&#8217;s a consumptive use.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The attorney went further, comparing the stablecoin to Bitcoin, suggesting UST was &#8220;controlled by a decentralized group through the LUNA token.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Devon Staren &#8211; a representative of the SEC &#8211; said the agency has been &#8220;simply enforcing existing laws.&#8221; She noted that the analysis of tokens expands beyond them and touches upon the ecosystems they are part of. Staren also gave her two cents on LUNA, claiming it is &#8220;merely a piece of code.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Judge Rakoff&#8217;s decision on whether the motion will be approved or dismissed is expected in mid-July.</span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a letter to employees, Binance said it foresees protracted and expensive litigation with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and asked Binance.US management to reduce the size of its workforce across the division.</p>
<p>The job-cut decision is likely to affect about 50 employees.</p>
<h2>Job Cuts at Binance.US</h2>
<p>A Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-15/binance-us-fires-workers-in-anticipation-of-costly-sec-fight" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a> noted that a number of employees at Binance’s US affiliate have been laid off. While a firm spokesperson confirmed the lay-offs, the exact number of employees affected by the decision was not mentioned.</p>
<p>However, a Reuters report outlined that about 50 staff members have been affected.</p>
<p>Early this month, Binance.US said it was being cut off from the banking and payments partners. On June 9, the crypto exchange serving only American customers <a href="https://twitter.com/WhaleWire/status/1667002820258668545" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">suspended</a> USD deposits and asked users to withdraw their dollar deposits right away, given the SEC’s “extremely aggressive and intimidating tactics.”</p>
<p>More recently, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao dismissed the notion that the company sold BTC and BNB and termed such <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cz-refutes-rumors-claiming-binance-sold-btc-bnb/" data-wpel-link="internal">rumors</a> on social media as FUD. CZ asserted that the firm even holds its “bag of FTT.”</p>
<h2>In a Crosshair With the SEC</h2>
<p>In its June 5 lawsuit, the SEC requested the court to freeze the assets and operations of Binance.US. However, the authorities <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/judge-rejects-secs-request-to-freeze-binance-us-assets-orders-parties-to-compromise/" data-wpel-link="internal">denied</a> the SEC’s motion on June 14 and asked Binance.US and the agency to engage with each other and find a solution.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Shutting it down completely would create significant consequences not only for the company but for the digital asset markets in general. (Work it out) – The nitty-gritty of it is better handled by you than by me,” the court said.</p></blockquote>
<p>These developments signify that the sudden hardening of US regulators’ stance following the collapse of FTX in November 2022 has finally caught up with the industry’s top players. The US SEC filed lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase on June 5 and June 6, respectively.</p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s charges against the duo included functioning as exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing houses without proper licenses. It charged Binance with running two unregistered securities – BNB and BUSD &#8211; and commingling customers&#8217; funds. The SEC argued that Binance and Coinbase allow trading in crypto tokens, which are unregistered securities.</p>
<p>The regulator wants the exchanges and tokens to abide by the guidelines that apply to securities. It means following the rulebook and making sufficient disclosure that help investors mitigate risks and make informed decisions.</p>
