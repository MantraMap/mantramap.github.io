										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="800" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/19165114/bitcoin3.jpeg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="Cryptocurrency News" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p>The world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) has once again come under strong selling pressure and is not finding enough catalysts to move past the $17,000 resistance. A few hours ago, the BTC price tanked to a new low for the month of December at $16,277.</p>
<p>However, it has recovered the dip and is currently trading at $16,740 level. The equity market has been facing <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-market-tanks-6-bitcoin-slips-under-17000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turbulence</a> over the last weekend owing to macro factors and other developments in the crypto space.</p>
<figure id="attachment_132213" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132213" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-132213" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20101100/Bitcoin-December-Low.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="349" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-132213" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy: Bloomberg</figcaption></figure>
<p>Market analysts are expecting further lows in the Bitcoin (BTC) price going ahead and the possibility of another 20% correction from here can&#8217;t be ruled out. Speaking to Bloomberg, Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/bitcoin-falls-to-lowest-this-month-with-risk-of-further-declines-1.1861516" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We expect a retest of the November lows, near $15,600, in the coming weeks” after a failed test of levels in the $17,000 to $18,000 range. “We ultimately expect Bitcoin to make a lower low, increasing risk to long-term support near $13,900&#8243;.</p></blockquote>
<h3>New Lows for Bitcoin and Crypto?</h3>
<p>The year 2022 has witnessed one of the biggest crypto winters in the history of the industry. Bitcoin is down by 75% and a majority of the altcoins are down by nearly 90%. On the other hand, the Fed has made it clear that they would continue with rate hikes throughout the next year of 2023.</p>
<p>If so, there&#8217;s a strong chance of correction in the U.S. equity markets next year. With crypto having a greater correlation with U.S. equities, we can expect a further correction in the crypto market as well. In their latest report, blockchain analytics firm Nansen Research <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://research.nansen.ai/article/489/the-forest-for-the-trees-are-crypto-valuations-and-fundamental-drivers-signaling-the-end-of-this-crypto-winter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Given the Fed&#8217;s determination to maintain tightening for longer, our key scenario for 2023 is a US recession and a US equity sell-off. Crypto prices could experience one further (perhaps final) drop in this cycle before interest rates turn more favorable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also, crypto exchange Bitfinex explains a slowdown in trading activity this holiday season. “As we approach the end of the year many firms and traders take a break, however, the slowdown in trading activity brings with it the risk of higher volatility, given the declines in trading volume and liquidity,” it noted.</p>

This breakdown releases the coin price from its prior sideways trend and encourages the resumption of the prior downfall. Thus, how far a potential decline may lead the BNB prices.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bearish engulfing candle at $252 resistance suggests the high possibility for a downtrend continuation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The downsloping EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200) may offers dynamic resistance to any potential bullish recovery</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the BNB price is $793.8 Million, indicating a 13% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/p/PbIGljhg.png" alt="Binance Coin Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1109" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaos in the crypto market continues due to opaque information on <a href="https://coingape.com/binances-mysterious-trades-worth-22-trillion-found-latest-analysis/">Binance&#8217;s finances</a>. The so-called largest crypto exchange is currently under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department on suspicion of money laundering and violating sanctions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the crypto market has recently been through similar mayhem with the FTX crypto exchange crash, the market participant is on high alert with the ongoing trail on Binance. Moreover, fear among traders has already begun to emerge in the crypto market, particularly for Binance coin(BNB). As a result, the BNB price witnessed aggressive outflow during mid-December, which tumbled its value by 16% within a fortnight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid <a href="https://coingape.com/massive-bnb-selling-amid-binance-fud-where-is-it-heading/">this downfall</a>, the sellers have recently breached multi-month support of $257-$252. Moreover, with the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market, the BNB price managed to retest the $252 mark as potential resistance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 19th, a bearish engulfing candle at the retest phase indicates the sellers are defending the newly flipped resistance. A post-retest fall may tumble the prices 23% down to $190 support. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the in-between level of $215 remains a strong support that could assist buyers in regaining trend control.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, if the retest phase or consolidation just below $252 prolong for a few more trading sessions, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">Binance</a> coin price could jump above the mentioned level and undermine the bearish thesis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI:</strong> this indicator has reverted from the oversold region, indicating that excessive selling in the market has been stabilized. Moreover, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> still wavering in the deeper level of indicators’ nearish territory indicates the market sentiment favors more downfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the increasing gap between EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200) reflects the established downtrend, and selling activity remains high.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance Levels: $257 and $300</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support Levels: $215 and $190</span></li>

The subsidiary in question is a Binance-founded payment tech company called Bifinity.</p>
<h2>Jo Johnson Quits Binance</h2>
<p>The Binance-powered Bifinity, which was established in March of this year, includes Joseph Johnson on its advisory board. He had been in that role since September, but according to a major <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/12/19/boris-johnsons-brother-quits-adviser-binance-amid-crypto-meltdown/" rel="nofollow">media</a> outlet, Johnson resigned last week as a result of growing demands for transparency from Binance.</p>

<p>The 50-year-old member of the House of Lords of the United Kingdom, was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>I stepped down from the advisory board last week and have no role with it [or] any related entity.</p></blockquote>
<p>This development comes at a time when the crypto giant is facing trouble gaining regulatory approval to launch operations in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-kingdom/">United Kingdom</a>.</p>
<h2>Binance&#8217;s Growing Legal Issues</h2>
<p>Earlier, in June of this year, authorities in the UK prohibited the Binance exchange from providing any kind of financial services. As according to the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority, the company in question did not have the appropriate authorization to provide regulated services anywhere within the country&#8217;s borders.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/binance-cz-financially-strong-interview/">“We’re Financially Strong” Says Binance’s CZ: Interview</a></em></p>
<p>Only in November of this year, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">Binance</a> began the process of applying for the appropriate regulatory permits from official authoritative bodies.</p>
<p>Additionally, the company is dealing with a possible indictment by the United States Department of Justice as the government body is considering filing <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-sanctions-more-likely-with-evidence-from-us-money-laundering-probe/">criminal charges against Binance</a> for violating anti-money laundering laws.</p>
<h2>About Binance&#8217;s Bifinity</h2>
<p>According to Binance, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-launches-payments-technology-company-bifinity-421499824684903541" rel="nofollow">Bifinity</a> is a fintech company that connects businesses, merchants and millions of users to the world of crypto and blockchain.</p>

<p>Led by Helen Hai, Bifinity&#8217;s President, the platform currently supports over 50 <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrencies</a> and all major payment methods, including VISA, Mastercard and more.</p>

On December 17th, the memecoin rebounded from the $0.0082 support, triggering a new bull cycle within this range movement. However, the price is struggling to breach the in-between resistance of $0.875, suggesting the ongoing consolidation will prolong for a few more sessions.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>Key points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A daily candle closing above $0.00000875 may drive the coin price 13.6% higher to rechallenge $0.00000966 barrier</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shibu price will need a range breakout to trigger a directional rally </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume of the Shiba Inu coin is $115.2 Million, indicating a 36% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is the Shiba Inu coin price rising?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite a sluggish price action in market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum, the Shiba Inu coin price has risen for three consecutive days. It&#8217;s possible that this steady growth is related to excitement regarding a special countdown mentioned on Shiba Inu&#8217;s official Twitter account,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, this countdown is expected to be the initial step of <a href="https://coingape.com/shiba-inu-developer-confirms-shibarium-beta-launch-shib-and-bone-to-rally/">Shibarium’s Beta launch</a>. This much-awaited layer two blockchain solution getting into action will have a significant impact on the Shiba Inu coin’s market value.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, recently posted a tweet with the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1604612627015127041?s=20&amp;t=3PtEggwY-agO-4pRbEafNg">most-watched cryptocurrencies</a> of 2022. Thus, the Shiba coin made it to the list, encouraging a bullish rally.</span></p>
<h2>Price Analysis</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/x/XpuXeKMT.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish recovery from the $0.0000082 support drove the prices 5.5% higher in the last three days. However, the coin price currently trades at $0.0000085 and shows a power struggle to surpass an in-between resistance of $0.00000875. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the higher price rejection shown in the daily candle indicates a strong possibility for SHIB to revisit the $0.0000082 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for coin holders to escape the current consolidation, the prices must breach either of the range barriers. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the $0.0000082 breakdown will hint at the resumption of a prior downtrend and slump the <a href="https://coingape.com/shiba-inu-coin-news-1-3-trillion-shib-moved-amid-this-binance-update/">Shiba Inu coin</a> 8.5% down to hit $0.0000075.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a daily candle closing above $0.00000966 will bring a sense of recovery and surge the price to $</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">0.0000105.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative strength index:</strong> the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily-RSI slope</a> continues to wobble below the midline, indicating the market sentiment remains negative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the 20-day EMA located near the $0.0000966 increase the resistance power of this barrier.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $0.00000877 and $0.00000966</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels: $0.00000820 and $0.00000755</span></li>

<h2>Crypto Analyst Shares Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Chainlink Prices</h2>
<p>Crypto analyst Rekt Capital in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1604856135697059840" target="_blank" rel="noopener">series of tweets</a> on December 19 shares his price prediction for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Chainlink (LINK).</p>
<p>In the weekly timeframe, Bitcoin has closed below $17,150 (blue), which is a monthly level. Moreover, $17,150 continues to act as the resistance level. In the monthly timeframe, BTC held the $17,150 level in November, but this could become a new resistance this month.</p>
<figure id="attachment_132196" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132196" style="width: 678px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-132196" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/19223855/Bitcoin-BTC-Price.jpg" alt="Bitcoin (BTC) Price" width="678" height="479" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-132196" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin (BTC) Price. Source: Rekt Capital</figcaption></figure>
<p>If Bitcoin continues to reject from $17,150, then the BTC price could fall up to 20% in the upcoming weeks. Bitcoin will move between the $13,900-$17,150 range.</p>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">However, Bitcoin still has time </span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">to perform a Monthly Close above the $17,150 level later this month, just like in November. A Monthly Close below $17,150 would confirm the start of a breakdown to $13,900.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-is-19k-still-possible-or-btc-to-fall-below-15k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Many crypto analysts have predicted</a> that Bitcoin holding its support level is crucial for the altcoins rally. <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Altcoins</a> would drop over 20% if Bitcoin fails to hold the level. The BTC price currently trades at $16,638.</p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) has failed to reclaim the 3-month support of $1,300 in December, with the ETH price currently trading at $1,175. The 3-month support level is acting as a resistance now. If Ethereum closes this month below $1,300, then lower prices can be expected in the New Year.</p>
<p>Cardano (ADA) price has retraced 91% in the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bear market</a>. As there&#8217;s no major support below, more downside can be expected. Currently, the ADA price trades at $0.2605.</p>
<p>Chainlink (LINK) price consolidating within the $6.2-$7.7 range since May 2022. A monthly close below $6.2 confirms a fall below $5 in the New Year.</p>

<h2>SHIB&#8217;s Dismal 2022 Performance</h2>
<p>The pseudonymous crypto trader who goes by the Twitter handle <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CryptoCapo_" rel="nofollow">CryptoCapo</a> has painted a rather gloomy picture for the viral meme <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> which comes second to its predecessor, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/dogecoin/">Dogecoin</a>, in market capitalization.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The year 2022 has been a predominantly dismal one for SHIB, as the token&#8217;s value dropped by more than 70% due to <a href="https://coingape.com/fed-rate-hike-crypto-prices/">rising interest rates</a> and ongoing turmoil in the internal market.</p>

<p>In October of 2021, the price of SHIB skyrocketed to a new all-time high. However, due to the unfavorable macro climate and the instabilities in the domestic market, everything went from bad to worse for SHIB holders from that point onwards.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu&#8217;s Growth Plans</h2>
<p>Despite the poor performance of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/shiba-inu-shib/">SHIB tokens</a> and the extremely pessimistic sentiment prevailing in the crypto community, there have been many significant attempts by the project and its community to drive utility and bolster newer use cases.</p>

The cryptocurrency prices remain stagnant at the lowest levels in several months following the bloodbath the market saw after <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> collapsed. This also led to increased pressure from regulators on the crypto market. Also, traditional financial players in the insurance sector are also shying away from crypto investments related to FTX.</p>

<h2>FTX Contagion Effect Drags On</h2>
<p>In a latest, major insurance companies like Lloyd&#8217;s of London are restricting their coverage to clients who have FTX exposure. This could have a cascading effect on the whole crypto market as there is a long way to go before gaining regulatory clarity on insurance policy for crypto assets. Not just crypto traders, but big firms in the industry like exchanges are being denied insurance coverage to at least part of the funds that are linked to the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sam-bankman-fried/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> company.</p>
<p>According to a latest <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/insurers-shun-ftx-linked-crypto-firms-contagion-risk-mounts-2022-12-19/">Reuters report</a>, several &#8220;insurers are denying or limiting coverage&#8221; to clients with exposure to the bankrupt crypto exchange. This leaves crypto traders and exchanges with the risk of losing insurance cover in the event of cyber hacks, exploits and legal issues.</p>

With an intraday drop of 2.23%, this altcoin has breached another support of $0.35. Thus breakdown offers an additional resistance level on the seller&#8217;s side to limit price recovery.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $0.35 support breakdown sets the XRP price for a 6.2% fall</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coin price will maintain a downward trend until the overhead resistance trendline is intact.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP price is $741.2 Billion, indicating a 111% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/f/fIpDXLcw.png" alt="XRP Price" width="1946" height="1109" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past three weeks, the <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-ripple-lawyer-urges-ftx-venture-investors-to-do-this/">XRP</a> price was steadily falling under the influence of descending trendline. The prices have reverted from this trendline three times, suggesting a selling on rallies motive is driving the market sentiment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with the recent sell-off in the crypto market, the XRP price witnessed significant outflow and accelerated downward spiral. On December 14, the last reversal from the overhead trendline resulted in a 13.7% fall within the last seven days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid this downfall, this <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> has breached multiple support, with the most recent one of $0.35. With a sufficient rise in volume, a long-red candle breakdown from mentioned support indicates the sellers are confident about reaching lower levels.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, with sustained selling, the XRP price may tumble another 6.2% to revisit the $0.32 mark.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, if the buying pressure rises in the crypto market, this holder may experience a bullish pullback to the resistance trendline before resuming the prevailing downfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, the sidelined traders waiting for buying enter should wait for the XRP price to breach the overhead trendline.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative Strength Index:</strong> the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI indicator</a>, which reflects the strength of a price trend, dives deeper into the bearish territory. This downfall accentuates the rising bearish momentum and negative sentiment in the crypto market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the crucial EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200) leaning downwards offer additional selling pressure to XRP price</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">XRP intraday price levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.34</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Low</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.35 and $0.38</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.32 and 0.3 </span></li>

After being detained in Nassau the previous week, Bankman-Fried is scheduled to appear in a court in the Bahamas, where it is anticipated that he would consent to be extradited to the U.S. in order to face allegations of fraud.</p>
<h2>SBF Ready For U.S. Extradition</h2>
<p>The former chief executive officer of the FTX <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a>, has been detained in the Bahamas since last Monday, when he was arrested at the request of U. S. prosecutors in Manhattan.</p>
<p>The officials have accused <a href="https://coingape.com/manhattan-court-finds-ftx-founder-sbf-guilty-to-wire-fraud/">SBF of a variety of crimes, including wire fraud</a>, and have therefore asked for his extradition to the United States.</p>
<h2>SBF&#8217;s Detention In Nassau</h2>
<p>The 30-year-old crypto mogul has been detained at the Fox Hill Prison in Nassau since his arrest and subsequent rejection of bail by a court in the Bahamas.</p>
<p>The institution has been heavily criticized in international assessments for having an inadequate sanitation system and an excessive number of occupants.</p>

<p>Bankman-Fried is also facing civil charges from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sec/">SEC</a>) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which allege that he deceived investors and transferred customer funds that were entrusted to the FTX exchange to his private trading company, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/alameda-research/">Alameda Research</a>.</p>
<h2>Change of Stance If No Bail</h2>
<p>Initially, Bankman-Fried refused to surrender his right to contest extradition to the U.S., but the crypto founder is anticipated to change his mind as soon as Monday if his request to be released on bail is denied, according to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/sam-bankman-fried-prepared-to-be-extradited-to-us-as-soon-as-monday-1.1861276">reports</a>.</p>

Ray III Claims “Embezzlement” Root Cause Of FTX Collapse</a></em></p>
<p>Although, Bankman-Fried has acknowledged risk management failures at <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a>, he has continually denied his involvement in any of the wrongdoings.</p>

<p>Grayscale Bitcoin Trust also as GBTC has widened its discounts rate eventually following the turmoil in the market this year. GBTC, on Friday, was trading at a 49% discounted rate compared to the price of Bitcoin, according to a report. GBTC does its trading as a close-end fund, it offers premium and discounted offers on trading. The annual fees for the fund is 2%.</p>
<p>Michael Sonnenshein, Chief Executive of Grayscale, said in a letter that</p>
<blockquote><p>“These options could include a tender offer for up to 20% of the outstanding shares of the $10.7 billion trust,”</p></blockquote>
<p>as per a report by The Wall Street Journal.</p>

<h2>What does the Grayscale letter aims at?</h2>
<p>The letter from Sonnenshein aims to deal with the worries of GBTC investors following the bankruptcy of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> exchange FTX. The crash of the leadeing exchange had shook the entire cryptoverse. Among those affected by the FTX collapse include Grayscale&#8217;s parent company, Digital Currency Group, and cryptocurrency lender Genesis Global. Genesis halted loan originations and redemptions after it was unable to satisfy client withdrawal requests, and DCG claimed Genesis is owed over $1.7 billion through two loans.</p>
<p>Until now, the Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected spot bitcoin ETF applications. It claims that these products are susceptible to fraud and market manipulation. Only ETFs tracking bitcoin futures were permitted to enter the market by the SEC.</p>
<p>According to Grayscale, making GBTC an ETF would assist its share price trade in line. To make sure that the shares of GBTC reflect the true worth of the bitcoins it has, market players would be able to issue and redeem shares.</p>

Terra Rebels announced reducing the number of inactive team members to increase efficiency.</p>
<p>However, the Terra Classic community is disappointed with the latest decision as it leaves crucial members such as Edward Kim and Zaradar out from the developments. As a result, the LUNC price has now started to fall further.</p>
<h2>Terra Classic Developers Leave Terra Rebels</h2>
<p><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/ZaradarBH/status/1604777833007562752">Tobias Anderson</a> or Zaradar in a tweet on December 19 announced leaving the Terra Rebels group due to disagreements with the recent governance discussions on funding.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I have renounced my position in Terra Rebels due to an inability to align with the most recent governance discussions on funding. As a result, I have been removed from GitHub and can no longer service PRs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Validator <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/LUNCDAO/status/1604785651097825282" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LUNC DAO</a> responded to the reduction in Terra Rebels members and shared concerns over not retaining key contributors Edward Kim and Zaradar. LUNC DAO believes Terra Rebels are not eligible for <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-proposal-separating-terra-classic-tfl-do-kwon-passes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$150,000 provided from the community pool</a> without key contributors in the group.</p>
<p>Another developer Duncan claimed he left the Terra Rebels because of shifting to a corporate structure. Despite 25-65 people in the group and &#8220;internal governance doesn&#8217;t have a quorum and passed with 7 yes votes.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to ClassyCrypto, the Terra Rebels is now reducing to just 12 members. These include Raider70, ReXx, Vegas, ClanMudhorn, EchelOn, and others. Terra Rebels will pay these 12 &#8220;active&#8221; members and the rest &#8220;inactive&#8221; members will be paid a stipend for their contributions and contracted based on the project.</p>
<h2>LUNC Price Continues To Fall</h2>
<p>The Terra Classic community is disappointed by the decision of Terra Rebels. As a result, the Terra Classic (LUNC) price has tumbled 3% in the last 24 hours and 17% in a week. The LUNC price is currently trading at $0.0001381, the lowest recorded in recent times.</p>
<p>Some believe this could be the end of LUNC as it&#8217;s unclear if Edward Kim and Zaradar will work on the Terra Classic developments. Meanwhile, others criticize <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-terra-rebels-transfers-terra-station-support-to-terracvita/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terra Rebels for not going with the v23 upgrade</a> and switching focus to Rebel Station.</p>

However, details regarding these have mostly been concealed from the general public.</p>
<h2>Concerns Over Binance Grows</h2>
<p>Binance, which is touted as the largest <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">cryptocurrency exchange</a> in the world, seems to be facing a crisis of trust as a result of the sharp decline in the value of its native token, BNB, and an uptick in the number of user withdrawals.</p>
<p>Although, the exchange claimed that due to its strong financial position they have been able to manage net outflows of $6 billion over 72 hours last week without &#8220;breaking stride.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a title="Massive BNB Selling Amid Binance FUD, Where Is It Heading?" href="https://coingape.com/massive-bnb-selling-amid-binance-fud-where-is-it-heading/" rel="bookmark">Massive BNB Selling Amid Binance FUD, Where Is It Heading?</a></em></p>
<p>However, along with the publicly hidden information regarding its $22 Trillion trades occurring this year, Binance refuses to disclose its location of work or that of Binance.com, as per Reuters. It also withholds basic financial data including revenue, profit, and cash on hand.</p>
<h2>More Gaping Holes Found</h2>
<p>The crypto firm also remains tight-lipped about its <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/binance-bnb-coin/">BNB token</a> and what impact it has on the exchange&#8217;s balance sheet.</p>
<p>According to Binance, customers are able to borrow money to trade on margin and obtain loans backed by their crypto assets. But, as per the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/binances-books-are-black-box-filings-show-crypto-giant-tries-rally-confidence-2022-12-19/?rpc=401&amp;" rel="nofollow">analysis</a>, the quantity of those bets, the degree to which Binance is exposed to that risk, or the amount of money the company has set aside in reserves to cover withdrawals are not discussed in detail.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a title="“We’re Financially Strong” Says Binance’s CZ: Interview" href="https://coingape.com/binance-cz-financially-strong-interview/" rel="bookmark">“We’re Financially Strong” Says Binance’s CZ: Interview</a></em></p>
<p>Commenting on the numerous jurisdictions where Binance operates, John Reed Stark, a former chief of the U.S. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sec/">SEC&#8217;s</a> Office of Internet Enforcement states that,</p>
<blockquote><p>They are co-opting the nomenclature of regulation to create a veneer of legitimacy. There is absolutely no transparency, no sunlight, no confirmation of any kind about its financial position.</p></blockquote>
<p>He further claims that,  Binance&#8217;s operations are more shrouded in mystery than <a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-illegally-moved-millions-during-bankruptcy/">FTX&#8217;s business dealings</a>.</p>
<h2>Binance Facing Legal Issues</h2>
<p>Since Binance accounts for more than half of all trading volume in the cryptocurrency market, U.S. officials are particularly interested in how it does business.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-prosecutors-split-over-charging-binance-cz-report/">Prosecutors Split Over Charging Binance &amp; CZ</a></em></p>
<p>According to Reuters, some prosecutors think they have enough evidence to indict Binance and its certain top executives.</p>
<p>The business is under investigation by the <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-sanctions-more-likely-with-evidence-from-us-money-laundering-probe/">U.S. Justice Department for potential money laundering</a> and violating sanctions.</p>

The top crypto exchange is going through a rough patch with the trader community demanding that it provide greater transparency on its reserves. The criticism comes after FTX, which was once a market leader, collapsed and eventually filed for bankruptcy in November 2022.</p>

<h2>To Unlock Customer Funds</h2>
<p>On Monday, beleaguered crypto lender Voyager Digital announced it sold its assets to <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">Binance</a> after the exchange placed the highest bid. The purchase helps and intensifies Voyager in its efforts to unlock customer funds. The asset deal is valued at $1.022 billion, the company said in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/voyager-announces-agreement-for-binanceus-to-acquire-its-assets-301706065.html" rel="nofollow">statement</a>. However, the crypto lender faces legal obligations around disbursement of the customer funds. The process of returning assets will be done in accordance with court-approved disbursements and platform capabilities, it said.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Voyager Digital selected U.S. exchange Binance.US as the highest and best bid for its assets after a review of strategic options with the core objective of maximizing the value returned to customers and other creditors on an expedited timeframe.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The recent buzz about <a href="https://coingape.com/binances-exchange-balances-vs-proof-of-reserves-a-complete-report/">Binance reserves</a> and the need for full transparency led to a fall in the Binance (BNB) coin price. In the space of one week, the top 5 ranked cryptocurrency lost around 15% in value. As of writing, the BNB price stands at $248, up 0.98% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/">CoinMarketCap</a>. The FUD around the crypto exchange&#8217;s asset stability only worsened after auditing firm <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-binance-auditor-mazars-suspends-services-for-crypto-firms/">Mazars suspending its services</a> for Binance.</p>
<p>The firm said it was discontinuing auditing services for many crypto exchanges including Binance, KuCoin and Crypto.com.</p>

However, the reduced size of daily candlesticks and low volume indicates uncertainty in the <a href="https://coingape.com/cryptocurrency-news-nigeria-to-pass-bill-on-legalizing-cryptos-bitcoins/">crypto market</a>. This lateral walk has limited growth in several altcoins keeping a stagnant market sentiment. As a result, the global crypto market </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cap </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">shows an insignificant rise of 0.01% in the last 24hr and reached the $809.29 Billion mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top Gainers and Losers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-132175" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/19190504/Screenshot_20221219_190441.png" alt="Heat map of cryptocurrency prices" width="1200" height="675" />Source- Coin360 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the ongoing volatility in the crypto market, the sense of negativity in altcoin persists. Having said that, XDC Network and ImmutableX tokens show the highest gain among the top 100 list. Thus, in the last 24 hours, the XDC price is 5.5% up and currently trades at $0.02509, whereas IMX jumps to $0.434, registering a 3.17% rise. Conversely, Chiliz and Toncoin are top losers, where CHZ at $0.1159 shows a 7.69% loss and TON price at $2.60 displays a 4.95% fall.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Price </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-132177" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/19190746/Screenshot_20221219_190253.png" alt="BTC" width="1200" height="370" />Source- Coinmarketcap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 16th, the <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-will-btc-continue-its-downfall-for-the-coming-week/">Bitcoin price</a> gave a high momentum breakdown from the support trendline of an inverted flag pattern. In theory, this pattern breakdown indicates the replenished bearish momentum and encourages a deeper correction in BTC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By press time, the coin price trades at $16731 with an insignificant intraday loss of 0.04%. Furthermore, the daily chart showcased three short body candles, indicating indecisiveness among market participants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/lOWY7kVW.png" alt="Bitcoin Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1109" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if the Bitcoin price shows sustainability below the $16700 level or the 4% higher trendline, the ongoing downfall may resume and tumble the coin 7% down to $15550.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, if the BTC price rises above the trendline, the bearish thesis will get invalidated. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum price </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-132178" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/19190856/Screenshot_20221219_190326.png" alt="ETH" width="1200" height="373" />Source- Coinmarketcap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to bitcoin, the <a href="https://coingape.com/ethereum-price-prediction-why-eth-price-may-drop-another-9/">Ethereum price</a> followed also followed a bearish continuation pattern called a rising wedge. The recent downfall in the crypto market offered a massive breakdown from the pattern’s support trendline and local support of $1220. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the prices plunged to the $1160 support and started walking a lateral path. However, If the market witnessed a certain buying pressure, a 4.5% rise in ETH will retest the $1220 mark as potential resistance.</span></p>
