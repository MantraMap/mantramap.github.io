<p>Gambling has been a popular way to pass the time for many centuries, and it is no different today. However, thanks to the advent and subsequent implementation of innovative technologies like cryptocurrencies, &lsquo;Bitcoin gambling&rsquo; has become exceedingly popular to the point that since 2014, players have actually wagered over $4.5 billion in Bitcoin to date.

<p>Why does this matter?</p>

Furthermore, the casino market is predicted to grow in the coming years. To that end, the revenue of brick-and-mortar casinos in the United States is expected to increase year on year from 2021 to 2024 and experts view this is a key indicator of the projected growth for the casino market.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that although online casinos are becoming more popular on a global scale, it will surely take some time before they become as popular in the United States, given that many states in the country have yet to legalize online casinos and a sizable portion tend to operate without a license.</p>

<p>Where does crypto fit into all this?</p>
<p>Crypto gambling is leading the way in the online gambling industry. Of course, Bitcoin can be used for other purposes like buying NFTs, cars, real estate, and even insurance. Still, the majority of Bitcoin transactions take place in crypto casinos. The most recent Bitcoin gambling statistics therefore indicate that interest in crypto gambling is growing as players continue to prefer cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin over traditional fiat currencies.</p>

These games enhance the transparency of crypto casinos which is in stark contrast to traditional casino games, as a provably fair game enables users to verify the outcome of each hand or round played. As a result, provably fair games are frequently preferred among crypto gamblers who value safety and transparency.</p>
<p>Also, casino operators can use blockchain technology to access features that are not available in traditional casinos.
