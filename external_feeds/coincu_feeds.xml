<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Many crypto users discovered that the Multichain cross-chain bridge was transferring large amounts of crypto to the outside world for unknown reasons.</em></li>



<li><em>The incident affects about $130 million in assets on Fantom, Moonriver, and Dogechain chains.</em></li>



<li><em>Multichain has yet to release any information about the above transfers and asked users to stop using the service in conjunction with revoking approvals.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nearly $130 million worth of tokens were withdrawn from the Multichain bridge on the Fantom network, and security firms speculated that this could be a security flaw.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-452.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-452-1024x576.png" alt="Multichain Bridge Trouble Again, $130M Assets Withdrawn For Unknown Cause" class="wp-image-200811" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-452-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-452-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-452-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-452-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-452-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-452.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Multichain Bridge Trouble Again, $130M Assets Withdrawn For Unknown Cause 1"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The tokens transferred include $58 million USDC stablecoin, 1020 WBTC (approximately $30.9 million), 7,200 WETH (approximately $13.7 million), and $4 million DAI stablecoin (valued at around $30.9 million) of the above 4 tokens over $100 million), also includes other tokens such as Chainlink, Curve DAO, YFI, Wootrade Network and almost a quarter of UniDex&#8217;s total supply.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi <a href="https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@MultichainOrg</a> you may want to take a look:  <a href="https://t.co/D4GKGpuBtw" target="_blank">https://t.co/D4GKGpuBtw</a> <a href="https://t.co/3qURqGmes8" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/3qURqGmes8</a></p>&mdash; PeckShield Inc.

</div></figure>



<p>Assets also appear to be moving on Multichain&#8217;s Moonriver bridge, including 4.8 million USDC and 1 million USDT. Dogechain also experienced unusual fund flow. At least 660,000 USDC was sent to the same wallet as Moonriver&#8217;s fund flow.</p>



<p>Security firm Paidun questions whether this could be related to the addition of support for four tokens (USDC, USDT, WETH, and WBTC) on the LayerZero cross-chain platform, which overlaps but is only partially consistent with the tokens being migrated.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-453.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-453-1024x512.png" alt="Multichain Bridge Trouble Again, $130M Assets Withdrawn For Unknown Cause" class="wp-image-200813" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-453-1024x512.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-453-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-453-768x384.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-453-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-453-750x375.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-453-1140x570.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-453.png 1448w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Multichain Bridge Trouble Again, $130M Assets Withdrawn For Unknown Cause 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>LayerZero CEO Bryan Pellegrino responded that the issue had nothing to do with the platform and believed it was a hack targeting Multichain. According to Pellegrino, users of the Multichain bridge can withdraw assets, bringing them to LayerZero.</p>



<p>However, Igor Igamberdiev, research director at Wintermute, says that this is likely the job of whoever controls Multichain, as Fantom funds are not destroyed when the transaction occurs. Igamberdiev also noted that oddly enough, the wallet that received the bulk of USDC also made a transaction from the old Binance Smart Chain bridge a few hours earlier.</p>



<p>Earlier today, Bridge Protocol announced that locked assets had been moved irregularly, and users were advised to suspend the use of Multichain services in conjunction with the <a href="https://t.co/fUNafBC0UA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revocation</a> of all approvals chain-related contracts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The lockup assets on the Multichain MPC address have been moved to an unknown address abnormally. <br>The team is not sure what happened and is currently investigating. <br><br>It is recommended that all users suspend the use of Multichain services and revoke all contract approvals…</p>&mdash; Multichain (Previously Anyswap) (@MultichainOrg) <a href="https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1677096839731097600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 6, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The incident caused great disappointment to the community because the operation of Multichain resumed not long after the incident at the end of May 2023. This project once caused a stir with the news that the CEO <a href="https://coincu.com/191300-multichain-lost-contact-with-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was arrested </a>by the Chinese police and lost access to the bridges, causing all activities to be stopped.</p>

<p>CZ said that Binance is always working to protect its employees.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;As markets and the global environment for crypto changes, as our organization evolves, and as personal situations change, there is turnover at every company. We thank all of our ex-team members for their contributions to our growth, and wish them all the best.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>CZ also confirmed that it will continue to grow and continue to recruit.</p>



<p>Earlier today, Fortune magazine <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/07/06/binance-crisis-executives-quit-changpeng-zhao-justice-department/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cited </a>three Binance executives who resigned this week as Binance General Counsel Han Ng, Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann, and Senior Vice President of Compliance. Prime Minister Steven Christie.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-451.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="929" height="523" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-451.png" alt="CZ Responds To Reports Of 3 Binance Senior Executives Resigning" class="wp-image-200798" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-451.png 929w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-451-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-451-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-451-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px" title="CZ Responds To Reports Of 3 Binance Senior Executives Resigning 4"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Reportedly, their departure is related to the reaction of Binance founder Zhao Changpeng to the ongoing investigation by the US Department of Justice. Hillmann later confirmed his departure on Twitter and said he would &#8220;continue to respect and support&#8221; Changpeng Zhao. According to previous news, Matthew Price, Binance&#8217;s senior director of investigations, recently resigned.</p>



<p>Binance has been under strain for months amid regulatory investigations that have severed many of its key banking relationships globally.</p>



<p>Despite the difficulties, Binance and Coinbase staged a counter-attack by protesting the charges from the SEC and asserting their compliance with US laws. This is a bright spot, helping exchanges focus on restoring user confidence and proving their credibility.</p>



<p>The common point of Binance FUD times is that user assets are massively withdrawn from Binance and other centralized exchanges. Causing the trading volume on CEXs to drop sharply. However, the quick and timely responses of the CEO of Binance can be said to be always quick to stabilize the psychology of users.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Top executives resign from Binance amid regulatory investigations.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange faces multiple regulatory challenges globally.</em></li>



<li><em>Operations and market share of the exchange are affected by the investigations.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/07/06/binance-crisis-executives-quit-changpeng-zhao-justice-department/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortune</a></em>, Binance, the renowned cryptocurrency exchange, finds itself in a state of turmoil as key executives step down following CEO Changpeng Zhao&#8217;s handling of the ongoing regulatory investigations.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-449-1024x589.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="589" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-449-1024x589.png" alt="Binance In Crisis When Executives Flee Regulatory Storms" class="wp-image-200792" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-449-1024x589.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-449-300x173.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-449-768x442.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-449-750x431.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-449-1140x656.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-449.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance In Crisis When Executives Flee Regulatory Storms 5"></a></figure></div>


<p>The departures of senior figures, including the general counsel, chief strategy officer, and compliance SVP, signify a critical management and strategic crisis for <a href="https://coincu.com/200606-binance-unleashes-wallet-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a>, intensifying the pressure as these units are directly engaged with regulatory matters.</p>



<p>The resignation of top executives is expected to complicate Binance&#8217;s defense efforts as it faces multiple investigations from regulators worldwide. Notably, the United States Department of Justice has been conducting a probe into alleged attempts by the exchange to deceive regulators, as well as potential money laundering and sanctions violations on its platform.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true that I am leaving Binance,&#8221; Hillmann <a href="https://twitter.com/PRHillmann/status/1677070523740884992" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>, adding that he was departing on good terms and continuing to respect and support Zhao.</p>

<p>The regulatory challenges have already taken a toll on the exchange&#8217;s operations. The exchange&#8217;s U.S. business and international trading arm have been significantly impacted, with U.S. regulators suspecting a deep interconnection between the two. The loss of a major European banking partner and the decision to halt trading in U.S. dollars by Binance.US further illustrate the consequences of these investigations.</p>

<p>Despite being the largest cryptocurrency exchange globally, Binance has experienced a decline in market share recently. This decline is attributed to the mounting regulatory pressures and the severing of banking relationships, restricting the exchange&#8217;s access to fiat currencies.</p>



<p>While there have been speculations about potential succession plans and CZ stepping aside to help Binance navigate the storm, CEO Changpeng Zhao has not shown any intention of relinquishing his position. As a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency industry, his decisions and leadership will play a crucial role in shaping the future of the exchange.</p>



<p>As the situation continues to unfold, it is important to remain updated on the latest developments. Binance&#8217;s response and official statements should be monitored to understand the ongoing impact of these regulatory challenges on the cryptocurrency exchange industry as a whole.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Georgian Co-Investment Fund founder George Bachiashvili was charged with cryptocurrency misappropriation and money laundering.</em></li>



<li><em>Allegations claim he obtained a substantial amount of Bitcoin through mining in 2015 using raised funds.</em></li>



<li><em>Bachiashvili could face nine to twelve years in prison; the fund denies involvement.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>George Bachiashvili, the founder of the prominent Georgian Co-Investment Fund, is facing serious charges of cryptocurrency misappropriation and money laundering, as reported by Georgian news outlet <em><a href="https://agenda.ge/en/news/2023/2656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Agenda</a></em>.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-445.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="976" height="661" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-445.png" alt="Founder Of Georgian Co-Investment Fund Charged In Cryptocurrency Scandal" class="wp-image-200781" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-445.png 976w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-445-300x203.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-445-768x520.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-445-750x508.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px" title="Founder Of Georgian Co-Investment Fund Charged In Cryptocurrency Scandal 8"></a></figure></div>


<p>The Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of Georgia alleges that Bachiashvili, who played a key role in managing the $6 billion private equity fund contributing significantly to the nation&#8217;s GDP, unlawfully obtained a substantial amount of cryptocurrency, particularly <a href="https://coincu.com/200621-bitcoin-waiting-for-the-next-bull-run-at-35500/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a>, dating back to 2015.</p>



<p>Investigation findings reveal that Bachiashvili utilized funds personally raised by himself and an undisclosed investor to invest in Bitcoin mining. A foreign firm was contracted for mining services, with the total agreement valued at $6.3 million, with the investor contributing $5 million to the venture.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-447.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="929" height="523" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-447.png" alt="Founder Of Georgian Co-Investment Fund Charged In Cryptocurrency Scandal" class="wp-image-200783" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-447.png 929w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-447-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-447-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-447-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px" title="Founder Of Georgian Co-Investment Fund Charged In Cryptocurrency Scandal 9"></a></figure></div>


<p>The Prosecutor&#8217;s Office claims that Bachiashvili later seized the generated profit of 8,253.13 Bitcoins in 2017, amounting to over $39 million. Only a meager $536,900 was reportedly paid to the investor. Bachiashvili allegedly concealed the details of the misappropriated funds, transferring them to various wallets for undisclosed financial operations, enabling him to freely manage and utilize the illegal proceeds. He is a significant person in Georgia, having formed a private equity business that accounts for around 40% of Georgia&#8217;s GDP.</p>



<p>If found guilty, Bachiashvili could face a prison sentence ranging from nine to twelve years. In response to the charges, the Georgian Co-Investment Fund released a statement clarifying that the organization was not involved in the alleged actions. They further emphasized that Bachiashvili had not served as a director for several years, highlighting a distinction between his individual actions and the activities of the fund.</p>

<p>LayerZero Labs has announced the introduction of four new tokens &#8211; USDC, USDT, WETH, and WBTC &#8211; built on top of LayerZero, to the Fantom network. With support from the Fantom Foundation and a majority of the ecosystem, these tokens are expected to account for over 50% of the TVL on Fantom. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>The adoption of these assets on Fantom will bring much-needed stability and longevity for projects utilizing them as liquidity, collateral, stores of value, and more. LayerZero-powered assets are already widely used as canonical assets across a number of ecosystems, and the introduction of these assets will ensure that the Fantom ecosystem can continue to grow with the trust of its users. The new tokens will be able to be bridged between Fantom and Ethereum via <a href="https://twitter.com/LayerZero_Labs/status/1676989317858889728" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/LayerZero_Labs/status/1676989317858889728" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stargate Finance</a>. </p>



<p>This announcement comes ahead of Fantom&#8217;s next two major milestones, Carmen and Tosca. With over a dozen of the most recognizable teams building on Fantom, the platform is poised for further growth and adoption in the coming months.</p>



<p>Coincu previously <a href="https://coincu.com/200064-layerzero-ceo-twitter-account-hacked/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/200064-layerzero-ceo-twitter-account-hacked/" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported </a>that LayerZero has officially acknowledged that the CEO&#8217;s Twitter account (@PrimordialAA) has been compromised. As a precautionary measure, users have been warned against clicking on any suspicious links or engaging in questionable activities.</p>



<p>Last month, the Uniswap Foundation <a href="https://coincu.com/195595-uniswap-cross-chain-bridge-assessment/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/195595-uniswap-cross-chain-bridge-assessment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared </a>an assessment report on cross-chain bridges, providing insights into the analysis of various protocols. According to the report, LayerZero did not fully meet all the requirements at the time of evaluation. However, the foundation noted that LayerZero is actively working towards fulfilling these requirements through a planned upgrade to its Oracle and relayer set. The Committee strongly urges the LayerZero team to implement this upgrade swiftly and recommends conducting a reassessment after the new configuration has been operational for at least three months.</p>

<p>Sources familiar with the matter have disclosed with <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/06/taylor-swift-agreed-to-ftx-partnership-despite-contrary-public-claims-source.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC</a></em> that the popstar had agreed to a collaboration, only for it to be thwarted by former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who is currently embroiled in legal troubles.</p>



<p>Contradicting earlier statements made by a class-action attorney, it appears that Swift did, in fact, entertain the idea of a partnership. The signed agreement was allegedly sent to Bankman-Fried&#8217;s email inbox, where it languished unanswered for several weeks. Eventually, a group of FTX executives reportedly convinced Bankman-Fried to abandon the proposed $100 million deal, painting a markedly different picture from the narrative surrounding Swift&#8217;s supposed withdrawal.</p>

<p>The nature of the agreement, which was initially reported by <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/technology/tom-brady-crypto-ftx.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a></em>, challenges the public messaging surrounding the failed FTX-Swift deal. Previously, a high-profile attorney had praised Swift&#8217;s due diligence efforts and claimed that she rejected the deal after questioning <a href="https://coincu.com/199738-ftx-announces-to-launch-customer-claims-portal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a> about the status of its listed assets as unregistered securities. However, multiple sources, speaking anonymously due to ongoing legal proceedings, revealed that Swift&#8217;s team signed the deal after six months of negotiations, with <a href="https://coincu.com/198247-bankman-fried-pretrial-motions-denied/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bankman-Fried</a> ultimately halting its progression.</p>

<p>FTX&#8217;s subsequent filing for bankruptcy in November added further complications to the unfolding narrative. Bankman-Fried now faces criminal charges related to alleged fraud and money laundering, while three other FTX executives have pleaded guilty to federal charges and are cooperating with the government&#8217;s prosecution.</p>



<p>The existence of an FTX-Swift partnership was first reported by <em>The Financial Times</em>, introducing an intriguing twist to an already convoluted situation. As the story develops, more information is likely to emerge, shedding light on the true extent of Taylor Swift&#8217;s involvement with FTX and the reasons behind its ultimate collapse.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>NFT Inspect, a popular non-fungible token (NFT) analysis and community tool, has partnered with Web3 infrastructure company MoonPay to enable users on Twitter to purchase NFTs and cryptocurrencies through its Chrome browser extension, as per <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/web3/2023/07/06/you-can-now-buy-nfts-on-twitter-through-inspects-browser-extension/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=rss&amp;utm_campaign=headlines" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.coindesk.com/web3/2023/07/06/you-can-now-buy-nfts-on-twitter-through-inspects-browser-extension/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=rss&amp;utm_campaign=headlines" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinDesk</a>. </strong></h5>

<p>The partnership will allow NFT Inspect users to purchase a range of cryptocurrencies using MoonPay&#8217;s payment infrastructure to then buy NFTs. MoonPay supports payment methods such as debit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or various local bank transfer options. The collaboration is in line with their shared vision of fostering widespread crypto adoption and creating a borderless digital payments ecosystem where everyone can participate, regardless of experience level.</p>



<p>Last month, Inspect released a new Chrome browser extension that provides real-time data on popular NFT collections commonly used as Twitter profile pictures (PFPs). The Twitter NFT Search tool, which is also available in beta as a web version, allows users to search for different ways an NFT is used on Twitter and analyzes blockchain data about the collection.</p>

<p>NFT Inspect was resurrected under new ownership in March after announcing its reluctant shutdown in January. Post-acquisition, it has continued to build out its suite of tools to help NFT traders monitor market trends and recently partnered with Polygon Labs to drive adoption.</p>



<p>The new partnership between NFT Inspect and MoonPay is a significant step towards making NFTs and cryptocurrencies more accessible to the general public. The ability to purchase NFTs and cryptocurrencies on Twitter will make it easier for users to engage with the growing NFT market and benefit from the potential financial gains. With the support of MoonPay&#8217;s payment infrastructure, users can now purchase NFTs and cryptocurrencies without the need for extensive knowledge of crypto wallets or complex payment methods.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crypto exchange Bitfinex <a href="https://twitter.com/bitfinex/status/1676967823065878532" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that it collaborated with authorities to recover around $315,000 in cash and cryptocurrencies stolen in a 2016 hack on its website.</strong></h5>

<p>The assets came from the US Department of Homeland Security, which was essential in capturing the stolen digital assets and prosecuting the perpetrators, Bitfinex stated in a statement on Thursday. Around 120,000 Bitcoins, worth approximately $72 million at the time, were taken. The haul is worth around $3.7 billion at the current market price.</p>



<p>The digital asset trading platform Bitfinex reported the restitution of $312,219.71 in cash and 6.917 Bitcoin Cash (BCH) from the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as part of continuing efforts to recover assets taken during the 2016 security incident. The recovery value at today&#8217;s Bitcoin Cash pricing is $314,196.</p>

<p>Heather &#8220;Razzlekhan&#8221; Morgan and Ilya &#8220;Dutch&#8221; Lichtenstein, a couple detained last year for allegedly laundering billions of dollars in Bitcoin from the robbery, are among individuals previously accused of keeping cash from the attack. The seizure was carried out by US Customs and Border Protection, a law enforcement department inside the Department of Homeland Security.</p>

<p>Bitfinex&#8217;s Chief Technical Officer, Paolo Ardoino, acknowledged the company&#8217;s happiness with this recovery milestone and thanked for law enforcement authorities&#8217; efforts.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“This specific seizure demonstrates the commitment of law enforcement officials to diligently track all the proceeds of the crime committed against Bitfinex almost seven years ago,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The fund will be given to holders of Bitfinex&#8217;s Recovery Right Tokens, which are digital tokens given to individuals who lost money in the breach. Since there are around 30 million RRTs in circulation, each investment will most likely get just a tiny portion of the recovery. RRT holders will have their tokens redeemed pro rata today, July 6, 2023, at 12:00.01 AM UTC, depending on the amount of their RRT holdings. Bitfinex is continuing to work actively with law enforcement and legal institutions to retrieve the stolen assets.</p>

<p>The proposal, unveiled on July 6, aims to enable users to actively participate in protocol governance while ensuring adequate liquidity for decentralized exchanges. By implementing the 8020 Initiative, Balancer offers a unique solution to the liquidity issue faced by DeFi platforms. The structure allows token holders to engage in governance activities while simultaneously providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges. This approach ensures that the locked governance tokens do not hinder the availability of liquidity within the ecosystem.</p>



<p>Several prominent protocols have already joined the 8020 Initiative, including Radiant, Aave, Alchemix, Y2K Finance, OATH Finance, Paraswap, and Timeless Finance. The collaboration of these projects further strengthens the ecosystem by pooling resources and expertise to enhance liquidity provisions across DeFi platforms.</p>

<p>The rewards are aimed at those who can create alternatives to the Reddit chain on DeSo&#8217;s platform. This initiative comes as a response to Reddit&#8217;s recent decision to restrict API access, leading to discontent within the community due to limited access to content.</p>



<p>DeSo believes that building a decentralized version of Reddit on its blockchain will grant users complete control over their content, free from censorship or the risk of being banned at the protocol level. By leveraging the capabilities of blockchain technology, the firm aims to empower users with greater freedom and ownership over their social media experiences.</p>



<p>The announcement of the bounty program comes on the heels of the platform successful financing round in 2021, which secured a substantial $200 million in funding. Prominent investors, including a16z and Sequoia Capital, participated in the financing, highlighting the growing interest and support for DeSo&#8217;s innovative blockchain-based social platform.</p>
