<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/johnson-johnson-q2-2023-earnings/">Johnson &#038; Johnson Reports Better than Expected Q2 2023 Earnings, JNJ Shares Up Slightly</a></p>
<p>One of the oldest American pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods companies, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/johnson-and-johnson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson &amp; Johnson</a> (NYSE: JNJ) announced its second quarter (Q2) 2023 earnings on July 20, which ostensibly beat Wall Street expectations. According to the company’s announcement, the second quarter sales grew by about 6.3 percent and the operational growth excluding the COVID-19 vaccine jumped by 8.9 percent. Meanwhile, the company’s Joaquin Duato, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer highlighted that the future is bright for its vast products, especially as it moves ahead to split its shares.</p>
<p>“We are entering the back half of the year from a position of strength with numerous catalysts, including becoming a two-sector company focused on Pharmaceutical and MedTech innovation,” Duato <a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-reports-q2-2023-results" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>.</p>
<h2>Johnson &amp; Johnson Q2 2023 Financial Highlights</h2>
<p>During the second quarter of 2023, the company announced adjusted earnings per share of $2.80 compared to $2.62 expected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. Additionally, Johnson &amp; Johnson announced revenue of about $25.53 billion compared to the $24.62 billion expected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. Splitting the sales, the company announced that it collected about $13.44 billion from the United States market and the remaining $22 billion from the international market.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical segment reported the highest sales with about $13.71 billion, followed by MedTech with a total sales of about $7.78 billion, and the remaining accrued from the consumer health segment. Although the company is facing several headwinds including some legal proceedings, it highlighted that the coming quarters could as well be profitable as the prior one.</p>
<p>As a result, the company announced that it will be increasing its 2023 full-year guidance midpoints for adjusted operational sales excluding the COVID-19 vaccine and the adjusted operating earnings per share. Notably, the company is forecasting its full-year sales to come in between $98.80 billion to $99.80 billion, which is about $1 billion higher than the guidance issued in April. Additionally, the company’s full-year earnings outlook is expected to come in between $10.70 to $10.80 per share, which is higher than the prior one issued in April between $10.60 to $10.70 per share.</p>
<p>Amid the legal litigations most centered on allegations that its pharmaceutical products are causing cancer to its users, the company has focused on splitting its pharma segment and MedTech segment for future growth prospects.</p>
<h2>Market Outlook</h2>
<p>The $413 billion valued company has been on the receiving end in the past two years. According to the latest stock market data, JNJ shares have dropped approximately 7.3 percent and 10 percent in the last year and YTD respectively. Nonetheless, 21 analysts are still optimistic about the company’s future performance having given the JNJ market an average rating of Over.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/american-airlines-outlook-2023/">American Airlines Raises Earnings Outlook for 2023 as Travel Demand Soars</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/american-airlines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Airlines Inc</a> (NASDAQ: AAL), one of the largest airlines around the world has announced an upward revision of its earnings outlook for 2023. The news comes on the heels of a robust start to the peak travel season, reaffirming the carrier&#8217;s resilience in the face of unprecedented challenges within the airline industry.</p>
<p>The airline revealed according to a CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/20/american-airlines-aal-2q-2023-earnings.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> that it now expects to earn between $3 and $3.75 per share for the full year, after adjusting for one-time items. This represents a notable increase from their previous prediction made in May, which anticipated earnings of approximately $2.50 to $3.50 per share.</p>
<h2>Impact of the Pandemic</h2>
<p>The airline industry is experiencing a <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/american-airlines-stock-rises-41-as-covid-19-crisis-is-backing-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notable rebound</a> as travel demand increases, particularly for international travel. Airline executives have expressed optimism about the recovery, buoyed by the easing of travel restrictions, higher vaccination rates, and a growing desire among people to travel again after a prolonged period of restricted movement due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>One noticeable impact of the current scenario is the decline in airfares compared to the previous year. As demand outpaces supply, airlines have been able to offer more competitive pricing and a broader range of flight choices to passengers.</p>
<p>American Airlines said it is closely monitoring its unit revenues, which are expected to drop by up to 6.5% in the third quarter of the current year compared to the same period in 2022. Despite the expected decline in unit revenues, American Airlines is planning to expand its capacity for Q3, with growth projections of up to 7% compared to the same period in 2022.</p>
<p>In terms of earnings, American Airlines has forecasted adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) range of 85 cents to 95 cents for the third quarter, which aligns with estimates from financial analysts. The announcement comes with an acknowledgment of ongoing labor negotiations, particularly with its pilots’ union. The company’s forecasts include costs associated with labor deals, including a tentative agreement reached with its pilots.</p>
<h2>American Airlines Q2 2023 Performance Exceeds Expectations</h2>
<p>The report noted that American Airlines’ second-quarter performance exceeded Wall Street expectations. According to the breakdown, the airline announced adjusted profits per share of $1.92, exceeding the $1.59 consensus forecast from The Wall Street.</p>
<p>Also, the company’s total revenue for Q2 amounted to $14.06 billion, which exceeded the analysts’ anticipated figure of $13.74 billion. The record revenue marks a significant 4.7% increase compared to the same period a year earlier, signaling a strong rebound in passenger demand and economic recovery.</p>
<p>Furthermore, American Airlines reported a net income of $1.34 billion for Q2 or $1.88 per share. This marks a substantial improvement from the same period in the previous year when the net income was $476 million, or 68 cents per share.</p>
<p>For the second quarter, American Airlines’ adjusted net income was $1.37 billion, or $1.92 per share. Meanwhile, the airline’s flying capacity increased by 5.3% from the same period a year ago.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/zeebu-partnership-hayo-axistel-qatama/">Zeebu Inks Strategic Partnership with Hayo, Axistel and Qatama</a></p>
<p>Zeebu, a revolutionary platform designed to harness the power of blockchain technology to address the challenges faced by the industry has inked strategic partnerships with three telecommunication companies; Hayo Telecom Inc., Axistel FZE and Qatama Ltd. According to a press release shared with Coinspeaker, this latest partnership brings the total number of Zeebu&#8217;s major telecom partners to seven.</p>
<p>The latest addition will play a crucial role in boosting the company&#8217;s mission of becoming a game changer in the telecommunications sector.</p>
<h2>The New Zeebu Tripartite Partnership</h2>
<p>Hayo Telecom is one of the growing firms in the Senegalese mobile operator industry with a broad range of services including Mobile, Fixed, WiFi, and Wimax. The company holds international clearing house licenses from Ghana and Nigeria. Hayo is known for generating traffic both locally and internationally as a key player in the telecom ecosystem.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to become a member of Zeebu’s telecom loyalty platform and utilize an infrastructure that will enable instantaneous transaction settlements across the globe,” said Feraz Ahmed, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Hayo Telecom, adding that “Based on the concepts of trust and transparency, Zeebu’s platform will provide game-changing benefits for telecom carriers.”</p>
<p>The second partner Axistel FZE is another key player in the global telecom sector known for services like Voice and SMS OTP HQ and CC services.</p>
<p>Most of its services are designed to cater to the ever-evolving needs of fixed and mobile carriers and corporate customers. Axistel FZE CEO Hiren Kakad believes that the adoption of the Zeebu blockchain network will play an important role in accelerating innovation in the telecom industry. He also highlighted the possibility of this integration to deliver real value to every participant.</p>
<p>Massih Qhoraish, Director of Qatama said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Zeebu’s blockchain-based loyalty solution is just what the telecommunications carrier industry needs. It offers unmatched security, with its rewards-based transaction infrastructure providing a strong incentive that will maximize operational efficiency for the entire industry.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Zeebu to Tackle Core Problems in the Telecom Sector</h2>
<p>Zeebu owns a revolutionary blockchain solution that tackles some of the unique problems faced in the telecom sector. Some of these issues are security threats, rising and complex costs between intermediaries, and remittance delays of up to 20 days.</p>
<p>Telecom operators can now be more confident to perform instant global transactions without fear of delay or high costs. With Zeebu&#8217;s platform, they are assured of enterprise-grade security against cyberattacks and fraud.</p>
<p>The Zeebu platform creates a transaction ecosystem that is trustless, transparent, and highly efficient for telecom carriers and their partners by utilizing smart contracts. Also, the Zeebu Loyalty Token (ZLU) promotes fast and seamless cross-border transactions and eliminates traditional banking routes and intermediaries.</p>
<p>Generally, the telecom industry is fast <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/3rd-edition-connected-africa-premier-telecom-summit-transforming-telco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integrating</a> blockchain into its ecosystem. Two months ago, Conflux Network and China Telecom <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/conflux-china-telecom-blockchain-sim-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> a jointly developed Blockchain SIM (BSIM) card at the Xuhui District West Bank Artificial Intelligence Center in Shanghai.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftx-exchange-71m-subsidiaries/">FTX Exchange Files to Reclaim $71M from Its Philanthropic and Life Science Subsidiaries </a></p>
<p>Beleaguered cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> has been trying to recover assets the company spent under the leadership of its former CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/sam-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, who is currently awaiting trial for his involvement in the collapse of the $32 billion valued exchange. In April, the company managed to recover $7.2 billion in cash and liquid crypto assets, but the FTX exchange is now pushing to retrieve an additional $71 million.</p>
<p>According to a recent court document filed in the United States court, the bankrupt crypto exchange seeks to reclaim the funds from the company&#8217;s subsidiaries, the FTX Foundation and Latona. The FTX Foundation serves as the philanthropic arm of the FTX group of companies, while Latona is a non-profit organization based in the Bahamas.</p>
<p>Both firms received approximately $71.5 million from FTX and its sister company Alameda Research before its unfortunate collapse in November 2022.</p>
<h2>Personal Aggrandizement and Not Altruistic Purposes</h2>
<p>The funds were used to invest in and donate to life sciences companies between February and October 2022, including Lumen Biosciences, GreenLight Biosciences, Genetic Networks, and 4J Therapeutics. However, according to the court filing, the lawyers representing FTX claimed these investments were made for Bankman-Fried&#8217;s personal Aggrandizement rather than for charitable purposes as initially planned.</p>
<p>The attorneys also allege that both entities used commingled funds from Alameda and FTX accounts to make investments and donations in the life sciences sector, intending to generate goodwill, political capital, and influence for Bankman-Fried. The lawyers are now seeking to recover these funds as part of the company&#8217;s restructuring plan to repay creditors.</p>
<p>&#8220;While purporting to make these investments for altruistic purposes (i.e., pandemic prevention and preparedness), Bankman-Fried in fact pursued these transactions because he believed that doing so would generate goodwill and amass political capital and influence for himself,&#8221; the lawyers <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ftx-seeks-recover-71m-philanthropic-070420401.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> in the filing.</p>
<h2>FTX Exchange Continues to Make Efforts to Recover Funds Spent by Bankmam-Fried</h2>
<p>FTX&#8217;s new administration has continued to make significant efforts to reclaim funds the former CEO spent during his time at the firm to ensure the company&#8217;s financial stability moving forward as it prepares to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftx-relaunch-international-exchange/">relaunch</a> the exchange. The latest court filing is not the first time FTX has sought to reclaim assets.</p>
<p>In June, Alameda Research&#8217;s lawyers pursued the recovery of $700 million, which Bankman-Fried allegedly transferred to a former aide of Hillary Clinton and the investment firm K5 Global in 2022. The <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/k5-global-ftx-700m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuit</a> named other politicians and celebrities as part of the recipient of the funds.</p>
<p>The company had warned US politicians and other political parties that received goodwill donations from the former FTX boss to support their campaign. Last December, some politicians began returning the funds to disassociate themselves from the company.</p>
<p>The troubled crypto exchange has also asked the court to retract $323 million from FTX Europe&#8217;s leadership team.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, last month, the US Metropolitan Museum of Art (the Met) <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/met-museum-550k-ftx-donations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed</a> to return the $550,000 donation it received from FTX before its demise.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/el-salvador-bonds-rally-bitcoin/">El Salvador Sees Bonds Jump in Tandem with Massive Rally in Bitcoin</a></p>
<p>As an emerging economy, El Salvador believes the best way to hedge against the core fluctuations brought on by the US dollar devaluation can be effectively mitigated with Bitcoin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/el-salvador-bonds-rally-bitcoin/">El Salvador Sees Bonds Jump in Tandem with Massive Rally in Bitcoin</a></p>
<p>El Salvador&#8217;s junk-rated bonds have defied expectations by experiencing a remarkable surge, mirroring the extraordinary ascent of Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) throughout 2023. According to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/20/el-salvadors-bonds-surge-62-amid-bitcoins-etf-driven-rally/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a>, El Salvador&#8217;s bonds have defied all odds by surging 62%, now trading at 72 cents on the dollar. Bitcoin, the world&#8217;s leading cryptocurrency, experienced an impressive 79% rise during the same period.</p>
<p>The surge in El Salvador’s bonds has even outpaced the performance of the Invesco Emerging Markets Sovereign Debt ETF (PCY), one of the largest holders of the country&#8217;s debt.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Adoption and ETF Surge</h2>
<p>The recent global trend of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) fueled by <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock Inc</a> (NYSE: BLK) is at the heart of this exponential surge in El Salvador&#8217;s bonds. As the application for spot Bitcoin ETFs expanded, the price of Bitcoin saw a notable upward trajectory. This rally, in turn, spurred investor confidence and may have increased the demand for El Salvador&#8217;s sovereign bonds.</p>
<p>As investor appetite for high-yield ventures surges, it can be deduced that El Salvador’s junk-rated bonds are not an isolated incident but rather a part of a larger market-wide trend. Junk-rated bonds of other countries, including Turkey, Argentina, and Nigeria, have also outperformed investment-grade bonds early this year.</p>
<h2>El Salvador Bitcoin Diversification Plans Faced Resistance</h2>
<p>El Salvador&#8217;s decision to embrace Bitcoin as a legal tender has been met with skepticism and opposition from rating agencies and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from the onset. The IMF opposition to El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption dates back to the early days when the country tapped the digital currency as its legal tender.</p>
<p>The IMF has <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/imf-el-salvador-bitcoin-legal-tender/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">urged</a> authorities to reconsider their plans to expand government exposure to Bitcoin due to legal risks, fiscal fragility, and the speculative nature of crypto markets. Besides the IMF, other global financial institutions like the World Bank and Fitch Ratings have also criticized and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/fitch-downgrades-el-salvador-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downgraded</a> the economic viability of adopting Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In 2021, S&amp;P also expressed skepticism over El Salvador&#8217;s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, citing immediate negative implications for the country&#8217;s credit. The rating agency raised concerns about the risks outweighing the potential benefits of embracing cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>As an emerging economy, El Salvador believes the best way to hedge against the core fluctuations brought on by the US dollar devaluation can be effectively mitigated with Bitcoin. Shortly after it made BTC legal tender with some <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/el-salvador-buys-additional-500-btc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accumulations</a> sanctioned by President Nayib Bukele, Bitcoin slipped into its long winter with price not recovering as consistently as it has done in the past few months.</p>
<p>With top projections for Bitcoin to outperform traditional assets in the long term, Bitcoin proponents are convinced El Salvador will be the one to laugh last. Thus far, the country has been able to meet its debt obligations and the current growth in its bonds can help restore investor confidence to an extent.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mizuho-72m-fund-startups/">Mizuho Financial Group Plans for $72M Venture Debt Fund for Startups</a></p>
<p>Japanese financial giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/mizuho/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mizuho Financial Group</a> announced that it would be launching a venture debt fund worth 10 billion yen or $72 million with a goal to boost the startup economy of Japan.</p>
<p>Mizuho feels that Japan has been lagging in the number of startups and thus it seeks to address this issue upfront. Kazutoshi Isogai, Mizuho’s retail and business banking chief, said that the fund will start as early as this month.</p>
<p>The goal of the fund will be to provide finance to middle and late-stage startups without diluting their existing shareholder equity. “We want to help finance startups in deep tech fields such as biotech, space, renewable energy and artificial intelligence where large upfront investments are required for research and development,” he said.</p>
<p>The Japanese government aims to increase investment in startups to 10 trillion yen ($72 billion) within five years to revitalize the country&#8217;s innovation and competitiveness. Decades of weak economic growth had hindered private investment and stifled innovation, prompting the need for this initiative.</p>
<p>As part of the plan, the government also aims to foster the creation of 100 unicorns, startups with a valuation exceeding 100 billion yen. Currently, there are only about a dozen such firms in Japan.</p>
<p>Mizuho, along with its larger peer Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, is taking steps to support this effort. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group also plans to establish a 20 billion yen venture debt fund for Japan, building upon existing $750 million debt funds for overseas startups.</p>
<h2>Strong Demand from Startups</h2>
<p>Kazutoshi Isogai said that there&#8217;s strong demand for debt from Japanese startups. Besides, more of these firms have preferred loans to equity financing that requires diluting ownership stakes.</p>
<p>“Startup business has been our forte,” Isogai said in an <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/mizuho-to-start-72-million-fund-targeting-japan-s-tech-startups-1.1948207" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a>. “Other megabanks are also very active in this field. We don’t want to get beaten.”</p>
<p>Mizuho&#8217;s fund will primarily focus on purchasing bonds with stock options, allowing the lender to share in potential gains if the borrower goes public through an initial public offering in the future. Depending on the success of the first fund, the bank may establish more similar funds.</p>
<p>Apart from investment purposes, Mizuho sees this initiative as an opportunity to attract future unicorns, which will help build a strong pipeline of wealth management clients for the bank.</p>
<p>In the latest development, Mizuho has also <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mizuho-45000-employees-test-openai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allowed</a> its 45000 employees to explore OpenAI, to unlock any major opportunities ahead in the market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/zhipu-ai-meituan-funding/">Chinese Project Zhipu AI Sees Huge Boost, Gets Meituan Funding</a></p>
<p>Zhipu AI has reportedly received a significant boost in its bid to challenge OpenAI&#8217;s domination of the artificial intelligence space. This follows after a recent announcement revealed that the firm has received funding from China&#8217;s food supply giant Meituan. Although the amount of funding remains undisclosed, Zhipu AI is now easily the country&#8217;s most promising project to take on OpenAI.</p>
<p>According to a local media <a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3693590" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>, a Meituan subsidiary has become a major stakeholder in an affiliate of Zhipu AI. That is after buying a 10% stake in the firm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zhipu&#8217;s exact funding to date also remains guesswork. The only idea about how much the startup has raised so far is the hint that it dropped earlier. Zhipu claims that it raised “hundreds of million yuan” ($1 = 7.23 yuan) from a Series B round last September. And mentioned that the round featured the likes of Qiming Venture Partners, Legend Capital, and Tsinghua Holdings, as its investors.</p>
<h2>Zhipu AI Aims to Build Dominant LLM</h2>
<p>Since OpenAI launched in 2015, several Chinese companies have been working to develop large language models (LLMs) that could compete with what their Western equals have created. And as it stands, Zhipu AI might already be in a clear lead among its Chinese counterparts.</p>
<p>Zhipu recently open-sourced its bilingual (Chinese and English) conversational AI model ChatGLM-6B. According to the firm, the model is trained on six billion parameters and is capable of carrying out inferences on a single consumer-grade graphics card, thereby, lessening the cost of running an LLM by a wide margin.</p>
<p>Before this, the firm had also open-sourced another model, the GLM-130B, which may be a more robust, general-purpose variant, being that it is trained on 130 billion parameters. Its user-facing chatbot app ChatGLM is currently in its beta phase.</p>
<p>Zhipu AI was founded in 2019 as a creative invention by the Chinese prestigious Tsinghua University. The startup is led by Tang Jie, a professor in the university’s Department of Computer Science and Technology.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/chatgpt-performance-research/">ChatGPT Is Declining in Performance According to Recent Research</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chatgpt-ai-chatbot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT</a> has become one of the most popular and powerful AI tools. Users worldwide have found it useful for many functions, from brainstorming content ideas to solving complex mathematical equations. Despite its widespread use, some GPT-4 users have expressed concern about its declining performance over time. And the research has also highlighted some decline in the performance of ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Researchers from Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley, recently published a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09009.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">study</a> titled &#8220;How Is ChatGPT&#8217;s Behavior Changing Over Time?&#8221; The study explores changes in the outputs of OpenAI&#8217;s large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, over the past few months.</p>
<h2>The Results of the Research on OpenAI’s ChatGPT Models</h2>
<p>The study calls into question GPT-4&#8217;s performance in coding and compositional tasks. Using API access, the researchers tested the March and June 2023 versions of these models on a variety of tasks, including math problem-solving, sensitive question answering, code generation, and visual reasoning. Notably, GPT-4&#8217;s ability to identify prime numbers decreased significantly from 97.6% in March to only 2.4% in June. GPT-3.5, on the other hand, performed better during the same time period.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">For example, GPT-4&#39;s success rate on &quot;is this number prime? think step by step&quot; fell from 97.6% to 2.4% from March to June, while GPT-3.5 improved. Behavior on sensitive inputs also changed. Other tasks changed less, but there are definitely singificant changes in LLM behavior.</p>
<p>&mdash; Matei Zaharia (@matei_zaharia) <a href="https://twitter.com/matei_zaharia/status/1681467964053413889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Another notable finding from the study was the considerable change in GPT-4&#8217;s response length. The average verbosity of GPT-4 decreased significantly, from 821.2 characters in March to just 3.8 characters in June. In contrast, GPT-3.5 experienced approximately 40% growth in its response length during the same period. Moreover, the study found that the overlap between the March and June versions&#8217; answers for both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 was relatively small for both services.</p>
<p>The study observed distinct changes in how GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 responded to sensitive questions. From March to June, GPT-4&#8217;s frequency of answering such questions decreased significantly, dropping from 21.0% to 5.0%. On the other hand, GPT-3.5 demonstrated the opposite trend, with the rate of answering sensitive questions increasing from 2.0% to 8.0% during the same period.</p>
<p>The experts who conducted the research speculated that the June update for ChatGPT (GPT-4) likely incorporated a stronger safety layer, leading to a more conservative approach to handling sensitive queries. In contrast, GPT-3.5 appeared to become less conservative in its responses to such questions.</p>
<p>The research findings emphasize that the behavior of a supposedly consistent LLM service can undergo significant changes in a relatively short period. This highlights the crucial importance of continuous monitoring to ensure and maintain LLM quality.</p>
<p>Critics of GPT-4 have expressed subjective concerns about its declining performance. Some theories suggest that OpenAI might have &#8220;distilled&#8221; the model to reduce computational overhead, fine-tuned it to minimize harmful outputs, or even intentionally limited its coding capabilities to drive demand for GitHub Copilot.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">GPT-4 is getting worse over time, not better.</p>
<p>Many people have reported noticing a significant degradation in the quality of the model responses, but so far, it was all anecdotal.</p>
<p>But now we know.</p>
<p>At least one study shows how the June version of GPT-4 is objectively worse than… <a href="https://t.co/whhELYY6M4">pic.twitter.com/whhELYY6M4</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Santiago (@svpino) <a href="https://twitter.com/svpino/status/1681614284613099520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>OpenAI has consistently denied any decline in GPT-4&#8217;s capabilities. According to OpenAI&#8217;s VP of Product, Peter Welinder, each new version is designed to be smarter than the previous one, and issues may become more noticeable with increased usage.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">No, we haven&#39;t made GPT-4 dumber. Quite the opposite: we make each new version smarter than the previous one.</p>
<p>Current hypothesis: When you use it more heavily, you start noticing issues you didn&#39;t see before.</p>
<p>&mdash; Peter Welinder (@npew) <a href="https://twitter.com/npew/status/1679538687854661637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The research paper challenges the assertion made by OpenAI regarding the intentional improvement of every new version of GPT. One of the co-authors of the research paper, Matei Zaharia, also the Chief Technology Officer at Databricks, expressed concerns on Twitter about the difficulty in managing the quality of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI</a> model responses. He further questioned how well model developers can detect changes and prevent the loss of certain capabilities while introducing new ones.</p>
<p>While the study appears to support critics&#8217; claims, some experts advise caution. Arvind Narayanan, a computer science professor at Princeton, <a href="https://twitter.com/random_walker/status/1681490845462134786" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claims</a> that the study&#8217;s findings do not prove GPT-4&#8217;s decline conclusively. He speculates that the observed changes are consistent with OpenAI&#8217;s fine-tuning adjustments. The study, for example, evaluates code generation based on immediate executability rather than correctness, which could lead to misinterpretations.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/terraform-labs-new-ceo/">Terraform Labs: Do Kwon Out, New CEO In</a></p>

<p>Terraform Labs, the company behind the TerraUSD stablecoin and the Luna blockchain, has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/terraform-labs-appoints-former-coo-chris-amani-as-interim-ceo-301880860.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> a major change in its leadership. The company appointed the former COO Chris Amani as director and interim CEO. Earlier, Do Kwon, the founder and former CEO of Terraform Labs, stepped down from both roles to face his legal battles.</p>
<p>Mr. Armani steps in with over 20 years of leadership experience at global technology companies. Since joining Terraform Labs in 2021 as COO and CFO, Mr. Armani has been integral to the company’s strategy and operations.  However, he comes in as CEO at a critical juncture for the company.</p>
<h2>Terraform Labs Appoints New CEO amid Legal Woes</h2>
<p>Recall that TFL and Do Kwon have been embroiled in a legal battle with the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>. Following the UST depeg and Luna crash, the SEC accused the duo of misrepresenting the nature and risks of TerraUSD. They also accused them of causing investor loss and triggering a market-wide collapse. Elsewhere, a South Korean court also issued an arrest warrant for Do Kwon while investigating the events that led to the company’s collapse.</p>
<p>Mr. Armani acknowledged the company’s limitations but believes he can lead the company through it. He said, &#8220;It&#8217;s been a challenging year for Terra following UST&#8217;s depeg, but the Terra community and TFL team have shown incredible resilience.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Terra Ecosystem Will be Rebuilt</h2>
<p>Following the collapse, Do Kwon unveiled a revitalization plan that will reset the Luna supply to 1 billion tokens. The new offer would prioritize investors who previously owned Luna Classic (LUNC), TerraUSD Classic (USTC), and Anchor Protocol UST (aUST).</p>
<p>Mr. Armani believes his appointment as CEO will help the rebuilding efforts. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The process won&#8217;t be easy, but we have a clear vision of where Terra fits within the broader Web3 ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also noted that the company was &#8220;hyper-focused&#8221; on executing the vision and would share more about it soon.</p>
<p>However, some experts and analysts are skeptical about Terraform Labs&#8217; new efforts and its ability to regain the trust of the crypto community.</p>
<h2>Do Kwon Faces Extradition to the US</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Do Kwon is in <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/do-kwon-guilty-4-months-jail/">a Montenegro jail for forging travel documents</a>. Do Kwon was arrested at the Podgorica Airport in March while trying to fly to Dubai and sentenced to four months in jail. He also faces possible extradition to South Korea or the United States after serving his sentence.</p>

<p>Kuwait, a country in West Asia, has taken a stringent step in its regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies by imposing a comprehensive ban on all transactions involving crypto and other digital assets in the nation. The country&#8217;s financial regulator, the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) of Kuwait, <a href="https://www.cma.gov.kw/en/web/cma/cma-board-releases/resolutions-and-regulations/-/cmaboardreleases/detail/1384960" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a circular on July 18, enforcing the absolute prohibition on major activities related to virtual assets, including Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>), following in the footsteps of other nations such as Pakistan, Argentina and China which have already <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/agricultural-bank-china-ban-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented</a> similar restrictions on virtual assets in their various jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The ban covers crucial aspects of the crypto ecosystem, such as payments, trading, making investments in crypto, and engaging in mining operations. The move aims to address the potential risks associated with virtual assets and to safeguard the interests of consumers and investors.</p>
<h2>CMA Claims Cryptocurrencies Lack Legal Status</h2>
<p>While the ban prohibits crypto traders in the country from engaging in any digital assets-related activities, the new rule does not extend to traditional financial products in the country. According to the circular, the restriction does not apply to securities and other financial instruments regulated by the Central Bank of Kuwait and the CMA.</p>
<p>In its circular, the CMA cited the lack of legal status for cryptocurrencies as part of the reasons for the ban, emphasizing that digital assets are not issued or supported by any central authority.</p>
<p>In addition to the prohibition, the authorities have warned the public about the potential risks involved in engaging with digital assets, noting that prices or values of these assets are often driven by speculative trading, making them highly volatile and susceptible to sharp price fluctuations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not linked to any asset or issuer, and the price of these assets are always driven by speculation that exposes them to a sharp decline,&#8221; said CMA in the circular.</p>
<h2>Crackdown on Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing</h2>
<p>The financial authorities said in the circular that the recent regulatory changes align with the country&#8217;s dedication to combating money laundering and illicit activities related to cryptocurrencies within the nation. In line with its commitment to tackling money laundering and terrorist financing, the regulator emphasized that any violations of the country&#8217;s Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws may result in penalties under Law No. 106 of 2013. These measures reinforce Kuwait&#8217;s efforts to maintain financial integrity and security.</p>
<p>The CMA also pointed to a study in the circular conducted by the National Committee for Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism regarding the commitment to implementing the Financial Action Task Force&#8217;s (FATF) Recommendation (15).</p>
<p>For clarity, the FATF Recommendation 15 is a regulatory framework that requires crypto exchanges and other virtual asset service providers (VASP) in the country to implement AML rules for money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the ban on Bitcoin and other crypto transactions in Kuwait is reportedly part of a broader regulatory initiative that involves multiple supervisory authorities, including the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the Central Bank of Kuwait, and the Insurance Regulatory Unit. This coordinated effort ensures a consistent and unified approach to address the challenges posed by the rapidly growing cryptocurrency market.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/google-ai-tool-journalists/" rel="prev">next</a></p>
