<p>According to a forum post by <strong>Devin Walsh</strong>, the foundation&#8217;s executive director, Uniswap community members will be able to vote on a reorganization package that would increase the DAO&#8217;s efficiency and efficacy on <strong>December 14</strong>.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In November, we made a proposal to reduce friction in the Uniswap community governance process. <br><br>Delegates provided their feedback &#8211; and today we are posting an updated proposal. <br><br>We plan to hold a vote on these changes on Wed., Dec. 14.<a href="https://t.co/3xXQ4ymzuw" target="_blank">https://t.co/3xXQ4ymzuw</a></p>&mdash; Uniswap Foundation (@UniswapFND) <a href="https://twitter.com/UniswapFND/status/1601227009278910464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 9, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The most significant change would be a reduction in the requirement for off-chain snapshot votes prior to on-chain votes in the governance. It would significantly raise the bar for obtaining preliminary votes, preventing lower-quality proposals from passing. The final governance votes will remain unchanged.</p>



<p>Revisions and updates to <strong>Request for Comment</strong> include: increasing the <strong>new “RFC” process </strong>to a <strong>minimum of 7 days</strong> rather than the originally proposed <strong>3 days</strong>; increasing the quorum for the <strong>new Temperature Check</strong>, the remaining off-chain Snapshot poll, to <strong>10 million UNI</strong> rather than the originally proposed <strong>5 million UNI</strong>; increasing the quorum to <strong>10 million UNI increases</strong> the effectiveness of this phase as a signal of community support.</p>

<p>Community members have been active in their attempts to simplify governance and reduce friction within the protocol.

<p>As was updated in an earlier Coincu News article, <strong>The Block CEO Michael McCaffrey <a href="https://news.coincu.com/150663-the-block-ceo-resigns-after-loans-from-sbf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced his resignation</a> after discovering the loan from Alameda Research by former FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried</strong>.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.axios.com/2021/04/16/block-crypto-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously reported</a> by AXIOS, the company is not profitable, its revenue <strong>mainly from advertising and subscriptions</strong>, is expected to be <strong>around $20 million this year, </strong>a source told Axios. </p>



<p>As is known, Michael McCaffrey is the only person aware of this grant to the company. On its disclosure page, The Block writes, &#8220;it is critical that The Block is fully transparent about our own financial holdings so as to avoid any appearance of bias or impropriety. The most valuable asset that we hold and strive to earn again every day is our reader&#8217;s trust.&#8221;</p>

<p>McCaffrey received three loans, the first of which was worth $12 million and was used in 2021 to acquire other investors from the news provider, cryptocurrency statistics and research. A second $15 million loan was made in January, which was used to finance day-to-day operations before an additional $16 million loan to purchase private property in Bahamas.</p>



<p>The Block Chief Revenue Officer Bobby Moran confirmed to Axios on Friday. McCaffrey is also leaving his board. Next, Moran said all senior leaders are staying with the organization and the company will continue to operate and publish.</p>

<p>Regardless of interest income risks, the bank&#8217;s report indicates that revenue expectations for <strong>2023</strong> are likely unduly optimistic.</p>



<p>Coinbase CEO <strong>Brian Armstrong</strong> said that the company&#8217;s revenue would be half or less of what it was last year as the exchange struggles amid sharp drops in cryptocurrency prices and the collapse of crypto exchange <strong>FTX</strong>.</p>

<p>The company claims <strong>their balance on FTX represents 18% of the company&#8217;s equivalent</strong>, which is within the counterparty&#8217;s risk limit. Even without recovering any assets from FTX, FalconX said it remains “one of the best-capitalized digital asset companies.”</p>

In addition, the company also says that its trading volume is growing by more than 80% monthly, with an average daily trading volume in the billions of dollars.</p>

According to the document, its assets and liabilities all range from $1 million to $10 million.</p>



<p>Founded in 2013 as Math Money FX, Symbiont.io aims to help financial institutions use blockchain to &#8220;reduce risk, save costs, and increase efficiency&#8221;.</p>

<p>It has raised capital from financial magnates, including the former CEO of the New York Stock Exchange. Symbiont has previously reached partnerships with major institutions like index fund giant Vanguard.</p>



<p>As was updated in an earlier Coincu News article, SWIFT, the Global Consortium for Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is <a href="https://news.coincu.com/124830-swift-partners-with-symbiont/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partnering with blockchain enterprise firm Symbiont</a> on a project.</p>



<p>However, the company still could not escape the death spiral of the crypto winter and had to add itself to the list of bankrupt crypto companies.</p>

<p>According to Michael McCaffrey&#8217;s Tweet, <strong>he was the only person with knowledge of the funding at the company.</strong></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">4/ I didn’t disclose the loan to anyone.

<p><strong>McCaffrey obtained three loans</strong>, the first of which was <strong>$12 million</strong> and it was used in 2021 to buy out other investors from the provider of cryptocurrency news, statistics, and research. The second loan of <strong>$15 million</strong> had been made in January, which was used to help fund daily operations before an additional <strong>$16 million</strong> was borrowed to buy private property in the Bahamas.</p>



<p>His resignation is the most recent in the line of business losses related to the collapse of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/150561-bankman-fried-says-he-is-willing-to-testify/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/150561-bankman-fried-says-he-is-willing-to-testify/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bankman-Fried</a>’s crypto empire. Besides, <strong>Bobby Moran, The Block’s Chief Revenue Officer, will step into the role of CEO</strong>. Prior to The Block, Bobby was the Chief Revenue Officer at POLITICO and the online educational service, EverFi.</p>



<p>Additionally, McCaffrey will leave his position as CEO as well as the company&#8217;s board, which will now have three members. <strong>The business is currently looking to add two more people to the extended group to join Moran</strong>. However, McCaffrey remains the company’s majority shareholder</p>

<p>The <a href="https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-improved-value-capture-and-fast-lane-poc/4142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposal</a> proposes the development of a <strong>Bancor Fast Lane </strong>arbitrage bot. This bot will scan all accessible <strong>Bancor</strong> <strong>pools</strong> for arbitrage opportunities, which profit on price disparities in the same trading pair across multiple markets.</p>



<p>Before doing the arbitrage deal, the bot&#8217;s contract will launch a flash loan, necessitating the creation of a new contract.</p>



<p>According to the plan, <strong>Bancor DAO</strong> users who detect these beneficial deals will get a <strong>10% finders fee</strong>. The charge, however, will be limited to <strong>100 bancor tokens (BNT)</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/111409-bancor-with-liquidity-difficulties/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bancor</a>&#8216;s bot will compete with other arbitrage bots crawling the various liquidity pools and extracting value from the protocol.</p>



<p><strong>Bancor DAO </strong>intends to offer its own bot a competitive edge by exempting it from transaction costs that third-party bots must still pay. The team might also upgrade the Bancor v3 contract to enable the bot to work.</p>

<p>Nicholas Padilla, who oversaw investigations, has resigned from his position as inspector general. <strong>Representatives of the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> confirmed that he left in November even though his page on the organization&#8217;s website has not been updated</strong>.</p>

<p>The loss of staff was reported by Padilla to Gensler in October. According to the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/inspector-generals-statement-sec-mgmt-and-perf-challenges-october-2022.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.sec.gov/files/inspector-generals-statement-sec-mgmt-and-perf-challenges-october-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>, &#8220;the Securities and Exchange Commission seems to be facing challenges to its retention efforts&#8221;, in particular, <strong>the speed of the regulation and a lack of communication about policy under Gensler as sources of conflict.</strong></p>

<p>On a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJiQiL5bLY0&amp;t=539s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">podcast</a> with hedge fund manager <strong>Hugh</strong> <strong>Hendry</strong>, Davies explains how the hedge fund unraveled. He stated that the fund survived the collapse of Luna, the accompanying credit crisis, and the decrease in crypto values, only to succumb when it was liquidated by FTX. </p>



<p>He further meaningful that <strong>FTX</strong> and <strong>Alameda</strong> communicated internal information and that <strong>the trading business was aware of its liquidation level and actively pursued it.</strong></p>



<p>He said that a larger effect came when credit was tightened across the crypto community and lenders began canceling loans, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/149661-court-orders-subpoena-3ac-founders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3AC</a> refunded all loans sought during that time period.</p>
