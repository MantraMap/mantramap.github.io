<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/flare-strategic-partnership-flaredashboard/">Blockchain Platform Flare Enters in Strategic Partnership with FlareDashboard</a></p>
<p>On Friday, July 14, <a href="https://flare.network/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Flare Network</a> entered into a strategic partnership with the community-managed database platform FlareDashboard.</p>
<p>The collaboration aims to gather important information about the contributors who support the network&#8217;s decentralized operations, improving transparency within the Flare ecosystem.</p>
<p>Initially, the focus will be on the data providers for Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO), who provide price feed data to the network. Eventually, the partnership will include other participants such as validators and <a href="https://flare.network/stateconnector/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">State Connector</a> attestation providers, enabling network participants to make well-informed decisions.</p>
<p>Flare is a Layer 1 blockchain that focuses on providing developers with lots of information in a decentralized way. Unlike other blockchains, Flare has built-in protocols that make it easy and affordable for developers to access different types of high-quality data. It&#8217;s designed to handle large amounts of information efficiently and at a low cost. Speaking on the development, Ash W, CEO and Co-Founder of FlareDashboard said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We have been actively supporting the Flare and Songbird ecosystem since their inception, and we take great pride in building FlareDashboard, an independent community platform that connects infrastructure teams with ecosystem participants. FlareDashboard’s objective is to facilitate the exchange and validation of valuable information provided by the network’s infrastructure providers. This information can be utilized by ecosystem participants when delegating to support infrastructure teams that bring added value to the ecosystem.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Flare Seeks to Build a Transparent System</h2>
<p>The Flare platform brings together crucial information including team details, KYC compliance, operational history, data protection measures, technology configuration, and network addresses. This promotes transparency within the system.</p>
<p>All network participants can access this important information through the website flaredashboard.io. Infrastructure providers also have the chance to share additional details with the community. Hugo Philion, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Flare Network said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Flare is proud to be able to support a community initiative like FlareDashboard. By providing a transparent view on ecosystem contributors, they can help our community make more data-driven decisions on how they participate.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The Flare Network has been working on key initiatives in the past to build robust blockchain-based decentralized infrastructure. Recently, Flare formed a <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/flare-ankr-rpc-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategic partnership</a> with Ankr, a well-known cloud infrastructure provider in the Web3 industry. The collaboration aims to improve Flare&#8217;s Remote Procedure Call (RPC) procedures, which are specifically designed for developers.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/xrp-4th-largest-crypto-victory/">XRP Emerges as 4th Largest Crypto after Ripple’s Decisive Victory</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">XRP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the digital currency affiliated with </span><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ripple-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ripple Labs Inc</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This remarkable feat comes on the heels of Ripple’s recent victory over the United States </span><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Securities and Exchange Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (SEC).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court declared that the sale and offer of XRP on exchange platforms did not constitute the sale of investment contracts. This legal victory sent shockwaves through the crypto market, resulting in a rapid accumulation and an eventual surge in the price of XRP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from TradingView, XRP’s price spiked by as much as 98% in the hours following the decision, reaching a high of $0.93. Accordingly, XRP experienced an extraordinary surge in market capitalization within hours of the recent ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cryptocurrency’s market cap skyrocketed by a staggering $21.2 billion, propelling it to a new yearly high of $46.1 billion. XRP’s market capitalization has settled down at $41.5 billion as of the time of writing. This surge in market value propelled XRP from its previous 7th position to surpass Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) and Binance’s BNB token in the rankings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surge in XRP’s price highlights the impact of legal outcomes on the crypto market. Ultimately, regulatory clarity is paramount to investors, as it eliminates the ambiguity surrounding a digital asset&#8217;s status and potential future restrictions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court’s ruling served as a catalyst for renewed investor confidence in XRP, leading to a surge in buying pressure and a subsequent price appreciation. However, it is worth noting that the battle between Ripple and the SEC is yet to be concluded. The ultimate outcome of the lawsuit will have far-reaching implications for XRP and its regulatory status.</span></p>
<h2><b>XRP Victory: Impact on the Crypto Space</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent court ruling in favor of XRP in the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC has had a significant impact on the crypto ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been indications of an unexpected rise in activity on several crypto exchanges following the court ruling. One such exchange affected by the sudden spike was Uphold, a US-based crypto exchange. The unprecedented volume of trading activity led to technical difficulties and temporarily caused Uphold’s platform to go down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent ruling in favor of Ripple has also had a notable impact on the re-listing of XRP on several prominent US crypto exchanges. For instance, </span><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coinbase Global Inc</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (NASDAQ: COIN), one of the largest crypto exchanges, announced the re-listing of XRP shortly after the court’s decision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, Kraken, another prominent crypto platform, and iTrustCapital have also followed suit. The re-listing of XRP by these major exchanges signifies growing confidence in XRP’s regulatory status following the court’s ruling. It also indicates a willingness to provide their users with access to a broader range of digital assets, including XRP.</span></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/jpmorgan-reports-q2-2023-figures/">JPMorgan Reports Q2 2023 Figures Scaling Analysts’ Estimates on Revenue and EPS</a></p>
<p>American multinational financial services giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/jpmorgan-chase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JPMorgan Chase</a> (NYSE: JPM) has reported Q2 figures for 2023, exceeding expectations set by analysts. Much of the company’s rise came from increasing interest income and interest rates.</p>
<p>JPMorgan reported a total revenue of $42.4 billion for Q2 2023, higher than the $38.96 billion Refinitiv estimated. The company also reported adjusted earnings per share at $4.37 versus the estimated $4.</p>
<p>JPMorgan had a good quarter as its net income came in at $14.5 billion, a 67% increase, or a 40% spike excluding the First Republic acquisition. In premarket trading, JPM is changing hands at $153.56, 3.24% higher than its previous $148.87 close. The company’s stock has also risen nearly 4% in 1 month, more than 7.3% in three months, and 11% year-to-date (YTD). In addition, JPM has climbed nearly 32% in the past year.</p>
<p>JPMorgan’s rise comes following a lot of pressure on the banking sector. Since last month, regional banks have reported reduced interest revenue, with more expected in the near future. Consequently, lenders are reportedly preparing to make more provisions as the economy staggers. Estimates suggest JPMorgan will post $2.72 to provide for credit losses.</p>
<h2>Q2 Increase in 2023 Follows Increased JPMorgan Revenue Target</h2>
<p>After successfully <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/jpmorgan-chase-acquires-first-republic-bank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquiring</a> First Republic Bank early in May, JPMorgan <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/jpmorgan-2023-revenue-target-84b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised</a> its key target revenue for 2023 to $84 billion. During an investor presentation, the bank increased the target from $3 billion after <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/jpmorgan-record-q1-2023-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting</a> impressive figures for Q1 2023. Profit then jumped 52% in Q1, with revenue increasing 25% year-over-year (YoY).</p>
<p>JPMorgan officially <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/jpmorgan-chase-acquires-first-republic-bank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> First Republic Bank, including all deposits and a large number of shares. The deal involved JPMorgan taking up nearly $30 billion in securities and $173 billion in loans, all belonging to First Republic. Following the acquisition, JPMorgan <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgan-tells-1000-first-republic-employees-theyll-lose-their-jobs-bloomberg-2023-05-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fired</a> nearly 1,000 First Republic staff and offered employment to about 7,000 workers for full-time or temporary roles. However, the temporary roles may only last between three months and one year. First Republic staff not offered any roles were to receive benefits for 60 days, lump sum payments, and benefits coverage.</p>
<h2>JPMorgan Predicts &#8216;Hard Landing&#8217; for UK Economy</h2>
<p>JPMorgan economist Allan Monks has warned about an economic downturn in the UK owing to the continuous increase in interest rates. Monks believes that the Bank of England (BoE) could peak interest rates at 5.75% or continue the increase up to 7% “under some scenarios”.</p>
<p>According to Monks, there are many reasons the BoE could maintain its increase in interest rates. Monks said high inflation could cause “a sustained wage-price spiral”, spurring continued rate hikes. The analyst also believes that an increase in short-term expectations for arresting inflation could still end in raised hikes even if longer-term measures remain stable. Monks cautions that these events could force the central bank to raise rates higher than JPMorgan’s forecast.</p>
<p>Comments made by BoE Governor Andre Bailey admit that the rising inflation and interest rates used to tackle the rise are factors negatively affecting the people. However, Bailey assured that the BoE&#8217;s priority is reducing inflation.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-turns-6-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">Binance Turns 6: CEO Changpeng Zhao Appreciates Customers in Heartfelt Message </a></p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/">Binance</a> turns 6, CEO Changpeng Zhao (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/changpeng-zhao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CZ</a>) reflects on the company’s journey since inception and expresses deep appreciation to users who have kept the company profitable. In a heartfelt note shared with Coinspeaker, CZ details the exchange’s journey filled with problems and successes alike.</p>
<p>CZ opened with Binance’s “humble beginnings”, explaining that the exchange raised $15 million in digital assets and launched two weeks after. At the time, Binance launched with 5 tokens and only supported 2 languages. Zhao added that the exchange borrowed a customer support team from a different organization and had no marketing team.</p>
<p>Binance is now the world’s largest exchange by trading volume and has maintained this position since 2017. Six years after launching, Binance now has several thousand employees and supports more than 600 digital assets in over 40 languages.</p>
<h2>CZ Reflects on Binance’s Challenges as Exchange Celebrates Year 6</h2>
<p>Zhao wrote extensively about challenges the exchange faced in the note. He said the first major challenge was China’s decision to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/04/bitcoin-digital-currency-price-falls-on-china-ico-ban.html">ban</a> crypto exchanges and ICOs in September 2017. Because of the ban, ICO projects returned funds to investors, and tokens crashed. Zhao eventually had to pay $6 million of Binance’s money, 40% of the exchange’s treasury. Thankfully, the action paid off and attracted a flock of users to Binance. By December of that year, Binance had become the world’s largest exchange by trading volume.</p>
<p>CZ also mentioned navigating “an evolving regulatory landscape”. While regulatory issues have always been a problem in the crypto industry, especially since a “Tier 1 regulator in Asia” told CZ in 2019 that they do not regulate crypto, the CEO is now confident that regulators are now paying more attention.</p>
<p>“Globally, we have shown that compliance and innovation can exist hand in hand. We take pride in our licenses and registrations across 17 countries, a testament to our pro-regulation stance and the extensive efforts we have made in compliance and regulatory space,” wrote he.</p>
<p>Zhao remarked in support of regulation, assuring the Binance community that the exchange is eager to collaborate with policymakers.</p>
<p>As part of his note, CZ explained Binance’s level of exposure during last year’s crypto winter. He assured that while last year’s market was more volatile than the 2018 winter, Binance had “minimal exposure”. However, the CEO confirmed that Binance invested $3 million in Terra in 2018 and never sold or moved the LUNA tokens. The investment spiked to $1.6 billion in 2021 and then crashed to $0 last year.</p>
<h2>Binance Looking Forward</h2>
<p>As Binance turns 6, Changpeng Zhao seems enthusiastic about the future of crypto. Zhao highlights increasing institutional crypto adoption, mentioning firms like Fidelity, Citadel, and BlackRock. He also predicts that decentralized finance (DeFi) will accelerate as DeFi products make crypto ownership easy, and developers create more products. Zhao also predicts that DeFi will exceed CeFi in about 6 years.</p>
<p>Finally, the CEO ends his note by thanking Binance customers for their support and candid feedback.</p>
<p>“I am forever grateful to be on this journey with you. You are the heart and soul of Binance, for many years to come,” Zhao concluded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-base-mainnet-for-developers/">Coinbase&#8217;s Layer-2 Network Base Unveils Mainnet for Developers before Public Launch</a></p>
<p>In the latest development, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> unveiled the mainnet of its Layer-2 scalability platform Base, for developers. This <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/239393/coinbase-base-mainnet-developers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">release</a> comes just ahead of the public launch of Coinbase Base slated for earlier August next month.</p>
<p>Earlier this year in February, Coinbase unveiled the testnet version of Base. This release of the developer mainnet will allow the deployment of applications on the Base network.</p>
<p>Coinbase Base is a network based on Ethereum Layer 2 technology. It offers developers a cost-effective and secure platform for creating on-chain solutions. Developed in partnership with Optimism and residing on the OP Stack, Base operates as a rollup network. This secondary layer conducts off-chain computations to enable faster and more affordable transactions, while still benefiting from the security features of the Ethereum mainnet.</p>
<p>In preparation for the launch of the mainnet, the Base core team conducted thorough security audits, both internally and externally, to enhance the safety of the network and the Optimism Protocol Stack (OP Stack). This involved collaboration with Coinbase protocol experts as well as over 100 external security researchers, as stated by the team.</p>
<p>The Base mainnet now offers various tools for developers that are readily available. These tools include node providers such as Blockdaemon, QuickNode, and Blast, the Safe Wallet for secure storage, block explorers like Etherscan and Blockscout, and data indexers such as The Graph and Covalent, as confirmed by the team.</p>
<h2>More Details About the Coinbase Base Mainnet</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>In their announcement on July 13, the team revealed that the Base mainnet now includes two functioning block explorers and an official RPC node, which enables users to read data and send transactions. Data from these explorers indicates that the network has been operational since July 2 and has successfully processed over 1 million transactions.</p>
<p>Blockchain data confirms the deployment of an official &#8220;OptimismPortal&#8221; or Base bridge contract to the Ethereum network. This contract facilitates the transfer of Ether (ETH) to the new network for covering gas fees. However, it&#8217;s important to note that the bridge does not have a web-based user interface (UI) and can only be accessed through a command-line interface or by running scripts.</p>
<p>During the initial &#8220;builder&#8221; phase, the team decided not to provide a publicly available bridge with a UI. This feature is reserved for the upcoming public launch, and developers are advised against launching their own UIs for their applications until then.</p>
<p>To commemorate the event, the team is offering builders the opportunity to mint a special nonfungible token (NFT) called &#8220;Base is for builders&#8221;. Additionally, any developer who deploys a contract to the network and completes a form on the project&#8217;s website will receive a &#8220;Genesis Builder NFT&#8221; as a token of appreciation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/crypto-yearly-highs-xrp/">Crypto Soars to Yearly Highs amid XRP Fueled Sentiment</a></p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies witnessed a remarkable spike reaching new yearly highs in a remarkable overnight rally. This surge comes as a result of the favorable decisions bordering on the legal battle between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and blockchain payments firm, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ripple-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple Labs Inc</a> over the status of XRP.</p>
<p>The spike in buyups helped in breaking the prolonged uncertainty that had gripped the market for months in the name of crypto winter.</p>
<h2>A Shifting Regulatory Landscape</h2>
<p>Matthew Dibb, the Chief Investment Officer at crypto asset management firm Astronaut Capital explained that the regulatory environment is changing. “Based on what we&#8217;ve seen in the last 24 hours, it may be for the better,” he said.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/signs-crypto-winter-ending-regulatory-fog-begins-lift-2023-07-14/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a>, Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency, reached its highest price since June 2022, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">touching</a> $31,818 on the Bitstamp exchange. This surge reflects a significant upswing of over 90% for the year so far and nearly 30% in just a month, defying earlier predictions of a prolonged market slump.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> (ETH), the second-largest token by market capitalization also saw a significant increase, recording its best session since March. Several factors have contributed to this resurgence. Regulatory clarity and increased institutional involvement have played a crucial role in revitalizing the market.</p>
<p>The recent court ruling regarding Ripple’s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP</a> tokens has provided much-awaited regulatory clarity for Ripple stakeholders, according to Justin d’Anethan, Head of Business Development in Asia at Keyrock, a digital assets market maker in Hong Kong. While the language used in the ruling may still be somewhat ambiguous, the finding that XRP tokens sold on public crypto exchanges are not considered securities under the law is seen as a potentially influential precedent.</p>
<p>The court ruling spurred a spike in smaller cryptocurrencies known as “altcoins”. Tokens such as Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), and Stellar (XLM) saw price gains of 15% to 50%. Also, shares of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase Global Inc</a> (NASDAQ: COIN) soared 24% to reach a yearly high.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the development of innovative financial products, such as Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), has also attracted new investors and increased market liquidity.</p>
<h2>Legal Battles Causing Uncertainty in the Industry</h2>
<p>The market witnessed a protracted period of gloomy sentiment during the crypto winter, with prices plunging and investor confidence dwindling. The collapse of the FTX Exchange further intensified the negative sentiment and raised concerns about the security and stability of crypto platforms. This challenging environment led to a prolonged period of stagnation and uncertainty for the sector.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Coinbase and Binance are facing lawsuits from the SEC. These legal challenges have created uncertainty and potential setbacks for the market.</p>
<p>Despite the legal challenges and market setbacks, the recent positive news surrounding cryptocurrencies has sparked optimism. <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock Inc</a> (NYSE: BLK) <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed</a> to launch a Bitcoin ETF, and Cboe, a leading exchange operator, refreshed its filing for a similar fund to be managed by asset manager <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/fidelity-investments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fidelity Investments</a>.</p>
<p>Chris Weston, Head of Research at Brokerage Pepperstone, notes that after a prolonged period of negative news, the industry is now experiencing a consistent stream of positive developments, creating momentum and improving market sentiment.</p>

<p>According to the announcement on the Worldcoin website on July 13, it took less than half the time to achieve 2 million sign-ups for World ID compared to reaching the first million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/worldcoins-world-id-program-2m-users/">Worldcoin&#8217;s World ID Program Surpasses 2M Users</a></p>
<p>Worldcoin has gained over 2 million users for its global identity protocol World ID. Currently in its beta phase, the project attracted many of these users through tours conducted in major cities worldwide.</p>
<p>The Worldcoin project aims to establish a global digital currency and identity system. Sam Altman created it to address the challenges associated with financial inclusion and identity verification using <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-blockchain-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain technology</a>.</p>
<p>One of the prominent features of the project is the World ID protocol, which aims to provide individuals with digital passports stored on their smartphones. This enables secure and private identity verification using biometric data obtained through iris scanning, resulting in a unique identifier known as an IrisHash.</p>
<p>A key problem that the project aims to solve is the lack of legal identity for a significant portion of the global population. Referring to a statement from McKinsey Global Institute, it <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/McKinsey%20Digital/Our%20Insights/Digital%20identification%20A%20key%20to%20inclusive%20growth/MGI-Digital-identification-Report.ashx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“There are over 4.4 billion people worldwide who either don’t have a legal identity or have one that can’t be digitally verified. This is a major stumbling block when it comes to accessing financial services.”</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the announcement on the Worldcoin website on July 13, it took less than half the time to achieve 2 million sign-ups for World ID compared to reaching the first million. The project announced the achievement of the 1 million sign-up milestone in January, and it took only six months to reach 2 million.</p>
<p>The new milestone was reached after the project&#8217;s global tour was carried out in cities like Barcelona, New York, Tokyo, Seoul, Buenos Aires, and Berlin. The tours resulted in an average of 40,000 individual sign-ups every week for the verified World ID.</p>
<p>In its announcement, it is <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/worldocin-passes-2-million-world-id-sign-ups-demand-increases" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Achieving 2 million World ID sign-ups is more than just an accomplishment for the Worldcoin community; it’s also a significant milestone in the broader global effort to make digitally-verifiable identity more accessible to everyone.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>More Users Lead to Increase in Demand for Worldcoin’s Services</h2>
<p>The increase in users has also increased the demand for ‘Orb,’ the device used for iris scanning and data capture. As a result, it is expected that Orb will become more widely available to meet the growing demand in the coming months. Additionally, various apps and services have recognized the value of the World ID program. This is also very positive for Worldcoin, as it helps it further expand its reach to a larger user base since the services are opening up the verification model to their dedicated users.</p>
<p>To register for the World ID program and obtain a digital passport, individuals need to obtain their unique identifier, the IrisHash, which confirms their uniqueness. Upon successfully uploading their biometric information, participants are rewarded with <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/worldcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WorldCoin</a> (cryptocurrency) for their involvement and contributions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/xrp-ripple-cto-warning-scams/">Ripple CTO Issues Warning against Potential XRP Scams</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ripple-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple</a>&#8216;s CTO David Schwartz has warned its community members about the rising number of potential <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP</a> scams.</p>
<p>With scammers and fraudsters looking to exploit the current market hype, several airdrops targeting inexperienced users have popped up. Schwartz said, &#8220;A lot of scammers are taking advantage of the recent good news to try to cheat and steal. There are no airdrops, giveaways, or special offers associated with this ruling.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Court Ruling Favours Ripple</h2>
<p>In a stunning turn of events, US District Judge Analisa Torres ruled on July 13 that XRP is not a security. It also stated that Ripple did not violate securities laws by selling the digital asset.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ripple-sec-lawsuit-xrp-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC&#8217;s lawsuit</a>, which was filed in December 2020, caused significant damage to XRP&#8217;s reputation and value. Since then, several exchanges have either delisted or suspended trading the token. However, on Thursday, Judge Torres dismissed the case, marking a major win for Ripple and the XRP community.</p>
<h2>XRP Price and Market Cap Jumps after Court Ruling</h2>
<p>Ripple CTO&#8217;s caution comes amid a surge in XRP price and market capitalization. XRP price soared by over 70% after the ruling, reaching a peak of $0.93, <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">according to TradingView</a>.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency also became the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, displacing Binance Coin (BNB) and USD Coin. According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CoinMarketCap</a>, XRP&#8217;s market cap jumped from $24.9 billion to $46.1 billion in one day. Again, the token’s trading volume spiked as investors rushed to buy the token amid the bullish news.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, US exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken and iTrustCapital also moved to relist the token on their respective platforms.</p>
<h2>Implications of the XRP Win for the Crypto Community</h2>
<p>Ripple’s victory over the SEC is not just a win for its community but for the larger industry. The case will now serve as a precedent for how regulators view and treat digital assets. Regarding this, the CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse said, “This is now a matter of law (not up for trial),” he wrote.</p>
<p>Many believe that the judge&#8217;s ruling could pave the way for more clarity and certainty for crypto projects and investors. Republican majority whip, Tom Emmer, <a href="https://twitter.com/GOPMajorityWhip" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">agrees</a> and has urged that the next step is to make it into law. He said that “the Ripple case is a monumental development in establishing that a token is separate and distinct from an investment contract it may or may not be part of. Now, let’s make it law.&#8221;</p>

<p>US Congressman Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) has called for two independent investigations into the US Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) actions, citing concerns over its handling of digital assets. In letters <a href="https://twitter.com/RepRitchie/status/1679534903661301761?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> on Twitter on June 13, Rep. Torres expressed dissatisfaction with the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;haphazard and heavy-handed approach&#8221; to regulating the crypto industry.</p>
<p>The two letters were addressed to the SEC&#8217;s Inspector General Deborah Jeffrey and the Comptroller General Gene Dodaro of the Government Accountability Office, respectively, seeking an objective assessment of the SEC&#8217;s enforcement actions and processes to ensure greater transparency and accountability within the federal regulatory body.</p>
<p>The first investigation requested by the congressman was focused on the SEC&#8217;s decision to grant a special purpose broker-dealer (SPBD) license to Prometheum, a crypto brokerage company that, according to Torres, does not engage in any trading of digital assets.</p>
<p>In March, the company <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230523005313/en/Prometheum-Ember-Capital-is-the-First-SEC-Qualified-Custodian-for-Digital-Assets-Securities" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> that it had received federal approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to legally offer digital asset services to residents of the United States. However, the license, or &#8220;sweetheart deal&#8221; as it was referred to, has stirred controversy within the crypto industry, with some arguing that it undermines the need for additional regulations. In contrast, others like Torres question the platform&#8217;s actual business activities.</p>
<h2>Prometheum&#8217;s License Approval Could be Politically Motivated</h2>
<p>Earlier this week, US senator Thomas Tuberville (R-Ala.) and five other congressional Republicans called for investigations into Prometheum&#8217;s ties to Chinese entities, alleging connections with the Chinese Communist Party. Similarly, the Blockchain Association, an industry trade group based in the US, also called for an investigation into the company.</p>
<p>Joining these groups, Torres has questioned the circumstances surrounding the issuance of the Prometheum&#8217;s license, suggesting that it may have been a politically motivated move by SEC Chair Gary Gensler rather than a genuine effort to incorporate digital assets into the existing regulatory framework.</p>
<p>The US congressman criticized Prometheum as a &#8220;deceptive digital asset platform&#8221; and compared it to Potemkin villages, which were elaborate facades created to deceive observers. He suggested that the company&#8217;s licensing reflects a trend of politicizing the registration process within the SEC, an approach rarely seen before.</p>
<h2>Overzealous Traffic Agent</h2>
<p>In his second letter, Rep. Torres requested an investigation into the financial regulator regarding its failure to establish a robust and practical registration process for companies offering crypto services.</p>
<p>He argued that the SEC&#8217;s current approach leads to uncertainty and inconsistency, likening the agency to an &#8220;overzealous traffic agent&#8221; who issues arbitrary speeding tickets without clearly defining the speed limit. Torres emphasized that regulation through enforcement is not an effective or reliable way to regulate the digital assets industry.</p>
<p>According to Torres, the financial watchdog has failed to provide clear guidelines regarding implementing securities laws in relation to digital assets.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SEC refuses to bring even the barest amount of clarity to applying securities law to digital assets. Its preferred means of communication is neither rule nor guidance but enforcement,&#8221; said the congressman.</p>
<p>The call for investigations comes during intense debate and legislative efforts to clarify the regulatory landscape for digital assets in Congress. The congressman has previously <a href="https://ritchietorres.house.gov/posts/u-s-rep-ritchie-torres-issues-statement-on-sec-enforcement-against-binance-and-founder-ceo-changpeng-zhao">commended</a> the SEC after it sued crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase within 24 hours for violations of US laws. According to him, the Commission finally took action after sitting on the sidelines.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/gemini-kraken-bitstamp-resume-xrp/" rel="prev">next</a></p>
