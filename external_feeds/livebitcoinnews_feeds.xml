										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many analysts believe the present wave <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/04/20/biggest-ever-crypto-cycle-has-already-quietly-begun-after-huge-bitcoin-and-ethereum-price-rally/?sh=2d64daf31b28" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">of price hikes and technical</a> upgrades recently enjoyed by leading digital currencies like bitcoin and Ethereum will lead to a huge surge in institutional crypto investing.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin and Ethereum May Be Boosting Institutional Confidence</h2>
<p>Not long ago, the price of bitcoin rose to a ten-month high <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-rose-to-30k-in-mid-april-analysts-discuss-why/" data-wpel-link="internal">and hit $30K for</a> the first time since last June. The world’s number one digital currency has been on the rise since the beginning of the year and has nearly doubled its price from the end of 2022 (during that time, it was trading in the mid-$16K range).</p>
<p>But bitcoin isn’t alone in its present ascension. The world’s number two digital currency and the primary competitor to bitcoin, Ethereum, has endured what’s known <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-ethereum-shapella-upgrade-occurred-now-what/" data-wpel-link="internal">as the Shapella upgrade</a>. This has opened the door to all kinds of staked ether withdrawals, which were not available prior to this point. As a result, Ethereum has entered a rather bullish path and recently struck $2K per unit for the first time in what feels like an eternity.</p>
<p>Analysts with a broker called Bernstein believe these elements – and others – will cause more institutional investors to enter the crypto arena. They believe these institutions will view crypto in a much more positive light and seek to add these assets to their portfolios as the prices are likely to gain further steam in the coming months and weeks. In a report, the analysts wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The opportunity to build a new institutional financial stack on the blockchain remains a worthy goal, and serious participants remain focused on the long term.</p></blockquote>
<p>For the longest time, the belief has been that if institutions can get involved in digital currency investing, the industry will take on a much more legitimate and mainstream appearance. However, it’s been troublesome getting them to hop on board as many of them do not see the space as valid or secure enough to warrant further attention.</p>
<p>While there have been occasional institutions out there (i.e., <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-microstrategy-bitcoin-bet-is-already-paying-off-big-time/" data-wpel-link="internal">MicroStrategy</a>, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/square-just-bought-a-whole-lot-of-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">Square</a>, etc.) that have shown interest in crypto, they are ultimately in the minority, and most of them prefer to play it safe with stocks, cash, and bonds.</p>
<h2>The Banking Failures Are Also Playing Roles</h2>
<p>But with <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/analysts-provide-their-thoughts-on-latest-bitcoin-rally/" data-wpel-link="internal">the recent banking failures</a> in the U.S. and Europe, the analysts are confident that institutions will begin to see assets like bitcoin as potential “safe havens” and start investing their money in the digital side of the financial spectrum. They commented in the report:</p>
<blockquote><p>Any potential dislocation, whether on the bank&#8217;s credit side or on the sovereign side… positions bitcoin perfectly as a safe-haven asset alongside gold.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite its recent bullish behavior, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/btc-falls-following-high-inflation-in-the-u-k/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin has taken a step back</a> at press time given there is sudden fear surrounding inflation in the U.K., as numbers were higher than expected.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two men broke into a home in Durham, North Carolina with <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/durham-couple-forced-to-wire-250k-of-cryptocurrency-at-gunpoint-during-home-invasion-police-investigating/ar-AA1a4Gh5" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">guns and forced the couple</a> living there to transfer hundreds of thousands of dollars in crypto to them. The men were armed handguns and allegedly used zip ties to restrain the pair.</p>
<h2>Durham Is the Focus in New Crypto Crime</h2>
<p>The man and the women were both around 76 years of age. They were forced into moving over $250,000 in digital currency funds to wallets controlled by the attackers. Police have issued arrest warrants for the men and say they are looking for their getaway vehicle, which is a BMW X5 built between 2021 and 2023.</p>
<p>The married pair sustained minor injuries and were taken to a local hospital after the ordeal was over. Durham Police Sergeant Jermaine Clark explained in a recent interview that crypto crime containing this level of violence is rare. Clark said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anytime we&#8217;re dealing with a home invasion, they&#8217;re inherently violent. You probably could count on a hand how many times recently there have been cases&#8230; of this magnitude involving cryptocurrency.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clark also mentioned that while bitcoin and crypto are difficult to track, it’s not impossible, and he expressed confidence that his police staff will be able to locate the stolen units and return them to their rightful owners. Clark said:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are investigative tools that can be utilized to assist in recuperating those assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Home invasions in the region of Durham are relatively rare, though they do happen on occasion, Clark further mentioned. Police investigator Christopher Walker said that the best way to avoid getting your home invaded is to refrain from opening the door to someone you don’t know. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>If somebody comes over to your house that you don&#8217;t know that&#8217;s coming unannounced, do your due diligence. Ask for information [or] IDs before you open any door to anybody that you don&#8217;t know.</p></blockquote>
<p>He further advised getting security systems or doorbell cameras installed to ensure you can always see who is near your property. Lastly, you should have solid relationships with all your neighbors and community members so they can keep an eye on your home for you when you’re not around and report anything suspicious.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the case is still ongoing. Police are asking for assistance from residents and requesting anyone with potential information to come forward and report it right away.</p>
<h2>This Is Rare&#8230;</h2>
<p>For the most part, crypto theft doesn’t occur through such physical or over-the-top means. Usually, attackers set their sights on wallets and exchanges and steal what they can, though scams (i.e., <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/romance-scams/" data-wpel-link="internal">romance scams</a>) have also become rather prominent over the last few years.</p>
<p>They’ll often take the form of fraudsters getting online victims to invest in digital currency platforms controlled by their criminal cronies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The European Parliament has approved some of <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/eu-parliament-approves-worlds-most-110912633.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">the most sweeping digital</a> currency regulations the continent has ever seen. A digital euro is also planned to go into effect at some point later in the year.</p>
<h2>European Regulators Are Getting Serious</h2>
<p>The goal is to prevent all crypto traders from ongoing abuse and manipulation. The rules stem from concerns arising from last November’s <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">FTX debacle</a>. As one of the leading digital currency exchanges in the world, the company came crashing down in a heaping pile of bankruptcy and fraud after it was alleged executives used customer funds to pay off loans for another company and buy luxury Bahamian real estate.</p>
<p>European Union (EU) commissioner for financial services Mairead McGuinness explained in a recent debate that the present rules Parliament is implementing would have likely prevented FTX from happening or could have at least minimized the damage done by those in charge had they been established earlier.</p>
<p>She emphasized the importance of ongoing digital currency regulation in her interview by saying that the present rules system requires that all wallet providers (including exchanges) will be required to take measures to ensure all digital currency assets held within their systems remain protected. She also said that those that fail will endure harsh penalties. She commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe that had FTX, for example, been captured under EU jurisdiction, many of its practices would not have been permissible under MiCA.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, the rules are set to bring a certain level of eco-friendly protocols to the present arena. She said that all crypto companies and large providers must provide information on how they’re planning to reduce energy use, carbon emissions, and overall pollution. Lastly, the present regulations will make crypto mirror some of the aspects of traditional finance.</p>
<p>All this, the European Union feels, will make it much harder for cyberthieves to make off with digital assets. Ernest Urtasun – one of the EU lawmakers pushing the regulations forward – said that these regulations bring an end to the “Wild West” status the crypto industry has been holding over the past several years. Urtasun said:</p>
<blockquote><p>For over a decade, the lack of regulation has resulted in massive losses to many first-time investors and provided a safe haven for fraudsters and international criminal networks.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Not Everyone&#8217;s Happy</h2>
<p>Despite being considered a solid step forward, some – like Elizabeth McCaul, a European Central Bank supervisor board member – don’t think they’re going far enough and were critical of the regulations. McCaul said:</p>
<blockquote><p>In line with the principle of proportionality, significant CASPs should be subject to both stricter requirements and enhanced supervision. Neither of the two is catered for by MiCA… What we believe is that having a regulatory framework allows the industry to evolve in a more cohesive and safer environment.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Cardano price is rising above $0.380 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-eyes-another-increase-to-30k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. ADA price could rally if there is a clear move above the $0.385 resistance.</em></p>
<h2>Cardano Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This week, Cardano price started a steady increase above the $0.362 resistance zone against the US Dollar. The ADA/USD pair gained pace for a move above the $0.370 and $0.375 levels.</p>
<p>Besides, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $0.3700 on the 4-hours chart. The bulls were able to pump the price above the $0.380 resistance. However, the bears appeared near $0.385. A high is formed near $0.3864 and the price saw a downside correction.</p>
<p>There was a minor drop in Cardano below $0.382. The price spiked below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.3537 swing low to the $0.3864 high.</p>
<p>ADA price is still trading above $0.375 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cardano-ada-price-analysis-bulls-aim-fresh-increase-above-0-38/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. It is also showing positive signs above the $0.380 level. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.3850 zone. The next major resistance is near the $0.3880 zone.</p>
<p>A clear move above the $0.3880 resistance might start a strong increase toward $0.400. Any more gains above the $0.400 resistance might send the price toward the $0.420 resistance or even $0.432.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support is near the $0.378 level. The next major support is near the $0.370 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.3537 swing low to the $0.3864 high. A clear move below the $0.370 level might send the price toward the $0.360 level. Any more losses might send the price toward the $0.350 support.</p>

<p>Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $1,920 level. The next major resistance is near the $2,000 zone. A clear move above the $2,000 level could send the price toward $2,140. Any more gains could even send the price toward the $2,220 resistance zone or $2,280 in the near term.</p>
<p>On the downside, initial support is near the $1,880 level. The next major support is now near the $1,850 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,759 swing low to the $1,928 high. A break below the $1,850 support could push the price to $1,800. Any more losses could lead the price towards $1,750.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong is looking <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/hong-kong-high-court-recognizes-cryptocurrency-as-property-for-the-first-time/ar-AA1a3o6K" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">to implement digital currency</a> regulations. It recently took its first step in doing so by deciding (and taking a page out of the U.S. taxation book) that all crypto will be taxed as property and not money.</p>
<h2>Hong Kong Changes Its Thoughts on Crypto</h2>
<p>This is very similar to how crypto is taxed in the United States. Organizations like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) do not look at crypto transactions as exchanges of money. Rather, they are exchanges of property, meaning selling crypto ultimately subjects the person to capital gains taxes or capital losses depending on if they sell their assets higher or lower than when they first purchased or received them.</p>
<p>This is somewhat of a problem because Hong Kong, like the U.S., is refusing to see digital currency for what it is: legitimate and actual money. What many people likely forget is that while bitcoin and many of its crypto cousins have taken on either speculative or even hedge-like statuses in recent years, many of them were initially designed to serve as payment tools. They were built to push checks, credit cards, and fiat currencies to the side, but this has been a relatively slow journey given the volatility that continues to drag them down.</p>
<p>Despite this volatility, however, crypto was – and always has been – designed to serve as money, so the idea that a region as advanced and as forward-thinking as Hong Kong refuses to take such initiative is disappointing to say the least.</p>
<p>Still, some analysts are viewing this maneuver as a solid step forward given Hong Kong served as the home of <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/gatecoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">Gatecoin Limited</a>, a crypto exchange that ultimately fell apart roughly four years after it was first introduced to the world in 2015.</p>
<p>The collapse of the digital currency platform and the subsequent legal matters it was involved in are what are ultimately considered to have contributed to the prevention of Hong Kong even recognizing crypto either as money or property, and many fans are lauding regulators for at least being able to step beyond their initial biases.</p>
<h2>FTX Boosted Regulatory Calls</h2>
<p>The calls for crypto regulation have been increasing over the past six months following the collapse of digital currency <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">platform FTX</a>. The company – which first rose to fame in the year 2019 – became one of the top five crypto exchanges within three years and its founder and chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried was considered a genius by many, but that reputation didn’t last long.</p>
<p>SBF is presently awaiting trial at his parents’ <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-to-await-trial-at-his-parents-house/" data-wpel-link="internal">house in Northern California</a>. It is believed that he used customer funds to potentially invest in luxury Bahamian real estate. It is also thought that he used the money to pay off loans taken out by his other company Alameda Research.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Digital currency company My Crypto Merchant has <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/23/04/31881307/my-crypto-merchant-launches-cryptocurrency-payment-processing-platform-for-smes" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">announced the launch of</a> new software designed to help both small and medium-sized businesses integrate crypto payments into their networks. The goal is to help these enterprises accept digital currency payments for goods and services from their clients.</p>
<h2>My Crypto Merchant Will Help Small Businesses Accept Crypto</h2>
<p>The move is pushing the goals of bitcoin and its digital counterparts closer to being achieved. What many people likely forget is that while bitcoin and many of its crypto cousins have taken on either speculative or even hedge-like statuses in recent years, many of them were initially designed to serve as payment tools. They were built to push checks, credit cards, and fiat currencies to the side, but this has been a relatively slow journey given the volatility that continues to drag them down.</p>
<p>It is extremely hard to understand when <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a> and its crypto family will go up or down when it comes to their prices. Many stores and companies have been reluctant to say “yes” when it comes to accepting crypto payments for this reason, and to a degree, we can’t blame them.</p>
<p>Consider the following scenario: someone walks into a store and buys $50 worth of merchandise with bitcoin. For one reason or another, the store doesn’t trade the BTC into fiat right away and about 24 hours go by. From there, the price of BTC goes down and that $50 becomes $40. The customer gets to keep everything he or she bought, but the store loses money in the end. Is this a fair situation? Not everyone thinks so.</p>
<p>That’s what makes enterprises like My Crypto Merchant so important. They understand the initial purposes of bitcoin and digital currencies and are trying to transform them into usable tools that everyday people can benefit from.</p>
<p>Bryant Harper – co-founder of My Crypto Merchant – expressed his enthusiasm in an interview and commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are excited to launch our innovative crypto services which will be a game-changer for small businesses, enabling them to accept digital payments securely and compliantly. Our user-friendly platform will help businesses seamlessly process crypto transactions, while our focus on financial inclusion will benefit SMEs across the retail industries. Our mission is to enable every business, merchant, gig worker, vendor, and contractor to receive payment in the cryptocurrency of their choice directly from their customer with no middleman, no fees, and no limits.</p></blockquote>
<h2>No Fees for Merchants!</h2>
<p>The company is built to provide direct customer-to-merchant payments with zero (you read that right) fees for the merchant. Transaction volumes are also designed to be unlimited, meaning there can be no halting in how many crypto payments a company can accept or initiate.</p>
<p>My Crypto Merchant also believes that digital currency payments can limit financial fraud and money laundering.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The prices of bitcoin, several crypto stocks, and other leading altcoins have fallen somewhat at the time of writing following fears surrounding <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/panic-in-crypto-land-bitcoin-dives-ether-sinks-altcoins-crumble-%E2%80%94-4-experts-on-the-path-ahead-1032244044" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">higher-than-expected</a> inflation figures stemming from the United Kingdom.</p>
<h2>Inflation was Much Higher Than Expected in the U.K.</h2>
<p>Inflation in the U.S. and for all its allies has been a serious problem over the past two years. There were several antics taken during the days of the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/coronavirus/" data-wpel-link="internal">COVID pandemic</a>, one of which was constantly printing new money as a means of giving people the funds they needed to survive and make it out alive at the end of the day. This caused the values of the U.S. dollar and the U.K. pound to dip heavily.</p>
<p>However, there has also been a wide array of simplistic (and dumb) economic plans put in place by the likes of incompetent leaders such as Janet Yellen and Joe Biden, which have ultimately caused the problems surrounding inflation to expand well into 2022 and 2023.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO of Mudrex Edul Patel commented that U.K. inflation has grown by more than ten percent in just the last 12 months. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>As is typical with unexpected events, the market responded with a reaction, causing investors to move away from the riskier assets. It may take some time for investors and traders to evaluate the potential impact of the inflation data and recover from the event.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ilya Volkov – CEO and co-founder of You Hodler – says that despite the recent dips in its price, bitcoin is still in an “upward trend channel” given that roughly one-fifth of the world&#8217;s total bitcoin supply stays holed up by long-term holders that refuse to keep it on exchanges and similar platforms. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the last few days, the crypto market has experienced relatively high volatility while many on-chain indicators are surprisingly consistent and tell us about the potential of further growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the slips for crypto are <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-and-ether-fall-as-investors-weigh-persistent-inflation-and-rising-interest-rates/ar-AA1a2Z98" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">still relatively disappointing</a> in many ways given BTC recently hit a new ten-month high by <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-rose-to-30k-in-mid-april-analysts-discuss-why/" data-wpel-link="internal">striking the $30K</a> mark. In addition, Ethereum also shot beyond the $2,000 price mark after it went through the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-ethereum-shapella-upgrade-occurred-now-what/" data-wpel-link="internal">recent Shapella upgrade</a>. Joel Kruger – market strategist at LMAX Group – said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe the pullback we&#8217;re seeing is more a function of an overdue correction following some impressive moves and possible profit taking on broader risk-off flow in global markets than anything crypto specific.</p></blockquote>
<h2>More Rate Hikes Coming?</h2>
<p>Kruger also commented that there’s likely to be further rate hikes in the U.S. and other countries given inflation remains a pressing problem. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>There have been some signs the Fed could be more aggressive towards higher interest rate policy than what the market is pricing, which has been driving yield differentials in the U.S. dollar&#8217;s favor, while weighing on sentiment.</p></blockquote>

XLM price must clear $0.090 to start a major increase.</em></p>
<h2>Stellar Lumen Price Analysis (XLM to USD)</h2>
<p>This past week, Stellar lumen price saw a bearish reaction from the $0.0900 zone against the US Dollar. The XLM/USD pair traded below the $0.0850 support and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>The bears were able to push the price below the $0.0832 level. A low was formed near $0.0827 and the price is now attempting a fresh increase. It was able to rise back above the $0.0850 resistance. The price is now testing the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.0948 swing high to the $0.0827 low.</p>
<p>XLM is now trading above $0.0850 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/stellar-lumen-xlm-price-could-nosedive-below-0-087/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>.

<p>There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.0888 on the 4-hour chart. The next major resistance is near the $0.0900 level. It is near the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.0948 swing high to the $0.0827 low.</p>

<p>Initial support on the downside is near the $0.0880 level. The main support is near the $0.0850 zone. Any more losses could lead the price towards the $0.0825 level in the near term, below which the price might even retest $0.080.</p>
