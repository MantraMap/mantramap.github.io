<p>Introducing Grove
The energy consumption and electronic waste generated by traditional cryptocurrency mining methods has wide-reaching environmental consequences. As the world looks for greener solutions to tackle climate change, the public perception of cryptocurrency hampers its massive, untapped potential to be a driving force for positive change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grove is a project that aims to reverse that negative view with its Grove Green Plan and help crypto realize its latent potential. It is the guiding outline for the hybrid 'green crypto' blockchain ecosystem and a planet-friendly investment business built to pursue the mission of a healthier and wealthier future for all.</p>
<p>The ecosystem of Grove consists of 3 major components, one of which is GroveKeeper, the digital asset wallet providing an easy-to-use and secure method for investors to obtain and hold their cryptocurrencies and NFTs. With multiple layers of insurance and access to a DApps browser to facilitate buying, selling and swapping of coins and tokens as well as staking and farming for passive income generation, GroveKeeper will be a platform that maximizes usability while utilizing cutting-edge cybersecurity methodologies to protect users.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also GroveSwap, the decentralized exchange (DEX) utility of Grove. Users can buy, sell, swap and trade various cryptocurrencies across three blockchains with as-low-as-feasible network fees on each transaction. Investors are guaranteed a fast, reliable and safe experience as any project successfully listed on GroveSwap must be audited, interviewed and provide documentation regarding operational wallets and the deliverability of their project aims and utilities.</p>
<p>In addition to GroveSwap, the centralized exchange (CEX) GroveX is another capstone of Grove&rsquo;s crypto-industry utilities. As a robust, easy-to-use exchange for first-time investors or seasoned industry veterans, GroveX will be available online through mobile apps and support tokenomics for listed projects. This makes it more attractive to list on for developers and far more rewarding for the communities that support projects to engage with.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;GreenOasis&rsquo; program within GroveX is a unique support platform for Grove&rsquo;s fellow &lsquo;green crypto&rsquo; projects, offering support and partnership incentives that would help eco-friendly but potentially very niche projects receive awareness and attention in the broader market by leveraging the brand name power of Grove.</p>
<p>With a team of professionals and entrepreneurs, known to be the best in the field, Grove strives to create wealth, for all Grovers, by harnessing the opportunities of a secure, decentralized digital currency in an environmentally conscious way. By compensating nature for years of abuse, Grove will create a healthier, wealthier future for all.</p>
