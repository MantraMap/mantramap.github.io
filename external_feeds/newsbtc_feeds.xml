One particular whale turned $27 into more than $4M. Yet, according to the cryptocurrency community, the owner do the related wallet might never be able to cash in on those gains. “Blacklisted” Pepe Wallet Left A Sad Frog The meme coin based on Pepe the Frog has everyone who bought in earlier today, feeling good.

					<description><![CDATA[The number of daily Bitcoin (BTC) transactions on the blockchain has risen, reaching an all-time high of 682,000 on May 1st. Rafael Schultze-Kraft, one of the founders of Glassnode, has suggested that this increase in transaction volume is likely due to a combination of factors.  Related Reading: US Regional Bank Failures Trigger Bitcoin Surge, $30,000 Level In Sight Bitcoin Transactions Skyrocket Rafael argues that one key driver is the growing adoption of Bitcoin by institutional investors and large corporations. As more companies begin to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets and offer it as a payment option, the demand for Bitcoin transactions has more potential to increase. Another factor contributing to the rise in Bitcoin transactions is the growing popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. These applications, built on top of blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin, allow users to borrow, lend, and trade cryptocurrencies in a decentralized manner.  Furthermore,  Schultze-Kraft notes that the recent surge in Bitcoin transactions could be a sign of increased interest and activity in the cryptocurrency space more broadly. As more people become aware of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In addition, according to Schultze-Kraft, the current surge in transaction counts is noteworthy because it is more than double the baseline established in 2022, which had been relatively stable at around 250,000 transactions per day, as seen in the chart above.  A notable increase in the use of Taproot transactions has accompanied the recent surge. According to data from Glassnode, Taproot transactions accounted for 37.5% of spent outputs on April 30th, and on May 1st, a record-breaking 60% of all Bitcoin transactions used Taproot. So, what is Taproot, and why is its adoption increasing? Taproot is a proposed upgrade to the Bitcoin network designed to improve privacy and efficiency. It achieves this by combining multiple BTC script paths into a single output that can be spent using a single signature. This makes transactions smaller and cheaper, which can help to reduce congestion on the network and lower fees.  Taproot was first proposed in 2018, but it has taken some time for the Bitcoin community to reach a consensus on its implementation. However, with the recent activation of Taproot looking increasingly likely, more users and businesses are starting to adopt the technology. Furthermore, the recent surge in Taproot transactions in the Bitcoin network can be attributed to the heavy increase in text inscriptions, according to Rafael Schultze-Kraft. More than 50% of all transactions on the Bitcoin network have been associated with text inscriptions. When separating transactions related to text inscriptions from all other Bitcoin transactions, it becomes clear that they are the sole driver for the recent increase in BTC activity, surpassing the total number of all other transactions for a brief time. The data from Glassnode shows that text inscriptions are far more popular than others on the Bitcoin network, including images, videos, and audio. While there are some uses for these other types of inscriptions, such as embedding a digital signature or proof of ownership, text inscriptions seem the most versatile and widely used. As the Bitcoin network continues to evolve and adapt to changing user needs, there will likely be more innovations and upgrades that will further enhance its functionality and usability. Whether through text inscriptions or other technologies, it is clear that BTC is becoming more than just a financial instrument but also a powerful tool for communication and expression.

<p>The data from Glassnode shows that text inscriptions are far more popular than others on the Bitcoin network, including images, videos, and audio. While there are some uses for these other types of inscriptions, such as embedding a digital signature or proof of ownership, text inscriptions seem the most versatile and widely used.</p>
<p>As the Bitcoin network continues to evolve and adapt to changing user needs, there will likely be more innovations and upgrades that will further enhance its functionality and usability. Whether through text inscriptions or other technologies, it is clear that BTC is becoming more than just a financial instrument but also a powerful tool for communication and expression.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In a new development, a pro-XRP attorney has shared some startling information that could point toward victory for Ripple in its ongoing securities battle against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This ruling in another case that was similar to what Ripple is currently fighting with the SEC shows there could be a positive outcome for the crypto firm after all of this. A Case Similar To Ripple Gets Good Judgement Attorney Jeremy Hogan took to Twitter to share a previous ruling by Judge Analisa Torres in another case involving a crypto mining company Rio Tinto and the SEC. In the cutout of the ruling posted by Hogan, it shows that the judge previously ruled that there was no liability on the part of Rio Tinto when “the sole basis for such claims is alleged misrepresentations or omissions,” something that is also present in the Ripple case.

The crypto company emerged victorious in this case, as the judge did not see any evidence of scheme liability, saying that Rio Tinto only “failed to prevent misleading statements from being disseminated by others.” I was just reminded of a case in which Judge Torres ruled against the SEC on a key issue, the SEC appealed, and the appellate court upheld Judge Torres.

SEC case and such a judgment on a previously similar case could also translate to a similar judgment for Ripple. If so, then this is a positive for the company. What A Victory Would Mean For XRP The Ripple v. SEC case has dragged on for a couple of years now which has negatively impacted the price of XRP. In 2020 when the bull market was starting to roll around, Ripple was hit with a lawsuit that saw XRP’s price crash over 50%, and while other cryptocurrencies in the space went on to see new all-time highs in the next year, XRP suffered tremendously. Even now, the token is yet to reach its full potential but a Ripple victory would turn the tide on this. An example of what kind of impact such a victory would have on the price was back in Q1 2023 when CEO Brad Garlinghouse said he expected the case to come to a close in the first half of 2023. XRP price struggles at $0.46 &#124; Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com The price of XRP soared on this news and reached as high as $0.55 before correcting back downwards. However, it worked to show what such news could do to the price. It is entirely possible that a Ripple victory would push the digital asset to a new all-time high. Related Reading: Is Meme Coin Season Back? Here’s What The Numbers Say As for if the SEC would take such a judgment lying down, Hogan responded to a Twitter user that he does not think the SEC would appeal. Furthermore, he cited two other lawyers who are familiar with the case who also believe that the SEC would not appeal if Judge Torres were to rule in favor of Ripple. However, all of this remains to be seen. At the time of writing, XRP’s price seems to be moving in tandem with the general market trend. It is trading at a price of $0.46, with a minor 0.43% increase on the 7-day chart.

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum transaction fees are once again hitting highs last seen since May 2022. This development has raised concerns about the impact on the Ethereum network usage and its native cryptocurrency, ETH. Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market capitalization, is one of the leading decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) platforms. The network has been experiencing a surge in activity due to the increasing popularity of memecoins such as PEPE, which has caused fees to spike. Rising Transaction Fees: A Cause For Concern On May 2, the median average transaction fee on the Ethereum network soared to around 87 gwei, according to Dune Analytics. This spike was mainly attributed to the increased on-chain activity surrounding memecoin trading, according to Hildobby, a pseudonymous data researcher at VC firm Dragonfly. Memecoins such as Pepe the Frog-themed token have been enjoying a renaissance recently, with the token price soaring over 266 times in just four days in April. The memecoin&#8217;s market cap rose to over $500 million this week before crashing below $400 million again. Related Reading: Meme Coin PEPE Hits New All-Time High As Shorts Get Rekt While this surge in activity may indicate increasing interest in the crypto market, it also highlights concerns about the network&#8217;s scalability and the impact of rising fees on users. High transaction fees can deter users from interacting with decentralized applications on the Ethereum network; as the fees increase, smaller users are priced out of the platform and its applications.  Notably, the rise in memecoin trading activity, which increased the number of transactions on the Ethereum network, leading to a surge in fees, has also made decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Ethereum experience the highest level of users since 2021.  Dune Analytics data shows that Ethereum-based DEXs saw a surge in volume, with the total trading volume on these platforms surpassing $63 billion in April alone. This represents a significant increase from March, when the total trading volume was around $31 billion. What This Means For ETH It is worth noting that the rising transaction fees on the Ethereum network are seen as a disadvantage to the value of ETH, as users may seek alternative blockchains with lower transaction costs. An instance of this is the increasing interest in other L1 blockchains such as Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Fantom (FTM), and so on. However, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently suggested that the network could quickly scale up to 100,000 transactions per second. This could help alleviate network scalability concerns and reduce transaction fees. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Just Reversed And Signals Fresh Run To $2,000 Regardless, the increased activity may be a positive sign of growing interest in the crypto market; but it has an expensive price tagged. The rise in fees could discourage smaller transactions and lead to a decline in demand for ETH.  Wwith Ethereum&#8217;s scalability improvements in the pipeline, it remains to be seen how the network will evolve in the coming months. Meanwhile, ETH price has declined 0.4% after a potential surge to trade above $2,000, last month. ETH currently trades for $1.872 at the time of writing. ETH has a 24-low of $1,855 and a 24-high of $1,919, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Regardless of the market decline, the asset’s trading volume has only ranged between $8 billion and $9 billion in the past two weeks.

					<description><![CDATA[The total market capitalization for the memecoin sector reached $19 billion in the past weeks; the launch of PEPE, WOJAK, and others have attracted new participants to the market. As a result, these assets have experienced a massive surge in value and trading volume. Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Under Sell Pressure As Bears Retaliate Over the last 24 hours, memecoin PEPE saw a 53% profit while WOJAK, AIDOGE, have experienced rallies of over 20%. Over the past week, PEPE alone saw a 629% profit while WOJAK recorded a 972% profit increasing the euphoria around these assets. Memecoin Fever Triggers Euphoria The increase in the price of the memecoin sector has seen traders betting a large portion of their capital in the hopes of turning into millionaires overnight. Some achieved this goal by investing as little as $20 before the memecoin explosion. $27 $pepe wallet update: Now worth $4,240,471.20 pic.twitter.com/jsA4BIRSms &#8212; borovik.eth (@3orovik) May 4, 2023 One investor put $27 into PEPE and turned the capital into over $4 million in a few weeks as the token entered price discovery. Crypto is no stranger to these stories, but new data from Coingecko is trying to shine a bigger light on this phenomenon. The analysis team behind Coingecko attempted to reply to the following question: How much money do you need to be a Meme Coin Millionaire? On average, and taking into consideration the current trending coins (PEPE, BONK, AIDOGE), and the classic memecoins (DOGE, SHIB, Baby Doge), the study concluded: An investor would have needed $66,298.25 on average to become a meme coin millionaire, according to an analysis of 10 meme coin price returns. To reach $1 million in meme coin holdings, the minimum initial investment that is needed ranges from $11.87 for Shiba Inu, to $190,585.57 for ArbDoge AI (AIDOGE). As seen in the chart below, AIDOGE, WOJAK, and PEPE, needed the highest initial capital to reach millionaire status. As seen in the chart below, ArbDoge AI (AIDOGE) required a $190,000 investment if buying them in 2023, while classical Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) needed $820 if buying in 2022 and 2013, respectively. How To Find The Next PEPE, WOJAK, AIDOGE? As these assets become mainstream, it is harder for early investors to see a higher investment return. As the chart shows, earlier investors in classical memecoins needed much less capital to reach millionaire status but much more time. In order to achieve millionaire status, an early Dogecoin investor needed 2,701 days or 7 years, while a Bonk investor needed but a week. Thus, there is an inverse correlation between initial capital and the take it would take investors to become a millionaire with these assets. Coingecko concluded: For the 2023 meme coins in particular, it is likely that Pepe, ArbDoge AI, Wojak and Ignore Fud will subsequently surpass their current all-time highs. Although they might take longer to reach higher prices, it also means that a lower initial investment is needed to become that meme coin’s millionaire. In the crypto industry, trends, and sectors can lose popularity and gain overnight. In that sense, finding the “next big thing” is challenging.

However, Coingecko recommends that users leverage decentralized exchange (DEX) trackers to monitor the tokens experiencing a surge in their trading volume/price. These assets are the most likely to see an uptick in their market cap and popularity, hinting at a potential bull run.]]></description>

<blockquote><p>An investor would have needed $66,298.25 on average to become a meme coin millionaire, according to an analysis of 10 meme coin price returns. To reach $1 million in meme coin holdings, the minimum initial investment that is needed ranges from $11.87 for Shiba Inu, to $190,585.57 for ArbDoge AI (AIDOGE).</p></blockquote>
<p>As seen in the chart below, AIDOGE, WOJAK, and PEPE, needed the highest initial capital to reach millionaire status. As seen in the chart below, ArbDoge AI (AIDOGE) required a $190,000 investment if buying them in 2023, while classical Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) needed $820 if buying in 2022 and 2013, respectively.</p>

How To Find The Next PEPE, WOJAK, AIDOGE?
<p>As these assets become mainstream, it is harder for early investors to see a higher investment return. As the chart shows, earlier investors in classical memecoins needed much less capital to reach millionaire status but much more time.</p>
<p>In order to achieve millionaire status, an early Dogecoin investor needed 2,701 days or 7 years, while a Bonk investor needed but a week. Thus, there is an inverse correlation between initial capital and the take it would take investors to become a millionaire with these assets. Coingecko concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the 2023 meme coins in particular, it is likely that Pepe, ArbDoge AI, Wojak and Ignore Fud will subsequently surpass their current all-time highs. Although they might take longer to reach higher prices, it also means that a lower initial investment is needed to become that meme coin’s millionaire.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the crypto industry, trends, and sectors can lose popularity and gain overnight. In that sense, finding the “next big thing” is challenging.</p>

<p>However, Coingecko recommends that users leverage <a href="https://www.geckoterminal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">decentralized exchange (DEX) trackers</a> to monitor the tokens experiencing a surge in their trading volume/price. These assets are the most likely to see an uptick in their market cap and popularity, hinting at a potential bull run.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data from Glassnode shows the largest Bitcoin whales have been showing the opposite behavior to what other investors have been doing. Bitcoin Market Is Observing A Moderate Distribution Phase Currently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the behavior of the largest BTC whales has once again deviated from the rest of the market. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;Trend Accumulation Score,&#8221; which tells us whether Bitcoin investors are buying or selling. There are mainly two factors that the metric accounts for to find this score: the balance changes taking place in the holders&#8217; wallets and the size of the investors making such changes. This means that the larger the investor making a buying or selling move, the larger their weightage in the Trend Accumulation Score. When the value of this metric is close to 1, it means that the larger holders in the sector are accumulating right now (or a huge number of small investors are displaying this behavior). On the other hand, the indicator has a value near the zero mark suggesting the investors are currently displaying a distribution trend. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin And Crypto Up Today? This indicator is generally defined for the entire market but can also be used on specific investor segments. In the below chart, Glassnode has displayed the data for the Bitcoin Trend Accumulation Score of the various holder groups in the market. The value of the metric seems to be red for most of the market right now &#124; Source: Glassnode on Twitter Here, the investors in the market have been divided into six different cohorts based on the amount of BTC that they are carrying in their wallets: under 1 BTC, 1 to 10 BTC, 10 to 100 BTC, 100 to 1,000 BTC, 1,000 to 10,000 BTC, and above 10,000 BTC. From the above graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Trend Accumulation Score for all these groups had a value of about 1 at the bear market lows following the November 2022 FTX crash, suggesting that the market as a whole was participating in some heavy buying back then. This accumulation continued until the rally arrived in January 2023, when the market behavior started shifting. The holders began distributing during this period, selling especially heavily between February and March. Following this sharp distribution, the rally lost steam, and the price plunged below $20,000. However, these investors once again started to accumulate as the price sharply recovered and the rally restarted. Though, this time, the accumulation was only moderate. Interestingly, while the behavior in the market had been more or less uniform in the months leading up to this new accumulation streak (meaning that all the groups had been buying or selling at the same time), this new accumulation streak didn&#8217;t have the largest of the whales (above 10,000 BTC group) participating. Instead, these humongous investors were going through a phase of distribution. Related Reading: Bitcoin Up After Fed Rate Reveal, Correlation With Stocks Over? Since Bitcoin broke above the $30,000 level in the middle of April 2023, the investors have again been selling, showing moderate distribution behavior. Like the accumulation phase preceding this selling, the above 10,000 BTC whales haven&#8217;t joined in with the rest of the market; they have rather been aggressively accumulating and expanding their wallets. These holders seem to have decided to move in the opposite direction of the general market. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $28,900, up 1% in the last week.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) is on the verge of reaching the $30,000 milestone, but regional banks in the United States face significant anxiety and fear. Investors are concerned about the potential for contagion following the recent struggles of PacWest, a California-based lender. The bank&#8217;s shares have plummeted by as much as 60% overnight, causing it to reassure investors and confirm that it is in talks with potential partners and investors about a deal, as reported by The Telegraph. Despite insisting that it has not experienced any unusual deposit flows, regional bank stocks are down by more than 5% today, with not one of the 349 banks in the sector seeing gains. Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Under Sell Pressure As Bears Retaliate Regional Banks Take A Hit, 130 Stocks Down Over 5% The fears surrounding regional banks are undoubtedly fueled by the recent failure and sale of First Republic Bank to JPMorgan Chase. This high-profile event has highlighted the potential risks and challenges facing smaller banks, particularly in the current economic climate. Despite the broader concerns in the financial sector, Bitcoin has climbed above the $29,000 level, up by 1.7% in the last 24 hours, potentially fueled by the ongoing concerns surrounding the US banks.  This suggests that there may be some investors who are turning to alternative assets as a potential hedge against the risks and uncertainties in traditional financial markets, which have shown no signs of relief for the short term.  Furthermore, according to CryptoCon, a Bitcoin market analyst, the accurate BTC bull market is here. This is based on the mid-line crossover of the 3 Week Keltner Channels, a technical indicator measuring volatility and trend in Bitcoin. When BTC crosses over the mid-line, currently priced at $26,500, it is a strong signal that a bull market has begun. Additionally, CryptoCon notes that historically, Bitcoin has not returned under the mid-line after crossing, supporting the argument that a bull market is underway. According to the analyst, this has been true, as the crossover has consistently brought months of bull market activity. Bitcoin On The Rise As US Bank Failures Mount Daan Crypto Trades, a cryptocurrency market analyst, has analyzed Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance and potential impact in the broader cryptocurrency market. According to the analyst, Bitcoin dominance, which measures the percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization made up of Bitcoin, is currently trading at its range highs at the 48-49% area. Daan suggests that if Bitcoin can push through this range and make new local highs, it could move toward 52% or higher. This likely leads to continuing the ongoing trend of Bitcoin dominance, which has increased in recent months. However, the analyst notes that if Bitcoin remains range-bound between $27-30K, it could lead to a recovery in ALT/BTC pairs, seeing Bitcoin dominance come down. This would suggest that altcoins, or alternative cryptocurrencies to Bitcoin, could outperform Bitcoin in the short term. Related Reading: Coinbase And Ripple CLOs Meet, Will XRP Listing Follow? When writing, the top cryptocurrency in the market is trading at $29,000. In the past 24 hours, there has been a total liquidation of $100 million in short positions. The question is whether Bitcoin will continue its upward trend or experience a healthy pullback to fill in the liquidity below its crucial resistance levels.

					<description><![CDATA[Yesterday marked a new dawn in the crypto industry as the SUI Layer 1 blockchain launched on Mainnet with its hyped native token SUI. The news of the token launch on major exchanges brought excitement to the crypto community, and SUI did not disappoint as its native token rallied massively, recording over 2,000% in the first hour of listing. The layer 1 blockchain token was seen to hit the $2.16 mark at the time of its launch and listing on exchanges before it retraced due to selloffs. However, while crypto investors have been drawn to the opportunities and price potential a layer 1 blockchain token can offer, SUI has temporarily failed to continue its price rally on day 2 of its listing. Bears have sent a welcome message. SUI Token Price Falls Short On Day 2 The Sui layer 1 blockchain token has experienced a price decline in today&#8217;s trading session after a significant rally that followed its launch and listing yesterday on major exchanges. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Price Shows Vigor, Are Bulls Up To Something? According to trading data reports from Coingecko, the native token, which trades at $1.33 at the time of writing, is on a negative 38.46% from its 24-hour all-time high of $2.16. Bears are seen to take over in today&#8217;s trading session as the token struggles to hold the price on its red candle on the daily timeframe. Why Is The Ethereum Killer Falling In Price The recent price decline of the layer 1 blockchain token may be attributed to selloffs from holders and traders who took part in the SUI recognition sale. Weeks earlier, before the mainnet and token launch, SUI had announced a community access program to enable its community members to receive its native tokens in the &#8220;early phases of the network&#8217;s life.&#8221; Instead of carrying out airdrops as rewards, the SUI Foundation proposed a recognition sale for its user champions and network supporters. Community members and users eligible for the recognition sale were reported to have met specific requirements as stated by the foundation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rips Above $29,000, But Why Is The Mean Transaction Size At A 3-Year Low? Eligible community members were required to register on a participating exchange, which would then notify them via email on how to purchase the allocated SUI tokens. Bybit, a participating crypto exchange for the recognition sale, made available 1,500 SUI tokens at a unit price of $0.03 for each eligible user purchase. At this price, each eligible user purchased and received allocations of 1,500 SUI tokens at a total price of $45 before the public listing on May 3, 2023.SUI, upon launch, rallied massively, and at a high of $2, crypto traders who participated in the recognition sale made around $3,000 from their $45 investments. As it is with airdrops and community recognition sales, the price of the reward token is subject to temporary retracements and price dumps due to selloffs and users cashing out their rewards. While SUI may experience selling pressure, it is important to note that the hype surrounding it is very much active as some call it the Ethereum killer and, as such, may recover in price. Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements also have a major role and effect on the price direction of many altcoins, including SUI, and may dictate if selling pressure continues.   BTC Price dips after testing resistance at $29,200, dragging some alts with it &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com &#160; Featured image from Coingo, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

<p>The recent price decline of the layer 1 blockchain token may be attributed to selloffs from holders and traders who took part in the SUI recognition sale. Weeks earlier, before the mainnet and token launch, SUI had <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://sui.io/community-access-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> a community access program to enable its community members to receive its native tokens in the &#8220;early phases of the network&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of carrying out airdrops as rewards, the SUI Foundation proposed a recognition sale for its user champions and network supporters. Community members and users eligible for the recognition sale were reported to have met specific <a href="https://sui.io/community-access-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">requirements</a> as stated by the foundation.</p>

<p>Eligible community members were required to register on a participating exchange, which would then notify them via email on how to purchase the allocated SUI tokens. Bybit, a participating crypto exchange for the recognition sale, made available 1,500 SUI tokens at a unit price of $0.03 for each eligible user purchase.</p>
<p>At this price, each eligible user purchased and received allocations of 1,500 SUI tokens at a total price of $45 before the public listing on May 3, 2023.SUI, upon launch, rallied massively, and at a high of $2, crypto traders who participated in the recognition sale made around $3,000 from their $45 investments.</p>
<p>As it is with airdrops and community recognition sales, the price of the reward token is subject to temporary retracements and price dumps due to selloffs and users cashing out their rewards. While SUI may experience selling pressure, it is important to note that the hype surrounding it is very much active as some call it the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/ethereum-killer-sui-launched-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum killer</a> and, as such, may recover in price.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements also have a major role and effect on the price direction of many altcoins, including SUI, and may dictate if selling pressure continues.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Over the last week, Polkadot (DOT) has had trouble gaining traction, falling by 8.41% from April 30 to May 4. However, the price is trading sideways and there might be a modest recovery next week as investors take advantage of this dip to acquire more DOT. According to CoinMarketCap, Polkadot ranks #11 among all cryptocurrencies with a current market price of $5.75. Polkadot&#8217;s 24-hour trading volume is up by 29.40% in 24 hours, while its market cap has also gained 1.57% within the same time frame. Polkadot&#8217;s (DOT) Fear &#38; Greed Index today is 46. This level indicates that bulls are pushing the price up gradually, but the bears are still in their positions.  Over the last few days, Polkadot (DOT) has been showing some bullish signs; so expect a possible recovery within the next few weeks as investors take advantage of the current momentum. DOT Price Analysis Polkadot trades between the 200-day simple moving average and the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). This indicates that the market is in a neutral or consolidation phase. The price does not trend significantly in either direction. During this phase, traders and investors may use the 50-day and 200-day SMAs as support and resistance levels while trading.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) level of DOT is 41, indicating that its market is heading towards the neutral zone and there&#8217;s indecision among investors. But the 24-hour volume indicator shows that the trading activity is gradually growing, which could mean investors are building interest in the coin. This may increase liquidity and potential price movement in favor of DOT. The chart above shows the key support and resistance levels of Polkadot (DOT). Polkadot now trades between $5.587 and $6.07 primary support and resistance levels. DOT&#8217;s first important resistance level is $6.07. If the price rises above this level, the next resistance levels are $7.970.

In time, more adoption and activities may affect DOT prices positively. Featured image from Pixabay and chart from Tradingview.com]]></description>
