					<description><![CDATA[The Polkadot price has breached the $5 resistance mark in the past trading sessions. Over the last 24 hours, DOT has appreciated by 3.8%. The price of Bitcoin has been surging, which has caused other altcoins to also move upward on their respective charts. When Bitcoin crossed the $18,000 price mark, other altcoins broke past their immediate resistance marks. Polkadot price momentum remains bullish in the shorter time frame. The technical outlook for DOT showed that despite a price correction, accumulation on the chart increased. Related Reading: This Metric Suggests Bitcoin Could Be In Danger Of Another Selloff Polkadot demand also showed an increase on its chart. The asset&#8217;s price has to remain above the $5.40 support line and breach the $6.20 resistance level if the coin has to maintain a bullish stance for a longer time frame. The daily chart of DOT also points towards an incoming fall in price, which means that traders might be presented with shorting opportunities. Currently, DOT is trading at an 89% discount from its all-time high secured in 2021. Polkadot Price Analysis: One-Day Chart DOT was exchanging hands at $5.89 at the time of writing. Polkadot had formed a cup and handle pattern, which means that the bullish momentum can continue, which is why Polkadot resumed its northbound journey on the daily chart. Overhead resistance for the coin stood at $6. Toppling the $6 mark can take the coin to $6.20. As Polkadot was overbought, demand for the coin could trickle down. This can cause the price to fall for a few trading sessions before it starts to rise again. In case of a price retracement, DOT will encounter its local support at $5.40 and then at $5.33. These two levels can be an entry point for buyers, as the altcoin will rise in value after it touches these support lines. The amount of Polkadot traded in the last session was still green, indicating that buying pressure remained. Technical Analysis The asset had secured a multi-month high in registering demand in the past week. The coin was overvalued a week ago, and as a result, demand has retraced slightly. The Relative Strength Index fell back from the 80 mark, which was a sign of the asset being overbought. At press time, DOT again registered an uptick, indicating that buying strength was building again. On that note, the price of DOT was above the 20-Simple Moving Average line, hinting that buyers were driving price momentum in the market. The coin was also above the 50-SMA (yellow) line. Despite that, the 50-SMA line crossed above the 20-SMA line, which signified a death cross. A death cross means an incoming fall in value. This reading corresponds to traders finding the chance to short the asset. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which depicts price momentum and reversals, showed declining buy signals. This means that the price will fall over the next trading session.

					<description><![CDATA[As Bitcoin breaks out of the $21k level, many crypto analysts have begun projecting further rallies for the asset. One of the famous crypto strategists, Crypto Kaleo, recently gave a high price prediction for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Addressing his over 550,000 followers on Twitter, Kaleo says BTC is preparing for a rally to $30,000. Bitcoin last saw $30,000 during the bear market in June 2022. However, the crypto strategist believes there would be fluctuations as Bitcoin targets $30,000, albeit his bullish stance. Related Reading: HNT Balloons As Token Gets 36% More Helium In Run-Up To Network Migration In his words, the market should expect more falls before Bitcoin reaches $30,000. According to Kaleo, there would be some lows beneath $20k, which would trigger lower positions before Bitcoin can be ready for the short squeeze.  A short squeeze occurs when crypto traders borrow assets at a particular price, hoping to sell them lower and keep the difference. These traders often use overleverage short positions in the futures market. However, the traders would have no choice but to buy the borrowed assets as price propulsion pushes against them, sparking more rallies as market makers take out their liquidity to keep the momentum.  Kaleo is confident that the short squeeze is approaching since the BTC price has already jumped above 23% within seven days. Bitcoin Rally Could Signal Increased Volatility BTC has witnessed several bullish indicators since the beginning of 2023, bringing it to a year-high of over $21,000. Bitcoin’s bullish rallies have boosted crypto traders’ hopes that the long-running bear market could end soon.  There has been a reduction in the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index to neutral, which might cause an increase in trading volume. A massive increase in Bitcoin trading volume followed the recent price surge. Throughout the past week, Bitcoin trading volume has climbed above double the initial value, reaching $10.8 billion, a 114% increase.  An increase in trading volume often leads to a spike in volatility. Bitcoin’s current seven-day volatility level of 2.4% is below the 2022 value of 3.1% but remained stable during the recent rally. There is a likelihood that the constantly increasing trading volume during the rally may cause a spike in volatility. Centralized exchanges (CEXs) had to battle with low trading volume, which means lower transaction fees and revenue, including staff layoffs. Therefore, the rising trading volume is a welcomed development for the exchanges and BTC traders.  Bitcoin Recovery Underway As Realized Profit And Trading Volume Increase According to Glassnode’s data, on-chain realized profits for BTC return to the adjusted spent output profit ratio (aSOPR) value of 1.0.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Bitcoin breaks out of the $21k level, many crypto analysts have begun projecting further rallies for the asset. One of the famous crypto strategists, Crypto Kaleo, recently gave a high price prediction for the world’s largest cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Addressing his over 550,000 <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoKaleo/status/1615094502082969600" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">followers on Twitter</a>, Kaleo says BTC is preparing for a rally to $30,000. Bitcoin last saw $30,000 during the bear market in June 2022. However, the crypto strategist believes there would be fluctuations as Bitcoin targets $30,000, albeit his bullish stance.</p>

<p>In his words, the market should expect more falls before Bitcoin reaches $30,000. According to Kaleo, there would be some lows beneath $20k, which would trigger lower positions before Bitcoin can be ready for the short squeeze. </p>
<p>A short squeeze occurs when crypto traders borrow assets at a particular price, hoping to sell them lower and keep the difference. These traders often use overleverage short positions in the futures market. However, the traders would have no choice but to buy the borrowed assets as price propulsion pushes against them, sparking more rallies as market makers take out their liquidity to keep the momentum. </p>
<p>Kaleo is confident that the short squeeze is approaching since the BTC price has already jumped above 23% within seven days.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Rally Could Signal Increased Volatility</h2>
<p>BTC has witnessed several <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/btc%21/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">bullish indicators</a> since the beginning of 2023, bringing it to a year-high of over $21,000. Bitcoin’s bullish rallies have boosted crypto traders’ hopes that the long-running bear market could end soon. </p>
<p>There has been a reduction in the <a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index to neutral</a>, which might cause an increase in trading volume.</p>
<p>A massive increase in <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/4rilomtvvae4/6SExqAaqYIwlHl7FuT1VBH/7231fe008c6c984d4756d6b8f163c262/Ahead_of_the_curve_-_Jan_3_2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bitcoin trading volume</a> followed the recent price surge. Throughout the past week, Bitcoin trading volume has climbed above double the initial value, reaching $10.8 billion, a 114% increase. </p>

<p>An increase in trading volume often leads to a spike in volatility. Bitcoin’s current <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/4rilomtvvae4/6SExqAaqYIwlHl7FuT1VBH/7231fe008c6c984d4756d6b8f163c262/Ahead_of_the_curve_-_Jan_3_2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">seven-day volatility level</a> of 2.4% is below the 2022 value of 3.1% but remained stable during the recent rally. There is a likelihood that the constantly increasing trading volume during the rally may cause a spike in volatility.</p>
<p>Centralized exchanges (CEXs) had to battle with low trading volume, which means lower transaction fees and revenue, including staff layoffs. Therefore, the rising trading volume is a welcomed development for the exchanges and BTC traders. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Recovery Underway As Realized Profit And Trading Volume Increase</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;category=Market%20Indicators&amp;m=indicators.NetUnrealizedProfitLoss" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Glassnode’s data,</a> on-chain realized profits for BTC return to the adjusted spent output profit ratio (aSOPR) value of 1.0. Some analysts believe it is the critical resistance level. The aSOPR historically indicates a shift in the total market cycle when increasing demands (trading volumes) absorb profits.</p>

<p>BTC’s on-chain realized profit and loss ratio has jumped over the 1.0 mark, recording 1.56 profits against the January 16 losses. This marked a reversal of the downtrend that started in May 2022. An increase in realized gain without a price drop indicates market strength.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ripple has reached a new milestone in Australia with its native token, XRP, recording the highest trading volumes on exchanges. With this, Ripple now dominates Australian crypto exchanges as the XRP community anticipates a final court ruling in the lawsuit with the U.S. SEC (Securities And Exchange Commission). The news came from Financial Review, an Australian media outlet shared on Twitter by Neil Smith, Ripple’s partner engineer, and Aussie firm, Blockchain Australia. Ripple now dominates Australian crypto exchange volumes #XRP https://t.co/yaeFIqsNIn &#8212; Neil Smith (@nsmithau) January 18, 2023 Reason For XRP Performance In Australia According to the report, Ripple’s cross-border remittance payment (ODL) use case adoption gets the credit for this achievement. Ripple on-demand liquidity makes XRP suitable for cross-border payments as it helps customers access liquidity using this token. Related Reading: HNT Balloons As Token Gets 36% More Helium In Run-Up To Network Migration  XRP itself serves as a bridge token between fiat currencies. It allows users to make payments in local currency at the payment destination within seconds, hence the name, on-demand liquidity. Following the report&#8217;s details, Ripple&#8217;s native coin contributed to 62% of the trading volumes on the BTC Market, a Melbourne-based exchange. It also accounted for 82% of the Independent Reserve Exchange over the past day.  CEO of BTC Markets Caroline Bowler said her crypto exchange is a Ripple on-demand (ODL) liquidity partner in Australia. That explains XRP&#8217;s dominance in the exchanges&#8217; trading volume. According to Bowler, Ripple ODL helps firms to run cross-border payments without incurring banking or pre-funding costs. It uses Ripple&#8217;s native coin to power part of the process, which explains the trading volumes on the BTC Market platform. As Bowler further explained, Ripple&#8217;s native coin shares a higher percentage on their platform while the overall transaction volumes in the crypto market remain down. Meanwhile, XRP transactions score a 24-hour volume of $10.2 million on the Sydney-based crypto exchange, Independent Reserve. This number is more than other countries&#8217; trading volumes put together. CEO of Independent Research, Adrian Prezelozny, said market makers and international remitters on the ODL network are part of their XRP trading clients. Status Of Long-Standing Ripple/SEC Lawsuit While XRP scores these wins in Australia, Ripple is still in a legal battle with the SEC over the token&#8217;s status as a security. According to Stuart Alderoty, chief attorney for Ripple in the lawsuit, the outcome will significantly impact the entire cryptocurrency market.  Bloomberg also stated that the soon-to-come ruling would clarify who should handle crypto oversight. It would also define assets that qualify as securities or those that do not. Related Reading: HNT Balloons As Token Gets 36% More Helium In Run-Up To Network Migration Both parties in the Ripple case have filed motions for summary judgment. According to Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, and Stuart Alderoty, the ruling is expected to come in the first half of 2023. James K. Filan said the court ruling might go as early as March. Irrespective of the time, Alderoty believes it will impact the future of the crypto industry in the United States. Meanwhile, XRP is still on its way up and currently trading at $0.3933, with slight gains on the chart. Featured Image From Pixabay/ SalesBlog, Charts From Tradingview.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Solana (SOL) recovered from the slight pullback yesterday, even when the general crypto market cap dropped today. SOL which has been on an uptrend in the past week saw a 28.44% increase during this time. This increase might be due to combined economic factors and Solana&#8217;s growing utility among crypto users. What Is Driving The Price Of Solana? The Solana network is enjoying more attention from the increased crypto awareness and adoption among individual and institutional investors. The network has rolled out plans for 2023, creating excitement among its online community. Related Reading: XRP Vs. Cardano (ADA), Which Is The Better Investment In 2023? The SOL network provides developers access and a framework to build DApps on its blockchain. For instance, Phantom, a crypto wallet, is hosted on the Solana blockchain. The wallet supports decentralized finance, staking, and NFT transactions for Solana users.  Also, SolanaMobile, on Twitter, announced its intention to launch Solana Mobile Stack and Saga phones. The mobile phone will bring the Solana blockchain to the fingertips of users. Users are keen on the launch of the device, slated for this early this year.  Additionally, as an altcoin, Solana correlates to bitcoin in price action. So, Bitcoin&#8217;s recent rally and other economic factors might be influencing SOL&#8217;s price. The macroeconomic factors affecting SOL price include a low Consumer Price Index (CPI) value for December 2022. The CPI notes the overall change in consumer prices in a specific timeframe. These factors combined could be responsible for SOL&#8217;s price surge in the past few weeks. Solana Price Prediction: Will SOL Break Its Resistance? SOL is recovering from yesterday&#8217;s slight pullback, trading at $21.28. The support levels are $19.60, $20.09, and $20.75, while the resistance levels are $21.90, $22.40, and $23.05. SOL is trading below its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and 200-day SMA on the weekly charts. These signs point to a bearish trend or slight reversal in the price of SOL ahead. Related Reading: HNT Balloons As Token Gets 36% More Helium In Run-Up To Network Migration The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is close to the oversold region at 43.04 and might continue to descend if the bears sustain their charge. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is below its signal line and giving off negative values, indicating a bearish reversal despite the rally. The price of SOL might dip further and touch the $19.69 support. The next rally will likely surpass the first resistance level of $21.90 in the coming days. At press time, the price of SOL was trading at $21.42. Its trading volume is down over 50% in the last 24 hours to be sitting at $638.8 million.

					<description><![CDATA[A Bitcoin on-chain indicator is currently forming a pattern that has previously led to significant selloffs of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin 100-Day SMA Supply Adjusted Dormancy Has Rapidly Gone Up As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the selloff could potentially be even stronger than the one seen in November 2018. A relevant concept here is of a &#8220;coin day,&#8221; which is the amount of 1 BTC accumulated after sitting still on the chain for 1 day. Thus, when a token stays dormant for a certain number of days, it gains coin days of the same amount. However, when this coin is finally moved, its coin days naturally reset back to zero, and the coin days it had previously accumulated are said to be destroyed. An indicator called the &#8220;Coin Days Destroyed&#8221; (CDD) measures the total amount of such coin days being destroyed through transfers on the entire Bitcoin network. When the CDD is divided by the total number of coins being involved in transactions, a new metric called the &#8220;average dormancy&#8221; is obtained. This metric is so named because it tells us how dormant the average coin being transferred on the chain currently is (as dormancy is nothing but the number of coin days). When the average dormancy is high, it means coins being moved right now are quite aged on average. On the other hand, low values imply investors are currently transferring coins that they only recently acquired.

The reason behind this change lies in the fact that the supply of the crypto isn&#8217;t constant, but rather moving up with time.

<h2>Bitcoin 100-Day SMA Supply Adjusted Dormancy Has Rapidly Gone Up</h2>
<p>As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/63c9fc7abf0caf3db205ba35-Bitcoins-Supply-Adjusted-Dormancy-rapid-rise-points-to-a-likely-sell-off" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a>, the selloff could potentially be even stronger than the one seen in November 2018. A relevant concept here is of a &#8220;coin day,&#8221; which is the amount of 1 BTC accumulated after sitting still on the chain for 1 day.

<p>When the average dormancy is high, it means coins being moved right now are quite aged on average. On the other hand, low values imply investors are currently transferring coins that they only recently acquired.</p>

<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 100-day simple moving average (SMA) Bitcoin dormancy over the last few years:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The second most popular meme coin on the crypto market, Shiba Inu (SHIB), is about to launch its eagerly awaited layer 2 scaling solution Shibarium. While lead developer Shytoshi Kusama has repeatedly said in recent weeks that the launch date is not yet set but will be &#8220;soon,&#8221; he may now have leaked the beta launch date himself wrapped in a word puzzle. He revealed the decisive hint in his Twitter bio, where he writes: Tending the Pine Tree of Life. Quickly learning to play the flute before putting Shibarium in a heart shaped box with a bow. For the Shiba Inu community, this is an unmistakable clue that the beta version of Shibarium will be released on Valentine&#8217;s Day, February 14. Already on January 15, Kusama had posted a prelude to his announcement, where he mysteriously stated: During fall the tree may have only a few leaves, but then spring appears. Luckily, Shibarium, in this context, is a Pine Tree. Still, it needs water, sunlight and proper soil. But pines survive and thrive during the harshest winters. (I also hear the needle tea is good for you.) Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Reacts By Moving Up 4% Shiba Inu (SHIB) has risen almost 4% in the last 24 hours and 21% within the last week, with the price currently standing at $0.00001249. Trading volume was around $305 million within the last 24 hours, representing a -55% decrease against the previous time period. Year-to-date (YTD), SHIB is up about 43% at the current price, the highest level since early November 2022. Related Reading: Shiba Inu’s BONE Bags New Listing As Token Surges 14% In 7 days This rally has been mainly driven by two reasons: on the one hand, macroeconomic sentiment has improved substantially, giving the overall crypto market a strong boost, and on the other hand, Shibarium has provided some level of FOMO. However, a look at the 1-week chart of SHIB reveals that the price should still be assessed as mostly bearish. In its third attempt since September 2022, SHIB&#8217;s price has failed to close above $0.000014 on a weekly basis. The resistance zone between $0.000013 and $0.000014 has so far proved too stubborn to confirm a breakout from the bearish territory. The 1-day chart shows the massive drop from the lower end of the resistance zone at $0.000013 very clearly. Currently, however, SHIB is finding support from the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Jumps By 21%, Here’s Why As signaled by the daily RSI, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is in an overbought condition. On a daily basis, the RSI remained significantly in the overbought zone, 79 at press time. Ideally, the RSI causes investors to reduce their positions and thus initiate a price correction on a price basis. Otherwise, there would have to be a correction on a time basis, which would mean a longer sideways trend below the resistance zone. To trigger a sustained bullish breakout on the daily and weekly charts, Shiba Inu needs to break above the $0.000014 level within the next few weeks.

This lack of negative movement from bitcoin in response to the news could cement the digital asset’s path to the upside in the coming weeks. Bitcoin Remains Unfazed By Genesis Despite the dreaded news of a Genesis bankruptcy finally becoming a reality, the price of bitcoin has not reacted negatively. In fact, the digital asset has barely responded to the news at all and continues to trade around the $20,900 level. What this shows is that the news of the Genesis bankruptcy was already priced into the price of the asset. It is understandable given that the crypto lender had been considering filing for bankruptcy for quite some time and has been exploring its options.

					<description><![CDATA[CryptoQuant data on January 20 shows an unusually sharp spike in Bitcoin miners&#8217; outflow, an unexpected development considering the solid performance of BTC prices in the past few trading days. Miners&#8217; Position Index (MPI) Rising The Miners&#8217; Position Index (MPI) is up from -0.85 registered on December 31, 2022, to +3.25 on January 19, 2023. The expansion could indicate that miners are moving their coins, at a faster pace, to centralized exchanges.  The MPI is a moving ratio between the total miner outflows to the total one-year moving average of the total miner outflows. All denominations are in USD. Per CryptoQuant&#8217;s interpretation, the higher the MPI ratio, the higher the odds that miners are sending mined coins to centralized exchanges, heightening the risks of a price plunge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Show Signs Of Dumping, Bad For Rally? For a wholesome picture, it is recommended that the MPI be used with other metrics since there are assumptions that miners are expressly selling their coins in top exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or even in over-the-counter (OTC) exchanges. Nonetheless, when used with different technical indicators, MPI flows can provide a rough indicator of Bitcoin miners&#8217; financial state.

In proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin, miners are compensated with coins to secure the platform against external attacks and confirm transactions. Bitcoin distributes 6.25 BTC for every block they successfully mine. This translates to around $131,000 in BTC. A block is released roughly every 10 minutes.

Since the Bitcoin network is transparent and all movements can be tracked, dedicated analytics&#8217; platforms and traders often monitor their activities. Recent data points to these miners moving coins, possibly to exchanges for cash. The spike from -0.85 to +3.25 coincides with the stalling of Bitcoin prices below $21,500.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CryptoQuant data on January 20 <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptoquant.com/asset/btc/chart/flow-indicator/miners-position-index-mpi?window=DAY&amp;sma=0&amp;ema=0&amp;priceScale=log&amp;metricScale=linear&amp;chartStyle=line" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shows</a> an unusually sharp spike in Bitcoin miners&#8217; outflow, an unexpected development considering the solid performance of BTC prices in the past few trading days.</p>
<h2>Miners&#8217; Position Index (MPI) Rising</h2>
<p>The Miners&#8217; Position Index (MPI) is up from -0.85 registered on December 31, 2022, to +3.25 on January 19, 2023. The expansion could indicate that miners are moving their coins, at a faster pace, to centralized exchanges. </p>
<img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-516908" src="https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Rising-Miners-Position-Index.png" alt="Rising Miners' Position Index" width="1072" height="488" srcset="https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Rising-Miners-Position-Index.png 1072w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Rising-Miners-Position-Index-460x209.png 460w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Rising-Miners-Position-Index-860x391.png 860w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Rising-Miners-Position-Index-768x350.png 768w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Rising-Miners-Position-Index-750x341.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1072px) 100vw, 1072px" />
<p>The MPI is a moving ratio between the total miner outflows to the total one-year moving average of the total miner outflows. All denominations are in USD. </p>
<p>Per CryptoQuant&#8217;s interpretation, the higher the MPI ratio, the higher the odds that miners are sending mined coins to centralized exchanges, heightening the risks of a price plunge.
</p>

<p>For a wholesome picture, it is recommended that the MPI be used with other metrics since there are assumptions that miners are expressly selling their coins in top exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or even in over-the-counter (OTC) exchanges. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, when used with different technical indicators, MPI flows can provide a rough indicator of Bitcoin miners&#8217; financial state. The actions of the miners may provide an indication of where the market might be headed next.</p>
<p>In proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin, <a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-miners-feel-the-heat-more-selling-pressure-might-be-imminent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">miners</a> are compensated with coins to secure the platform against external attacks and confirm transactions. Bitcoin distributes 6.25 BTC for every block they successfully mine. This translates to around $131,000 in BTC. A block is released roughly every 10 minutes. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[MANA is the native token of the Decentraland ecosystem which, as the time of writing, has seen growth enough to recoup losses post-FTX collapse. According to CoinGecko, the token is up 55% in the weekly timeframe with the biggest gains made during the monthly time frame at 105%.  With 2023 showing a renewed interest in crypto, Decentraland has a lot to unpack this month for users, traders, and investors as they released their manifesto detailing plans to improve user experience and making it easier for creators to enter the world of the metaverse with ease. Related Reading: HNT Balloons As Token Gets 36% More Helium In Run-Up To Network Migration The Decentraland Manifesto The Decentraland team recently posted on their blog about how this year would be the “Year of Creators.&#8221; According to Decentraland, it will continue its mission it set itself from the start of 2017: to establish a decentralized platform where users can help build and grow. The blog post said: “Decentraland, anyone can extend the capabilities of the virtual world’s platform, audit it, contribute to it, and build on top of it—all the code is open source. To that end, in 2023 Decentraland will continue to be developed as a public good in the era of the internet.”  Image: Decentraland.org The manifesto detailed several goals that the ecosystem wants to achieve this year. Namely, the developers aim to achieve a better environment for creators, to make Decentraland more fun, and to make the performance of the ecosystem better. This would drive the platform to become a dominant player in the metaverse space.  In the 18 months since its birth, Decentraland&#8217;s DAO has developed into a basic decision-making system for high-level deliberations concerning the Decentraland ecosystem and the metaverse in general. In order to address the growing demand for governance and stewardship of progressive decentralization, the DAO&#8217;s procedures and processes have continued to expand with the community&#8217;s increasing self-governance experience and strength, according to the manifesto. What Does This Mean For MANA? As the time of writing, MANA is changing hands at $0.6210 with the token being rejected at $0.7567. This led to the token retesting its current support at $0.6352 which, if broken, could lead the bears to test further support ranges in the next few days or weeks.  If the token buckles under the rejection, we might see MANA at $0.5397 support which could easily be breached. However, with the detailed roadmap provided by the devs, MANA will have a strong enough investor sentiment that it will retest $0.7567 once the rejection reaches its bottom.  MANA total market cap at $1.1 billion on the daily chart &#124; Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: HNT Balloons As Token Gets 36% More Helium In Run-Up To Network Migration Investors and traders should brace for short to mid term volatility as the token tries to consolidate above $0.6352.
