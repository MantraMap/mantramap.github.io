<ul><li>A VIP hiring program launched by Coinbase attracted 283 applicants from around the world.&nbsp;</li><li>The program aims to attract talented crypto enthusiasts with extraordinary abilities.&nbsp;</li><li>CEO Brian Armstrong announced the program last week in a bid to offer employment to such individuals.&nbsp;</li><li>The applicants include people with an O-1 Visa, Olympic athletes, Armed forces veterans, and influencers.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>A VIP hiring program launched by <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ark-invest-sold-coinbase-share-53-million/">Coinbase</a> last week has attracted more than 250 applications from around the globe. The VIP Access program, which was announced by CEO Brian Armstrong last week, seeks to attract experienced crypto enthusiasts to work at the largest crypto exchange in the United States. </p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase’s VIP Access Attracts Olympians, Veterans &amp; Crypto Influencers</strong></h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/careers/vip-access" rel="nofollow noopener">VIP Access</a> Program was launched on July 19 to attract crypto enthusiasts with extraordinary abilities. According to Coinbase, the program is aimed at hiring highly-talented individuals who are passionate about crypto and economic freedom. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We created a VIP page to hire people with extraordinary ability <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">@coinbase</a>.<br><br>If you&#39;ve shipped a popular open source library, built a large online following, won a math/eng/gaming competition, were part of a special forces unit, or built something awesome, say hello.…</p>&mdash; Brian Armstrong 🛡️ (@brian_armstrong) <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1681439056323051529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">July 18, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The program is looking for people with a specific skill set and experience, which includes experience in elite armed forces, winners of chess tournaments, coding or video game competitions, crypto influencers with a large following on social media, crypto project founders, entrepreneurs, and holders of an O-1 Visa, which is granted to individuals who have achieved national/international acclaim for extraordinary ability in sciences, art, business, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took to Twitter earlier today to provide a glimpse into the applications received so far. The VIP Access program had attracted 283 applications, the majority of which came from North America. 39 applications came from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, 13 from India, and 10 from the Asia Pacific region. The remaining two applicants were from Latin America.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Crypto is attracting the best and brightest globally who want to build the future, and increase economic freedom.” </p><cite>Brian Armstrong, Co-founder and CEO at Coinbase</cite></blockquote>



<p>Armstrong revealed that 65 applicants had led a crypto forward project, 56 had founded and sold companies, 22 had elite armed forces experience, and 43 were influencers with a large social media audience. The applicants also included 7 O-1 Visa holders and 6 Olympic athletes.</p>

<ul><li>DOGE became one of the top gainers today after Elon Musk rebranded Twitter as X.&nbsp;</li><li>The meme token gained as much as 10%, topping a two-month high of $0.077.&nbsp;</li><li>The demand for Dogecoin increased after Musk briefly displayed its dog-themed logo in his Twitter bio.&nbsp;</li><li>Traders also rushed to invest in multiple namesake tokens leading to triple-digit gains.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) witnessed double-digit gains earlier today after <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/elon-musk-offensive-in-dogecoin-lawsuit/">Elon Musk</a> rebranded Twitter as X. Musk, who bought Twitter in October last year, has owned the domain name X.com since 2017 and previously revealed his plans to turn it into “the everything app”. The domain name now redirects users to Twitter and is part of the billionaire businessman’s broader plan to turn the social networking platform into what he envisions as “the most valuable financial institution in the world.”</p>



<h2><strong>Dogecoin Reaches Two-Month High Of $0.77</strong></h2>



<p>Elon Musk took to Twitter recently to <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1683171310388535296" rel="nofollow noopener">announce</a> his social networking platform’s new identity. The rebranding included the X logo featured on Twitter’s homepage, replacing the iconic blue bird logo.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>X is the future state of unlimited interactivity – centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking – creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities. Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we’re just beginning to imagine.&#8221; </p><cite><a href="https://twitter.com/lindayacc/status/1683213798386147329" rel="nofollow noopener">Linda Yaccarino, CEO of Twitter</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Shortly after the announcement, traders scrambled to buy up DOGE, anticipating some role for the meme token in Twitter’s overhaul. The memecoin gained as much as 10%, reaching a two-month high of $0.77. At the time of writing, DOGE was trading at $0.75. The buying frenzy led to a 374% increase in the memecoin’s daily trading volume, which topped $1.38 billion. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy</a> now points to <a href="https://t.co/AYBszklpkE" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/AYBszklpkE</a>. <br><br>Interim X logo goes live later today.</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1683171310388535296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">July 23, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The rebranding to X also led to several namesake tokens witnessing triple-digit gains. Data from <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/x/" rel="nofollow noopener">CoinMarketCap</a> shows that the price of one X token increased by a whopping 313%. Another token, X AI, which didn&#8217;t even exist till last week, gained more than 166%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Musk has been vocal in his support for Dogecoin, going as far as enabling DOGE payments on The Boring Company, an online store that previously sold flamethrowers, perfumes, and even Tequila. Several of his cryptic tweets with a subtle hint of the dog-themed memecoin have sent its price soaring in the past.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the announcement of X, he even displayed Dogecoin’s logo in his Twitter bio briefly. In early April, members of the crypto community on Twitter reported that they could see the dog mascot of the meme coin instead of Twitter’s logo on their homepage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The project co-founded by OpenAI CEO <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sethmatlins/2023/06/22/sam-altman-is-the-unofficial-1-on-forbes-2023-worlds-most-influential-cmos-list/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sethmatlins/2023/06/22/sam-altman-is-the-unofficial-1-on-forbes-2023-worlds-most-influential-cmos-list/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Altman</a> sparked debates across the crypto ecosystem with proponents raising concerns over centralization and privacy. </p>



<p>Worldcoin styles itself as a &#8220;privacy-preserving digital identity&#8221; protocol built on the Ethereum L2  solution Optimism that allows users to claim a WorldID through Orb biometric verification and a digital currency (WLD), where local regulations permit. </p>

<h2>Ethereum Founder Buterin Chimes In On Worldcoin Conversation</h2>



<p>Indeed, WLDs launch raised eyebrows mainly regarding the project&#8217;s biometric verification and possible data leaks that could emerge. The project utilizes a device called Orb &#8211; a device that scans a participant&#8217;s Iris and validates their identity on the company&#8217;s database. Notably, the product is unavailable to U.S. users. </p>



<p>Tools for Humanity&#8217;s chief communications officer Rebecca Hahn said the German-made Orbs will debut in 35 cities over the coming months. Currently, there are 200 Orbs although that number is expected to reach 1,500 by year&#8217;s end, head of product and design Tiago Sada noted. </p>



<p>Amid concerns that privacy leaks and Worldcoin&#8217;s centralization could put users at risk, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/07/24/biometric.htmlhttps://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/07/24/biometric.html" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/07/24/biometric.htmlhttps://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/07/24/biometric.html" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">opined</a> that the technology is needed and will likely take time to effectively build at scale. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The concept of proof-of-personhood in principle seems very valuable, and while the various implementations have their risks, not having any proof-of-personhood at all has its risks too: a world with no proof-of-personhood seems more likely to be a world dominated by centralized identity solutions, money, small closed communities, or some combination of all three.</p></blockquote>

<ul><li>The United States SEC has signaled that it will appeal the recent ruling in the lawsuit against Ripple.</li><li>The securities regulator’s latest comments were part of a filing in the lawsuit against Do Kwon and Terraform Labs.&nbsp;</li><li>Do Kwon recently cited the Ripple ruling to support his motion to dismiss the SEC’s lawsuit against him.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has signaled that it may appeal the landmark ruling in its lawsuit against Ripple, which handed the crypto firm a major victory and set a precedent surrounding the security status of cryptocurrencies. The securities regulator’s intent to appeal came to light in its latest filing in a separate lawsuit against Do Kwon and his defunct Terraform Labs.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>SEC: Ripple Ruling Adds Baseless Requirements To Howey Test</strong></h2>



<p>The summary judgment motion by Federal Judge Analisa Torres last week identified XRP’s institutional sales as securities offerings. However, the judge ruled that retail or programmatic sales of XRP did not constitute an investment contract. This ruling was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/terra-do-kwon-ripple-ruling-dismiss-sec/">cited</a> by  lawyers representing Terraform Labs’ disgraced founder Do Kwon in the motion to dismiss the SEC’s lawsuit against him and his firm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-21/sec-signals-appeal-to-crypto-ripple-ruling-in-terra-response#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the SEC urged the judge overseeing its lawsuit against Kwon and Terraform Labs to not consider the Ripple ruling as a legal precedent. The securities regulator argued that Judge Torres’ stance on XRP’s programmatic sales created “an artificial distinction between the expectations of sophisticated institutional and retail investors. The regulator added that the Ripple ruling added “baseless requirements” to the decades-old Howey Test, which is used to determine if an asset qualifies as a security.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Institutional buyers in this case, such as trading firms that purchased Defendants’ crypto assets with no restrictions on resale, purchased because they viewed the assets as an investment opportunity into Terraform’s efforts.” </p><cite>SEC’s filing in the lawsuit against Do Kwon</cite></blockquote>



<p>The SEC asked the judge hearing Do Kwon’s case to reject the components of the Ripple ruling about XRP’s non-security status for retail sales and added that it was considering appealing the controversial ruling by Judge Torres. Interestingly, the securities regulator encouraged the Terraform judge to consider Judge Torres’ stance on institutional sales of XRP, which were deemed securities.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Binance France reported a loss of €4 million in the financial statements for 2022.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange’s French arm currently holds €1bn in crypto assets on behalf of its clients.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange started recording expenses eight months before revenue, which led to the multi-million euro loss.&nbsp;</li><li>Binance France expects to be profitable by the end of this year.</li></ul>



<p>Binance France has reported a loss of €4 million for the year 2022. The French arm of the world’s largest crypto exchange recently, which was established in November 2021, released the audited financial reports for last year. The crypto exchange’s financial statements were audited by Paris-based accounting and audit firm RSM France.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance France Holds €1 Billion On Behalf Of Clients</strong></h2>



<p>According to the audited <a href="https://www.binance.com/fr/blog/ecosystem/binance-france-publishes-2022-accounts--what-do-they-say-and-faq-7753651850896626460" rel="nofollow noopener">financial reports</a> released by Binance France earlier today, the exchange held €1 billion worth of crypto assets on behalf of its users residing in the country. Apart from that, the exchange also holds 7 million USDT in its own account. The majority of the French crypto exchange’s income came from trading fees charged from users on the platform. </p>



<p>The crypto exchange stated in its report that the reason for the €4 million loss was a mismatch in the dates that they started recording expenses and revenues. The accounts reportedly covered 14 months of expenses but only six months of revenue. The delay in receiving revenue was attributed to the lack of regulatory approval from France’s top market regulator, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers’ (AMF).&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cut-employee-benefits-low-profits/">Binance</a> France started operating as a crypto exchange only after registering as a virtual asset service provider (VASP) with the AMF in May last year, followed by another two months of formalities to onboard the French users. However, the exchange had started incurring expenses as early as November 2021, which led to 14 months of expenses being recorded in the financial statements. </p>



<p>If not for the mismatch, Binance stated that its French unit would be profitable in 2022. The exchange clarified that the international platform was profitable and that the French unit would also turn profitable in 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The study identified two crypto exchanges &#8211; U.S.-sanctioned Russian platform Garantex and an unnamed Australian exchange &#8211; that have served as payment gateways for merchants in China offering precursor chemicals and pill presses required to produce Fentanyl. The</p>



<p>Elliptics study on crypto&#8217;s use in the fentanyl supply chain comes at a time when the deadly synthetic opioid is causing massive public health issues in the United States, Europe, and the world at large.</p>



<p>Despite China&#8217;s fentanyl export restrictions, the study revealed that savvy operators have found ways to smuggle precursor chemicals overseas. Tactics include using disguised packaging, such as dog food or car wash detergent, and leveraging established carriers who may not frequently verify package contents.</p>



<h2>Crypto Exchanges Funnel $50 Billion In Street-Valued Fentanyl Ingredients</h2>



<p>According to the report, transactions to Bitcoin addresses, and USDT addresses on Tron and Ethereum blockchains were identified. In total, these addresses received $32 million in crypto for fentanyl precursor chemicals. </p>



<p>Elliptic estimates that if all these funds were used to buy fentanyl products, the goods could produce as much as $50 billion in drug proceeds factoring in street value. </p>



<p>The report was released amid a global crackdown on questionable crypto exchanges suspected to be money laundering intermediaries. In January, U.S. authorities <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariagraciasantillanalinares/2023/01/18/justice-department-shuts-down-700-million-russian-crypto-exchange/?sh=72806ed427c7" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariagraciasantillanalinares/2023/01/18/justice-department-shuts-down-700-million-russian-crypto-exchange/?sh=72806ed427c7" rel="noreferrer noopener">sanctioned</a> and shut down an almost unknown Russian exchange called Bizlato on money laundering suspicions.

<p>FTX Trading Ltd filed a lawsuit against founder Sam Bankman-Fried and other company executives, seeking to recover $1 billion of customer cash misused for personal benefits, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ftx-sues-bankman-fried-others-recoup-fraudulent-transfers-2023-07-20/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ftx-sues-bankman-fried-others-recoup-fraudulent-transfers-2023-07-20/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a> reported.</p>



<p>Lawyers submitted court documents on July 20 claiming that the defendants stole customer assets to fund political donations, loans to executives, and luxury apartments. The suit named former CEO Bankman-Fried, ex-Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, co-founder Gary Wang and former Lead Engineer Nishad Singh as defendants.</p>



<p>According to lawyers of the bankrupt crypto exchange, Singh received $447 million in a supposed loan from FTX and Alameda but there was no intention to repay.</p>



<p>The defendants received at least $725 million in equity for shares that were never paid for, per the filing. Lawyers also alleged that Bankman-Fried’s brother Gabriel planned to acquire the island nation of Nauru.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the beleaguered exchange sent tens of millions for real estate purchases and legal fees to SBF’s dad, Allen Joe Bankman. Separate lawsuits seek to recover $71.5 million and $700 million respectively spent by SBF for <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-71-million-recovery-sbfs-sham-ngo/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-71-million-recovery-sbfs-sham-ngo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal aggrandizement</a> prior to FTX&#8217;s collapse in November 2022.</p>



<h2>FTX Debacle Continues</h2>



<p>In other related news, the U.S. Department of Justice asked a court to ban &#8220;extrajudicial statements&#8221; made by defendants and witnesses after FTX founder Bankman-Fried reportedly leaked Caroline Ellison&#8217;s private diary to the press. </p>



<p>Ellison who led SBF&#8217;s hedge fund and FTX sister firm Alameda Research agreed to a plea deal with federal prosecutors. Singh also was also in talks with DOJ attorneys over a possible deal. </p>



<p>While bankruptcy administrators track down stolen customer cash and prosecutors levy charges against former company leadership for wrongdoing, crypto observers remain puzzled about the whereabouts of known FTX executive Sam Trabucco and his noticeable omission from court proceedings. </p>

<ul><li>A consortium of investors is in the final stages of acquiring crypto news outlet CoinDesk.&nbsp;</li><li>CoinDesk is owned by the Digital Currency Group (DCG), which is currently embroiled in a lawsuit with its creditors.&nbsp;</li><li>Coindesk has been on the market since January 2023, following instability at its parent company.&nbsp;</li><li>Crypto exchange Binance was previously looking to acquire the crypto news website for around $75 million.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>A consortium of investors is reportedly in the final stages of purchasing CoinDesk, which is one of the largest crypto news outlets in the world. Owned by Barry Silbert’s crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group (DCG), CoinDesk has been on the market since January 2023, following financial instability at its parent company.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>DCG Plans To Retain A Stake In CoinDesk Post Sale</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, the consortium of investors is led by Matthew Roszak of blockchain-focused venture capital firm Tally Capital, and Peter Vessenes from Captial6, a venture capital and private equity firm. People familiar with the matter revealed that the deal, which is valued at $125 million, is in the final stages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CoinDesk’s parent company Digital Currency Group will reportedly retain a stake in the crypto news outlet, which it bought for $500,000 in 2016. DCG’s stake would cover media, events, data, and index business. As per <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/investor-group-nears-125-million-deal-for-coindesk-146a6faa" rel="noopener">WSJ</a>, the current management is expected to be retained by CoinDesk’s new owners. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, CoinDesk hired investment bank Lazard Ltd to explore a partial or full sale. At the time, CEO Kevin Worth revealed that the company had received “numerous inbound indications of interest”. One of these was from crypto giant <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cut-employee-benefits-low-profits/">Binance</a>, which was looking to acquire CoinDesk for about $75 million. The offer was considerably less than early estimates, which indicated that the crypto news website could fetch as much as $300 million. </p>



<p>CoinDesk went on the market right around the time when DCG’s subsidiary Genesis filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At the time, DCG was facing allegations of financial discrepancies surrounding its liability to subsidiaries like Genesis. Earlier this month, DCG and its founder Barry Silbert were sued for fraud by the Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange Gemini, adding to the company’s woes.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Binance’s investment arm has invested $10 million in DeFi lending protocol Radiant Capital.&nbsp;</li><li>Radiant Capital’s native token RDNT gained more than 10% following the multi-million dollar investment by Binance.&nbsp;</li><li>The DeFi lender plans to use the investment for technology and product development.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Binance Labs, the investment and incubation arm of the world’s largest crypto exchange, has invested $10 million in the DeFi lending protocol Radiant Capital. Radiant is a decentralized lender built atop Layer Zero Labs, a part of Binance Labs&#8217; portfolio firms. The DeFi protocol aims to connect users from different chains enabling greater access to liquidity. </p>



<h2><strong>Binance’s Funding To Help Radiant Capital’s Ethereum Mainnet Deployment</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-labs-invests-$10-million-in-radiant-to-support--its-mission-to-lead-the-next-era-of-defi-lending-1438479277678345894" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> by Binance, the $10 million raised in Radiant’s strategic funding round will foster the DeFi lender’s tech and product development, paving the way for its expansion on oracle support, dual-emissions support, and collateral expansion. The funds will also help the protocol’s deployment on the Ethereum mainnet. Radiant Capital aims to onboard the next 100 million users into decentralized finance through these developments. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Radiant Capital&#8217;s commitment to facilitating seamless cross-chain transactions for DeFi, and performance on Arbitrum and BNB Chain demonstrates its potential for driving mass adoption. We look forward to seeing Radiant&#8217;s continued growth and further contributions to the ecosystem.&#8221; </p><cite>Yi He, Co-Founder of Binance </cite></blockquote>



<p>Radiant currently supports more than 20 collateral options and plans to expand its cross-chain functionality to additional chains. Data from <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/radiant" rel="nofollow noopener">DeFiLllama</a> shows that Radiant has more than $262 million in total value locked (TVL). In the BNB ecosystem, Radiant is the second largest lending protocol, with a TVL of $73.5 million. The DeFi lender’s bridges are built on the Delta algorithm of Layer Zero, which raised $120 million in a Series B funding round in April this year. </p>



<p>News of Binance Labs&#8217; investment in Radiant led to a 10% in its native token <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/radiant-capital/" rel="nofollow noopener">RDNT</a>, which reached as high as $0.319 earlier today. At the time of writing, RDNT was trading at a 3-week high of $0.308. The token’s daily trading volume surged 331% to $79 million. </p>



<p>Binance Labs&#8217; investment in Radiant Capital comes a week after it <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-lab-invest-15-million-xterio-game/">invested</a> $15 million in web3 gaming startup Xterio. </p>

<ul><li>Terra and Do Kwon&#8217;s legal team argued that the recent ruling in the case of US SEC v. Ripple Labs directly impacts their motion to dismiss.</li><li>The SEC sued Do Kwon and his company for selling unregistered securities namely UST, LUNA, wLUNA, and MIR.</li><li>Judge Analisa Torres ruled that cryptocurrency sales to retail investors on exchanges do not qualify as an investment contract i.e. a security.</li></ul>



<p>Terraform Labs and Do Kwon&#8217;s legal <a href="http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.594150/gov.uscourts.nysd.594150.47.0.pdf" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.594150/gov.uscourts.nysd.594150.47.0.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">filed </a>a motion to dismiss the U.S. Securities and Commission (SEC) lawsuit alleging securities violations. Lawyers for founder Do Kwon and his company cited the recent summary judgment by Judge Analisa Torres in the Ripple vs SEC case.</p>



<p>Their legal team, represented by Dentons, argues that the recent <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/xrp-up-exchanges-resume-trading-ripple/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/xrp-up-exchanges-resume-trading-ripple/" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruling in the case of US SEC v. Ripple Labs</a>, delivered by Judge Analisa Torres, directly impacts their motion to dismiss.</p>



<p>According to the SEC, cryptocurrencies like UST, LUNA, wLUNA, MIR, and mAssets fall under the category of securities. However, the Ripple case demonstrates the SEC&#8217;s lack of legal grounds to claim that all cryptocurrencies, except for Bitcoin, are securities. </p>



<p>The defense highlighted distinctions between programmatic sales of digital assets which are not considered securities and institutional sales which are treated as securities under investment contracts per &#8220;Torres Doctrine&#8221;. </p>



<p>Furthermore, the defense for Terra and Do Kwon asserts that the SEC did not allege any direct or secondary market sales of UST. Lawyers filed a supplemental authority citing the Ripple judgment in a bid to throw out the SEC&#8217;s case against Terra and its founder alleging fraud and securities rulebreaking. </p>



<h2>New Terra CEO, Do Kwon in Jail</h2>



<p>The motion comes at amid a shift in company leader after Terraform <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-terraform-labs-appoints-new-ceo/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-terraform-labs-appoints-new-ceo/" rel="noreferrer noopener">appointed </a>Chris Amani as CEO. Meanwhile, founder and former CEO Do Kwon sits in a Balkan prison <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-4-month-montenegro-forgery/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-4-month-montenegro-forgery/" rel="noreferrer noopener">serving a 4-month sentence</a> for forgery and awaiting news of his possible extradition to his country South Korea, or the U.S.</p>



<p>If tried and convicted of breaking South Korea&#8217;s Capital Markets Act, Do Kwon could spend 40 years in prison. The U.S. Justice Department also hopes to try Kwon on criminal charges in a federal court.</p>
