			            <description><![CDATA[Many Bitcoin-adjacent companies are outperforming the asset itself since the start of the year.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin (BTC) has treated its faithful well in 2023, having appreciated over 80% year to date. However, there may be better ways for investors to capitalize on the asset’s success besides stacking actual sats.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at how some Bitcoin-related assets and companies are performing next to BTC, from financial companies to mining stocks.</p>
<h2>Mining Stocks Are Booming</h2>
<p>Shares for multiple publicly traded Bitcoin miners surged on Friday, including CleanSpark (CLSK; 11.32%), Riot Platforms (RIOT; 14.33%), and Hut 8 (HUT; 6.14%). Bitcoin, by contrast, only rose by 1.42%.</p>
<p>This year alone, all three miners have seen their share prices at least triple in value. Rival mining firm Iris Energy, which rose 9.5% on Friday, is up a whopping 48% since January 1.</p>
<p>Miners’ balance sheets and revenue are directly connected to Bitcoin’s price, as such firms receive a fixed number of Bitcoin every ten minutes as newly minted coins from the network.</p>
<p>Many such miners have made <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-mining-firm-riot-secures-33280-mining-rigs-ahead-of-halving/" data-wpel-link="internal">major infrastructure investments</a> this year in preparation for the “halving” – an event that cuts Bitcoin’s network emissions in half and is widely thought to catalyze Bitcoin bull markets.</p>
<p>While the industry’s upside looks promising, it can also encounter even greater downside volatility than BTC. Core Scientific (CORZQ), for example, saw its share price collapse over 80% in a single day in October after <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/large-bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-could-file-for-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">revealing</a> it was not in a position to pay back its debt.</p>
<h2>Exchanges and ETFs</h2>
<p>Another publicly traded firm outpacing Bitcoin this year is Coinbase (COIN) – up 134% YTD. Though the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued the exchange last month, Bitcoin’s positive price action, Coinbase&#8217;s optimistic <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-posts-79m-net-loss-but-beats-expectations/" data-wpel-link="internal">Q1 earnings numbers</a>, and a partnership with BlackRock for a planned Bitcoin spot ETF all spell good fortune for the company.</p>
<p>BlackRock’s filing has markets more optimistic that a spot ETF could finally get past the SEC, paving the way for other firms to follow suit.</p>
<p>This makes the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) another enticing buy: Shares for the fund have traded at a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/gbtc-discount-narrows-to-27-for-the-first-time-since-may-2022-heres-why/" data-wpel-link="internal">discount</a> well below the value of its underlying Bitcoin for years. However, if its effort to convert into a spot ETF proves successful, that discount will immediately be restored to parity, creating added value for investors. The discount currently stands at 27%.</p>
<p>Until a Bitcoin spot ETF is approved, MicroStrategy (MSTR) is one of the better alternatives that are available, up 162% YTD. The software company – whose balance sheet includes over <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/microstrategy-buys-12333-btc-for-350-million-at-28k-per-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">150,000 BTC</a> – frequently issues stock to buy more Bitcoin, much like an ETF.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Aside from SOL, the other notable gainer from the larger-cap alts is Avalanche (AVAX).]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin went through a volatile end of the week in which it posted a new 13-month high before it slipped under $30,000 but has managed to defend that level.</p>
<p>The altcoins are calmer on a daily scale, aside from SOL, AVAX, LEO, ARB, and a few others, which have added some value.</p>
<h2>BTC Defends $30K</h2>
<p>The past weekend was quite uneventful, even though BTC went through a rollercoaster that drove it from $31,000 to $29,500 and back up to $30,500 in a matter of hours on Friday. Saturday and Sunday, though, were calm, with BTC remaining at just over $30,000.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until early Tuesday morning when the landscape changed, and BTC pushed above $31,000 once again. It was rejected there, but the bulls went on the offensive once again on Thursday, and this time, they managed to drive bitcoin north to $31,500 (on Bitstamp) for the first time in 13 months.</p>
<p>However, the asset failed there again and plummeted to $29,700 by Friday morning. Nevertheless, it bounced off and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/btc-defends-30k-after-blackrock-refiled-its-spot-bitcoin-etf-application-this-weeks-crypto-recap/" data-wpel-link="internal">reclaimed</a> the coveted $30,000 in the following hours and has remained just above that line since then.</p>
<p>Its market capitalization still stands at $585 billion, and its dominance over the alternative coins is just shy of 50%.</p>
<figure id="attachment_259420" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-259420" style="width: 1835px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSD-8.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-259420" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSD-8.png" alt="BTCUSD.

Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>SOL, AVAX on the Rise</h2>
<p>The altcoins also experienced enhanced volatility in the past few days, but most have calmed on a daily scale. Ethereum had neared $2,000 at one point but was sharply rejected yesterday and currently stands roughly $150 away from that level.</p>
<p>Binance Coin, Ripple, Cardano, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Tron, Polkadot, and Polygon are slightly in the green from the larger-cap alts.</p>
<p>Avalanche and Solana have stolen the show with gains of 7.5% and 13%, respectively. As a result, AVAX stands above $13, while SOL is north of $22.</p>
<p>Overall, the cumulative market cap of all crypto assets has managed to reclaim just over $10 billion in a day and sits above $1.8 trillion. Recall that the metric <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-markets-shed-50b-daily-as-btc-dipped-below-30k-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">dumped</a> by $50 billion yesterday alone.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The tools aim to connect the Bitcoin network with the growing field of AI.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The hype surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) is taking multiple industries by storm, and the digital assets industry appears to be readily embracing the tech.</p>
<p>Lightning Labs has become the latest platform to tap the space. The team behind the Bitcoin Lightning Network announced the release of a new set of developer tools to enable the Lightning and AI developer communities to interact with Bitcoin seamlessly.</p>
<h2>Lightning Labs Taps AI</h2>
<p>According to the official <a href="https://lightning.engineering/posts/2023-07-05-l402-langchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">blog post</a>, the newly released toolkit assists AI applications such as OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT to interact with the Bitcoin network to send, receive, and hold the crypto-asset. Lightning Labs explained that the new tools are built on a Lightning native authentication mechanism &#8211; L402 protocol. It also uses a popular library called &#8220;Langchain.&#8221;</p>
<p>The firm also highlighted the problem of rising deployment costs that serves as a barrier due to the current billing paradigm, a crucial aspect that Lightning and the L402 protocol seek to address. As such, leveraging the L402 protocol, any entity with an internet-connected device will be able to receive or acquire Bitcoin instantly. Owing to the Lightning Network, high-volume payments can also be carried out while retaining privacy.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We’re extremely excited about the new wave of innovation brought about with the latest wave of LLM models. With the L402 protocol and LangChainBitcoin, we’re able to ensure the open models can be accessed using an open payment system, connected to the world’s set of open APIs. In the end, open source will win, and we’re working to provide the tooling to enable greater accessibility to AI for humans and agents alike.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>LN Growth</h2>
<p>Despite a slow start, Lightning Network has been increasingly embraced by crypto entities. The scaling solution witnessed tremendous growth as measured by the amount of BTC locked within it. The latest <a href="https://1ml.com/statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">data</a> shows that there are now more than 5.4k BTC on the Lightning Network.</p>
<p>Binance recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/keep-building-binance-starts-running-bitcoin-lightning-network-nodes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> that it would start running multiple Lightning nodes to leverage the layer-2 scaling solution in a bid to enable cheaper BTC deposits and withdrawals on its platform.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Uniswap had earlier invited community feedback to discuss potential areas of concern and opportunities for V4 improvement.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Uniswap Labs has shared some detail about its much-anticipated v4 release, which is currently undergoing active development. In a new post, the team behind the DeFi juggernaut Uniswap said it is thinking about the launch of the upcoming version in terms of three milestones.</p>
<p>If no security issues or delays with respect Cancun hard fork and audit process occur, V4 is likely to be launched later this year.</p>
<h2>Updates on Uniswap V4</h2>
<p>According to Uniswap Foundation&#8217;s governance lead, Erin Koen, the first step in the timeline includes publishing of protocol code which was achieved on June 13th. It involved the opening of the protocol repo for public view and contribution, a move meant to underscore Uniswap&#8217;s dedication to decentralization.</p>
<p>One of the main factors that V4&#8217;s <a href="https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-v4-and-the-dao/21626" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">launch</a> relies on is the completion of the audit process, which, in turn, depends on the successful integration of EIP-1153 into Ethereum&#8217;s Cancun. The upcoming upgrade is expected to occur in September-end.</p>
<p>Following Cancun, the devs will focus on an extensive auditing process of the v4 codebase before being deployed. The process is estimated to range anywhere between one to four months. Despite providing the timeline, Koen admitted,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The above timeline is purely indicative and it should be noted that the Cancun hard fork could be delayed, the audit process could be extended, and the protocol could be subjected to other security testing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>What’s New in V4?</h2>
<p>The V4 <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/uniswap-upgrades-to-v4-heres-whats-new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">upgrade</a> is expected to expand on the DEX&#8217;s coin-swapping capabilities by introducing &#8220;hooks&#8221; and custom liquidity pools. According to Uniswap Labs CEO Hayden Adams, hooks can be described as &#8220;plugins to customize how pools, swaps, fees, and LP positions interact.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new functionality aims to implement features such as on-chain limit orders and dynamic fees that might be accessible on more traditional exchange platforms but are not easy to bring in a blockchain setting that consists of no centralized infrastructures. Among other features, the pool creation cost on Uniswap v4 will also be slashed by 99% since all pools live within a single contract.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[In the Battle of the Bankruptcies, who will come out on top?
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to US Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane, Genesis, whose repayment plan was pending approval, will first have to resolve its outstanding issues with FTX.</p>
<p>The announcement came mere hours after Cameron Winklevoss’ <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cameron-winklevoss-issues-3-day-ultimatum-to-dcgs-barry-silbert-threatens-lawsuit/" data-wpel-link="internal">ultimatum</a> to DCG CEO Barry Silbert expired, meaning yet another lawsuit against Genesis’ parent company is also on the horizon. A response to said ultimatum, which would have forced DCG to stick to a repayment plan, may now be out of DCG&#8217;s control to begin with.</p>
<h2>Awfully Optimistic</h2>
<p>During a preliminary hearing concerning Genesis’ creditor repayment plan, Manhattan-based Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane stated that any further hearings regarding this proposal are likely to be delayed until the firm’ legal dispute with FTX was resolved, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-06/genesis-s-2-billion-spat-with-ftx-may-delay-creditor-payouts" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">according</a> to Bloomberg.</p>
<blockquote><p>“That schedule is looking awfully optimistic. My understanding is these deadlines were likely to slip.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However, a final ruling on the payment plan is still not out of the question. The two parties proposed “duel procedures” in order to settle FTX’s claim, a request that was denied by Judge Lane.</p>
<p>Also rejected by the judge were a second request from FTX to sue Genesis in a Delaware court and another from the former for a hearing to decide whether the claim is legitimate in the first place.</p>
<h2>Right to Confidentiality</h2>
<p>Genesis’ debt to FTX has been outright denied by the company in earlier hearings with Judge Lane, who outright <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/genesis-judge-denies-ftxs-bid-to-participate-in-confidential-mediation-sessions-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">refused</a> access to its confidential mediation sessions to the exchange&#8217;s legal counsel.</p>
<blockquote><p>“There will be a certain amount of radio silence because mediation needs that to work. Shortening the mediation does not shorten the case.”</p></blockquote>
<p>FTX originally claimed that Genesis owed it nearly $4 billion, a claim which has since been revised to only $2 billion. This, in turn, indicates that FTX is overestimating the scope of its business deal with its fellow crypto lending platform at best and simply grasping at straws at worst. As far as Genesis is concerned, FTX “is entitled to claims totaling $0.00.”</p>
<p>Judge Lane has ordered the two platforms to exchange information regarding the alleged debt and to report back at a later date. Until then, the court will refrain from ruling on whether FTX is even allowed to sue Genesis in the first place.</p>
<p>Once the parties have exchanged the necessary information, the court may schedule the hearing requested by Genesis regarding the size of its debt to FTX – assuming it exists in the first place.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the crypto landscape continues to change, recent days have seen Bitcoin ($BTC), along with several other cryptos, experience a notable downturn.</p>
<p>This downturn has caused ripples of concern throughout the market, with many traders now pondering whether the bullish momentum is over for now.</p>
<p>However, despite the slump, several new tokens are emerging, offering a silver lining.</p>
<h2>Red Week for Crypto As Bitcoin Price Stumbles</h2>
<p>It’s been a difficult week for crypto traders thus far, with most major coins and tokens experiencing a significant selloff.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has seen its price drop 4% in the past day – and has now closed in the red for three days in a row.</p>
<p>This surprise turnaround in fortunes comes after a period of sustained momentum for $BTC, which saw the coin’s price soar by 27% over the past month.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259378" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6.jpg" alt="Picture6" width="602" height="287" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-300x143.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>However, this bullish momentum appears to have been halted, with $BTC struggling to surpass the crucial $31,000 level.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, $BTC is retesting $30,000 – a vital psychological level that has often served as support and resistance in previous market cycles.</p>
<p>If it fails to hold, further downward momentum could be on the cards.</p>
<h2>Market Uncertainty Dampens Crypto Enthusiasm</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s not just Bitcoin experiencing a price dip – major altcoins like Ethereum ($ETH) are also seeing the bears take control.</p>
<p>The $ETH price has dipped over 5% from Monday’s high, with the token now trading around the $1,860 level.</p>
<p>A quick glance at the Coin360 <a href="https://coin360.com/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">heatmap</a> shows a sea of red, with big hitters like Ripple ($XRP) and Binance Coin ($BNB) also experiencing a sharp price drop.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture7-1.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259377" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture7-1.jpg" alt="Picture7" width="602" height="279" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture7-1.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture7-1-300x139.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture7-1-50x23.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>It appears that uncertainty is rippling throughout the crypto market following the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d3b06ad6-6b96-42bb-9fac-ebe1b8dc7fa6" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">release</a> of the Federal Reserve’s FOMC meeting minutes, which indicate that another rate hike could be in the works for July.</p>
<p>This is bearish news for the crypto market since higher interest rates can make riskier assets, like cryptocurrencies, less attractive to investors.</p>
<p>As a result, investor funds may be redirected towards “safer” financial instruments and away from cryptos, leading to a broad decline in coin/token values.</p>
<p>Despite the current headwinds, many traders still hope for a rebound – although time will tell whether they&#8217;re correct in their predictions.</p>
<h2>Which Tokens Are Traders Still Bullish On?</h2>
<p>However, it’s not all doom and gloom in the crypto market, with several new projects gaining traction and turning heads.</p>
<p>Two of these projects are Wall Street Memes and Thug Life, which are gearing up for major exchange listings once their respective presales conclude.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Memes Gears Up for Major CEX Listings &amp; Hits $13.2m Presale Raise</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=bitcoin-price-other-major-cryptos-are-stalling-but-traders-remain-bullish-on-these-tokens" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes ($WSM)</a> is a new meme token that aims to capture the spirit of the r/WallStreetBets subreddit and the GameStop saga, where retail investors challenged the big hitters on Wall Street.</p>
<p>The $WSM token is community-driven and aims to reward holders for showing faith in the Wall Street Memes brand – which is backed by over 1.1 million people worldwide.</p>
<p>Wall Street Memes’ scale can be traced to the success of the <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/wall-street-bulls" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall St Bulls NFT</a> collection, which launched in 2021 and sold out in 32 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture8-1.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259376" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture8-1.jpg" alt="Picture8" width="602" height="179" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture8-1.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture8-1-300x89.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture8-1-50x15.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>The collection’s popularity has prompted the creators to turn their attention to the crypto market, launching $WSM and hoping to capitalize on the ongoing meme coin craze.</p>
<p>This decision already appears to be bearing fruit, with high-profile names like <a href="https://twitter.com/RealCryptoJamie" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Crypto Jamie</a> opting to join the project as a brand ambassador.</p>
<p>Wall Street Memes is now in Stage 21 out of 30 during its presale phase, which has already raised $13.2 million.</p>
<p>Investors who get in early can purchase $WSM tokens at the appealing price of just $0.031.</p>
<p>While the exact price for the intended CEX listing remains undisclosed, it&#8217;s anticipated that the currently-offered price will be a discount on the eventual listing price.</p>

<h2>Thug Life Aims to Be “Baller’s Meme Coin” &amp; Raises $600,000 in One Week</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b_thuglife_33357?referrer=bitcoin-price-other-major-cryptos-are-stalling-but-traders-remain-bullish-on-these-tokens" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Thug Life ($THUG)</a> is another new meme token that many believe is set to explode in the crypto market.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, Thug Life is a project that embraces a bold and edgy persona in the world of finance – setting it apart from most other low-cap cryptos.</p>
<p>Thug Life’s branding features a variety of well-known memes and celebrities, including Snoop Dogg and Pepe the Frog, which looks set to appeal to a broad demographic of retail investors.</p>
<p>Not only that, but Thug Life’s team encourages investors to adopt a “gangsta” attitude and “pimp out” their money game.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture9-1.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259375" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture9-1.jpg" alt="Picture9" width="602" height="301" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture9-1.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture9-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture9-1-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>As these statements highlight, Thug Life aims to fuel a community-driven movement through humor and trolling – an approach that seems to be working, given the huge influx of new members to the official <a href="https://t.me/thuglifetoken" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Telegram channel</a>.</p>
<p>Like Wall Street Memes, Thug Life is in its presale phase, which has already raised over $600,000 in just one week.</p>
<p>The presale price of $THUG is $0.0007, fixed for the duration of the offering, ensuring that early investors can secure their tokens at a stable price.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin recorded more than 15 million Ordinals inscriptions. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin maximalists have proved to be highly staunch supporters of the crypto asset. For more than a decade, they have stayed as a united front, but the advent of Ordinals shook up the long-standing narrative. 2023 will be known for many things, one of them being &#8211; the Bitcoin community&#8217;s split into two warring factions.</p>
<p>The first cohort are Ordinals skeptics and supporters of &#8220;staying true&#8221; to Bitcoin &#8211; using the asset purely to process transactions. The second cohort is Ordinals fans. Both groups have compelling arguments to back up their case, but Vitalik Buterin believes Bitcoin Ordinals&#8217; booming popularity has helped revive the developers of the network.</p>
<h2>Vitalik Buterin Praises Ordinals</h2>
<p>While addressing a July 7 Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1DXxyvDYZqgKM" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Space</a> with Eric Wall and Udi Wertheimer, the Ethereum founder said Ordinals are starting to revive a &#8220;culture of actually doing things,&#8221; which, according to him, feels like a &#8220;real pushback to the laser-eye movement.&#8221; He believes this trend is good for the overall ecosystem.</p>
<p>The Ordinals protocol enabled NFTs on the Bitcoin network. Until then, Ethereum dominated the NFT scene. Hence, it can be said that Ordinals played a crucial role in changing the dynamic by bringing NFT creators from Ethereum to Bitcoin. This influx of new developers triggered the transaction fees on the network to soar.</p>
<p>Buterin, however, lauded the BRC-20 token standard and said its increasing prominence signals an outright abandonment of &#8220;stagnant&#8221; politics that he believes to be plaguing the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Ordinals&#8217; Explosive Year</h2>
<p>The latest <a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/state-of-the-dapp-industry-in-q2-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">stats</a> show that Bitcoin Ordinals trading volume rose by 2,834% from Q1 to Q2 of 2023, hitting an astonishing $210.7 million. All-time trades accounted for 554,215 across 150,969 unique traders, suggesting an increasing user interest who are keen on exploring new types of digital assets.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Bitcoin sports over 15 million Ordinals inscriptions at writing time, as per Dune Analytics <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">data</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a Bitcoin Ordinals proposal was released to slash inscription costs by 90%. Ordinals launchpad platform Luminex <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-ordinals-proposal-to-reduce-inscription-costs-by-90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">proposed</a> a new standard &#8211; BRC69 &#8211; that brings new on-chain features, such as &#8220;pre-reveal collection launching and on-chain reveals,&#8221; in addition to reducing inscription costs.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Deaton said the class action was the least of Ripple's worries. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John Deaton, crypto lawyer and legal representative of XRP holders in the lawsuit between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has disclosed that a recent class action brought against the company would most likely be made void if the firm wins the case.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1676589373226115073?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">tweet</a>, Deaton said the class action was the least of Ripple&#8217;s worries.</p>
<h2>Ripple&#8217;s Win in SEC Case to Nullify Class Action</h2>
<p>The class action in question was granted certification by Judge Phyllis Hamilton of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on June 30. The class suit <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/securities-law/ripple-labs-crypto-investors-get-class-status-in-securities-suit" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">alleges</a> that Ripple Labs, its CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and its subsidiary XRP II engaged in a scheme to raise hundreds of millions of dollars through sales of XRP to retail investors.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs accused the defendants of violating registration provisions of state and federal securities laws through the sale of the crypto asset, which has been tagged unregistered security.</p>
<p>While Garlinghouse and Ripple Labs challenged the certification, Judge Hamilton ruled that the class action met the four requirements to be certified. Ripple&#8217;s argument was based on the plaintiffs&#8217; failure to show that they would protect the interests of the class, as several proposed members disagreed on the premise of the suit.</p>
<p>One such member is Bradley Sostack, who made purchases in the secondary market, making his case subject to unique defenses, according to Ripple.</p>
<p>In response, Hamilton disclosed that the plaintiffs had clarified that individual issues would remain secondary to common class ones, and the standard opt-out procedure would remedy any disagreements over the premise of the suit.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Deaton said the plaintiffs&#8217; attorneys should hope the SEC loses in its lawsuit <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-v-sec-case-update-the-latest-developments-as-of-june-27th/" data-wpel-link="internal">against</a> Ripple, as the agency would set up a fund to pay XRP holders if the reverse becomes the case, thereby invalidating the class action.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Class Suit Only Concerns U.S. Investors</span></h2>
<p>On the other hand, if Ripple wins, Deaton believes Hamilton would follow Judge Analisa Torres&#8217; decision on XRP not being a security. Either way, the class suit will be invalidated when the SEC-Ripple case ends.</p>
<p>In response to an inquiry about offshore XRP holders, the crypto lawyer <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1676612189254299648?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">noted</a> that regulators in the U.K., Japan, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) do not recognize XRP as a security. Hence, the lawsuit applies only to U.S. investors.</p>

<p>Hayes’ arguments were based on the financial needs of AI machines and their critical inputs. He compared the monetary attributes of gold, fiat, and bitcoin, evaluating their importance to an AI machine.</p>
<p>Addressing the financial needs of AI, Hayes postulated that such machines would need to use a blockchain-based digital payments system that is available at all times and completely automated. The traditional banking system, which mostly functions when humans are awake and is divided between geographies, would not be a good fit.</p>
<p>A blockchain-based system, with its rules outlined in clear and transparent code, would enable AI machines to pay their data providers and receive the same for their services.</p>
<h2>A Good Fit</h2>
<p>For any currency to be fit for AI-powered economies, Hayes explained that they must have a finite supply, be censorship-resistant, and possess energy purchasing power.</p>
<p>While gold has a finite supply on earth, the BitMEX co-founder insisted it has an unknown quantity off-world. Since the bullion is a physical commodity, the only way to use its digital representation is to trust a centralized entity to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/texas-lawmakers-propose-a-gold-backed-digital-currency/" data-wpel-link="internal">issue</a> a gold digital certificate; hence it is not censorship resistant. In addition, the value of gold can not be defined by one energy derivative, as the asset can be created through various sources.</p>
<p>Conversely, fiat has an infinite supply in its physical and digital forms, as governments control its <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/arthur-hayes-expects-the-us-to-start-printing-again-bullish-for-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">issuance</a>. The centralized oversight makes the currency censorship non-resistant, and its value is placed more on the politics of the government than its natural energy wealth.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/goldman-sachs-acknowledged-bitcoin-as-the-best-performer-in-2023/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a> has a finite supply of 21 million coins. However, due to its decentralized network, the asset is purely digital and censorship-resistant. Since new bitcoins can only be created via computers, the cost of electricity defines its value over time.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Bitcoin is thus the logical currency choice for any AI. It is purely digital, censorship resistant, provably scarce, and its intrinsic value is completely electricity-cost-dependent. There is nothing in existence today that comes close to challenging Bitcoin on these aspects,” Hayes stated.</p></blockquote>
