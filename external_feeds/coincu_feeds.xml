<p>It should be noted, however, that as the current FTX bankruptcy case and SBF lawsuits are still ongoing, it has yet to be confirmed whether each affected user will ultimately be able to receive compensation. It is also unclear how much payment can be accepted.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>6 steps to claim compensation</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Step 1: Fill out the PDF claim form carefully and honestly</strong></p>



<p>If users affected by the FTX bankruptcy want their funds back, they must file a claim with the restructuring regulator Kroll, the US Bankruptcy Administration. The <strong>User must read and understand the Complaints Guide</strong> and <strong>must correctly and truthfully fill out the PDF Complaint Form</strong> before the complaint can be processed.</p>



<p>For example, the US Delaware Bankruptcy Court, which is dealing with FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy case, advises users against submitting original registration documents, as they will permanently destroy them once received. One more thing to be very careful about &#8211; don&#8217;t make fraudulent claims! Users who do so can be sentenced to 5 years in prison or fined up to $50,000 (possibly both).</p>



<p>In addition, applicants must add the following documents to their request: Mortgage, Promissory note, Invoice, Purchase Order, Confidentiality Agreement, and Judgment, and you can upload screenshots or videos proof of provision of assets on FTX for this Kroll Restructuring Management request The application also provides several other channels for submitting application documents. Alternatively, <strong>claim applicants can use this link to view submitted information, once on the page click on the claim number, go to the upper right corner and click on &#8220;PDF Proof of Claim&#8221; to see</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Step 2: Do not provide more personal information</strong></p>



<p>For users applying for an FTX claim, <strong>you need to ensure that you do not add any personal information to the registration document</strong>, that information includes personal data, TIN (tax identification number) and proof of identity mail, etc.</p>



<p>In fact, during the process of filling out the document, the document also warns the user not to add personal information or be redacted because the public has access to the unedited data, making the list unedited. User&#8217;s privacy is at risk of criminal theft.</p>



<p><strong>Step 3: Request Confirmation to Include Claims in Bankruptcy and Loss Statements on Tax Returns</strong></p>



<p>Users filing an FTX claim <strong>will need to have attached documents and the application verified by the bankruptcy administrator</strong>, Kroll Restructuring Authority, confirming the requested information as part of the process. overall bankruptcy filing. More importantly, the insolvency manager&#8217;s certification facilitates the reporting of financial losses to the relevant tax authorities.</p>



<p>In addition, all affected parties must clearly notify tax authorities or tax advisors on how to handle claims and report fraudulent losses to local law enforcement and file Formal complaints can also be of great help.</p>



<p><strong>Step 4: You must put a US stamp and label on the envelope</strong></p>



<p>It should be noted that if a user wants the bankruptcy administrator of FTX, the Kroll Restructuring Authority, to confirm the claim, <strong>it must be mailed to them and only in an envelope with a postage stamp</strong>. US only confirmed by the company. Unfortunately, these stamps are not easy to obtain as the US Postal Service or Consulate does not send stamps to FTX users around the world.</p>



<p>However, you can purchase US postage stamps on platforms like Frankaturware.com, since you don&#8217;t know how many confirmation documents the Kroll Recipient Restructuring Administration needs to attach, you also need to consider document weight, as for major airmails it will weigh more than 198 grams You may also need to purchase and additional stamps.</p>



<p><strong>Step 5: Send registration documents to the bankruptcy administrator by mail</strong></p>



<p>Provided your envelope contains all the required documents and you have properly stamped them, please send these applications via DHL Express to the following address:</p>



<p>FTX Trading Ltd. Claims Processing Center</p>



<p>c/o Kroll Restructuring Administration LLC</p>



<p>850 3rd Avenue, Suite 412</p>



<p>Brooklyn, NY 11232</p>



<p><strong>Step 6: Submit your request ASAP</strong></p>



<p>Although FTX receivership Kroll Restructuring Administration Inc. allows users to send PDF documents in digital form, but it is definitely worth sending in the mail. In addition, <strong>it should be noted that the claim file states: &#8220;When the court sets a deadline for filing proof of a claim against a debtor, all identified creditors will be notified of the deadline and they will also receive instructions on how to file a claim.&#8221;</strong></p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>The claim form can be a helpful tool for victims</strong></h2>

<p>Sam Bankman-Fried built the FTX cryptocurrency exchange thanks to the reputation of the trading company Alameda Research. Alameda herself is merely applying Wall Street-style “magic” to the crypto world, but everyone is sure it will win big. Transactions outside of Alameda, including a Bitcoin-related bet in Japan, have not been revealed much to the press.</p>



<p>Before being charged by federal prosecutors in December with a series of charges, Bankman-Fried said Alameda was &#8220;doing very well&#8221; until it took a sudden plunge in November. Bankman-Fried testified at the time. After that, I no longer ran Alameda myself and by the time I realized the problem, it was too late.</p>



<p>Looking deeper, it can be seen that Alameda has never worked effectively. Bankman-Fried entrenched in power even after stepping down as CEO in October 2021. Alameda used billions of dollars stolen from FTX customers to bet on a thriving future. Alameda herself also bought a lot of real estate and donated money to politicians.</p>



<p>Therefore, it led to a rapid collapse and beyond the imagination of investors.</p>



<p>Since the collapse of FTX, Bankman-Fried has tried to deny any connection between himself and Alameda. “FTX is a full-time job. My brain doesn&#8217;t have enough room to understand what&#8217;s going on at Alameda,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>As updated in <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157010-ftx-debtors-claiming-bahamian-forfeiture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an earlier article</a> by Coincu News, for the interest of debt, FTX Trading and its affiliated debtors announced on Friday that they would seek the restoration of cryptocurrency held by the Bahamas Commission to their chapter 11 estates. The Bahamas Security Commission announced on Thursday that it has been holding onto FTX customer assets worth more than $3.5 billion since November 12. The FTX debtors have informed the Bahamas Commission that they do not believe Bankman-Fried, Wang, or the Bahamas Commission have the authority to take any of their cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>While the courts currently dealing with FTX bankruptcy cases do not have a filing deadline (so you don&#8217;t have to worry about not filing a claim now), <strong>the fact that filing on time is very important and early filing is always a good thing to claim.</strong></p>

<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">General Introduction of ERC-20</h1>



<p><strong>The ERC-20 stands for Ethereum Request For Comments</strong>, and the number 20 denotes the unique numerical ID used to differentiate the standard from others.</p>



<p><strong>ERC-tokens are digital assets developed, issued, and used in the same way as Bitcoin.</strong></p>



<p><strong>ERC-20 is a collection of guidelines </strong>that helps developers simplify and enhance the process of developing a standard Ethereum-based token.</p>

<p><strong>ERC-20 tokens work similarly to ordinary cryptocurrency, but their ideas are distinct</strong>. Indeed, the terms cryptocurrency and tokens have distinct meanings and should not be used interchangeably.</p>



<p>To begin with, <strong>cryptocurrency is a type of digital asset that is encrypted using encryption</strong>. This implies that these coins run on their own blockchains, and the ledgers are distributed across decentralized blockchains.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Tokens are a type of utility that runs on top of a blockchain. ERC-20 tokens and several other equivalents, such as ERC-223, ERC-721, are among the most popular.</p>



<p><strong>ERC-20 tokens differ from normal crypto in that they rely fully on the Ethereum blockchain rather than having their own blockchain</strong>. As a result, there is a gas price to complete a transaction. And a miner utilizes these fees to accomplish network transactions. And the gas charge varies according to network activity. Finally, the more the gas taxes, the more crowded the network.</p>



<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">The Relationship Between ERC-20 And Smart Contracts</h1>



<p>Fabian Vogelsteller, a prominent player in the blockchain sector with a background in web development, introduced ERC-20, the technical standard underlying smart contracts implementing the currency on the Ethereum blockchain, in 2015.</p>



<p>A smart contract is a piece of code that is run in response to a request from a user or another program. Smart contracts are also in charge of conducting transactions, validating fees, and keeping track of the balances of each token&#8217;s holders.</p>



<p>These contracts often have a unique name, supply, and behaviour. However, as long as the core ERC-20 criteria are followed, they are all ERC-20 compatible.</p>



<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">The Function Of ERC-20 Tokens</h1>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Because ERC-20 tokens are based on smart contracts, their functionality varies. It can be used as money, reputation points on an online platform, lottery tickets, a financial asset such as a corporate share, or evidence of ownership.</p>



<p>The following are some of the properties of ERC-20 tokens:</p>



<ul>
<li>Applicable for payment transactions, and it is <strong>transferable</strong>. ERC-20 tokens function just like any other cryptos. They are transferable from one address to another, as long as it fulfills the requirements. </li>



<li>They are <strong>fungible</strong>. That means all transaction histories are traceable even though each token’s code is identical. </li>



<li>There must be an identified <strong>total supply </strong>of ERC-20 tokens created. Some ERC-20 tokens may or may not have a fixed supply of coins. Its purpose of having a total supply is to ensure the ecosystem is aware of the total number of tokens circulating.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>ERC-20 tokens are commonly purchased, sold, swapped, or traded on cryptocurrency exchanges</strong>. They may be stored in any Ethereum-compatible wallet, such as MetaMask and MyEtherWallet, as well as a paper wallet, wallet software, or even a hardware wallet, such as the Trezor or Ledger Nano S.</p>



<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">What Cryptocurrencies Use The ERC-20 Standard?</h1>



<p>On the Ethereum blockchain, there are several token specifications. ERC-20 tokens are among the most widely used. On Ethereum&#8217;s main network, <strong>more than 200,000 ERC-20-compatible tokens exist, according to Etherscan</strong>. Many of the top digital currencies by market cap are used for diverse reasons.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>ChainLink Token (LINK)</strong>, Chainlink is an ERC-677 token that inherits functionality from the ERC-20 token standard. This token runs on blockchain middleware that acts as a bridge between cryptocurrency smart contracts, data feeds, APIs, and traditional bank account payments. </li>



<li><strong>Maker (MKR) </strong>is a utility token based on the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that creates DAI stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain.</li>



<li><strong>Tether (USDT) is </strong>a stablecoin that runs on the ERC-20 protocol. That means the deposit address is an ETH address, while the deposits and withdrawals take place on the ETH network.</li>
</ul>



<p>When Ethereum introduces sharding and changes to the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism in the ETH 2.0 Upgrade, we may anticipate the number of projects based on the ERC-20 standard to rise tremendously. Furthermore, ETH 2.0 addresses transaction concerns by allowing users to make ERC-20 token transfers virtually instantly and at a lower cost.</p>



<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">Pros and Cons of ERC-20 Tokens</h1>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-171.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-171-1024x576.png" alt="Little-Known Facts About ERC-20 Token And ERC-20 Standard" class="wp-image-157628" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-171-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-171-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-171-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-171-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-171-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-171.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Little-Known Facts About ERC-20 Token And ERC-20 Standard 10"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 style="font-size:26px"><strong>Pros</strong></h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Convenient</strong>. ERC-20 tokens are simple and easy to deploy. Alternatively, developers can also code smart contracts with Vyper programming language which is similar to <strong>Python</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Flexible for customization</strong>. Depending on the business logic and user interactions, ERC-20 tokens are customizable to enable features like gas auto-refill for future transactions, freezing and unfreezing a token, adding on a central mint to modify the tokens in circulation, and more.</li>



<li><strong>A defined roadmap for developers</strong>. The ERC-20 standard gives developers a proper blueprint, which allows them to create new tokens in an effortless way instead of building them from scratch. </li>



<li><strong>Token standardization</strong>. Ethereum provides the token specification that includes interaction rules between different tokens and token purchase rules. With a universal standard, users can transfer new tokens to a wallet and be put on an exchange all at once.</li>



<li><strong>Liquidity</strong>. If the projects based on Ethereum are active and interact with each other, that brings more projects and more users to the Ethereum network. </li>



<li><strong>Widely Accepted.</strong> ERC-20, as well as its tokens, are recognizable on most exchanges and wallets because of the universal protocol that is adaptable to broad exchanges. </li>



<li><strong>Eradicate counterfeit tokens. </strong>All transactions are subject to approval, and the total supply of tokens smoothens the auditing process by ensuring there is no duplicate of tokens in circulation.</li>
</ul>



<h2 style="font-size:26px"><strong>Cons</strong></h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Instability</strong>. The Ethereum blockchain has recently moved its consensus method from the Proof-of-Work to the Proof-of-Stake system via ETH 2.0. Though ETH 2.0 aims to address all of the scalability issues, many changes are just undergoing, and it’ll take time, and the project is yet to complete. At this time, there might be system instability. </li>



<li><strong>Expensive gas fee</strong>. ERC-20 relies on the Ethereum blockchain, and to complete each transaction, there will be a gas fee. While the gas fee is parallel to the blockchain activities, the gas fees increase when there’s heavy traffic in the blockchain. </li>



<li><strong>Transfer bugs</strong>. In Ethereum, there are two kinds of accounts. Sending tokens from one EOA account to another using the transfer function causes no problems but transferring funds to a contract account results in a bug that has already led to the loss of nearly a million dollars.</li>



<li><strong>Slow transactions</strong>. The withdrawal and transactions are correlated to the Ethereum blockchain. When the network is congested, all of the transfers on ERC-20 will be slowed. </li>



<li><strong>Irreversible transactions</strong>. There is no way to return funds if users sent ERC-20 tokens to the wrong address, and tokens remain forever trapped in contracts. </li>



<li><strong>A very low entry point</strong>. Developers can easily exploit the policies to develop fraudulent ICOs and tokens with non-value-adding projects.</li>
</ul>



<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">Conclusion</h1>



<p>ERC-20 may continue to be one of the most popular standards used by many developers throughout the world. However, it is not without flaws. Many solutions try to solve technical issues with the standard. However, most of them continue to be short and deceptive hacks that do not provide a comprehensive explanation. As a result, while evaluating an ERC-20 initiative, investors should keep this in mind.</p>

<p>On behalf of the plaintiffs, Kattula filed the case. He asserts that <strong>owing to Coinbase&#8217;s lax security, criminals stole $6,000 worth of his digital assets and transferred them to unidentified wallets.</strong></p>

<h5><strong>As reported by Korean media<a href="https://www.edaily.co.kr/news/read?newsId=01170966635474112&amp;mediaCodeNo=257&amp;OutLnkChk=Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> E-Daily</a>, the First Trial Sentence for the fraud of 110 billion won (about $70 million) of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/136809-bithumb-8-jail-fraud-worth-about-70m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The former Bithumb President, Lee Jung-hoon</a>, known for his as the actual owner of Bithumb, a virtual asset exchange, will be launched today.</strong></h5>

<p>According to the legal community, on the 3rd, the 34th Criminal Agreement Division of the Seoul Central District Court <strong>will set a sentencing date for former Chairman Lee</strong>, who was brought to trial on charges of violating the Aggravated Punishment for Economic Crimes Act <strong>at 2:00 pm on the same day (local time).</strong></p>



<p>It is known that in October 2018, <strong>when Lee Jung-hoon and the Chairman of BK Group, Kim Byung-gun</strong> <strong>were negotiating the sale of Bithumb shares</strong>, Kim Byung-gun, after hearing that Lee Jung-hoon would list BXA (Bithumb token) on Bithumb, used part of the proceeds from the BXA pre-sale to buy shares. Bithumb shares, but BXA is not listed on Bithumb, and BK Group&#8217;s acquisition of Bithumb is still ongoing.</p>



<p>Prosecutors believe that during the contract process, former chairman Lee launched a business to raise funds by listing BXA coins and forming an alliance between exchanges, <strong>avoiding Korea because here ICO is prohibited.</strong></p>



<p>During this process, former Chairman Lee told Chairman Kim, &#8220;If you pay only part of the purchase price, you can issue and sell coins to pay the rest.&#8221; Still, the prosecutor was found to have deceived Chairman Kim even though he had no intention or ability to issue or sell assessed coins.</p>

<p>As a result of the investigation, former chairman Lee posted a notice saying, <strong>&#8220;BXA Coin is expected to be listed,&#8221; but stopped the listing process due to regulations of financial authorities and self-delisting when suspected collusion.</strong></p>



<p>In July, <strong>he was put on trial on charges of embezzlement totaling 112 billion won ($98 million)</strong>, including receiving balances of bonds and stocks without notifying Chairman Kim about the listing failure.</p>



<p>Former Chairman Lee denied that Chairman Kim&#8217;s side proposed the acquisition of Bithumb first, and there was no promise of listing BXA Coin in the final contract document.</p>



<p>At the final trial on October 25, the prosecution said: &#8220;The damage to ordinary coin investors is enormous. The defendant continues to deny the poor quality crime, so it is necessary to pronounce a heavy sentence.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>If the charges are established, he could face up to eight years in prison.</strong></p>

<p>As updated in <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156852-bithumb-vice-president-jumps-suicide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a previous Coincu News article</a>, a suspect was found dead while being evaluated by the prosecution on charges of embezzlement and stock price manipulation of the cryptocurrency exchange ‘Bithumb affiliates’.</p>



<p>The person in question is Park Mo, vice president of Vident, a holding company of Bithumb, who committed suicide by jumping from a building in the early morning of December 30 (local time). It is said that while serving as vice president of Vident, Park was in charge of accounting under Mr. Kang&#8217;s brother and sister, who claimed to be the chairman of Bithumb.</p>

<p>The Hedera Hashgraph system, which seeks to be a quicker, more effective, and more secure version of conventional blockchain technology, has a native coin called HBAR. <strong>The system&#8217;s foundation is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and it employs what is known as its Gossip protocol.</strong></p>



<p>With a <strong>maximum supply of 50 billion tokens </strong>and <strong>25 billion of them already in circulation</strong>, HBAR presently has a market capitalization of little under $1 billion.</p>



<p>Credible claims that<strong> even if Hedera has a big maximum supply in comparison to the circulating supply, once a bull market emerges, it won&#8217;t be a problem. </strong></p>

<li><em>The firm is currently working on a number of blockchain games and would be unveiling more during 2023.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>Square Enix, the developer of the Final Fantasy series, plans to increase its focus on blockchain game creation despite volatility in the cryptocurrency market, according to a <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/2023/html/a_new_years_letter_from_the_president_3.html" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/2023/html/a_new_years_letter_from_the_president_3.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">letter </a>from Yosuke Matsuda, the president of the Japanese firm, on January 1.</strong></h5>

<p>The letter sought to summarize the company&#8217;s significant achievements in 2022 and outline its goals for 2023. <strong>Seven of the 15 paragraphs were on blockchain gaming, indicating that blockchain gaming would be a significant emphasis of the company&#8217;s investing strategy in the future.</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">In terms of new business domains, we named three focus investment fields under our medium-term business plan. Among those, we are most focused on blockchain entertainment, to which we have devoted aggressive investment and business development efforts.</p>

<p>Matsuda summarized the ups and downs of the cryptocurrency market in 2021 and 2022 before attempting to explain its fall. He claimed that <strong>although new technologies sometimes generate &#8220;confusion,&#8221; they eventually become accepted as a regular aspect of daily life.</strong> Accordingly, investors shouldn&#8217;t automatically discount the potential of the cryptocurrency market if there is turbulence.</p>

<p>Any technology that can withstand &#8220;societal tides,&#8221; continued Matsuda, will gradually ingrain itself into people&#8217;s lives and eventually give rise to new industries and economic expansion.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Following the excitement and exhilaration that surrounded NFTs and the metaverse in 2021, 2022 was a year of great volatility in the blockchain-related space.

<p>In the letter, <strong>Winklevoss</strong> puts a face on the <strong>340,000 Earn users</strong>, <strong>the “real people” that lent their funds to Genesis</strong>. These people, applying Winklevoss&#8217; reasoning, put their money in the hands of <strong>Barry Silbert</strong> and the <strong>Digital Currency Group</strong>. Reads the letter:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;These users aren’t just numbers on a spreadsheet. They are real people. A single mom who lent her son’s education money to you. A father who lent his son’s bar mitzvah money to you. A husband and wife who lent their life savings to you… They deserve concrete answers and we are here to get them.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Genesis owes Gemini $900 million for money that the exchange lent to it as part of the<strong> Earn</strong> <strong>program</strong>, per the letter Winklevoss released on Twitter.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Earn Update: An Open Letter to <a href="https://twitter.com/BarrySilbert?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@BarrySilbert</a> <a href="https://t.co/kouAviTho4" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/kouAviTho4</a></p>&mdash; Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1609913051427524608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 2, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Winklevoss asserted that Genesis was unable to pay Gemini because DCG owed it money that it had not repaid.</p>



<p>On <strong>December 27</strong>, investors <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156256-gemini-investors-file-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued</a> <strong>Gemini</strong>. Because the Earn program was unregistered and investors were unable to adequately assess its risks, the lawsuit claims that Gemini committed fraud and broke securities laws. In <strong>November</strong>, Earn ceased paying investors.</p>

<p>Silbert responded to Wilkevoss&#8217; letter by denying many claims in a tweet without going into further detail, such as<strong> &#8220;DCG did not borrow $1.675 billion from Genesis” </strong>and<strong> “never missed an interest payment to Genesis and is current on all loans outstanding.”</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>In addition, <strong>Silbert</strong> claimed DCG sent a plan for settling the conflict to Genesis and Winklevoss&#8217; advisors on December 29 <strong>but had not heard back.</strong></p>



<p>According to <a href="https://news.coincu.com/143160-gemini-earn-has-paused-withdrawals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coincu&#8217;s previous article</a>, Gemini Earn&#8217;s product ceased operations as a result of Genesis&#8217; liquidity problems. <strong>FTX</strong> had an effect on the business, and it has been looking to raise money to start up again. Customers&#8217; money is currently locked in<strong> Gemini Earn</strong> and <strong>Genesis</strong>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://tr.cointelegraph.com/news/digital-wallet-announcement-from-the-vice-president" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cointelegraph Turkey</em></a>, <strong>Turkey</strong> intends to employ blockchain technology for the online public services login procedure. Turkish individuals will be verified when logging in to <strong>E-Devlet</strong>, the digital government site used in Turkey to access various public services using a blockchain-based digital identity.</p>



<p>Vice President <strong>Fuat Oktay</strong> discussed digital identification and wallets at the <strong>Digital Turkey 2023 Meeting</strong>. Oktay noted that <strong>the usage of digital identification would make this new application, which focuses on blockchain technology, a revolution for e-government.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Oktay</strong> referred to the blockchain-based application as a revolution for e-government initiatives and added that blockchain would increase the security and usability of online services. The ability for users to keep their digital data on their mobile devices.</p>

<p>And it isn&#8217;t the only application of digital identification. Many actions, including military service, roll call, summons, and dispatch, will be possible with the new system, according to the information provided by <strong>Oktay</strong>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;As a result of the work carried out with the Notaries Union of Turkey, services such as e-appointment, declaration of succession, e-detection and registered vehicle inquiry on behalf of the person you are the heir of were also put into practice.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>By</strong> <strong>the spring of 2018</strong>, Alameda&#8217;s assets had fallen by more than two-thirds, to about <strong>$30 million</strong>, partly because of huge losses on <strong>XRP</strong>, the token of Ripple&#8217;s payments network. Sam Bankman-Fried, Alameda owner, needs more and more capital to stay afloat.</p>



<p><strong>In</strong> <strong>late</strong> <strong>2018</strong>, he promised potential lenders annual returns of up to <strong>20% in cash or cryptocurrency</strong>, according to people familiar with the matter.<a href="https://news.coincu.com/145250-su-zhu-establishing-new-trading-entity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Su Zhu</a> of <strong>Three Arrows Capital</strong> also tweeted that SBF had promised proceeds to raise funds for <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156924-alameda-linked-wallet-transactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alameda</a>.</p>

<p>The first <strong>Binance Blockchain Week conference</strong> was sponsored by Alameda in<strong> January 2019</strong>, and <strong>SBF used the occasion to network with investors and secure finance for his faltering trading company.</strong></p>



<p><strong>FTX</strong> was introduced <strong>later in April 2019</strong> to provide institutional investors with a haven. <strong>Bankman Fried used Alameda to support its expansion after the FTX went live </strong>as the trading firm evolved into the exchange&#8217;s primary market maker. It was always accessible to other traders who wanted to buy from and sell to them. According to those knowledgeable about Alameda&#8217;s strategies,<strong> the exchange periodically took the losing side of a deal to attract customers.</strong></p>

<p>The most recent investigation proved that Alameda was doomed from the start. Instead of simply saving it with borrowed money in 2018, <strong>Bankman Fried later utilized it to launch and support the expansion of the now-defunct FTX cryptocurrency exchange.</strong></p>



<p>The new complaint by the <strong>United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) </strong>argues otherwise, contrary to Bankman Fried&#8217;s earlier assertion that <strong>Alameda and FTX have always operated independently.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Robert</strong> <strong>Lui</strong>, digital asset leader at Deloitte Hong Kong, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We have seen a lot of local brokers and fund managers seeking advice from us about the licensing requirements under the new regulatory regime.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <strong>Legislative Council </strong>last month passed the amendment to the<strong> Anti-Money Laundering </strong>and <strong>Counter-Terrorist Financing Act</strong>, imposing a new licensing regime on virtual-asset service providers from June this year under the purview of the <strong>Securities and Futures Commission (SFC)</strong>.</p>

<p>Virtual assets have a lot of liquidity and market value. Trading services in <a href="https://news.coincu.com/151921-hong-kong-warns-investors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hong Kong</a>-listed ETF futures based on <strong>Bitcoin</strong> and <strong>Ethereum</strong> are currently available to clients without the need for particular extra licenses from brokers. The SFC will still need to give its further permission before offering active trading in virtual assets like cryptocurrencies and related futures products, <strong>Lui</strong> added.</p>



<p>The <strong>SFC</strong> is anticipated to release a consultation paper on how to remove the present prohibition on professional investors or those with at least HK$8 million ($1.03 million) in bankable assets, allowing regular investors access to trading in virtual assets.</p>

<p>With the explosion in demand for virtual assets, the alteration has given Hong Kong&#8217;s ambition of improving its regional center position momentum.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Brokers who want to trade virtual assets for retail investors need to have responsible officers with virtual-asset knowledge. They also need to show the SFC that they have internal controls, client money custody and insurance arrangements to safeguard client interests,” Lui added.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The first two brokerage companies in the city to receive SFC approval to trade virtual assets exclusively for professional clients are GEM-listed <strong>Victory Securities</strong> and <strong>Interactive Brokers.</strong></p>



<p>After the collapse of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157136-ftx-revealed-the-address-of-167-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a>, <strong>Hong Kong </strong>is still open to the policy for investors and brokers to participate in virtual asset trading. However, the authorities still believe that the introduction of regulations will give them better protection.</p>
