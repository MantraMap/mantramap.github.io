Gold, in particular, has been on an upward trajectory, having risen by 3.4% in the past month and over 25% in the last six months.</strong></p>
<h2>Fed&#x2019;s Rate Hike Sparks Surge in Gold and Silver Values</h2>
<p>As of May 3, 2023, the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XAUUSD/">price of gold per ounce</a> has once again surpassed the $2,000 mark, currently trading at $2,057 per unit, representing a 1.18% increase in the past 24 hours. The Fed&#x2019;s rate hike has sparked a flurry of activity on Twitter, with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23preciousmetals&src=trend_click&vertical=trends">precious metals trending</a> and generating numerous discussions and tweets. Meanwhile, <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%201-d&q=how%20to%20buy%20gold&hl=en">global data</a> from Google Trends indicates that the search term &#x201C;how to buy gold&#x201D; reached a perfect score of 100 on Wednesday afternoon, according to 24-hour statistics.</p>

<p>Silver has also been on the rise, with the value of an ounce increasing by 0.87% against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday. Over the past 30 days, silver has seen a <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SILVER/">6% increase</a>, while six-month statistics reveal a 31.5% rise against the greenback. Following the Federal Open Market Committee&#x2019;s (FOMC) decision to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-raises-interest-rate-by-25bps-insists-us-banking-system-is-sound-and-resilient/">raise the benchmark bank rate</a> on Wednesday, chair Jerome Powell emphasized the central bank&#x2019;s unwavering commitment to reducing inflation.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The assessment of the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate is going to be an ongoing one, meeting by meeting,&#x201D; Powell <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/transcript-fed-chief-powells-postmeeting-press-conference-e15c1d7a">remarked</a>. &#x201C;We have to balance the risk of not doing enough and not getting inflation under control against the risk of slowing down economic activity too much. And we thought that this rate hike, along with the meaningful change in our policy statement, was the right way to balance that.&#x201D;</p>

<h2>Crypto Assets Rise While Crude Oil Prices Plummet</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, not only did gold experience a surge in value, but <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com">crypto assets</a> also saw a rise, with bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) surpassing the $29K per unit range and ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) reaching over $1,900 per unit. Both leading crypto assets saw gains ranging from 1.3% to 1.8% against the greenback.</p>

<p>However, market observers also <a href="https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/WTI-Crude-Falls-4-As-Economic-Fears-Trigger-Selloff.html">witnessed</a> a significant drop in crude oil prices on Wednesday, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Brent Blend, Nymex crude, Dubai Crude, and the OPEC Reference Basket all recording losses during the day&#x2019;s trading sessions. This decline in crude prices follows Saudi Arabia and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/saudi-arabia-and-opec-reveal-surprise-oil-production-cut-white-house-insists-cuts-arent-advisable-right-now/">OPEC&#x2019;s decision</a> to cut back on production earlier this week.</p>

<h2>Coinbase ‘Wrongfully Profits’ From Users’ Facial and Fingerprint Scans</h2>
<p>A proposed class action lawsuit, filed Monday in the Northern District of California, alleges that the Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) illegally collects face templates and fingerprints of its customers in violation of Illinois’ biometric privacy law.</p>
<p>Plaintiff Michael Massel, a Coinbase customer, explained that the crypto exchange requires users to upload a government ID and selfie for verification and set up biometric authentication (fingerprint scan) for mobile app login.</p>
<p>“Coinbase collects, stores, possesses, otherwise obtains, uses, and disseminates its users&#8217; biometric data to, amongst other things, further enhance Coinbase and its online ‘app-based’ Platform,” the lawsuit describes, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Coinbase wrongfully profits from the facial and fingerprint scans it has collected or otherwise obtained from its users.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Facial geometry and fingerprint scans are unique, permanent biometric identifiers associated with each user that cannot be changed or replaced if stolen or compromised. Coinbase’s unlawful collection, obtainment, storage, and use of its users&#8217; biometric data expose them to serious and irreversible privacy risks,” the plaintiff detailed.</p>

<p>The Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) has been a major driver of lawsuits against companies across a wide range of industries in recent years. The law requires companies to obtain consent before collecting biometric data, including fingerprints or facial scans, and to let users know how long the data will be kept. According to the complaint:</p>
<blockquote><p>Coinbase has created, collected, and stored thousands of &#8216;face templates&#8217; – highly detailed geometric maps of the face – and fingerprints from countless Illinois residents.</p></blockquote>

The DAME tax targets &#8220;making crypto miners pay for the costs they impose on others&#8221; regarding the environmental impact of crypto mining activities.</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Miners Could Face Gradually Increasing Tax With Biden’s DAME Proposal</h2>
<p>With the White House&#8217;s Council of Economic Advisors expressing alarm over the so-called climate crisis, Biden&#8217;s administration argues that crypto asset mining&#8217;s energy consumption brings about &#8220;negative spillovers on the environment, quality of life, and electricity grids where these firms locate across the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>To address these environmental costs, the White House believes that the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biden-budget-proposal-targets-crypto-investors-using-like-kind-exchange-provision-plan-aims-to-tax-crypto-miners-30/">Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) tax</a> will encourage companies to &#8220;start taking better account of the harms they impose on society.&#8221; The DAME tax intends to levy a gradually increasing tax on crypto asset miners in the United States, ultimately reaching 30%.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2023/05/02/cost-of-cryptomining-dame-tax/">blog post</a>, the White House refers to a recent New York Times article that was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-proponents-accuse-the-new-york-times-of-publishing-one-sided-hit-piece-on-bitcoin-mining/">accused</a> of being a biased &#8220;one-side hit piece&#8221; that relied on dated data while offering no counterarguments. Moreover, the Biden administration includes a comparison between electricity used for mining and power consumption concerning America&#8217;s residential lighting – a tactic viewed as deceptive in making readers believe that technology is stealing energy resources earmarked for human use.</p>

<p>However, this comparison neglects to factor in benefits provided by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/applied-direct-response-ercot-study-shows-bitcoin-mining-is-beneficial-to-the-texas-grid/">applied direct response systems</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/dsbatten/status/1528904169322840064?s=21">current research findings</a> from ESG analyst Daniel Batten. The Biden administration&#8217;s message fails to acknowledge renewable energy sources leveraged by bitcoin miners or how mining can mitigate flare emissions.</p>
<p>Even so, the White House contends that miners who utilize renewable energy actually &#8220;reduce the amount of clean power available for other uses,&#8221; leading to increased prices for consumers. The term &#8220;dirty&#8221; is employed numerous times when referencing supposedly &#8220;dirtier sources of electricity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lastly, the White House highlights that the DAME tax represents &#8220;only one example of the administration&#8217;s efforts to fight climate change.&#8221; It serves as merely the &#8220;start of having crypto miners pay their fair share of the costs imposed on local communities and the environment.&#8221;</p>

This marks the tenth consecutive occasion in which the Fed has raised interest rates since the initial 25bps increase in March 2022.</strong></p>
<h2>FOMC Announcement Says ‘Additional Policy Firming May Be Appropriate’</h2>
<p>At 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time, the central bank raised the benchmark interest rate citing that economic activity expanded “at a modest pace in the first quarter.” The Fed’s <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230503a.htm">announcement</a> noted that unemployment has been low but “inflation remains elevated.” The FOMC announcement further addressed the issues in the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-chase-assumes-control-of-first-republic-bank-following-seizure-by-california-regulators/">U.S. banking industry</a> and the committee emphasized that the “U.S. banking system is sound and resilient.”</p>
<p>The Fed&#8217;s unbroken chain of rate hikes is a testament to the bank&#8217;s unwavering commitment to getting inflation down. The FOMC’s press release notes a priority to get the inflation rate down to the 2% range. “In support of these goals, the committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 5 to 5-1/4 percent,” the FOMC said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The news caused all four major U.S. benchmark stock indexes to jump, alongside a modest spike in <a href="https://www.kitco.com/market/">precious metals</a> and <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/">crypto markets</a>. However, investors at the time were still waiting to hear what Fed chairman Jerome Powell had to say concerning rates going forward. It’s been speculated that the Fed will stop its rate hikes for the rest of the calendar year.</p>

<p>While some market observers expect the central bank to pivot and cut the benchmark bank rate, the FOMC said the committee still anticipates that some “additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time.” The FOMC message does not explain whether or not the Fed will keep the rate the same at the meeting in June.</p>
<p>During the press conference, Powell <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/03/live-updates-fed-decision-may-2023.html">addressed</a> the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-warns-us-could-default-on-its-debt-by-june-1/">U.S. debt limit</a> and expressed hope that a resolution would be reached. Consistent with his previous statements, the Fed believes that failure to raise the debt limit could lead to financial disruption. As for the Fed&#8217;s next move, Powell stated that the central bank is “prepared to do more if greater monetary policy is warranted.”</p>

With 10,487 BRC20 tokens built using Ordinals and a swelling market capitalization exceeding $95 million, this new development has the crypto world buzzing.</strong></p>
<h2>Ordinals Protocol Witnesses 3 Million Inscriptions While BRC20 Tokens Drive Bitcoin&#x2019;s Mempool into Overdrive</h2>
<p>The Bitcoin community is abuzz with <a href="https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1653508862631084036?s=20">conversations</a> surrounding the <a href="https://twitter.com/OrdinalLabs/status/1652603453980434432?s=20">BRC20 token standard</a> after its <a href="https://twitter.com/domodata/status/1634247606262964228">introduction</a> by a pseudonymous developer named Domo in March. BRC20 tokens leverage the Ordinals protocol, enabling creators to mint fungible crypto assets onchain with ease. To create a BRC20 coin, individuals need to encode a JSON data object containing critical token information. Like an ERC20 token contract on Ethereum, this data would encompass fundamental details such as the token&#x2019;s name, symbol, and total supply.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The impressive issuance of <a href="https://ordspace.org/brc20">over 10,500 BRC20 tokens</a> &#x2014; alongside the surge of Ordinal inscriptions <a href="https://ordinals.com/">surpassing 3 million</a> &#x2014; has led to a backlog of over <a href="https://mempool.space/">200,000 unconfirmed transactions</a> in Bitcoin&#x2019;s mempool. A comprehensive list of these 10K+ BRC20 coins can be found at ordspace.org, displaying each token&#x2019;s value in US dollars. Currently standing at a remarkable $95 million, the BRC20 token economy has witnessed tokens skyrocketing with quadruple-digit gains.</p>

<p>Notable examples of these tokens include ordi, $OG$, PEPE, MEME, PUNK, SHIB, and DOMO. The ordi market cap today is hovering above $52 million; the $OG$ token market cap sits at $7.9 million, and the PEPE BRC20 coin&#x2019;s market valuation rests at $8.3 million as of May 3, 2023. This rise of BRC20 tokens and Ordinal inscriptions, predominantly comprised of text, has driven Bitcoin&#x2019;s average and median-sized fees to soar.</p>

<p>Data from bitinfocharts.com on May 3, 2023, reveals that the <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3y">average onchain Bitcoin transaction fee</a> is 0.00025 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> or $7.05 per transaction, equating to roughly 0.0000011 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> per byte. Additionally, the <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-median_transaction_fee.html">median-sized transfer fee</a> is 0.00012 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> or $3.46 per transaction, according to metrics compiled by bitinfocharts.com. The flood of BRC20s and Ordinal inscriptions has reignited a heated <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=BRC-20&src=typed_query">debate</a> over whether the fungible tokens and non-fungible token (NFT) concepts built on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> justify confirmation alongside financial transactions.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your thoughts on the growing trend of creating fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain using the Ordinals protocol? Do you think the surge in BRC20 tokens justifies the high transaction fees and the backlog of unconfirmed transactions in Bitcoin&#x2019;s mempool?

The global crypto market cap was up by nearly 1% earlier in the day, as Tuesday’s losses eased. Solana, on the other hand, remained lower, as it fell towards a key price floor.</strong></p>
<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) edged higher on Wednesday, as the token moved away from a recent point of support.</p>
<p>Following a low at $0.954 on Tuesday, MATIC/USD jumped to a peak of $0.9925 earlier in today’s session.</p>
<p>As a result of the move, polygon bounced from a recent price floor of $0.950, after recently falling to a multi-week low.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, Wednesday’s surge led to the relative strength index (RSI) colliding with a long-term ceiling of 40.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 39.22, with MATIC at a level of $0.9813.</p>
<p>Despite earlier gains easing, there is still optimism that polygon could climb back above $1.00 this week.</p>

<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>On the other hand, solana (SOL) remained in the red, as the token moved back towards a recent price floor.</p>
<p>SOL/USD retreated to a low of $21.36 earlier in today’s session, less than 24 hours after the token traded at a high of $22.37.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s drop in price has sent SOL close to its long-term support point at $21.00, which was last hit a week ago.</p>

<p>From the chart, it appears that today’s decline came as the RSI made a move for its own floor at 45.00</p>
<p>As of writing, price strength is tracking at 45.17, with bears likely to push for a breakout in the coming hours.</p>
<p>Should this occur, there is a chance that SOL could move closer to $20.00 in the coming days.</p>

The research aimed to understand the level of security and trustworthiness of the wallet, and to identify any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that could be exploited by malicious actors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The findings of the research were largely positive, with the Trust Wallet receiving high marks for its security features and overall reliability. The wallet was found to use strong encryption and multi-factor authentication to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Furthermore, the researchers noted: “Trust Wallet has a strong track record of timely security updates and patching of any identified vulnerabilities.”</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This demonstrates a commitment to ensuring the ongoing security of the wallet and its users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the research conducted by </span><a href="http://twitter.com/ax1vc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AX1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> company provides valuable insights into the security and trustworthiness of the Trust Wallet. While the wallet was found to be generally secure and reliable, there are areas where it could potentially be improved to provide even greater levels of protection for its users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the hardware-based security features, the research also recommended that Trust Wallet could benefit from further transparency and openness regarding its security measures. This could include more frequent public disclosures of any identified vulnerabilities, as well as a clear and comprehensive security policy that outlines the measures in place to protect user data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AX1’s research also highlighted the importance of user education and awareness when it comes to maintaining the security of cryptocurrency wallets like Trust Wallet. Users should be encouraged to take proactive measures to protect their own data, such as using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and regularly updating their software.</span></p>

While the wallet was found to be generally secure and reliable, there is always room for improvement when it comes to protecting user data and preventing unauthorized access. By implementing the recommendations outlined in the research, Trust Wallet could further enhance its security measures and provide even greater peace of mind for its users.</span></p>

This joint venture, named &#8220;Operation Spector,&#8221; successfully dismantled the darknet marketplace (DNM) Monopoly Market and confiscated its infrastructure back in December 2021.</strong></p>
<h2>Monopoly Market Taken Down via a Consortium of Global Law Enforcement Officials</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/largest-international-operation-against-darknet-trafficking-fentanyl-and-opioids-results">U.S. Justice Department</a> and Europol <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/288-dark-web-vendors-arrested-in-major-marketplace-seizure">reveal</a> that officials from around the globe collaborated to bring down the DNM Monopoly Market, resulting in the arrest of 288 individuals throughout the investigation. The statement discloses that Monopoly was captured in December 2021 and led to over 100 federal investigations and prosecutions within the United States. In January 2022, an anonymous DNM and Tor researcher known as &#8220;Dark.fail&#8221; noted that Monopoly&#8217;s servers had been seized.</p>
<p>“Alert — Monopoly Market&#8217;s servers were seized by their host, very likely law enforcement action,” Dark.fail <a href="https://twitter.com/DarkDotFail/status/1487227934347866112?s=20">tweeted</a> at the time. “If you conducted blockchain/cyber research on this platform be aware that your transaction history may be in unknown hands.”</p>

<p>Europol stated that German authorities apprehended the DNM and started gathering evidence which “served as the foundation for hundreds of national investigations.&#8221; The officials also highlighted that Monopoly vendors held prominent positions on other well-known DNMs. The apprehended suspects were classified as &#8220;high-value targets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Europol&#8217;s executive director, Catherine De Bolle, commented: “This operation sends a strong message to criminals on the dark web: international law enforcement has the means and the ability to identify and hold you accountable for your illegal activities, even on the dark web.” Authorities emphasized that Operation Spector achieved greater success than its two predecessors, <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/international-sting-against-dark-web-vendors-leads-to-179-arrests">Operation Disruptor</a>, and <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/150-arrested-in-dark-web-drug-bust-police-seize-%E2%82%AC26-million">Operation Dark Huntor</a>.</p>

<p>In April 2022, German and U.S. law enforcement collaborated to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/germany-shuts-down-hydra-market-seizes-servers-and-bitcoin/">shut down the massive Russian DNM Hydra</a>, seizing EUR 23 million in cryptocurrencies. Despite the success of all of these operations, DNMs continue to proliferate, very much like the mythical creature Hydra, with its ability to regenerate its body parts.</p>
<p>Currently, DNM patrons have a plethora of options to choose from, including Tor2door Market, ASAP Market, Abacus Market, Vice City Market, Archetyp Market, Bohemia Market, Incognito Market, Gammagoblin, Psycellium, Flugsvamp 4.0, Mega Darknet Market, and Cypher Market, among others.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) rebounded on Wednesday, as all focus in the market turned to today&#x2019;s Federal Reserve rate decision .</p>
<p>Following a low of $27,935.73 on Tuesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD surged to an intraday high of $28,881.30 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>This came as after bitcoin rejected a breakout below its long-term floor at $27,600 to start the week.</p>

<p>Overall, momentum has shifted marginally higher, as the 10-day (red) moving average approached its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>
<p>Should this upwards crossover occur, this could be a signal that bulls need to intensify pressure, and potentially take <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> back above $30,000.</p>
<p>In order for this to occur, the relative strength index (RSI) will first need to surge past a ceiling at the 52.00 mark.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also bounced back on hump-day, as bulls began to reenter the market.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD rose to a peak of 1,879.76 on Wednesday, after almost falling below $1,800 the day prior.</p>
<p>The move saw ethereum bulls briefly push price above a ceiling at $1,875, before retreating as the session matured.</p>

<p>Earlier gains eased as price strength was unable to rally past a key point of resistance at 48.00, with the index now tracking at 46.99.</p>
<p>Despite this, there is still some optimism that ethereum could move beyond $1,900 later today, once the rate decision is made.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> is trading at $1,859.53.</p>
