<p>Marseille, France, May 24th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>In an age where the crypto world is dominated by GameFi, DeFi, NFTs, and meme coins, Hestia is revolutionizing the industry by demonstrating how cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology can be applied to traditional economic projects.</p><p>Hestia, a groundbreaking decentralized freelance platform, is harnessing the power of decentralization to hustle the gig economy and empower freelancers and clients alike.</p><p>The Hestia project stands out from its crypto counterparts by focusing on real-world applications and creating a sustainable ecosystem for a broad range of industries. By leveraging the advantages of blockchain technology, Hestia offers an innovative economic model that enables fair distribution of power, wealth, and community governance.</p><p>A New Economic Model: Decentralization at Its Core</p><p>Hestia's decentralized approach sets it apart from traditional freelance platforms, which often suffer from centralization issues and associated inefficiencies. By eliminating the need for a central authority, Hestia provides a more transparent, equitable, and efficient ecosystem for freelancers and clients to connect and collaborate.</p><p>Hestia's dual-token system, comprising the stable HTX token and the growth-focused HTI token, enables seamless transactions within the platform while fostering the development of the ecosystem. The HTX token is indexed to USDT, providing a stable medium of exchange, while the HTI token is designed for use in exchanging HTX for other tokens or fiat currencies, as well as financing the Hestia ecosystem.</p><p>The platform's unique tokenomics ensures that users can access its services without subscription fees or hidden costs. A modest 5% fee on token swaps between HTX and HTI is the only charge, which is used to support the platform's ongoing operation, maintenance, and evolution.</p><p>Community Governance: Empowering Users</p><p>Hestia's commitment to community governance allows users to participate directly in decision- making processes, creating a more inclusive, transparent, and democratic ecosystem. Token holders can vote on proposals, contribute to platform development, and help shape the future of the Hestia network.</p><p>Bridging the Gap Between Crypto and Traditional Industries</p><p>By combining the best of blockchain technology with a focus on real-world applications, Hestia is challenging the notion that cryptocurrencies are only suitable for niche projects like GameFi, DeFi, NFTs, and meme coins. The platform's innovative approach demonstrates how blockchain can transform traditional industries and drive meaningful change in people's lives.</p><p>About Hestia</p><p>Hestia is a testament to the versatility and potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. By creating a decentralized, user-driven freelance platform, Hestia is paving the way for a more equitable, transparent, and efficient future for freelancers and clients around the globe.</p><p>For more information please visit the Hestia project, website: https://hestia-project.com/</p>ContactLou ThierryHestiacontact@hestia-project.com
