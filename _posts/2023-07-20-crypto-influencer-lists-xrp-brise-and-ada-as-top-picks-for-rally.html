<p>Crypto influencer JefferyCrypt took to Twitter earlier today to share his hottest crypto picks for maximum gains in the next bull run. According to the influencer, XRP, Bitgert (BRISE) and Cardano (ADA) are likely to perform well in the near future and are poised for an upward movement in the dynamic and ever-evolving crypto space. </p>
<p>According to JefferyCrypt, Ripple&rsquo;s recent victory in the lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made XRP an attractive prospect for crypto investors. The influencer told his followers on Twitter that the court victory provided much-needed legal and regulatory clarity surrounding XRP and that it had restored investors' confidence in the cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>Data from CoinMarketCap showed that XRP was trading at $0.81 at the time of writing. The crypto has gained more than 70% since the summary judgment in SEC v Ripple. The online sentiment regarding XRP is divided, with some experts anticipating a further rally while others warned of a potential decline in case the SEC decides to appeal the court&rsquo;s ruling. </p>
The JefferyCrypt&rsquo;s second pick was Bitgert&rsquo;s native token BRISE. 
<p>According to the crypto influencer, Bitgert is a rising project in the blockchain space that offers innovative solutions and a fundamental value proposition. At the time of writing, BRISE was trading at $0.00000025, with a market capitalization of $102 million and a daily trading volume of $2.5 million. </p>
<p>JefferyCrypt&rsquo;s last pick was ADA, the native token of the Cardano blockchain. The influencer cited Cardano&rsquo;s advancements in blockchain research and peer-reviewed approach as the reason for including the token in his top altcoin picks. ADA is currently trading at $0.32, up 2.9% over the past 24 hours. </p>
<p>The influencer cited the summary judgment in Ripple v SEC as a major factor for his altcoin picks. According to him, the court ruling provided regulatory clarity regarding the security status of the above-mentioned tokens, which assured investors of their regulatory compliance. </p>
