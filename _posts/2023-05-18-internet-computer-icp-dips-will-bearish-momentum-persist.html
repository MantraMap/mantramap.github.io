Since the beginning of this month, ICP has exhibited range-bound behavior. ICP price has fluctuated between $6 &#8211; $5, resulting in a sideway price movement. The question is whether the bearish momentum will continue or if there&#8217;s a chance for a reversal soon. Bears To Hold Current Trend, Or Will The Bulls Rebuild Momentum?

The Internet Computer Fear &#38; Greed Index is 50 based on investor sentiment and market psychology. A value of 50 suggests that neither fear nor greed is dominant among traders and investors. Based on the recent increase in the overall ICP&#8217;s price movement, the bulls are gradually taking control of the market. If this momentum persists, ICP might rise significantly in the next few weeks. ICP Technical Outlook Using Indicators The asset is trading above its 200-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This indicates a long-term bullish trend and presents a potential buy opportunity for traders and investors. While ICP&#8217;s long-term prospects are bullish, there may be potential short-term uncertainties that need to be considered by traders. For instance, the Relative Strength Index is showing 47.46. This shows that there&#8217;s market indecision between buyers and sellers. Also, the pressure currently in the market is neutral. Also, the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicates a potential bearish trend as the MACD is trading below its signal line.

Internet Computer now trades between its direct support and resistance levels of $4.923 and $6.860. The next significant support level is $3.302, while the resistance level is $8.251. If the bulls maintain this growing momentum, ICP might break the primary resistance level of $6.860 before heading toward the next resistance level.
