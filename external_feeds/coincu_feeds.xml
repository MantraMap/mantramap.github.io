<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>South Korea&#8217;s Financial Services Commission is developing a stablecoin regulatory regime and reviewing efforts to establish a virtual asset disclosure system.</em></li>



<li><em>The Virtual Asset User Protection Act passed by the National Assembly is a &#8220;first step bill&#8221; focusing on investor protection, with plans for a &#8220;Phase 2 Act&#8221; to be developed based on the Financial Services Commission&#8217;s recommendations.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>South Korea&#8217;s Financial Services Commission (FSC) is making significant strides in the regulation of cryptocurrencies by developing a stablecoin regulatory regime and establishing a virtual asset disclosure system. The move comes as the country seeks to bolster investor protection and enhance the oversight of the rapidly evolving virtual asset market.</strong></h5>

<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.news1.kr/articles/?5116454" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">News1</a></em>, the recently passed <a href="https://coincu.com/199125-south-korea-passed-important-crypto-act/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Virtual Asset User Protection Act</a>, hailed as a &#8220;first step bill,&#8221; emphasizes safeguarding the interests of investors in the cryptocurrency space. Building upon this initial legislation, the FSC is now focusing on formulating the &#8220;Phase 2 Act,&#8221; which will encompass a comprehensive set of regulations related to the issuance of virtual assets and the regulatory framework governing different types of cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>To ensure a robust regulatory framework, the FSC has initiated a research service to review opinions and suggestions put forward by the National Assembly regarding virtual assets. The objective is to identify areas of improvement and legislative considerations to bolster the regulatory system surrounding cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>One of the critical aspects being examined is the issue of conflicts of interest that may arise during the issuance and distribution of virtual assets by cryptocurrency operators. By addressing these potential conflicts head-on, the FSC aims to create an environment that is more transparent, accountable, and secure for both investors and market participants.</p>



<p>In terms of the specific types of virtual assets, the FSC is planning to establish a regulatory system that caters to the nuances and characteristics of different cryptocurrencies. This will include stablecoins, which are digital assets pegged to a stable reserve, as well as security tokens and utility tokens, each with unique features that necessitate appropriate regulatory oversight.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1482.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="411" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1482.png" alt="South Korea Is Developing Phase 2 Of Virtual Asset User Protection Act" class="wp-image-204717" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1482.png 680w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1482-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" title="South Korea Is Developing Phase 2 Of Virtual Asset User Protection Act 9"></a></figure></div>


<p>The regulatory system will also encompass virtual asset evaluation businesses, advisory businesses, and public disclosure businesses. By bringing these entities within the regulatory purview, the FSC intends to enhance transparency and accountability in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://coincu.com/201600-south-korea-accounting-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FSC</a> is exploring the possibility of creating a system that can provide integrated market prices and comprehensive disclosures in line with relevant regulations. Such a system will contribute to a more transparent and efficient market, benefitting investors and stakeholders alike.</p>



<p>Moreover, in the event of unforeseen incidents or accidents in the cryptocurrency space, the FSC is contemplating regulations that can shift the burden of proof. This approach, similar to the Electronic Financial Transaction Act, aims to establish clear accountability and responsibility in case of any adverse occurrences.</p>



<p>Notably, the FSC is keeping a keen eye on global legislative and regulatory trends concerning virtual assets. Through a comprehensive study of the approaches and methods adopted by major countries and international organizations, the FSC intends to learn from global best practices and align <a href="https://coincu.com/202403-south-korea-moves-to-security-tokens/">South Korea</a>&#8216;s regulatory requirements accordingly.</p>



<p>The FSC&#8217;s proactive stance in developing a stablecoin regulatory regime and advancing the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies reflects the country&#8217;s commitment to fostering a well-regulated and secure virtual asset market. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, ensuring investor protection and market integrity remains a top priority for South Korea&#8217;s financial authorities. The development of a robust regulatory framework is expected to contribute to the sustainable growth and maturity of the virtual asset ecosystem in the country.</p>

<p>The crypto market capitalization ended the period on a positive note, showing signs of recovery. Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance reached its highest level since April 2021, with an impressive year-to-date price performance of over 87%, outperforming many traditional financial investments. The emergence of Ordinals and Inscriptions has energized the Bitcoin ecosystem, promising continued development and innovation in the coming months.</p>



<p>The first half saw significant developments in Layer 1 networks, with Ethereum&#8217;s liquid staking reaching new heights, giving rise to LSTfi. BNB Chain focused on scalability, while Solana and Tron made notable strides in their respective ecosystems. Avalanche and Cosmos also advanced through subnets, partnerships, and shared economic security models.</p>

<p>In the Layer 2 space, optimistic rollups remained dominant, while ZK rollups achieved new heights with the launch of fully functional zkEVMs. The industry witnessed a convergence of major players around the concept of networks of blockchains, such as L3s, Superchains, and Hyperchains.</p>



<p>The stablecoin sector underwent significant reshaping, with USDT experiencing a remarkable 25.8% increase in market share YTD, leading it to break away from the major trio of stablecoins.</p>



<p>DeFi demonstrated remarkable growth, driven by the ascent of liquid staking and user migration to DEXes. However, DeFi&#8217;s dominance experienced a slight decline compared to the overall crypto market.</p>



<p>NFTs saw higher trading volume in H1 2023, driven by increased activity on the Blur marketplace. However, NFT collections&#8217; floor prices declined YTD, underperforming the broader crypto market.</p>



<p>Gaming-related tokens experienced positive price trends, benefiting from the market recovery. Over 67% of games are built on <a href="https://coincu.com/204375-binance-shorter-deposit-eth-arbitrum-optimism/">BNB Chain</a>, Ethereum, and Polygon.</p>



<p>According to Binancee&#8217;s report the first half witnessed a decline in overall crypto deal activities and venture capital funding. Infrastructure projects attracted the most investments, followed by gaming/entertainment and DeFi.</p>

<li><em>Ripple&#8217;s CTO, David Schwartz, warns of a fake website &#8220;<a href="http://holdxrp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holdxrp.com</a>&#8221; that is trying to form an affiliation with XRP. </em></li>



<li><em>The fake airdrop announcement features a phishing link that could exploit user&#8217;s funds. XRP community members need to be vigilant as many scams have been linked to Ripple as a whole. </em></li>



<li><em>Bad actors exist in crypto, so announcements that do not come from verified Ripple platforms should be ignored.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>David Schwartz, the Chief Technical Officer (CTO) of Ripple Labs Inc, has recently taken to Twitter to warn cryptocurrency enthusiasts about a fraudulent website attempting to form an affiliation with the XRP coin. </strong></h5>

<p>His warning was directed towards a website called &#8220;<a href="http://holdxrp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holdxrp.com</a>&#8220;, which he identified as a scam site, and urged users to be very careful.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">CAUTION: holdxrp . com is a scam site.</p>&mdash; David &quot;JoelKatz&quot; Schwartz (@JoelKatz) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoelKatz/status/1682277705801400320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 21, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Although not recommended, a visit to the website shows an interface that is similar to Medium and features an announcement of a fake airdrop. The announcement contains a blog post from Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple Labs Inc, and has surprisingly received over 5,000 claps, which is possibly an attempt to make the website appear more legitimate. However, the announcement contains phishing links that may cause users to lose their funds. The site creators even impersonated industry experts like BitBoy Crypto, Carl from the Moon, and Crypto Rover to comment on the post, further displaying their fraudulent behavior.</p>

<p>Scams related to XRP and Ripple have been increasing since Judge Analisa Torres declared that secondary sales of the cryptocurrency are not securities. Many bad actors are taking advantage of the high social interest in the token by creating fake airdrops and giveaways to lure unsuspecting community members. While David Schwartz has been warning about these types of scams for some time, it is worth noting that genuine XRP-linked Twitter accounts have also been calling for boycotts of fraudulent websites.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Thodex founder sentenced to 7 months for document failure.</em></li>



<li><em>The Turkish crypto exchange collapse leaves $2 billion in losses.</em></li>



<li><em>Özer maintains innocence and faces fraud accusations.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The founder and former CEO of Thodex, Faruk Fatih Özer, has been sentenced to seven months and 15 days in prison for failing to submit requested documents during his trial.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1462.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="865" height="486" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1462.png" alt="Thodex Founder Faces Prison Sentence Over Missing Documents And Lost Billions" class="wp-image-204676" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1462.png 865w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1462-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1462-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1462-750x421.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px" title="Thodex Founder Faces Prison Sentence Over Missing Documents And Lost Billions 17"></a></figure></div>


<p>Thodex, once a prominent cryptocurrency exchange in Türkiye, abruptly shut down, leaving investors with approximately $2 billion in lost cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/182770-thodex-founder-arrested-in-turkey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Özer</a>, who had previously been detained and later fled to Albania, was apprehended and deported back to Türkiye following a Red Notice by Interpol. Throughout the trial, Özer maintained his innocence but failed to provide the requested documents to the Tax Inspection Board.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1465.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="929" height="523" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1465.png" alt="Thodex Founder Faces Prison Sentence Over Missing Documents And Lost Billions" class="wp-image-204682" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1465.png 929w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1465-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1465-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1465-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px" title="Thodex Founder Faces Prison Sentence Over Missing Documents And Lost Billions 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>He argued that he was not the official representative of Thodex during the specified period and, therefore could not present the requested books. Özer claimed that a trustee had been appointed to manage the business on his behalf during that time.</p>



<p>Initially, Özer <a href="https://coincu.com/121107-thodex-ceo-faces-extradition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">faced</a> potential charges of &#8220;smuggling&#8221; under the Tax Procedure Law, which could have led to a five-year prison sentence. However, the court initially sentenced him to one year and six months, which was later reduced to seven months and 15 days, taking into account factors such as Özer’s social relations and conduct during the trial.</p>



<p>Apart from tax-related charges, Özer also faces accusations of defrauding Thodex investors, and a hearing on these claims is pending.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1464.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="695" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1464-1024x695.png" alt="Thodex Founder Faces Prison Sentence Over Missing Documents And Lost Billions" class="wp-image-204678" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1464-1024x695.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1464-300x204.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1464-768x521.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1464-1536x1042.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1464-2048x1389.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1464-750x509.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1464-1140x773.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Thodex Founder Faces Prison Sentence Over Missing Documents And Lost Billions 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>As the legal proceedings continue, the case of Faruk Fatih Özer and Thodex serves as a reminder of the complexities surrounding cryptocurrency regulation and taxation. It highlights the need for transparency, accountability, and robust regulatory frameworks to protect investors and ensure the integrity of digital asset exchanges.</p>



<p>In a related context, a recent study by Swedish crypto tax firm Divly <a href="https://divly.com/en/guides/global-crypto-tax-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that a vast majority of crypto investors, approximately 99.5%, did not pay taxes in 2022. While some countries like Finland and <a href="https://coincu.com/203830-australian-regulator-cancels-ftx-license/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Australia</a> had a small percentage of crypto investors fulfilling their tax obligations, the report acknowledged the limitations of using search volume data to estimate the actual number of crypto taxpayers.</p>



<p>Notwithstanding these developments, Özer’s legal troubles are far from done, as he is still accused of scamming Thodex investors and is awaiting a hearing to answer these claims. The entrepreneur maintains his innocence and claims that the accused have set him up.</p>
