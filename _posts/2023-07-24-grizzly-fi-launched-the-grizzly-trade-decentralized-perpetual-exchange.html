<p>Grizzly.Fi, the trailblazing DeFi platform committed to democratizing innovative financial solutions, has shared a momentous announcement that transcends its vibrant community.</p>
<p>On July 21, 2023, Grizzly Trade, their decentralized perpetual platform built on opBNB in collaboration with Metavault Trade, officially launched on BNB Mainnet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This highly anticipated release marks the platform's advancement into a new realm alongside its existing range of earning products, further benefiting the Grizzly ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
The First Decentralized Perpetuals on opBNB
<p>Grizzly, one of the most promising projects in the DeFi span, has launched its decentralized perpetual exchange, Grizzly Trade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This strategic expansion marks a significant milestone for the Grizzly Ecosystem, as it taps into a new market and propels the platform towards its vision of becoming a decentralized hub for DeFi's finest utilities.</p>
<p>In collaboration with Metavault Trade, Grizzly.Fi has extended its product line to include a futures trading platform, providing additional benefits to the Grizzly ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The opBNB (BNB Layer 2) deployment process commenced on June 30, 2023, and made Grizzly Trade available for testing. Following the initial deployment on the opBNB Testnet, the platform was also launched on the BNB mainnet on July 21.</p>
<p>Grizzly Trade allows users to trade blue-chip cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, and BNB with leverage of up to 50x while ensuring a fully non-custodial experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform boasts an intuitive and user-friendly interface, providing a glimpse of the upcoming V2 update, which aims to transform the growing ecosystem into a beginner-friendly crypto hub.</p>
<p>Beyond its appeal as a new product catering to a broader audience, Grizzly Trade plays a vital role within the Grizzly ecosystem, serving as a lucrative real yield source for yield farmers. By providing liquidity, users can earn 50% of all platform fees while simultaneously being exposed to BTC, ETH, BNB, and stablecoins.</p>
<p>One of the most notable features of Grizzly Trade is the built-in Buyback &amp; Burn functionality for Grizzly's native token, "GHNY." This unique feature utilizes 25% of all generated platform fees to purchase GHNY from the open market and burn it. This mechanism effectively curbs inflation, transforming GHNY into an ultrasound (deflationary) token.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grizzly Trade not only expands the potential market size by introducing a utility already utilized by thousands of individuals regularly but also stabilizes inflation and drives the protocol's traction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It signifies an important step towards achieving the overarching goal of the Grizzly ecosystem: to lead and onboard the next million users into DeFi.</p>
Win Big with GrizzlyFi's "Trade to Earn" and "Trade to Win" Challenges!
<p>In parallel with this launch and to celebrate it, GrizzlyFi establishes new trading challenges to reward and encourage new users to explore the platform: 'Trade to Earn' and 'Trade to Win.' With these two challenges, users can win impressive prizes from a reward pool of $20,000 in the 'Trade to Earn' challenge with a $1,000 transaction volume. Also, they can compete for some of the $50,000 and $30,000 prize pools in the 'Trade to Win Beginner' and 'Trade to Win Pro' challenges, respectively.&nbsp;</p>
