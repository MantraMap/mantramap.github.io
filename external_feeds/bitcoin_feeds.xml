He explained that Tesla sales have depended in part on the perception that CEO Elon Musk &#8220;is a cool guy&#8221; while the price of bitcoin is &#8220;being sustained by a hard-core group of true believers.&#8221;<br />
</strong></p>
<h2>Paul Krugman Compares Tesla to Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Paul Krugman, who won the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel in 2008 for his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity, published an opinion piece in the New York Times Tuesday about Tesla, bitcoin, and their huge valuations. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tesla and bitcoin may have more in common than you think.</p></blockquote>
<p>The economist explained that mega-corporations like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon have maintained their dominance because these companies &#8220;benefit from strong network externalities — loosely speaking, everyone uses their products because everyone else uses their products.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to see what would give Tesla a long-term lock on the electric vehicle business,&#8221; Krugman described. &#8220;Where are the powerful network externalities in the electric vehicle business?&#8221; he questioned, emphasizing: &#8220;Electric vehicle production just doesn&#8217;t look like a network externality business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Krugman continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s hard to explain the huge valuation the market put on Tesla before the [price] drop, or even its current value.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Nobel Prize laureate proceeded to explain &#8220;why Tesla was ever worth so much.&#8221; He believes that it&#8217;s because “investors fell in love with a storyline about a brilliant, cool innovator, despite the absence of a good argument about how this guy, even if he really was who he appeared to be, could found a long-lived money machine.&#8221; Krugman added: &#8220;Tesla sales have surely depended at least in part on the perception that Musk himself is a cool guy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Describing a parallel between Tesla and bitcoin, the Nobel Prize-winning economist detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite years of effort, nobody has yet managed to find any serious use for cryptocurrency other than money laundering. But prices nonetheless soared on the hype, and are still being sustained by a hard-core group of true believers.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Something similar surely happened with Tesla, even though the company does actually make useful things,&#8221; Krugman concluded.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Tesla&#8217;s stock has fallen 70% year-to-date while bitcoin&#8217;s price has dropped 65% during the same time period.</p>

On Dec. 29, 2022, Trump’s NFT collection has a floor value of 0.15 ether, which is around 81% lower than the floor value highs recorded last week.</strong></p>
<h2>Trump Digital Collectibles Slide Significantly in Value Since the Launch, After Looking at the Art Trump Was Pleased With His 30-Inch Waistline</h2>
<p>The 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump, recently released 45,000 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and during the first day of the sale, each NFT was sold for $99 per unit. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/trump-launches-nft-card-collection-sweepstake-winners-could-dine-or-golf-with-the-45th-president/">Trump’s NFTs</a> started trading on secondary NFT markets on Dec. 15, 2022 and had a floor value of around 0.1 ether or around $125 for the most inexpensive Trump NFTs. Two days later, Bitcoin.com News reported on how Trump’s NFTs <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/donald-trump-trading-card-nfts-skyrocket-in-value-despite-being-mocked-for-his-major-announcement/">skyrocketed</a> in value after being mocked by a large number of left-leaning political commentators.</p>

<p>The same day, on Dec. 17, 2022, Trump’s NFT floor price jumped to an all-time high of around 0.79 ether or around $940 per unit, <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/trump-digital-trading-cards/analytics">according to stats</a> from the leading NFT marketplace Opensea. Since then, however, Trump’s NFT collection has seen its floor price slip all the way down to 0.15 ether ($180), which is 8.54% lower than the floor values recorded 24 hours ago. Metrics indicate that on Dec. 29, 2022, <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/trump-digital-trading-cards/activity?search[eventTypes][0]=AUCTION_CREATED">9%</a> or 3,864 Trump NFTs are listed on Opensea, and in total, there are roughly 15,083 unique Trump NFT card owners.</p>
<p>9,801 of those unique owners hold only one Trump NFT in their wallet while 2,556 own at least two Trump NFTs. 79 owners hold around 45 Trump NFTs, which means they will get an invite to the Trump gala dinner in South Florida, at least according to the terms of service agreement on the <a href="https://collecttrumpcards.com/">collecttrumpcards.com</a> website. Four owners hold 60 NFTs from the Trump collection and seven wallets hold 100 Trump NFTs. There’s also one owner with approximately 1,000 Trump NFTs in their wallet.</p>

<p>Trump told the press last week that his NFT collection was not about making money and it was more about the art and a trim waistline. “Well, I knew nothing about [the NFTs] and then a group came, and I loved the art,” Trump told <a href="https://twitter.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1606613227281989635?s=20&amp;t=sRycuJsvyjoHiIDAnfAhNQ">OAN</a>. “You know, it’s sort of comic book art when you think of it, but they showed me the art and I said, gee, I always wanted to have a 30-inch waist.” The former U.S. president added:</p>
<blockquote><p>I heard somebody [once say] it was the investment of the year. I didn’t view it as an investment. I thought they were cute. These visions are very beautiful [and] interesting.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since the Trump digital trading cards entered secondary sales markets, Opensea details that 7,720 ether or $9.2 million in sales volume has been recorded to date. Additionally, onchain tracking data via the Telegram group “Onchain Intrigue” shows the “Trump NFT admin” wallet moved 128 wrapped ether (WETH) worth more than $153K to six different Polygon wallets on Dec. 28, 2022. Trump said that the digital cards were expected to sell out in roughly six months, but the sale proved to be much faster.</p>
<p>“Wow, that’s sorta cute,” Trump said of his own NFT collection before the sale. “That might sell, that might sell. They thought it would sell in six months, it sold in six hours,” the former U.S. president added.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about Trump&#8217;s &#8216;sorta cute&#8217; NFT cards and their market performance since the collection of 45,000 NFTs launched? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.</strong> </em></p>

While coin market capitalization aggregation sites allow patrons to add their favorite coins to a watchlist, between coingecko.com and coinmarketcap.com, bitcoin is the most watched top ten crypto coin in 2022 as it&#x2019;s on approximately 4,848,865 watchlists today.</strong></p>
<h2>The Top Ten Crypto Market Cap Coins in Terms of Watchlist Numbers</h2>
<p>As 2022 comes to an end, crypto market and price aggregation websites like <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com">coinmarketcap.com</a> (CMC) and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com">coingecko.com</a> (CG) offer watchlists so visitors can hone in on their favorite coins or maybe the coins held in their portfolio. In basic terms, a watchlist is a specific set of crypto assets that a person selects in order to monitor and it can be viewed without monitoring all the other crypto assets the individual doesn&#x2019;t care about.</p>
<p>In traditional finance, investors have watchlists for stocks and commodities as well so they can keep an eye on an asset&#x2019;s market value. While looking at the top ten crypto assets on Dec. 29, 2022, each crypto coin has a number of how many users selected a specific coin to add to their watchlist. Between the CG and CMC coin market cap aggregation sites, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> is the top coin in terms of watchlists.</p>

<p>At the time of writing on CG, bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) is on 1,192,111 watchlists, and on CMC, bitcoin is on 3,656,754 watchlists, which equates to more than 4.84 million watchlists in total on Dec. 29, 2022. Ethereum is the second runner-up with a total of 4,109,238 watchlists with 1,104,484 stemming from CG, and 3,004,754 from CMC. Below <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, watchlist heavyweights include <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a> with 2.94 million, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> with 2.45 million, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> with roughly 2.21 million watchlists.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a>, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> are followed by crypto coins like DOGE with 2.14 million, polygon&#x2019;s (MATIC) 1.84 million, and the stablecoin tether&#x2019;s (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>) total of 1.52 million on Dec. 29. While there&#x2019;s three stablecoins in the top ten coin market caps, the dollar-pegged assets are the least watched bunch out of the top cryptos today. While <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> leads with 1.52 million, BUSD&#x2019;s watchlist count is much lower with 351,265 watchlists.</p>

<p>Just above BUSD is USDC&#x2019;s watchlist count as it currently commands 358,911 total across CG and CMC. At the time of writing at 2:30 p.m. (ET) on Dec. 29, 2022, the top ten crypto assets represent $676.08 billion or 84.72% of the crypto economy&#x2019;s current $797.95 billion value. Outside the top ten crypto assets, shiba inu (SHIB) is an outlier with 2,382,306 watchlists but the coin is in the 15th largest market cap position.</p>

According to metrics, Ethereum&#x2019;s issuance rate of new coins has dropped considerably and only 4,790.45 ether has been minted since The Merge took place on Sept. 15, 2022.</strong></p>
<h2>Ethereum&#x2019;s Issuance Rate Is 0.014% per Annum in Contrast to the Simulated PoW Inflation Rate of 3.58% per Year</h2>
<p>The Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>) network has been operating under its proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm for more than three months and since then, 4,790.45 ethereum or $5.7 million in value has been added to the supply. Statistics from <a href="https://ultrasound.money/">ultrasound.money</a> show that Ethereum&#x2019;s current issuance rate of new coins per annum is 0.014%.</p>

<p>That&#x2019;s a whole lot different than what it would be if Ethereum was still a PoW chain, according to ultrasound.money&#x2019;s simulation metrics. If <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> remained a PoW chain during the last 105 days, then the issuance rating or inflation rate per annum would be 3.58%. That would be approximately 1,247,674.60 ether added to the supply by 10:15 a.m. (ET) on Dec. 29, 2022. Instead of $5.7 million in value added, a PoW <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> chain would have added more than $1.5 billion in value.</p>
<p>In addition to the lower issuance rate, Ethereum also has a burn mechanism, and records show roughly 658,000 ether is burned each year. To date, 2,795,773 ether or $8.78 billion in U.S. dollar value has been burned by destroying <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> since the Aug. 5, 2021 London Hard Fork. Data from Dune Analytics indicates the biggest leader in terms of the number of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> burned is tied to traditional ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>) transfers, which account for 247,008 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> burned since the London Hard Fork.</p>

<p>The non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Opensea and its users are responsible for burning 229,928.53 ether and the decentralized exchange (dex) Uniswap V2 has burned 143,394.07 ether since Aug. 5, 2021. Transferring the stablecoin <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> has equated to 123,014.14 ether burned to date, and Swaprouter 02 accounts for the fifth largest burner with 110,868.70 ether destroyed.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the number of validators validating consensus within the Ethereum network is nearing 500,000, according to current <a href="https://beaconcha.in/charts/validators">beaconcha.in</a> statistics. On Dec. 28, 2022, 492,863 validators were recorded, which is a marked increase from last year&#x2019;s number of validators 12 months ago, which was roughly 275,054. Data from <a href="https://www.mevwatch.info/">mevwatch.info</a> also shows that 69% of the blocks mined on the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> network are enforced with the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) compliance.</p>

Furthermore, three-day hashrate distribution statistics recorded on Dec. 29, 2022 indicate that two mining pools command more than 50% of the global hashrate.</strong></p>
<h2>2 Mining Entities Currently Produce More Than 50% of the Global Hashrate, Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Expected to Decline Significantly in 5 Days</h2>
<p>The computational processing power behind the Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) network ramped up to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221229001446/https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/hashrate-chart">300 EH/s range</a> on the evening of Dec. 28, 2022. Three days before the rise, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s hashrate slid to a low of 170 EH/s on Dec. 28, 2022, when bitcoin miners from Texas <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-hashrate-slides-as-texas-miners-curtail-hashpower-to-bolster-the-grid/">curtailed</a> their hashpower to relieve the grid from any excess load.</p>
<p>Most of the SHA256 hashpower returned the same day, as Bitcoin.com News reported on it climbing back to 240 EH/s by 12:00 p.m. (ET). Following Wednesday&#x2019;s jump above 300 EH/s, statistics on Thursday show the total network hashrate is coasting along at 250.57 EH/s. Moreover, during the past three days, two mining pools have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221229123539/https://btc.com/stats/pool">captured more than 50%</a> of the network&#x2019;s total hashrate.</p>

<p>Of course, this has caused <a href="https://twitter.com/BWCKPhotography/status/1607957255110160384?s=20&t=uRGS4N827gsy3C2_iPGJtA">criticism</a> toward the network, and <a href="https://twitter.com/tante/status/1605600466255085570?s=20&t=uRGS4N827gsy3C2_iPGJtA">accusations</a> of centralization this week. On Dec. 29, the mining pool Foundry USA controls 31.45% of the total hashrate, and Antpool commands 21.87% of the current 250.57 EH/s on Thursday morning (ET). Between both mining pools, Antpool and Foundry command 53.32% of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s total hashrate.</p>
<p>F2pool has around 14.25% of the hashrate, and Viabtc has around 9.34% of the total on Dec. 29. Between all three top pools, Foundry, Antpool, and F2pool have around 67.57% of the total, and all four mining pools with Viabtc command around 76.91% of the total hashrate during the past three days. Only 12 known mining pools are dedicating SHA256 hashrate toward the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> chain, and 5.64 EH/s or 2.46% of the global network is associated with unknown miners.</p>
<p>After the Bitcoin network&#x2019;s mining difficulty retarget on Dec. 19, 2022, at block height 768,096, increased by 3.27%, the network&#x2019;s difficulty change is expected to see a notable decline on Jan. 3, 2023. Current estimates show that the difficulty reduction could be between 7.39% to 8.1% lower than today&#x2019;s difficulty metric.</p>

<p>Block generation times have been faster than the 10-minute average on a few occasions at 9:33 minutes, but a great majority of recent block intervals have been above the 10-minute average at around 10:54 minutes. At the time of writing, the most profitable SHA256 bitcoin mining machine is the Bitmain Antminer S19 XP Hyd. with 255 terahash per second (TH/s) of hashpower.</p>

According to the report, the goal is to establish a regulated trading platform for digital collectibles as part of government efforts to curb market speculation with such assets.</strong></p>
<h2>National Marketplace to Support Trading of Digital Collectibles and Copyrights in China</h2>
<p>Chinese authorities are preparing to launch a state-controlled platform allowing the trading of non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a>) and other digital assets, local media announced. The initiative is a joint project between government organizations and a private company.</p>
<p>The “China Digital Asset Trading Platform,” built in partnership by the China Technology Exchange, China Cultural Relics Exchange Center, and Huaban Digital Copyright Service Center Co. Limited, will launch on Jan. 1, 2023, the report by Sina Finance detailed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The marketplace will operate under the license of the China Digital Exchange, set up by the Ministry of Science and Technology, the State Intellectual Property Office, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Beijing municipal government.</p>
<p>The exchange facilitates purchase and sale of intellectual, scientific, and technological property rights in the People’s Republic. It will provide the underlying infrastructure for the new trading platform, taking responsibility for processing transactions and implementing settlement mechanisms.</p>

<p>The new marketplace will be compliant with applicable regulations and provide trading services for digital collectibles and digital copyrights, Huaban President Yin Tao explained. As China has been cracking down on crypto-related activities, the term “digital collectibles” is often preferred by media outlets and companies over “NFTs” to avoid association with cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>In terms of supervision and compliance, this market faces some uncertainties and greater compliance risks, but laws and regulatory policies will be gradually improved, commented Yu Jianing, co-chair of the Blockchain Committee of the China Communications Industry Association.</p>
<p>A ban on the resale of digital collectibles imposed by Chinese regulators to limit market speculation with these assets was reportedly the reason behind Tencent’s decision to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/chinese-tech-giant-tencent-to-shut-down-nft-platform-amid-trading-restrictions/">close down</a> its NFT platform, Huanhe. The news of the move came out in July, only a year after its launch.</p>
<p>In June, the popular social media app Wechat, also operated by the Chinese tech giant, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/wechat-to-prohibit-accounts-from-providing-some-nft-and-crypto-services/">announced</a> its intentions to prohibit public accounts facilitating secondary trading of non-fungible tokens. Soon after, the Tencent News app stopped selling NFTs.</p>

The U.S. dollar reached a value of 356 pesos on December 28, losing almost 10% during just one week, and threatening to spur a more significant inflationary jump.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Argentine Peso Sinks to Lowest Level in History</h2>
<p>Argentina, one of the countries in Latam with active exchange control for foreign currencies, is facing difficulties maintaining the value of its fiat currency. The exchange between U.S. dollars and Argentine pesos <a href="https://www.clarin.com/economia/-pasa-dolar-blue-causas-detras-salto-355_0_QLwEJxHRWx.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> historic levels, with the peso sinking to its lowest level ever on Dec. 28. The dollar reached a price of 356 pesos in its parallel cash denomination, also called &#8220;blue,&#8221; having closed November with a value of 314 pesos per U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>The Argentine peso plummet accelerated last week when it lost more than 10% of its value. Since the start of 2022, the Argentine currency has lost more than 70% of its value, having started the year with a value of 207 pesos per U.S. dollar. This decline has caused Argentines to drop their peso-based savings, migrating to dollars and stablecoins as a hedge.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Explanations and Repercussions</h2>
<p>Analysts who seek to explain the historic drop in the currency&#8217;s value mention that there are two main elements making the exchange rate soar. The first one has to do with the abundance of pesos in the market due to payments companies have made, increasing the demand for dollars in an ecosystem with exchange controls.</p>
<p>The other has to do with the political and legal uncertainty created by the attempt of Argentine president Alberto Fernandez to disobey the mandate of the maximum tribunal in Argentina, a situation that is still under development. Whichever may be the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentine-peso-plunges-to-a-5-month-low-amid-legal-and-political-woes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cause</a>, this abrupt rise is threatening to bring even higher levels of inflation to the nation, which was expecting to close the year with an inflationary level of 100%.</p>
<p>Juan Pablo Albornoz, an Argentine economist, expects this to affect the pricing structure in the country. He <a href="https://www.clarin.com/economia/suba-dolar-blue-amenaza-reactivar-suba-inflacion_0_VqAikIrCDk.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This rise could affect prices as usual in months after a nominally abrupt jump in the value of this rate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the Argentine government signing price control agreements, the fluctuation could create disruptions affecting the inflationary goals for next year. Fundacion Libertad economist Eugenio Mari explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In economies with high inflation the price system is destroyed. As a consequence, the exchange rate becomes the fundamental variable that companies and workers follow in order to adjust their prices.</p>
</blockquote>

The decision to delay the listing of the coin was prompted by what the team terms &#8220;current market conditions.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Scheduled Token Unlocking Postponed</h2>
<p>Nearly eight months after becoming the first country in Africa to adopt bitcoin, the Central African Republic (CAR) recently said it will not proceed with the listing of its &#8220;Sango&#8221; crypto token as planned. In a statement <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/technology/articles/2022-12-20/central-african-republic-delays-crypto-token-listing-cites-market-conditions">reportedly</a> posted in a sango coin Telegram group, the team promoting the token claimed that &#8220;current market conditions&#8221; had necessitated this decision.</p>
<p>Besides the listing delay, the CAR team said the planned unlocking of up to 5% of sango holders’ portfolios had been postponed as well. According to the token information available on the official Sango <a href="https://sango.org/">website</a>, the CAR had hoped to list the coin before the end of 2022.</p>
<p>However, just like the country’s decision to make bitcoin legal tender, which has faced a series of problems, the Central African Republic’s sango coin, too, has run into a series of challenges. Chief among these has been the seemingly limited investor interest in the sango coin. The court ruling that declared <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-constitutional-court-says-central-african-republics-sango-coin-for-citizenship-scheme-is-illegal/">unconstitutional</a> the government&#8217;s plan to grant the country’s citizenship to sango coin holders is also believed to have dampened investor interest.</p>
<p>In addition, many bitcoiners that initially supported the CAR’s decision to make the top cryptocurrency legal tender have <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/central-african-republic-reportedly-launches-own-crypto-coin-bitcoiners-slam-move/">questioned</a> the motives behind the sango coin initiative.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<h2>&#8216;Sango Bitcoin Sidechain Testnet&#8217;</h2>
<p>Despite encountering these and other setbacks, the CAR government is still proceeding with the token sale which is now in &#8220;cycle 2.&#8221; Also as shown by the token roadmap, the CAR will proceed with the &#8220;Sango bitcoin sidechain testnet&#8221; in the first quarter of 2023, before launching the so-called national mobile smartphones program.</p>
<p>Concerning the CAR government’s plan to grant citizenship to investors that acquire or hold $60,000 worth of sango coins, an unidentified Telegram moderator reportedly said &#8220;more updates about this will be made next month.&#8221;</p>

The value of the tokenized precious metal will depend on the prices of physical gold, the bank said, emphasizing that the operation is a first. </strong></p>
<h2>Russia’s Sber Bank Mints Gold-Backed Coins</h2>
<p>Sber, Russia’s largest bank, has reported issuing gold-based digital financial assets (DFAs) on its proprietary blockchain. The coins were minted for Solfer, a holding specialized in the processing and trading of metals and making products from precious metals.</p>
<p>The Russian law “On Digital Financial Assets,” which entered into force in January, 2021, allows companies to tokenize various assets. Sber Bank is one of three “information system operators” <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-russia-allows-sberbank-to-issue-digital-financial-assets/">authorized</a> by the Bank of Russia to issue DFAs, alongside <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/digital-token-issued-in-russia-to-facilitate-investments-in-palladium/">Atomyze</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russias-largest-digital-asset-deal-denominated-in-chinese-yuan/">Lighthouse</a>. The latter conducted Russia’s first DFA issue in June of this year.</p>
<p>The DFA issued for gold represents a monetary claim on the asset, Sber explained. Its price and the obligations associated with it will depend on the dynamics of gold prices, the bank elaborated in an <a href="http://www.sberbank.ru/ru/sberpress/all/article?newsID=dc30404f-1268-4020-bd60-fcef1823d3a9&amp;blockID=1303&amp;regionID=77&amp;lang=ru&amp;type=NEWS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a>, noting this is the first transaction of this kind on its blockchain.</p>
<p>“We were attracted by the new digital format for gold, and we decided to try a new way to diversify the company’s balance sheet … We think that a new format of investment in precious metals can find its niche in the market,” commented Maxim Nazhmetdinov, the chief executive of Solfer.</p>
<p>“The deal demonstrates interest from the market and the real sector in a new instrument that can become a good alternative to investments within the de-dollarization of the economy,” First Deputy Chairman of Sber’s Board Alexander Vedyakhin stressed.</p>
<p>Pressed by sanctions over the war in Ukraine, Russia has been preparing to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-parliament-postpones-adoption-of-crypto-mining-bill/">broaden</a> its legal framework for DFAs to also cover decentralized cryptocurrencies. While there is a general consensus among regulators in Moscow against the free circulation of bitcoin in the country, the government is considering legalizing crypto payments in international settlements.</p>
<p>Sber intends to expand the DFA product line in the future in order to attract more corporate clients to its blockchain platform. According to an earlier statement by Vedyakhin, the bank also plans to allow individuals to use the blockchain for digital asset transactions in the spring of 2023.</p>

The company explained that the current Japanese market conditions and a weak global crypto market do not justify the resources needed to further grow its business in Japan at this time.</strong></p>
<h2>Kraken Exiting Japan</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken announced Wednesday that it has decided to &#8220;cease its operations in Japan and deregister from the Financial Services Agency (JFSA) as of January 31, 2023.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company explained that the decision to exit the Japanese crypto market is part of its &#8220;efforts to prioritize resources and investments&#8221; in the areas that align with the company&#8217;s strategy and &#8220;will best position Kraken for long-term success.&#8221; The announcement details:</p>
<blockquote><p>Current market conditions in Japan in combination with a weak crypto market globally mean the resources needed to further grow our business in Japan aren&#8217;t justified at this time.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;As a result, Kraken will no longer service clients in Japan through Payward Asia,&#8221; the exchange affirmed. Payward Asia Inc. operates Kraken&#8217;s services in Japan.</p>
<p>All affected clients have until Jan. 31 to withdraw their fiat and crypto holdings, the announcement adds, noting that deposit functionality will be removed on Jan. 9. Kraken also assured customers that it is &#8220;fully funded to ensure all affected clients can withdraw their assets in a timely manner.&#8221;</p>
<p>The crypto market has suffered significantly this year, with bitcoin falling more than 65% year-to-date. The Terra ecosystem collapse in May and the FTX implosion last month have negatively impacted many crypto companies, and a number of firms ended up having to file for bankruptcy, including FTX, Three Arrows Capital (3AC), Voyager Digital, Celsius Network, and Blockfi.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the start of this year, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors have weighed on financial markets. This resulted in significantly lower trading volumes and fewer client sign-ups,&#8221; Kraken CEO Jesse Powell detailed last month. &#8220;Unfortunately, negative influences on the financial markets have continued and we have exhausted preferable options for bringing costs in line with demand.&#8221; Kraken announced in November that it is reducing its global workforce by 30% or approximately 1,100 people &#8220;in order to adapt to current market conditions.&#8221;</p>
