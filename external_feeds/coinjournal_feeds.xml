<li dir="ltr">The increased whale activity comes amid bullish sentiment for Shiba Inu ahead of its Shibarium launch.</li>
<li dir="ltr">SHIB price was slightly higher on Saturday, trading around $0.00000830.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/shiba-inu/">Shiba Inu</a> is among altcoins to see a significant surge in their prices over the past week, with the meme coin largely benefitting from whale activity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to on-chain data from market intelligence platform Santiment, large holders have accumulated staggering amounts of SHIB since early June. &nbsp;This spike in whale activity comes ahead of a highly anticipated Shiba Inu ecosystem event &ndash; the launch of the layer-2 solution Shibarium.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While only testnet access is available for now, the huge anticipation surrounding Shibarium is one of the factors driving interest in the meme coin.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Shiba Inu whales gorge on SHIB</h2>
<p dir="ltr">As Santiment <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1685041009728843776" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shared</a> on Friday, large Shina Inu <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/wallets/">wallets</a> in the category of &ldquo;sharks&rdquo; and &ldquo;dolphins&rdquo; have added more than $9 million worth of SHIB over the past two or so months.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Indeed, on-chain data indicates addresses with 10 million to 100 billion SHIB have accumulated 1.11 trillion of the meme token since June 4. The total SHIB holdings in the hands of these large investors stood at $32.49 trillion on Friday, July 28. In total, this group holds roughly $266 million worth of SHIB.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here&rsquo;s Santiment&rsquo;s chart showing the increased SHIB accumulation by 10 million to 100 billion address cohort.</p>

</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Kannagi Finance, a revenue aggregator protocol on zkSync Era, has reportedly rugpulled. Users have suffered major losses, while the price of the native token KANA has nosedived.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The protocol&rsquo;s official website has allegedly &ldquo;expired&rdquo;. Meanwhile, its social media channels, including the official Twitter account are inaccessible. Total value locked (TVL) has plummeted from $2.13 million on Friday to near zero this morning, putting users losses at over $2 million.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">TVL plunged to near zero</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Kannagi Finance is said to have had its audit on June 6, handled by SolidProof, an audit agency under Germany-based Make Network. However, the protocol&rsquo;s <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/smart-contracts/">smart contract</a> code remained closed-source and unverified.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>The zkSync Era revenue aggregator protocol Kannagi Finance has RugPulled, and its official website have expired.

<li>Solana based Aurory has expanded to Arbitrum, a leading L2 for Ethereum.</li>
<li>$1 million in AURY liquidity has been added to the Arbitrum native DEX Camelot.</li>
<li>AURY price surged more than 22% to hit highs of $1.00.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Aurory, a leading NFT and gaming project in the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/solana/">Solana</a> ecosystem, is seeing fresh adoption after it announced expansion to <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> Layer-2 protocol Arbitrum.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the platform, expanding to Arbitrum is all about accessibility and bringing more users to the gaming platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Using SyncSpace to expand Aurory to multiple platforms allows us to tap into diverse new user bases, creating frictionless onramps for these communities, regardless of whether they are Web2, or Web3 native</em>,&rdquo; the Aurory team <a href="https://twitter.com/AuroryProject/status/1683898723284275200" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The integration means that all of Aurory&rsquo;s on-chain assets are now accessible on either Solana or Arbitrum. Users on the Arbitrum network can get AURY by depositing USDC into SyncSpace, then swapping the stablecoin for AURY.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a native token, AURY can be used across the Aurory ecosystem. The teams announced that $1 million of AURY liquidity had been seeded on Arbitrum native DEX Camelot.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Aurory&rsquo;s availability on Ethereum marks a first major milestone for the gaming platform and could be followed by more expansions to leading chains like BNB, Polygon and Avalanche. Meanwhile, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/3-projects-on-solana-that-could-revolutionise-p2e-gaming-and-the-metaverse/">experts say</a> Aurory is one of Solana-based gaming projects likely to revolutionise the global play-to-earn (P2E) ecosystem.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">AURY price outlook</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The AURY price was up more than 22% in the past 24 hours at the time of writing, trading just shy of one dollar at $0.99. The intraday high was $1.00, with price up 135% in the past seven days. The cryptocurrency had a 24-hour trading volume of over $1 million, up more than 23%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Aurory has a total supply of 100 million coins, current circulating supply of 31 million and market cap of over $30 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale has generated more than $1.2 million in its first month.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">SHMU&rsquo;s price is increased daily, with the presale set to last for eight weeks.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has underperformed this week. Bitcoin has lost more than 2% of its value in the last seven days and is now trading below $30k. At press time, the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Bitcoin</u></a> stands at $29,212.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the market&rsquo;s poor performance, Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale has hit a new milestone. The presale has surpassed the $1 million mark in the first month of its presale.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Shiba Memu?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">AI has become the rage in the world now. Following the launch of ChatGPT earlier this year, we have seen a number of AI solutions crop up to solve numerous problems within society.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a> is a project that is taking advantage of AI and blockchain technology to make it easier for people to create content and market their services.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to their whitepaper, Shiba Memu is designed to handle the task of 100 marketing agencies. The Shiba Memu machine is always active and is working 24/7 to find the best work going on in creative advertising, consuming it and generating better content marketing.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu is launching a meme token thanks to the explosive growth recorded by meme coins in recent years. In 2020, meme coins were practically unknown in the crypto ecosystem but grew to a market cap of over $20 billion within two years.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, Shiba Memu could be better than most of the meme coins currently available in the crypto market, thanks to its utility. The team explained that Shiba Memu has self-sufficient marketing capabilities powered by AI technology, making it a unique and attractive investment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With Shiba Memu, users have a powerful AI that can create its own marketing strategies, write its own PR, and promote itself in relevant forums and social networks. Currently, Shiba Memu is available on the Ethereum and BNBChain blockchains.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale tops $1.2M</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a> is becoming quite popular amongst cryptocurrency investors despite the recent bearish sentiment in the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The presale has been on for less than a month, and the team has raised $1.2 million so far. The development team will use the funds to develop some of its products.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most of the funds generated from the presale would be used to develop Shiba Memu&rsquo;s AI technology. With the Shiba Memu AI technology, the platform can engage with users directly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The development team added that the platform would have a robotastic dashboard to interact with the AI, provide feedback, make suggestions, and ask questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Click here</u></a> to find out more about Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale event.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Shiba Memu price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr">It is hard to accurately predict Shiba Memu&rsquo;s price as the token is still in its presale phase. Currently, 1 SHMU = 0.016300 USDT.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The team revealed that the&nbsp;<a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a> price increases every day at 6 pm GMT. In a few hours, the token will go for 0.016525 USDT.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">SHMU began trading at $0.011125 when the presale began and will trade at $0.0244 when the presale ends. Users can purchase the SHMU token using Ethereum, USDT, BNB and BUSD</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Should you invest in Shiba Memu now?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">If you are interested in the project, then it is not too late to invest in Shiba Memu. the project&rsquo;s utility could make it one of the leading meme coins in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">By combing AI and blockchain technology to ease marketing strategies for companies and organisations, Shiba Memu could gain massive adoption in the coming months and years.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the project gets the necessary adoption, SHMU, the native token of the&nbsp;<a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a> ecosystem, could record massive gains in the medium to long term.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, if the broader crypto market enters a bullish cycle, SHMU could emerge as one of the biggest winners. Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are up by more than 40% year-to-date.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the market fundamentals improve over the next few months, SHMU could record excellent growth once it starts trading on cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>

<li>Crypto.com has earned approvals from seven other regulatory bodies in the recent past.</li>
<li>The exchange&rsquo;s approval in the Netherlands comes weeks after Binance withdrew its license application.</li>
<li>Crypto.com seems to be beating its main competitor Binance in regulatory approvals around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>The well-known cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com has made history by obtaining authorization for registration from the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) to provide its services in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Following careful adherence to the nation&rsquo;s Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Prevention) Act, Crypto.com received the DNB&rsquo;s approval, demonstrating the exchange&rsquo;s commitment to upholding strict regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>This accomplishment, according to CEO Kris Marszalek, is a turning point for the company&rsquo;s service and demonstrates the exchange&rsquo;s commitment to cooperating closely with regulators to advance the industry responsibly.</p>
<h2>Crypto.com regulatory approvals around the world</h2>
<p>The latest endorsement for Crypto.com by the Dutch regulatory body adds to a long list of worldwide endorsements. The Monetary Authority of Singapore, as previously reported <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-com-completes-its-licensing-process-in-singapore/">here</a>, and the UK&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority, as previously <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-com-secures-approval-as-a-crypto-asset-business-from-uks-fca/">reported here</a>, are among seven other regulatory bodies that have already approved the exchange.</p>
<p>The exchange has improved its standing as a trustworthy player in the cryptocurrency industry thanks to its outstanding success in navigating challenging regulatory environments and obtaining required certifications. Notably, Crypto.com recently acquired a regulatory licence in Spain, underscoring its unwavering commitment to upholding legal requirements.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Crypto.com wants to strengthen its relationships with EU authorities in anticipation of the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/european-parliament-finally-adopts-the-markets-in-crypto-assets-act-mica/">Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)</a> regulations that will change how EU countries deal with the cryptocurrency industry. By taking a proactive stance, Crypto.com is positioned to play a significant role in influencing the European crypto industry&rsquo;s future.</p>
<h2>Crypto.com in the Netherlands</h2>
<p>With each new regulatory approval, Crypto.com cements its position as a leading and trusted cryptocurrency exchange, bolstering investor confidence and opening up exciting possibilities for further expansion. As the crypto market continues to evolve, the exchange&rsquo;s dedication to compliance stands as a beacon of reliability, attracting both seasoned and novice investors.</p>
<p>Crypto.com&rsquo;s clearance by the Dutch Central Bank underscores the exchange&rsquo;s exceptional commitment to compliance and responsible practices. The company&rsquo;s growing list of approvals from various global regulatory bodies positions Crypto.com at the forefront of the crypto industry&rsquo;s transformation.</p>

<li>The British Museum is venturing into the Metervese following its partnership with the Sandbox.</li>
<li>Other museums including Ukraine&rsquo;s Kharkiv Art Museum have already ventured into the metaverse.</li>
<li>The Sandbox (SAND) token price reacted minimally following the partnership.</li>
</ul>
<p>The British Museum will be working with the Sandbox Metaverse development platform to bring it into the Metaverse, according to a July 27 <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSandboxGame/status/1684581767158566912?s=20">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>The partnership, according to the announcement, aims to develop fresh &ldquo;immersive experiences&rdquo; for users to learn about global history. The generation of a variety of digital collectibles will take into account the museum&rsquo;s various collections.</p>
<p>The chief operating officer and co-founder of the Sandbox Sebastien Borget called the partnership an opportunity to share the museum&rsquo;s collections with new audiences. He said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This is a great opportunity for The Sandbox players, regardless of where they are, to learn about and enjoy the amazing collections of human history, art, and culture in the British Museum.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2>The British Museum ventures into Web3</h2>
<p>The partnership also involves the licencing partner for the museum, a Web3 platform called laCollection, which has previously worked with top museums all over the world to digitise their collections.</p>
<p>The British Museum may be entering the Web3 space for the first time at this time, but it is not the first time a significant museum has entered the Metaverse.</p>
<p>A new exhibition on the expanding nexus between art and blockchain debuted this past spring at the Centre Pompidou, one of France&rsquo;s top museums for modern art and the location of the continent&rsquo;s first modern art collection. As part of a permanent exhibition, the museum unveiled items from some of the most coveted nonfungible token (NFTs) collections in the world, including CryptoPunks and Autoglyphs.</p>
<p>Prior to that, the Kharkiv Art Museum, one of Ukraine&rsquo;s oldest museums of modern art, started an NFT collection as a fundraiser to support its operations and safeguard its cultural heritage.</p>
<p>The first museum in Europe to tokenize a work of classical art with a million-euro value was the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp, Belgium.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Chancer revolutionises betting by making it possible to predict multiple events.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Chancer launched a presale on June 13, which has been happening fast.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The token is a 50x investment in the future as blockchain-based betting gains prominence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">A few weeks since Chancer launched a presale, investors have accumulated more than $1 million of the tokens. Very few presales raise these amounts that quickly, underlying a strong interest in the token of the peer-to-peer betting platform. As the world&rsquo;s first decentralised betting ecosystem, investors believe Chancer could be revolutionary. That stems from the growing interest in betting, which Chancer aims to take to the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>About Chancer and its P2P betting model</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer is a new blockchain-based betting platform. The platform will be powered by a $CHANCER token. The token will be the platform&rsquo;s medium of exchanging value and claiming winnings on successful bets and other rewards. There are a total of 1.5 billion Chancer tokens in supply, but only 65% are available for presale.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer aims to become the go-to destination for decentralised social and predictive markets. Betting on Chancer occurs through a P2P model, where users set their rules and odds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Picture this: You expect candidate X to win an election. Your peers may hold a contrary opinion. So, you place a bet against them for this probabilistic outcome. Under normal circumstances, you won&rsquo;t be able to bet on such a political event. Chancer allows betting via these less popular events.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Through Chancer, investors can bet on many events. They simply create a P2P Chancer market for the particular event or incidence and bet on it. In other words, Chancer increases investors&rsquo; choice and flexibility in betting. This makes the platform a remarkable way to decentralise betting and enable investors to be in charge.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The exciting bit is that users are rewarded for creating the P2P markets. The use case makes Chancer more than a betting platform. Users can also generate passive income by sharing the platform and staking the native token.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>How big is the P2P betting opportunity?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Since P2P betting is new, estimating the market size is down to estimations. However, it is easy to predict based on the market size and trends in traditional betting.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.polarismarketresearch.com/industry-analysis/sports-betting-market" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Market reports</u></a> point out that online sports betting was valued at $70.23 billion in 2021. This level is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.7% by 2030. Growth in technology and the proliferation of the digital arena are linked with these strong trends.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The projected growth in betting is positive for Chancer. Traditionally, sports betting dominated, but Cancer wants to bring new ways to bet. Coupled with the ever-growing popularity of blockchain, Chancer will craft a niche from traditional betting. It will also build a new niche that could increase the betting market size further through the P2P model.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Given the above, Chancer&rsquo;s betting market size is huge, conferring significant opportunities to investors. A strong demand for the platform is positive for the token and its ability to return huge.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Chancer prediction in 2023, 2024, and the future</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Chancer token&rsquo;s long-term value will be derived from the platform&rsquo;s continued use and demand. As such, quantifying the future value would be highly speculative. Most cryptocurrencies have risen by thousands of percentages after finding and earning the market trust. Thus, a potential 50x increase or more in the future is probable if Chancer lives to its promise.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, in the short term, $CHANCER could start to find higher values when it lists on Uniswap in Q3 2023. This is when the token will unlock more demand and rise, potentially by double or triple-digit percentages.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2024, $CHANCER could rise by over 1,000%. The basis for the prediction is that the main platform will allow $CHANCER to be deployed for real-world use cases. That could unlock organic demand that will sustain the token&rsquo;s value and push it to higher levels.</p>
