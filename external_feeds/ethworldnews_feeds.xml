<p>The Alchemix/CurveFinance Exploiter returned nearly $9 million in funds drained from the DeFi protocol following on-chain negotiations spotted via Etherscan on Friday. </p>



<p>Alchemix Finance received a blockchain transaction note asking the protocol to confirm its wallet address. The exploiter then <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xdce5d6b41c32f578f875efffc0d422c57a75d7d8#tokentxns" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://etherscan.io/address/0xdce5d6b41c32f578f875efffc0d422c57a75d7d8#tokentxns" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">transferred</a> 4,820 ether over three transactions to Alchemix&#8217;s multi-sig wallet. At current prices, the assets are worth $8.9 million. </p>



<p>Friday&#8217;s transaction represents a portion of around $61 million drained from decentralized exchange Curve Finance. The attacker reportedly exploited a code bug in Vyper&#8217;s compiler, a smart contract programming language used by Curve across its platform. </p>



<p>The code bug allowed malicious attackers to drain liquidity pools affecting Metronome, Alchemix, and JPEGd. So far, exploiters have returned some of the looted assets to Alchemix and JPEGd. </p>



<p>Curve, Metronome, and Alchemix previously asked the exploiters to return 90% of the drained funds for a 10% bounty in return. CRV gained 5% in price on Friday following news of Alchemix&#8217;s recovery. </p>

<h2>Curve Founder Offloads CRV To Balance Debt</h2>



<p>CRV, Curve native token and a cryptocurrency widely used across Ethereum&#8217;s DeFi lending ecosystem dipped in price following exploits on the exchange&#8217;s in-house pools. </p>



<p>The drop in CRV&#8217;s price spelled danger for loans taken by founder Michael Egorov. Egorov deposited million of CRV tokens as collateral on DeFi lending protocols like Aave and Fraxlend. These loans risked liquidation if CRV&#8217;s price fell below $0.30. </p>



<p>In response to the CRV&#8217;s declining price amid last weekend&#8217;s exploit, Egorov <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/curve-finance-egorov-sells-72-million-crv/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/curve-finance-egorov-sells-72-million-crv/" rel="noreferrer noopener">spurred</a> a deluge of over-the-counter (OTC) deals with some 13 investors including Tron founder Justin Sun. </p>



<p>Egorov&#8217;s CRV sales from OTC trades total 106 million CRV tokens and he received $42 million USDT in return. This liquidity has seemingly gone into <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1687294816890347520?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1687294816890347520?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">balancing debts on Aave</a> and other lenders amid concerns of a DeFi implosion. </p>



<p>DeFi analyst Ignas opined that a CRV nosedive looked unlikely due to an increase in Curve&#8217;s 3Crypto pool featuring crvUSD+ETH+CRV. </p>

<p>The United States Department of Justice is seeking the revocation of Sam Bankman-Fried’s bail due to his role in an article published by the New York Times last month that has stirred up <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/prosecutor-revoke-sam-bankman-fried-bail/">controversy</a> over the past two weeks. In a recent <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939.188.0.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">letter</a> to SDNY Judge Lewis Kaplan, federal prosecutors from the Justice Department cited multiple attempts by the disgraced FTX founder to tamper with witnesses and urged the judge to put him behind bars. </p>



<h2>DOJ Wants Sam Bankman-Fried Detained Pending Trial In October</h2>



<p>The Department of Justice highlighted the acknowledgment by Sam Bankman-Fried’s defense team regarding his involvement in the New York Times article on former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison. Bankman-Fried provided Ellison’s diary to NYT, which contained private writings about her time at the now-defunct crypto firm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Federal prosecutors told Judge Kaplan that the FTX founder shared Ellison’s private writings to influence the public’s perception of her, given that she is set to testify against him after pleading guilty in the lawsuit against FTX. The prosecutors believe that Bankman-Fried’s actions amount to a federal felony while out on bail, and asked Judge Kaplan to revoke the same till his trial hearings begin on October 2, 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, the New York Times wrote to Judge Kaplan on August 2, 2023, in what appeared to be an attempt to defend Sam Bankman-Fried’s decision to share Caroline Ellison’s private diary. The NYT argued their article was in the “public’s legitimate interest” given Ellison’s proximity to the case and knowledge of FTX and Alameda’s inner workings. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In all the years of bail revocation hearings I did, never did anyone or any organization claim a First Amendment right to facilitate witness intimidation.

<p>The New York Times also cited the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects freedom of speech and the press, among other things. The news giant asked the court to make its decision in Bankman-Fried’s bail revocation matter in accordance with the First Amendment. Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase, stated that NYT’s invocation of the First Amendment for a bail revocation hearing was unprecedented.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Matter Labs has denied allegations of source code plagiarism made by Polygon.&nbsp;</li><li>Polygon previously accused Matter Labs of copying part of its open-source code without giving due credit.</li><li>In response, Matter Labs claimed it had sufficiently attributed the copied code to Polygon.</li></ul>



<p>Matter Labs, the crypto firm behind zkSync, has responded to the recent plagiarism allegations made by fellow <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-ethereum-bridge-nft-base/">Ethereum</a> layer-2 scaling solution Polygon. Earlier today, Polygon accused Matter Labs’ developers of copying parts of its open-source code without giving due credit for the plagiarized code. Matter Labs has denied the allegations and argued that it had sufficiently attributed the copied part to Polygon. </p>



<h2><strong>Matter Labs: Polygon Is Making “Untrue Claims”</strong></h2>



<p>Earlier today, Polygon published a <a href="https://mirror.xyz/0x70DF15b0208eFCeFaA541Da9A0ED6C4A884554Fc/gNi8coqXjd1ybFsQBAG7QARUkPHZECu7ihIRkpiVx2Y" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> titled “Protect the Open Source Ethos”, which accused Matter Labs of copying a “significant amount” of source code from the Plonky2 library to its recently unveiled proving system called Boojum. According to Polygon, the code was copied with copyrights or attribution to its original authors. </p>



<p>Polygon also called out Matter Labs’ founder Alex Gluchowski for claiming that Boojum is more efficient than Plony2. Polygon questioned the authenticity of Gluchowski’s claim, given that Boojum’s code concerning performance was directly copied from Plonky2. Polygon further cited Boojum’s introductory post, which failed to mention the layer-2 scaling solution or its developers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to Polygon’s allegations, Matter Labs clarified that its Boojum proof system derived 5% of its code from Plonky2, which was “prominently attributed” in the first line of its library. In a statement to CoinDesk, a Matter Labs spokesperson said that Polygon’s blog post made untrue claims about Boojum’s code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CEO Alex Gluchowski followed up with a detailed tweet where he expressed his disappointment with Polygon’s allegations. Gluchowski reiterated that only 5% of the Boojum code was based on the Plonky2 code. He added that Boojum and Plonky2 were both implementations of the Redshift, which he claimed was introduced by Matter Labs 3 years before Polygon published the Plonky2 paper. </p>

<p>The tension between Polygon and Matter Labs comes as both firms rush to deliver the first zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) to offer cheaper and more efficient transactions on the Ethereum network. Earlier this year, Polygon’s Mihailo Bjelic and Matter Labs’ Alex Gluchowski were involved in a heated exchange over the latter’s zkSync Era, particularly its security audits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coinbase has reported a total revenue of $708 million for the second quarter of 2023.

Meanwhile, the crypto exchange’s net revenue came in at $662.5 million, down 10% compared to the first quarter.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Coinbase Posts Net Loss Of $97 Million In Q2 ‘2023</h2>



<p>As per Coinbase’s <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/397450999/files/doc_financials/2023/q2/Shareholder-Letter-Q2-2023.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">Q2 earnings report</a>, the transaction revenue from institutional and retail clients came in at $327 million, down from $374 million in the first quarter of 2023. The revenue from subscriptions and services took a 7.2% hit, coming in at $335.4 million. The total revenue also accounted for $45.4 million of corporate interest and other income, which grew 25% compared to Q1. </p>



<p>The largest crypto exchange in the United States saw a total trading volume of $92 billion in the second quarter of 2023. Retail traders contributed $14 billion, while institutional traders accounted for the remaining $78 billion of trading volume. The consumer and institutional trading volume decreased by 33% and 37% QoQ, respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of June 30, 2023, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-ethereum-bridge-nft-base/">Coinbase</a> had an ETH staking balance of $7 billion, $2.2 billion of which was from institutions.

<p>The earnings report also revealed a net loss of $0.76 per share for common stockholders. However, Coinbase’s overall Q2 metrics prompted its share price to gain 10% earlier today, with the stock soaring as high as $100.42 in after-hours trading.

<ul><li>Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov has offloaded 72 million Curve Dao Tokens since last week’s exploits.&nbsp;</li><li>Egorov has managed to reduce his $100 million debt, collateralized with 427 million CRV, by 21%.&nbsp;</li><li>Earlier today Curve’s crvUSD stablecoin briefly lost its peg to the US Dollar and tanked 0.35%.</li></ul>



<p>Michael Egorov, the man behind the automated market maker<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-defi-tvl-down-curve-crisis/"> Curve Finance</a>, has offloaded roughly 72 million Curve DAO tokens (CRV) in over-the-counter (OTC) trades since last week’s exploits on the DeFi protocol. Egorov’s recent sales came as he attempted to minimize his CRV-backed debts of over $100 million, which risk getting liquidated with CRV’s tanking price. </p>



<h2><strong>Curve Finance Founder Still Owes Over $80 Million</strong></h2>



<p>In a summary of Michael Egorov’s recent OTC sales, on-chain analytics firm <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1687115628006772737" rel="nofollow noopener">Lookonchain</a> reported that the Curve Finance founder had sold CRV to 15 different institutions and investors at an average price of $0.4, raising over $28 million in the process. </p>



<p>Last week’s exploit on Curve, which drained over $47 million from the DeFi protocol, put a spotlight on Egorov’s hefty loans totaling $100 million that was backed by more than 427 million CRV, which accounted for 47% of the token’s total circulating supply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The largest debt was on Aave, where the Curve founder had posted a collateral of 305 million CRV for a loan of 63.2 million USDT. This debt is eligible for liquidation as soon as CRV’s price sinks to $0.37, given that it has a liquidation threshold of 55%. The riskiest debt was on Frax Finance, where Egorove had pledged 59 million CRV for 15.8 million FRAX. Fraxlend’s time-weighted variable interest rate made it so that the interest rate would double every 12 hours if the credit utilization reached 100%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So far, Michael Egorov has repaid 12 million USDT to Aave and 6.6 million FRAX to Frax Finance, which left an outstanding debt of 51 million USDT and 9.1 million FRAX, respectively. The Curve Finance founder still owes 12 million MIM on Abracadabra, 9.4 million DOLA on Inverse, 740,000 XAI on Silo, reducing his total debt obligations by 21%.</p>



<p>Earlier today, Curve’s crvUSD stablecoin lost its peg to the US Dollar and sank as much as 0.35% amid uncertainty surrounding the DeFi protocol. Since the exploit, several players in the crypto industry, including Justin Sun and Huobi, have stepped in to prevent a dramatic decline in CRV’s price in order to avoid a DeFi catastrophe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coinbase <a href="https://twitter.com/BuildOnBase/status/1687089210216595456?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/BuildOnBase/status/1687089210216595456?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> the release of an Ethereum bridge and NFT minting for its layer 2 network Base. Base is set to launch its mainnet on August 9 after opening to developers back in July. </p>



<p>The Ethereum bridge will allow Base users to transfer tokens including ETH between Coinbase&#8217;s network and Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain. This was previously impossible as developer access released in July only allowed one-way transactions to Base. </p>



<p>Starting August 9, users will also be able to mint NFTs on Base and claim digital ID or crypto usernames on Coinbase Wallet. Coinbase also partnered with names like OpenSea, Atari, and Coca-Cola to power user rewards.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The bridge to Base is OPEN 🔵<br><br>Here are six ways you can bridge, including commemorative NFTs 👇 <a href="https://t.co/UtHxpxr8sg" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/UtHxpxr8sg</a></p>&mdash; Base 🛡️ (@BuildOnBase) <a href="https://twitter.com/BuildOnBase/status/1687089210216595456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">August 3, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<h2>BALD Degens Rekkt On Coinbase&#8217;s L2 Chain</h2>



<p>The previous lack of bridge options to Base did little to stop speculative traders from aping into memecoins launched on the blockchain. These degens as they&#8217;re known in crypto poured millions into tokens, with a coin called BALD taking center stage. </p>



<p>Traders reportedly turned a few hundred dollars in initial punts into millions overnight. Indeed, BALD&#8217;s market cap peaked at nearly $90 million on Sunday from a $50,000 token market cap two days prior. </p>



<p>BALD&#8217;s ascent was shortlived as its price <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/degens-rugpull-bald-devs-pull-liquidity/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/degens-rugpull-bald-devs-pull-liquidity/" rel="noreferrer noopener">tumbled</a> toward zero after the developer withdrew over $12 million in liquidity. The rug pull &#8211; the term used to describe when a token deployer withdraws liquidity after prices have increased, leaving users unable to liquidate their coins &#8211; splashed across Base&#8217;s ecosystem with several of these memecoins rugging would-be early investors. </p>



<p>Decentralized exchange LeetSwap also paused operations after multiple exploits on liquidity pools. The team has since recovered over 400 ETH, per LeetSwap Twitter updates. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Here is an update on the current situation.<br><br>We have rescued around ~400 ETH from the pools at risk as we ran through all of the 2000+ pairs multiple times trying to salvage all we could, now in our recovery wallet that will be distributed back to the teams for a relaunch.</p>&mdash; LeetSwap (@LeetSwap) <a href="https://twitter.com/LeetSwap/status/1687055050902847488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">August 3, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h3><b>Much ado about nothing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its 12-year history, Litecoin completed its third halving event on 2 August. The event led to a reduction in miners’ block reward from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">LITECOIN HAS SUCCESSFULLY HALVED ITS BLOCK REWARD!</p>
<p>⚡ <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24LTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">$LTC</a> ⚡ <a href="https://t.co/iemCnkPsdu" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/iemCnkPsdu</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Litecoin (@litecoin) <a href="https://twitter.com/litecoin/status/1686755968489861120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">August 2, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the halving, there was a debate about whether the halving event would result in a positive price rally for LTC. Some analysts believed that the halving was already priced in by most traders in the market. This means that many traders had already factored in the fact that the block reward would be halved and had traded accordingly. This group of people did not think the halving would result in any significant price growth for LTC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others, including Litecoin founder Charlie Lee, opined that the halving would increase the price per LTC coin. This is because the halving will reduce LTC’s supply, and should demand stay the same or increase, it would create a supply-demand imbalance, which would drive up the coin’s price. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee, on a Twitter spaces session held last week, had said:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the supply side gets cut in half and the demand stays the same, then the price should go up.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, an on-chain assessment of LTC’s network activity since the halving event revealed a decline in demand for the alt. Per data from S<a href="https://app.santiment.net/charts/FoSzIDuW__sCl" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">antiment</a>, yesterday, the count of daily active addresses that traded LTC dropped by 9%. In the early trading hours of today, this had dropped by another 68%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, transaction count also dwindled. With 127,110 LTC transactions completed on the day of the halving, a 5% decreased was registered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the daily chart, LTC selling momentum rallied. The coin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) were 39.44 and 39.39 respectively. Below their neutral lines and trending downwards at press time, it indicated that more traders sold their LTC holdings than bought them.</span></p>

<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seems to have softened its stance on exchange-traded funds focusing on <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-defi-tvl-down-curve-crisis/">Ethereum</a> futures contracts. The securities regulator is reportedly inclined to consider the Ether Futures ETFs following several applications by TradFi and crypto players over the past week. </p>



<h2><strong>Consideration of Ethereum Futures ETF Won’t Guarantee Approval</strong></h2>



<p>When Grayscale Investments filed an application with the SEC to offer the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF back in May, fellow funds including Bitwise, Roundhill Investments, and Valkyrie followed suit with their own ETH futures-based ETFs. However, the SEC reportedly asked the funds to stop pursuing ETH futures ETFs and withdraw their applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On July 28, Volatility Shares submitted an application for its Ether Strategy ETF. The application was followed by similar filings from VanEck, ProShares, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Roundhill. The funds submitted applications to offer their own versions of Ethereum Futures ETFs.</p>



<p>Citing two sources familiar with the latest ether futures ETF filings, Blockworks <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/sec-consider-ether-futures-etfs" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> that the SEC had “indicated its readiness to publicly consider such a product.” The source added that the securities regulator’s consideration of the ETH futures ETFs did not guarantee their approval. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>From a product perspective, all the ETF issuers are probably thinking it’s worth the cost of filing rather than risk falling behind in case ETH [ETFs] take off, even in futures form,” </p><cite>Henry Jim, Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence</cite></blockquote>



<p>If the SEC takes a favorable stance on the latest applications for Ethereum futures-based ETFs, they would go live in 75 days from the date of filing. This would mean that Volatility Shares’ Ether Strategy ETF could launch on October 12, followed by the debut of Grayscale, Bitwise, Roundhill, and ProShares ETFs on October 16.</p>

<ul><li>The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly considering fraud charges against Binance.&nbsp;</li><li>Federal prosecutors are concerned about the possibility of a bank run on the exchange.&nbsp;</li><li>The prosecutors may hit the exchange with fines or come to non-prosecution agreements to protect its users.&nbsp;</li><li>Reports of potential charges against the exchange have led to a 4% decline in BNB’s price.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The United States Department of Justice is reportedly considering filing fraud charges against <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-operational-mvp-license-dubai/">Binance</a>. However, people familiar with the matter have revealed that the Justice Department is reluctant to file formal charges considering the potential impact on the customers of the world’s largest crypto exchange. </p>



<h2><strong>Federal Prosecutors Consider Fines For Binance</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/08/02/2023/us-prosecutors-worry-binance-charges-could-cause-run-on-exchange" rel="nofollow noopener">Semafor</a> reported earlier today that the Department of Justice was concerned about a bank run on Binance in the event that they pursue a fraud lawsuit against the crypto exchange. Federal prosecutors are worried that an indictment may induce significant panic in the crypto market which may lead to the exchange’s customers losing money, as was seen in the case of Bahamas-based FTX last year. </p>



<p>Instead of an indictment, federal prosecutors are reportedly considering alternatives, including fines, penalties, and non-prosecution agreements. As per Semafor’s sources, this route would penalize Binance for its alleged violations while protecting its investors and customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Binance or its Chief Executive Changpeng Zhao is yet to put out a statement addressing the reports about potential fraud charges. The latest development prompted BNB to tank as much as 4%, pulling its price to a one-week low of $238. Bitcoin also witnessed a visible decline in its price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>News of the U.S. Justice Department’s potential fraud charges against Binance came less than a day after the Wall Street Journal reported that the exchange’s users traded $90 billion worth of crypto assets in China in a single month, despite a ban on crypto trading in the country. Citing internal figures and employees of the exchange, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-is-illegal-in-china-binance-does-90-billion-of-business-there-anyway-2a0af975?mod=latest_headlines" rel="noopener">WSJ</a> claimed that China accounted for 20% of Binance’s global volume, excluding trades made by high-volume traders. </p>
