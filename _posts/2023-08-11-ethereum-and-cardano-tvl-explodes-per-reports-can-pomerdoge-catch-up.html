<p class="s5">TVL or the total value of digital assets locked in a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform is often used as a metric to judge the growth of a network. A recent report shows that Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) TVL have seen an upsurge. A new project, Pomerdoge (POMD), has shown potential, but can it keep up in the highly competitive cryptocurrency world?</p>

Ethereum and Cardano TVL Explodes
<p class="s5">The TVL metric is often used to judge the growth of a DeFi network. Recent reports from Messari have shown that the TVL of Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) has been on the rise despite the bearish crypto market.</p>
<p class="s5">According to Messari, the TVL of Cardano has increased by 198.6% year-to-date (YTD). Cardano now has more than $175 million locked in its DeFi ecosystem. The increase in TVL has helped Cardano move from the 34th position to the 21st in overall TVL across all blockchains.</p>
<p class="s5">Messari links the growth of Cardano&rsquo;s DeFi ecosystem to the launch of stablecoins, improved programming languages, and new wallets. On the other hand, Ethereum still dominates the DeFispace as the leading network. At the time of this writing, Ethereum has more than $23.5 billion in TVL.</p>
<p class="s5">The explosive growth of Cardano and Ethereum is considered impressive due to the recent price drop in crypto prices. With the prices of Ethereum and Cardano forecasted to recover by the end of 2023, the TVL locked in their respective chains could increase further.</p>
