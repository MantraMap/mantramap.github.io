					<description><![CDATA[The Ethereum price has moved in the same direction as the broader market. In the last 24 hours, Ethereum has moved up by 2.5%. On the weekly timeframe, the altcoin has rarely registered any movement. This reflects lateral trading for ETH. In the short term, the altcoin might be registering gains, but as the technicals indicate, the coin can depreciate again before it rallies. Accumulation has been considerably low on the chart. Buying activity must significantly increase if ETH is to break above the $1,300 price mark. Even though ETH remained comfortably above the $1,220 price, buying strength has been weak on the daily chart. Ethereum has to keep trading above the $1,240 and $1,250 price levels for the coin to take a shot at $1,300. The bulls will lose all strength if the Ethereum price moves below the $1,240 mark and closes near $1,230. This price pullback can then further fuel a rally to $1,300.

However, ETH must stay above $1,250 to avoid a significant loss of value. The bulls must keep defending the $1,250 level regarding the closest support line.

Technical Analysis Corresponding to the earlier statement about low buyers, the technical outlook also painted the same picture.

					<description><![CDATA[A quant has explained why the recent retest of a critical support level by Nasdaq may help Bitcoin reverse its own trend. Nasdaq-100 Has Recently Retested A Critical Support Trendline As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, Nasdaq-100 is currently above a support line that has historically been important. Nasdaq-100 (NDX) is a stock market index that includes 102 equity securities issued by 101 of the largest non-financial companies (based on their market caps) listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Here is a chart that shows how this trendline has acted as a bounce in the index&#8217;s price over the past decade: The value of the asset seems to have touched this line recently &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the price of NDX has been supported five times by this trendline since the year 2010. In each of these instances, the line has put a check on the decline in the index, and has consequently reversed it back up. Related Reading: Upcoming FOMC Meeting Is The Most Important Ever For Bitcoin – Watch Out For The Dot Plot Recently, the Nasdaq-100 index has once again made a touch of this trendline, and has so far managed to stay above it. The quant notes that this retest could have been the end of the latest downwards trend, and might have also been the point of return of a bullish trend. However, if the trendline is lost instead, it would show the extreme strength of the downtrend, and would suggest that there is more drawdown ahead for the market.

This On-Chain Condition Hasn’t Been Met Yet At the same time, Bitcoin has also been testing a support line, as the analyst has highlighted in the chart: Looks like BTC is also just above a support trendline right now &#124; Source: CryptoQuant In the past year or so, Bitcoin has shown to be highly correlated with the stock market. The reason behind this correlation has been the rise of institutional investors in the crypto who treat it like a risk asset. The quant believes that if the current support retest in the stock market proves to be successful, then BTC could also be expected to see a reversal of its own due to its correlation with the stocks. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin&#8217;s price floats around $17.2k, up 1% in the last week. Over the past month, the crypto has lost 7% in value. Below is a chart that shows the trend in the price of the coin over the last five days.

					<description><![CDATA[The LUNA Classic (LUNC) price has noted a fresh decline in the last 24 hours. In that time frame, the altcoin depreciated by 1%. In the past week, LUNC logged gains worth 2.5%. Much of the weekly gains have been lost due to losses on the daily chart. At the moment, LUNC depicts consolidation beneath its immediate resistance mark. With the FTX collapse, LUNC has been teetering under a bearish influence for quite some time. Over the last month, the coin has lost more than 10% of its market value. On the development front, there is a new update. This is the introduction of the new Alpha package for TerraDart. TerraDart is a Dart SDK that is used for writing applications that would be interacting with the Terra blockchain, which has launched a new package called Alpha. The Alpha package has been available to communicate with the LUNC blockchain within Flutter and Dart environments. Related Reading: Yearn Finance: What The Final Quarter Of 2022 Has In Store For YFI Price Luna Classic (LUNC) Price Analysis: One-Day Chart LUNC was exchanging hands at $0.000162 at press time. The altcoin just fell from $0.000170 due to intra-day losses. Even with developments in the ecosystem, the LUNC price remains largely unaltered. The rigid price ceiling was at $0.000175, but demand for the coin was too low for bulls to take charge. Once the altcoin topples above the $0.000175 mark, it will be an easy path to the psychological level of $0.00019. On the flip side, with lesser accumulation, LUNC would eye its closest support line of $0.000148. Falling through the $0.000148 mark will bring LUNC to $0.00012. The amount of LUNC traded in the last session was low, indicating bearish strength. Technical Analysis In the past month, the coin displayed a bullish divergence, after which LUNC noted a slight increase in price. Despite that, the bulls could not build on their strength. The Relative Strength Index was near the 40-mark, which meant that the coin was moving toward the oversold zone. Similarly, the LUNC price was below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, which denoted a lack of demand. The reading also indicates that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. In regards to buying strength, capital inflows have also declined due to a lack of investor interest. The Chaikin Money Flow depicts capital inflows and outflows at a given point. The indicator was below the half-line which meant low capital inflows. Related Reading: Ethereum: On-Chain And Social Metrics Reveal Bulls Vs. Bears Battle – Who’s Winning? The Directional Movement Index indicates the general price direction and trend of the asset. DMI was negative as the -DI (orange) line was above the +DI (blue) line. The Average Directional Index (red) was below the 25 mark, indicating a loss of strength in the current price action. Presently, LUNC is trading at 100% lower than its all-time high secured approximately eight months ago. Featured image from Wccftech, Chart: TradingView.com ]]></description>

<p>In the past month, the coin displayed a bullish divergence, after which LUNC noted a slight increase in price. Despite that, the bulls could not build on their strength. The Relative Strength Index was near the 40-mark, which meant that the coin was moving toward the oversold zone.</p>
<p>Similarly, the LUNC price was below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, which denoted a lack of demand. The reading also indicates that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market.</p>

<p>In regards to buying strength, capital inflows have also declined due to a lack of investor interest. The Chaikin Money Flow depicts capital inflows and outflows at a given point. The indicator was below the half-line which meant low capital inflows.</p>

<p>The Directional Movement Index indicates the general price direction and trend of the asset. DMI was negative as the -DI (orange) line was above the +DI (blue) line. The Average Directional Index (red) was below the 25 mark, indicating a loss of strength in the current price action.</p>
<p>Presently, LUNC is trading at 100% lower than its all-time high secured approximately eight months ago.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows Bitcoin whales have continued to shave off their holdings in recent weeks, suggesting that the current lows may not be attractive enough to them. Bitcoin Whales Continue To Sell Despite The Recent Deep Lows As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the number of investors with balances in the 1k to 10k BTC range have continued to decline recently. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;UTXO Count &#8211; Value Bands,&#8221; which tells us about the number of UTXOs (or wallets) that are currently in each Bitcoin value band. These value bands are groups that define ranges between which the balances of UTXOs falling into said bands lie.

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum (ETH) has failed to rise above key resistance at $1,300 despite rising around 4% over the past 24 hours. At press time, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap was trading at $1,289. As the trading volume shows, the bulls and bears have woken up again. In the last 24 hours, the trading volume was $6.4 billion, which is about 31% higher than the previous day. Ethereum On-Chain And Social Metrics Show Uncertainty Analysis company Santiment has conducted an analysis of bullish and bearish signs in on-chain and social data for Ethereum and the result is mixed. A bullish argument is made by Ethereum&#8217;s shark and whale addresses. As Santiment writes, just as with Bitcoin, the ETH millionaire addresses gave up much of their supply while conditions looked poor. Related Reading: How Litecoin (LTC) Outperforms Other Top Cryptocurrencies In This Department However, this circumstance has fundamentally changed recently. A month ago, large ETH addresses started accumulating Ethereum again. Since November 7, Ethereum addresses holding 100 million to 1 million coins have accumulated 1.36% of the total supply and 2.09% more ETH overall (than before). Social volume, on the other hand, looks bearish. As with the majority of all cryptocurrencies, the number of discussions on Ethereum is decreasing, but this seems normal for a bear market. As Santiment notes, this is not necessarily a bad thing when the weak hands leave the market. What is negative, however, is that &#8220;there is so little talk about Ethereum compared to other top assets.&#8221; Related Reading: Upcoming FOMC Meeting Is The Most Important Ever For Bitcoin – Watch Out For The Dot Plot At the same time, this could also turn into a bullish argument if bullish whales can drive the price higher with little resistance, thus significantly affecting the general market sentiment. Currently bearish is also the MVRV (average trading return of addresses). The average return among long-term (365-day) addresses still indicates a &#8220;lot of pain.&#8221; However, based on an emerging long-term uptrend in the MVRV, the metric could also be moving into bullish territory. Extremely bullish is the remaining supply of Ethereum on exchanges. This is at a 4-year low of 12.1% of total supply. Thus, the metric clearly points to a nascent bottom that is forming. Sides Are Still Polarized In contrast, funding rates (perpetual contracts) are neutral. Neither the bulls nor bears can prevail on this metric at the moment. ETH funding rates have been too flat to swing in either direction since the FTX implosion. In terms of realized gains/losses, the bears are clearly winning at the moment, according to Santiment&#8217;s analysis. Given the recent surge in the Ethereum price, there is currently a lot of short-term profit-taking. Ultimately, Santiment summarizes: Overall, Ethereum&#8217;s on-chain and social metrics are about as mixed as the crowd&#8217;s perspective is. [&#8230;]Long-term? [&#8230;] Ethereum is very likely closer to its upcoming 3-year low vs. its 3-year high. But are we at maximal pain? Probably not yet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yearn Finance (YFI) has performed relatively well over the last 30 days, painting its charts in green despite the lingering uncertainty in the crypto market. According to information from Coingecko, at press time, the ERC20 governance token built on the Ethereum blockchain is changing hands at $7,087, going up by 5.7% during the past week and tallying an impressive 15.7% jump on its bi-weekly gauge. Here&#8217;s a quick glance of YFI performance: YFI is experiencing a significant decline in its daily trading volume Yearn Finance could fall all the way down to $6K within the next few days The altcoin could start 2023 with a bullish run to reclaim the $8K territory However, the altcoin’s technical indicators, specifically its Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), on its 4-hour chart doesn’t give much for traders to desire as they indicate a potential bearish run for the asset. The RSI settled below the 50-neutral zone at 48.97, suggesting that selling pressure increased and a lot of buyers veered away from the asset. Meanwhile, Yearn Finance’s CMF fell into a negative value of -0.07 – an indication of a weakened buying activity. Related Reading: How Litecoin (LTC) Outperforms Other Top Cryptocurrencies In This Department Source: TradingView Daily Active Addresses Count And Trading Volume Decline Along with the above-mentioned technical indicators, some developments concerning the cryptocurrency and its network pointed towards a bearish momentum. During the previous week, the number of unique addresses that traded Yearn Finance decreased sharply, going down by 41%. In fact, at the time of this writing, there were only 248 wallets monitored to have participated in YFI transactions. While the cryptocurrency’s spot trading price went up by 3% over the last 24 hours, its trading volume took a hit as it became lower by 25% during the same period. With these, there is a need for a significant uptick in demand for the crypto asset for another increase in value to be triggered as buyers in YFI market appear to be exhausted. However, it would seem that the digital currency could not catch a break as even in that particular department, it is showing signs of struggle. According to latest data, at the moment, only 59 new addresses were present at the network – 48% lower than what was observed within the last eight days. Chart: Santiment Coincodex Forecasts YFI At Over $8K By 2023 Although Yearn Finance’s short-term trajectory looks bleak, it is expected to have a strong start for the year 2023. According to the predictions of online crypto data information aggregator Coincodex, the digital asset is expected to decline significantly within the next five days and will eventually change hands at $$6,094 by December 15.

<p>While the cryptocurrency’s spot trading price went up by 3% over the last 24 hours, its trading volume took a hit as it became lower by 25% during the same period.</p>
<p>With these, there is a need for a significant uptick in demand for the crypto asset for another increase in value to be triggered as buyers in YFI market appear to be exhausted.</p>
<p>However, it would seem that the digital currency could not catch a break as even in that particular department, it is showing signs of struggle.</p>
<p>According to latest <a href="https://app.santiment.net/charts/ds1-ZWU8__sCl">data,</a> at the moment, only 59 new addresses were present at the network – 48% lower than what was observed within the last eight days.</p>

<h2><b>Coincodex Forecasts YFI At Over $8K By 2023</b></h2>
<p>Although Yearn Finance’s short-term trajectory looks bleak, it is expected to have a strong start for the year 2023.</p>
<p>According to the predictions of online crypto data information aggregator <a href="https://coincodex.com/crypto/yearn-finance/price-prediction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coincodex</a>, the digital asset is expected to decline significantly within the next five days and will eventually change hands at $$6,094 by December 15.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-511852 size-jnews-750x375" src="https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/c2-1-750x375.png" alt="" width="750" height="375" srcset="https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/c2-1-750x375.png 750w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/c2-1-360x180.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>

<p>However, the altcoin is expected to bounce back and reclaim its losses just few days after the expected price dump. By January 9, 2023, YFI is seen to trade at $8,891.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum has been showing bullish momentum in the last seven days. ETH has gained momentum in the past 24 hours, while other coins are still declining. This rally supports some theories that the asset will rise above the resistance level in the coming days. Weeks after a massive fallout, the second largest cryptocurrency is heading towards a comeback. The FTX crisis, with other macro factors, affected the entire crypto market, with many assets crashing flat. Although there are many uncertainties in the crypto market, hope seems to be returning to the Ethereum community. Related Reading: MATIC Price Battles Under $1 Despite Bullish Signals Vitalik Buterin, the Ethereum co-founder, made a statement urging people to focus on the technology instead of the current prices. The co-founder was confident that Ethereum-based applications for monetary transactions would scale up the blockchain in the long run. Ethereum Whales Are Buying The Dip In Buterin&#8217;s notes, he expressed a bullish stance that the decentralized stablecoins and the other applications built on Ethereum could have long-term benefits. Meanwhile, bullish Ethereum holders are taking advantage of the dip to accumulate more Ether positions. According to data from Santiment, Ethereum whales are taking advantage of the low prices to buy more ETH. The blockchain analytical firm tweeted that the shark and whale address, with 100 to 1 million ETH, added 2.1% more coins to their wallets. It could be a sign of bullish sentiment for a price rally in the weeks to come. Ethereum is currently trading at $1,280. Two months ago, before Ethereum transitioned to proof of stake, many investors were bullish about the price increase the upgrade could bring. However, two months after the merger, their hopes got dashed as the asset price continuously dropped. Although the upgrade sought to improve the blockchain&#8217;s infrastructure, the co-founder said it could take months to reflect on the ETH price. Bitcoin Stays Down While XRP Surges Amid Whale Accumulations While Ethereum seems to exhibit some bullish trend, Bitcoin is declining with a 24-hour price drop of $0.02%. Other coins are not doing any better, including FTX, except XRP. The report shows that the XRP price increased in the last 24 hours after whale accounts moved over 160 million tokens. According to a report, whales accumulated more than $19 million of XRP tokens from the Bitso crypto exchange. In addition, the report revealed that the tracker recorded another whale addition of 40 million XRP,  approximately $15.3 million.

These accumulations saw XRP&#8217;s price gain a 2% increase in the last 24 hours and are currently trading at $0.3918. The news comes as the XRP lawsuit tends towards a summary judgment.

					<description><![CDATA[With the Bitcoin price posting a small gain of over 1.5% over the last seven days, the market is in for a blockbuster next week. The release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on December 13, Tuesday at 08:30 AM ET, will once again be &#8220;the most important CPI ever&#8221;. Just one day later, on December 14, Wednesday at 2:00 PM ET, the final Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting of the year will take place. Remarkably, FED members will release their updated forecasts for inflation and interest rates (dot plot) at the meeting. A Blockbuster Week The dot plot is released only four times a year &#8211; in March, June, September, and December &#8211; and presents the FOMC&#8217;s economic projections, which look at GDP, unemployment rates, and inflation for the coming months as well as over the longer term. Within the dot plot, each member of the Committee publishes its view of potential interest rates over the longer term. For investors, this is extremely useful information as it allows market participants to see if the consensus path for longer-term interest rates is changing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Regains Strength, Why BTC Could Surpass $18K This Time The markets, as well as Bitcoin investors, will therefore be eagerly watching the inflation forecasts for next year, as well as the interest rate expectations for 2023 and 2024. As economic journalist Colby Smith wrote in November, the September dot plot showed most officials favored a slowdown to 50 basis points in December. The question for next week will be whether the Fed, led by Powell, will put into play a slower rate hike pace of 25 basis points (bps) or even a pivot. The Fed introduced the notion of slowing down the pace of hikes in July and the September dot plot showed support from most officials for a downshift to 50bps in December. The question today is how far Powell goes to ratify that move https://t.co/Pn8n0lh4kZ @FinancialTimes pic.twitter.com/62XOqMlm3T &#8212; Colby Smith (@colbyLsmith) November 2, 2022 A Year-End Rally for Bitcoin? These two events could be the &#8220;last remaining hurdles&#8221; for a year-end rally for Bitcoin, QCP Capital wrote in an analysis. However, a higher-than-expected consumer price index and a tighter stance by the Federal Reserve could derail that rally, as was seen in the April and August reversals. Related Reading: Ethereum Addresses Holding 32 ETH Or More On The Rise, This On-Chain Data Shows On the other hand, further disinflation could lead many to seek a continuation of the rally through the end of the year, according to QCP Capital&#8217;s analysis. It goes on to say that the question markets now face is where inflation will bottom. Even if 2% inflation is out of reach next year, will it fall low enough such that the Fed will have room to cut rates while keeping real rates positive? Therefore, one key market theme for next year will be the shift from &#8216;peak inflation&#8217; to &#8216;trough inflation&#8217;. This is another reason why the dot plot is of paramount importance. As the last two releases show, Powell has stuck relatively strictly to projections regarding interest rates. Thus, the dot plot could reveal some insights into Powell&#8217;s thoughts about a pivot. If the new data matches CPI expectations, it would be the fifth consecutive monthly decline. After peaking at 9.1% YoY in June. Next week&#8217;s reading could be even the lowest since January. Will Powell Follow His Words Given Powell&#8217;s recent comments to the Brookings Institute on November 30, it is also likely that the FED will stick to the script and raise the policy rate by only 50 basis points to 4.5%, reinforcing bullish sentiment in the market. If the CPI even comes in below expectations, markets could frontrun the Fed&#8217;s decision and trigger an end-of-year rally. In any case, next week will provide blockbuster volatility in the Bitcoin and crypto markets. Investors should pay close attention to the release of the FED&#8217;s dot plot. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $17,228, showing signs of strength ahead of the FOMC meeting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Litecoin (LTC) seemingly hit a speed bump that caused its bullish run to slow down a bit after it rallied all the way up to the $83 zone on December 5. The following day, the cryptocurrency closed the trading session with a trading price below the $80 marker before reclaiming said territory on December 7. Since then, the altcoin has been on a downward trend although it is already showing signs of recovery. In fact, at the time of this writing, according to tracking from Coingecko, Litecoin is changing hands at $78.18. LTC only managed to go up by 3% during the last 24 hours but it is still enjoying an increase of 36.3% in its value over the last 30 days. Moreover, the asset, despite its recent price dump, has once again managed to outperform other major cryptocurrencies in other departments. Related Reading: Solana Price Falls Below $14 – Does This Signal A Gloomy Week For SOL? Litecoin Surpasses Ethereum, Dogecoin, XRP In Transactions The 13th largest digital currency with a total market cap of $5.60 billion recently emerged as one of the top choices among cryptocurrencies used as a mode of payment for Bitpay. Specifically, Litecoin accounted for 27.64% of the overall tally of transactions that were being processed by the company’s platform. Although it failed to supplant Bitcoin in this category after the maiden crypto appeared to have been utilized as payment for 41.62% of Bitpay’s total transactions, LTC still beat the likes of Ethereum (ETH), XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE). In addition, the altcoin also proved to be profitable for its miners as data shared by CryptoCompare revealed Litecoin mining had an extremely high profitability rate of 58%. Along this line, its network hash rate also spiked by 3.05% during the last 30 days – a development that suggests that the asset’s blockchain remains strong and healthy. A Bearish Outlook Looms For Litecoin After a bear market-defying performance, LTC seems to be headed on a decline that might cause it to lose the gains it had when it increased its price by more than 33% after November 23. The cryptocurrency experienced rejection when it tested the resistance region of $84.45 as its Relative Strength Index (RSI), which now stands at 38.40, has fallen below the 50-neutral score. The current state of the above-mentioned technical indicator coupled with its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) which was below zero (-0.06) at the time of this writing indicates the momentum now belongs to sellers. With that being said, Litecoin appears to be headed for another bearish trajectory and if left to deal with the possibility of a decline all the way down to $70.40.

<p>In addition, the altcoin also proved to be profitable for its miners as data shared by CryptoCompare revealed <a href="https://invezz.com/news/2022/12/05/ltc-price-movement-after-hash-rate-reaches-new-all-time-high/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Litecoin mining</a> had an extremely high profitability rate of 58%.</p>
<p>Along this line, its network hash rate also spiked by 3.05% during the last 30 days – a development that suggests that the asset’s blockchain remains strong and healthy.</p>
<h2><b>A Bearish Outlook Looms For Litecoin</b></h2>
<p>After a bear market-defying performance, LTC seems to be headed on a decline that might cause it to lose the gains it had when it increased its price by more than 33% after November 23.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency experienced rejection when it tested the resistance region of $84.45 as its Relative Strength Index (RSI), which now stands at 38.40, has fallen below the 50-neutral score.</p>
<p>The current state of the above-mentioned technical indicator coupled with its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) which was below zero (-0.06) at the time of this writing indicates the momentum now belongs to sellers.</p>
<p>With that being said, Litecoin appears to be headed for another bearish trajectory and if left to deal with the possibility of a decline all the way down to $70.40.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[As the bear market continues, Ethereum &#8211; the second-biggest cryptocurrency &#8211; continues to struggle. If you look at the data from CoinGecko, the most notable positive change is 4.1% on the bi-weekly timescale. The red flashing of the longer time scales, however, indicates that ETH has been declining in value since the FTX collapse, and this fact overshadows the shorter time scales. The upswing was triggered by a sudden increase in demand for prime real estate The descending triangle, a confirmation of a rally, is formed in part by accumulation blocks To push prices higher, ETH buyers need to break over the $1,306.66 barrier However, a number of indicators are suddenly showing optimistic signs. With the price of ether at $1,283 right now, recent headlines have reported a sharp increase in the number of holders with certain units of ether. Glassnode discovered a surge in the number of addresses holding 32 ETH or more, or nearly $42,000, despite the fact that the price of Ethereum (ETH) has been dropping and has been volatile. The chart indicating the number of active addresses that had been tallied showed that there were more than 127,000 of them. In addition, it was quite evident that the number of addresses at this time had not only been up but had reached an all-time peak in the previous few years. Related Reading: Up Or Down? What To Expect From Solana (SOL) In The Homestretch Of 2022 Possibly Creating A Rally? Contrary to the rise, CryptoQuant reports that the number of active addresses fell on December 7th. Another bullish indicator is the sharp drop in foreign exchange reserves that has coincided with the rise in the number of high-value addresses. ETH created two bullish order blocks before the increase in high-value addresses. The price of ETH increased by 14.33% and 12.94% during the first and second bullish blocks, respectively. Chart: CryptoQuant The increase of high-value addresses has not yet been reflected in the price, as the price has decreased throughout this time period. Recent market moves have also contributed to the creation of a bullish descending triangle. The regression channel, which has a Pearson&#8217;s R value of 0.6824, bolsters this bullish finding. This indicates that the upward breaks of the upper half of the regression channel correspond to a significant upward trend. Chart: TradingView Quite Surprisingly Bullish The moving average of the Bollinger band acts as resistance at $1,252.15, thereby prolonging this surge. With the RSI rising and the MFI turning bullish, though, the ETH price should explode. Consequently, ETH bulls should initially aim for $1,306. If momentum permits, a further target of $1,348 would indicate that this is the relief rally that ETH holders have been anticipating. The construction of bullish order blocks, the decline in exchange reserves, and the increase of high-value addresses led to the current state of affairs. With Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish trend, the future of Ethereum appears to be very bright. Related Reading: Solana Price Falls Below $14 – Does This Signal A Gloomy Week For SOL?
