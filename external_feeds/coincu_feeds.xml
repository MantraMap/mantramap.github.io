<p>South Korea&#8217;s largest exchange, Upbit, announced the addition of EGLD to its KRW and BTC markets on April 27, 2023. As a result, EGLD&#8217;s Korean won, and BTC transactions will be available, and deposits will open within 3 hours of the announcement. However, the announcement of adding a new digital asset to Upbit often leads to a sharp increase in altcoins, so users should be aware of the risks.</p>



<p>EGLD deposit support will only be available from the mainnet network and not through other networks like BSC.</p>



<p>Orders under certain conditions will be restricted after adding new digital assets to the KRW and BTC markets to provide a safe trading environment and accurate market information to members. When adding a new digital asset, the initial purchase order is limited for about 5 minutes, and sell orders are limited to -10% or less of the previous day&#8217;s closing price of CoinMarketCap. The market price and pre-order are determined to be about an hour.</p>



<p>The price of the new digital asset confirmed on CoinMarketCap is 57,710.38 KRW / 0.001468 BTC as of April 27, 09:30 (KST). Users should refer to this point and be mindful of losses due to rapid market price fluctuations in the initial stage of transaction support.</p>



<p>Investors and traders must be careful as the announcement of EGLD&#8217;s addition to Upbit&#8217;s KRW and BTC markets may lead to high volatility in the market. While EGLD&#8217;s addition to Upbit is a positive development, it is essential to consider the risks involved and make informed decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>MeWe social network with 20M users to integrate with Polkadot parachain.</em></li>



<li><em>MeWe, a social network with reportedly better privacy protections than Facebook, will integrate with the Frequency blockchain network, a parachain of Polkadot. The move will allow MeWe to make a permanent commitment to data ownership for users.</em></li>



<li><em>The integration between MeWe and Frequency is based on the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP), which is expected to provide a basic framework that app developers can build upon to fix a variety of problems in the future.</em></li>

<p>The integration will be based on the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP), which was developed by Frank McCourt’s Project Liberty. MeWe&#8217;s CEO, Jeffrey Edell, stated that the move will allow MeWe to make a permanent commitment to data ownership for users, which aligns with its mission of providing better privacy protections to its users. MeWe plans to begin moving its users’ accounts to the network this quarter.</p>

<p>MeWe was launched in 2012 and has been praised as a “Facebook alternative” with allegedly better privacy protections. An Axios report in September stated that the network had over 20 million users. On the other hand, frequency launched as a Polkadot parachain in November and was initially developed by Amplica Labs. During the panel, Braxton Woodham, the president of Amplica Labs, emphasized that the partnership between Frequency and MeWe will not immediately solve all social media problems. However, he claimed that it would provide a basic framework that app developers can build upon to fix a variety of problems in the future.</p>



<p>While MeWe&#8217;s integration with Frequency is a significant move towards better privacy protections, there is still much work to be done in the world of social media. Social networks involve a lot of different problems, ranging from the user experience to moderation to AI algorithms for curation. It&#8217;s virtually impossible to solve all these problems at once, so MeWe and Frequency are taking an approach to link their digital presence together on the web to create the social web. This sets up the ability to attack the data layer and approach those difficult problems. Overall, the integration between MeWe and Frequency is an exciting development highlighting the growing importance of blockchain technology in social media.</p>

<p>Blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence denied involvement in the flash crash that caused Bitcoin to fall by 7% in less than an hour. DB had reported that the crash was caused by the firm sending out an alert that wallets linked to Mt. Gox and the US government had started shifting large sums of Bitcoin.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[DB] Mt Gox and US Govt Wallets Making Transactions: Arkham Alert</p>&mdash; db (@tier10k) <a href="https://twitter.com/tier10k/status/1651317391626846214?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 26, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>However, Arkham Intelligence claimed that it had conducted an investigation of the situation and found that its alerts were sent accurately, and neither the alert nor the tweet could have caused the sharp BTC price drop. They also pointed out that the drop occurred before the alert and subsequent tweet were sent.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have conducted an investigation of the DB Alert situation, and determined that the Arkham alerts were sent accurately in this case.<br><br>DB set two alerts on all Bitcoin transactions above $10k USD, with no counterparties set, then named the alerts “Mt Gox” and “US Gov”. <br><br>When we… <a href="https://t.co/8OITiygNhL" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/8OITiygNhL</a></p>&mdash; Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1651366459547713537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 26, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Data published by a Twitter user showed that there had been no transfers from wallets associated with Mt. Gox. While a Bitcoin address believed to be the US government&#8217;s wallet for Silk Road hack funds witnessed a transaction worth only $0.19, which was still processing at the time of writing.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The sudden and steep decline in prices wreaked havoc on the derivatives market, with the total sum of liquidations for crypto market participants topping $211 million at present, with Bitcoin traders accounting for nearly $97 million worth of these liquidations.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $28,796, up 1.6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinmarketcap</a>. Despite the flash crash and ensuing chaos, the cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile, with sudden drops or surges not uncommon.</p>

<li><em>Celsius creditors have asked the bankruptcy judge to authorize subpoenas with FTX to identify 10 wallets that manipulated the CEL price last year.</em></li>



<li><em>Creditors of the bankrupt lending platform said it was necessary to identify FTX users to determine if the transaction in question was legitimate.</em></li>



<li><em>Creditors want to determine the value of the CEL native token because it is so important in the bankruptcy controversy.</em></li>

<cite>Court filing by Celsius Creditors Committee.</cite></blockquote>



<p>According to court documents filed Wednesday, Celsius&#8217;s committee of creditors said it needed FTX user information to determine if the transaction was legitimate, saying it was &#8220;an act of market manipulation, such as fake trading.&#8221;</p>



<p>The commission said blockchain consultant Elementus Inc. that they hired identified 947 suspicious transactions that occurred between June 12 and July 13 last year, when the token was priced at 81 cents.</p>



<p>Determining the legitimacy of those transactions could be crucial in the Celsius bankruptcy controversy. The transactions provide significant value to Celsius&#8217;s bankruptcy because some transactions are made between the date on which the platform&#8217;s withdrawals were halted and the date on which the lender filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. </p>

<p>The firm claimed that the lending platform&#8217;s pricing of 81 cents at the time of bankruptcy did not fairly reflect the value when it valued the CEL token at 20 cents in its proposed Chapter 11 plan fair token market. The value of CEL has been contested by creditors, who have pointed to shady activities that might have affected the token&#8217;s price.</p>

<p>The reason behind this sudden decrease, as reported by various media outlets, was due to an incorrectly sent alert by blockchain analytics company Arkham Intelligence. The alert claimed that wallets related to both Mt. Gox and the U.S. government were transferring large sums of Bitcoin.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[DB] Mt Gox and US Govt Wallets Making Transactions: Arkham Alert</p>&mdash; db (@tier10k) <a href="https://twitter.com/tier10k/status/1651317391626846214?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 26, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Initially, Arkham responded to the situation by confirming that the mistake was caused by a bug fix which led to a false alert being sent out to a small group of users on their analytics platform. This confirmation was given through a tweet, which was subsequently shared by the popular crypto news alert account DB or Tier10k.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">

<p>However, an hour after the initial tweet, Arkham published a follow-up message contradicting its previous statement. The company claimed that its alerts had been sent accurately in this case, and that neither the alert nor the tweet could have caused the sharp drop in the price of BTC that day. Arkham highlighted that the drop occurred between 19:17 and 20:01 UTC, while the alerts and subsequent tweet were sent afterward at 20:07 UTC and 20:08 UTC.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have conducted an investigation of the DB Alert situation, and determined that the Arkham alerts were sent accurately in this case.<br><br>DB set two alerts on all Bitcoin transactions above $10k USD, with no counterparties set, then named the alerts “Mt Gox” and “US Gov”. <br><br>When we… <a href="https://t.co/8OITiygNhL" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/8OITiygNhL</a></p>&mdash; Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1651366459547713537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 26, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Moreover, a Twitter user named IT Tech said there have been no transfers from the wallets linked to Mt. Gox. This suggests that the sudden decrease in Bitcoin&#8217;s value may have occurred for reasons unknown to market participants at the time of writing.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>According to data published by blockchain explorer <a href="http://blockchain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blockchain.com</a>, a Bitcoin address that was believed to be the U.S. government&#8217;s wallet for Silk Road hack funds did witness a transaction on April 26. However, it was an inbound transaction worth only $0.19, which was still processing at the time of writing. This information may add to the mystery surrounding the drop in Bitcoin&#8217;s price, leaving investors and analysts alike wondering what the true cause of the decrease may have been.</p>

<p>The parent company of Facebook, today released the company&#8217;s unaudited financial statements for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 through March 31. The report shows Meta&#8217;s total revenue for the first quarter was $28.645 billion, up 3% from $27,908 billion in the same period last year, but net profit was $5.709 billion, down 24% from $7.465 billion in the same period the previous year.</p>



<p>The tech giant has seen an increase in ad revenue from a year earlier, but its metaverse division continues to burn money. Reality Labs had $339 million in revenue for the quarter, compared with $695 million in the same period last year. Labs lost $3.9 billion in the quarter, compared with a loss of $2.9 billion a year earlier.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg <a href="https://news.coincu.com/164049-mark-zuckerberg-still-believes-metaverse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has touted</a> 2023 as the company&#8217;s &#8220;productive year&#8221; and has implemented major cost-cutting initiatives, including layoffs at an expected 21,000 employees. But while the company goes down, it still pumps billions of dollars into the Metaverse after changing its name from Facebook in late 2021.</p>



<p>The company cut 11,000 employees last November, announced it would lay off an additional 10,000 workers last month, and close 5,000 job openings as the company seeks to restructure its structure and eliminate other jobs low priority projects.</p>



<p>In the announcement, Zuckerberg said Metaverse remains &#8220;at the heart of defining the future of social connectivity.&#8221; Still, it will also rely heavily on AI as the &#8220;biggest single investment&#8221; after the success of OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGBT. Zuckerberg added that while the company is advertising its plans to harness artificial intelligence, that doesn&#8217;t mean it is downplaying its metaverse vision.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;A narrative has developed that we&#8217;re somehow moving away from focusing on the metaverse vision, so I just want to say up front that&#8217;s not accurate (…).

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cryptocurrency detective ZachXBT says 114 meme coin scams over the past month and a half are linked to addresses starting with 0x739.</em></li>



<li><em>The amount of damage cannot be accurately measured because the scammers use alternative wallets and split the amount.</em></li>



<li><em>The strong momentum of BTC, ETH, and many other Altcoins has made meme coins start to make waves.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Chain Detective ZachXBT tweeted that in the past month and a half, users have continuously generated 114 meme coin scams, and the stolen funds from each scam will be sent to the same address.</strong></h5>

<p>In the past 1.5 months, one person has created 114 coin meme scams. Each time the funds stolen from the fraud are sent to the same deposit address as 0x739c58807B99Cb274f6FD96B10194202b8EEfB47.</p>



<p>According to detective ZachXBT, taking a total inventory of the coins the scammers have collected is still impossible because they use multiple alternate wallet addresses and split the proceeds.</p>



<p>In recent days, the community has experienced a substantial increase in BTC, ETH and many other Altcoins. When people say &#8220;Altcoin season has come&#8221; is also when the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/182481-elon-musk-aidoge-dog-ai-memecoins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meme coins</a> started to make waves. And the two hottest names are Pepe the Frog (PEPE) and AIdoge.</p>

<p>Critics argue that the enthusiasm surrounding the coin meme and NFT distract from blockchain projects with long-term development value. As investors chase quick returns, they overlook initiatives that could revolutionize industries like finance, healthcare, and supply chain management.</p>



<p>Meme coin and NFT proponents see them as part of the natural evolution of the crypto landscape. They argue that these assets reflect the growing interest in digital currencies and demonstrate the versatility of blockchain technology. From this point of view, the meme coin and NFT are not distractions but creative experiments aimed at pushing the boundaries of the safe zone in the crypto world.</p>



<p>The meme coin and NFT markets are back to life, with critics saying these trends threaten the crypto industry. Fake projects crop up quickly, and gullible investors buy assets without realizing their total value or risk. This &#8220;get rich quick&#8221; mentality catches off guard scams, fakes, and cyber attacks. Since then, potential projects with long-term growth value have been unpopular with many investors.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Bahamas intends to tighten cryptocurrency regulations, which have been tainted by the collapse of the FTX exchange.</em></li>



<li><em>More activities would be included in the new bill.</em></li>



<li><em>The use of algorithmic stablecoins and privacy tokens would be prohibited.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Following months of FTX damage control, the Bahamas&#8217; securities regulator has <a href="https://www.scb.gov.bs/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SCB-Opens-Consultation-Period-for-DARE-Bill-2023-PR.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opened</a> a consultation period for the country&#8217;s Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges (DARE) Bill.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1881.png"><img decoding="async" width="1717" height="1073" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1881.png" alt="Bahamas Introduces New Bill To Tighten Crypto Regulation After FTX Crash" class="wp-image-184205" title="Bahamas Introduces New Bill To Tighten Crypto Regulation After FTX Crash 27"></a></figure></div>


<p>The DARE Bill 2023, which is set to go into effect at the end of the second quarter of 2023, expands customer protection rules and adds disclosure and registration requirements from the DARE 2020 Act.</p>



<p>The definition of &#8220;Digital Business Activities&#8221; in DARE 2023 is expanded to include financial advice on digital assets, digital asset derivatives activities, blockchain node operation, and staking services.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.scb.gov.bs/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SCB-Opens-Consultation-Period-for-DARE-Bill-2023-PR.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>, new regulatory frameworks will be developed to ensure that the Bahamian legislative regime is &#8220;current, proactive, and compliant&#8221; with international standards.</p>



<p>The legislation specifically seeks to strengthen investor protections and risk management from industry-related companies while also improving provisions for market innovation and development.</p>



<p>The new bill includes provisions for stablecoins, proof-of-work mining, and staking, and it has the potential to become among the most advanced pieces of digital-asset legislation in the world, according to Christina Rolle, executive director of the Bahamas&#8217; regulator.</p>



<p>Strengthened regulations for crypto exchanges, financial and reporting requirements, and stablecoin regulation will all be prioritized.</p>



<p>Businesses intending to operate an exchange in the country will be required to demonstrate that they have systems in place to handle the scale and nature of their operations.</p>



<p>DARE is also said to include staking provisions, advice on managing digital asset activities, and distributed ledger network nodes.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://news.coincu.com/151785-bahamas-denies-cooperation-with-sbf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bahamas</a> was the headquarters of Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s bankrupt crypto exchange FTX. The company, which declared bankruptcy in November, was allegedly riddled with corruption and fraud, which was fueled by commingling and misappropriating user funds.</p>

<p>Bankman-Fried has since been accused of stealing corporate funds and spending them on luxury villas in the Bahamas. The US Department of Justice charged him with fraud, and he pleaded not guilty. FTX&#8217;s new management has criticized poor governance during his tenure, and the company is also embroiled in a lengthy legal dispute with the Bahamas over jurisdiction.</p>



<p>Following the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin last year, the new bill will include a new and comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins whose value is pegged to the US dollar or another stable asset.</p>



<p>The creation of algorithmic stablecoins and privacy tokens will be &#8220;expressly&#8221; prohibited as well. The bill also addresses crypto services such as advice, derivatives, and staking, as well as non-fungible token oversight.</p>

<p>As a result, the Fund has become the first US-registered mutual fund to use a public blockchain system for processing transactions and recording share ownership. A blockchain-integrated system is expected to enhance security, speed up transaction processing, and reduce costs, benefiting shareholders.</p>



<p>Investors can now access the Fund through an Ethereum-based blockchain supported by Polygon. This provides access to the Fund through a Layer 2 blockchain that has demonstrated its reliability.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Extending the reach of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund to Polygon enables the Fund to be further compatible with the rest of the digital ecosystem, specifically through an Ethereum-based blockchain. This furthers our distribution reach through a Layer 2 (L2) blockchain that has a proven track record.</p>
<cite>said Roger Bayston, head of digital assets at Franklin Templeton, in the press release</cite></blockquote>



<p>The Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund is a regulated fund that invests at least 99.5% of its assets in government securities, cash, and repurchase agreements fully collateralized by government securities or currency. Token holders can gain exposure to the Fund using one BENJI token on the Benji Investments app for mobile devices.</p>



<p>Franklin Templeton&#8217;s move to blockchain integration has resulted in operational efficiencies, and the company continues exploring blockchain technology&#8217;s potential. By leveraging the Ethereum ecosystem, investors can enjoy a stable $1.00 share price and high current income levels consistent with preserving shareholders&#8217; capital and liquidity. </p>

<p>Polygon&#8217;s blockchain ecosystem spans many L2, sidechains, and sovereign blockchains, and its suite of Ethereum scalability solutions has seen significant adoption across DeFi, NFTs, and enterprises. The Polygon blockchain provides access to a $260 billion market, representing the approximate aggregate value of all ERC-20 (Ethereum-based) assets. Tokenized assets are set to disrupt the global financial system positively, and Franklin Templeton is at the forefront of this movement.</p>

<p>The United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Damian Williams, announced that Esteban Cabrera Da Corte pled guilty to participating in a scheme to steal millions of dollars in cryptocurrency and trick US banks into refunding the millions used to purchase that cryptocurrency, in part by using stolen personal identifying information from other people.</p>



<p>According to US Attorney Damian Williams:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Esteban Cabrera Da Corte orchestrated a scheme to steal millions of dollars by buying cryptocurrency using false and stolen identities and then deceiving U.S. banks regarding those transactions.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>From at least in or around 2020 to at least in or around March 2020, Da Corte and his co-conspirators engaged in a scheme to defraud US banks and a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform by purchasing more than $4 million in cryptocurrency and then falsely claiming that the cryptocurrency purchase transactions were unauthorized, tricking the US banks and the exchange into reversing those transactions and redepositing the money into the Defendants&#8217; bank accounts. They then took the funds from the bank accounts.</p>



<p>They opened accounts with the exchange to carry out this scheme, frequently using photos of fake US passports, fake driver&#8217;s licenses, and stolen personal identifying information.</p>



<p>The exchange accounts were linked to bank accounts controlled by the defendants. They purchased cryptocurrency with money that had been deposited into the linked bank accounts, frequently through a series of cash deposits made using ATMs.</p>



<p>That cryptocurrency was then quickly transferred to other cryptocurrency wallets controlled by the Defendants and their co-conspirators outside of the exchange.</p>



<p>After the cryptocurrency was transferred, they called US banks and falsely claimed that the cryptocurrency purchases were unauthorized, causing the banks to reverse the transactions.</p>

<p>According to the Justice Department, the scheme resulted in more than $4 million in false reversals at US banks, while a cryptocurrency exchange lost approximately $3.5 million in digital assets.</p>



<p>Cabrera pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a 20-year prison sentence, and agreed to pay $3.6 million in restitution, with an additional $1.2 million forfeiture.</p>
