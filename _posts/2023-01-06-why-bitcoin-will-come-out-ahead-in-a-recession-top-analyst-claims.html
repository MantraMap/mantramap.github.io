Bitcoin keeps moving with no clear direction in the first week of 2023. Following a rejection from a critical resistance zone, the cryptocurrency returned to its range and could be gearing up for a re-test of support.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Falls, Is It A Wise Idea To Short? In the meantime, altcoins are blooming, with many recording profits on high timeframes. As of this writing, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $16,700 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. In the previous seven days, BTC records similar price action.  BTC In The Short Term, What&#8217;s Driving The Price Action? Bitcoin is reacting to macroeconomic developments and the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) monetary policy in the short term. As NewsBTC reported yesterday, investors are hesitant to trade in any direction due to uncertainty around global markets. The situation is likely to persist during January. Today the U.S. released new economic data, but with &#8220;mixed&#8221; results, according to a pseudonym analyst:  Economic Data a bit mixed.

This massive crash will ripple across the nascent industry and operate as the final catalyzer for another rally. The analyst said: The rising potential for a severe global economic slowdown may be a top crypto performance factor in 20222. Out bias is that Bitcoin is more likely to come out ahead in most scenarios (…).
