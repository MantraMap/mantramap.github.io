<p class="s6">Navigating the volatility of the crypto market is a skill that comes with experience. Such experience can be found among seasoned investors who have honed their skills and can spot a gem in the dirt.</p>
<p class="s6">While Sparklo might be dirt when compared to Binance Coin (BNB), investors believe the token has what it takes to hold its own in the bull run. As a result, investors are queuing to get their share of the presale token.</p>
<p class="s8">Binance Coin (BNB) Recent Burn Fails at Providing a Rally</p>
<p class="s6">Binance Coin (BNB) is the native token of the Binance exchange, the world&rsquo;s largest. The exchange&rsquo;s crypto influence means its native token would be one of the largest in the world, ranking 4th, only behind Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT). Binance Coin's (BNB) utility is tied to its being a trading tool on the exchange and being accepted as a payment option by large corporations.</p>
<p class="s6">A notable event that happened with the token in the previous week was the disposal of part of its supply. The exchange completed its 23rd quarterly Binance Coin (BNB) burn, which should play a great part in its bullish run. The total amount of burned Binance Coin (BNB) was over 2 million, worth over $676 million based on its value then.</p>
<p class="s6">However, the Binance Coin (BNB) is yet to have an upward trend, even with the total supply burn, as the token currently trades at $316 at the time of writing. Instead of a pump, the token has rather taken a downtrend, down 2.3% in the last 7 days and 2.6% in the past 24 hours at the time of writing.</p>
<p class="s6">It leaves room to wonder if such an event couldn't positively affect the price, what would? With options available to investors, they are particularly interested in the presale token, Sparklo.</p>
<p class="s6">What is Sparklo? How will it play against the Binance Coin (BNB)</p>
<p class="s6">There has been incessant chatter about Sparklo in the crypto community. The discussion primarily centered around the token&rsquo;s presale, its functionality, and the hype it is generating. After some research, we have reason to believe that investors should be excited about Sparklo&rsquo;spresale after all.</p>
<p class="s6">Sparklo is currently a presale token worth only $0.015, which is a steal if you ask me, considering the hype and use cases. The token&rsquo;s unique protocol makes it an instant favorite, as it is an investment platform that deals in precious metals like platinum, gold, and silver. Investors can fractionally invest in these physical assets, which they will receive in the form of an NFT. However, the purchase of the complete asset, or NFT, means the precious metal will be physically delivered to the investor.</p>
<p class="s6">In addition, the team recently audited its smart contract successfully, has an ongoing KYC audit, and completely locked the token&rsquo;s liquidity. These are all bullish signs, and as early adopters, investors can see the token&rsquo;s price go as high as 1,000% in the next year.</p>
