<p>In a strong commitment to Bitcoin adoption, business intelligence firm <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/microstrategy-turns-profitable-in-q1-after-betting-big-on-bitcoin/">MicroStrategy</a> is intensifying its efforts to incorporate layer 2 scaling solutions, particularly the Lightning Network, this year. Executive chairman Michael Saylor recently provided an <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1657807531664605185">update</a>, revealing that the company is developing a product to offer a Bitcoin wallet and Lightning address to every corporate account holder.<br /><br />The primary objective behind this initiative is to facilitate the swift and seamless development and deployment of Bitcoin rewards applications for employees, customers, prospects, and partners. The Lightning Network serves as a layer-2 payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, enabling off-chain transactions, increasing payment throughput, and reducing transaction fees.<br /><br /><a href="https://valkyrieinvest.com/daily-market-brief/the-valkyrie-market-brief-02-06-23/">Reports</a> indicate that the adoption of the Lightning Network is gaining momentum, particularly in emerging markets like South America and Africa. This can be attributed, in part, to the efforts of the Bitcoin payment company and wallet provider Strike.<br /><br />Back in December, Saylor shared MicroStrategy&#8217;s exploration of software and solutions that leverage the Lightning Network. These included solutions supporting enterprise marketing and a cybersecurity solution tailored for corporate websites. In April, the 58-year-old billionaire also announced the integration of Bitcoin&#8217;s Lightning Network into his corporate email address. This allows anyone to send BTC to Saylor using his company email address as an identifier.<br /><br />Aside from its focus on the Lightning Network, MicroStrategy has consistently expanded its Bitcoin holdings, making it the largest corporate holder of the flagship cryptocurrency. According to data compiled by Bitcoin Treasuries, MicroStrategy currently owns 140,000 BTC, accumulating more portions of the asset throughout all 11 previous quarters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Reports have emerged stating that South Korean prosecutors have <a href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2023/05/15/national/politics/korea-upbit-bithumb/20230515201129323.html">conducted raids</a> on the offices of the country&#8217;s two leading cryptocurrency exchanges, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/upbit-crypto-exchange-announces-49-million-worth-of-ether-was-stolen/">Upbit</a> and Bithumb. The raids are part of an ongoing investigation involving Kim Nam-kuk, a politician who faced public scrutiny over allegations of acquiring 800,000 Wemix tokens without adhering to the necessary regulations. The authorities suspect that the platforms may have somehow been involved in the transfer of the coins from Bithumb to Upbit last year.<br /><br />To unravel the case involving Kim Nam-kuk, local media outlets reported that Korean authorities searched the headquarters of Upbit and Bithumb in Seoul. Recently, the Democratic Party (DP) urged Nam-kuk to sell his 800,000 Wemix coins amid accusations of potentially using insider information to accumulate them a few years ago. It is alleged that Nam-kuk withdrew the assets at the beginning of 2022, several months before the enforcement of legislation requiring cryptocurrency entities to report personal information for transfers exceeding $758. Notably, Nam-kuk was part of the team that proposed a delay in the income taxation on digital assets in South Korea. He has now stated his intention to sell the holdings, which are currently valued at approximately $660,000, in compliance with the DP&#8217;s recommendation.<br /><br /><a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1658069446802702336">Wu Blockchain</a> argued that Nam-kuk&#8217;s transfer of 800,000 Wemix coins from Bithumb to Upbit in 2022 may have sparked the investigation against the exchanges. Upbit deemed the transaction &#8220;improper&#8221; and reported it to the government at that time. In January, Korean prosecutors raided Bithumb&#8217;s offices following rumors of price manipulation of an undisclosed coin listed on the platform. The authorities clarified that the raid aimed to secure transaction details for a specific coin and had no direct connection to Bithumb itself.<br /><br />The recent inspection comes shortly after prosecutors sought an arrest warrant for Kang Jong-Hyun, the owner of<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/south-korean-financial-regulator-intends-to-close-11-crypto-exchange-companies/"> Bithumb</a>, on charges of embezzlement and market manipulation. Jong-Hyun&#8217;s sister also encountered legal issues, as the Seoul Southern District Prosecutor&#8217;s Office claimed she artificially inflated the share price of certain firms through the issuance of convertible bonds.<br /><br />Despite being one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, Bithumb has faced various controversies over the years. In December 2022, Park Mo, the largest shareholder of Bithumb Holdings Co., was found dead in front of his house in southern Seoul. Although initial investigations suggested suicide and found no signs of violence, the crypto community raised doubts. Mo was closely associated with Jong-Hyun and his sister and had supposedly discussed the potential purchase of his organization by the now-bankrupt FTX.</p>

<h3>3. Market NFTs</h3>
<p>Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are unique assets stored on a digital ledger. NFTs have the excellent feature that the investment you store may be priceless. You may create NFTs for anything, including video, digital designs, photography, music, games, and GIFs.</p>
<p>Making an <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/wazirx-closes-nft-marketplace-due-to-low-engagements/">NFT</a> is easy. Websites like OpenSea let you to create an account and follow the step-by-step minting process (which involves additional gas fees).</p>
<p>Despite being a new business, NFT revenues have already shot above the $10 billion mark. You can still access the location. Just be aware that producing NFTs that will sell requires an upfront investment in time and minting costs.</p>
<h3>4. Yield Farming</h3>
<p>One of the more complicated possibilities here is yield farming, which will necessitate extensive more study for those who are interested. Yet it can also be one of the most profitable ways to use cryptocurrency for passive income.</p>
<p>Investors fund yield farms by putting their tokens into a liquidity pool, a unique kind of smart contract. A part of the fees made by traders using the pool goes to those who supply liquidity in this fashion.</p>
<h3>5. Crypto Games</h3>
<p>While playing bitcoin games online is becoming increasingly popular, passive income opportunities should grow. There are several crypto games available, and many of them offer rewards for using different kinds of crypto.</p>
<p>Axie Infinity, The Sandbox, Gods Unchained, Ethermon, and Pegaxy are just a few of the varied games.</p>
<h3>6. Forks and Airdrops</h3>
<p>An existing coin forks when it diverges into a new chain. New coins are manufactured and &#8220;dropped&#8221; onto users as a form of reward in an airdrop.</p>
<p>Users have no control over whether or when these occurrences might happen. But, your chances improve if you participate in the crypto economy.</p>
<h3>7. Airdrops</h3>
<p>Before an Initial Coin Offering, crypto projects would use airdrops as a marketing strategy to increase their circulation and popularity (ICO). This entails giving away free copies of the project&#8217;s native token to potential users. As a result, the pass receives more notice and circulates more widely before going on sale.</p>
<p>Airdrops come in a variety of forms. Some provide you tokens only for connecting your wallet, while others make you perform easy requirements like like the project&#8217;s social media page. Even though airdrops are unpredictable or rarely offer big profits, they can be a fun way to diversify your cryptocurrency holdings.</p>
<h3>9. Create an account on YouTube</h3>
<p>A YouTube channel can still be started. A startling 74% of people in the US use YouTube. A huge audience like that may be attracted for passive income. The issue? It requires a lot of work at first with little to no payoff.</p>
<p>Yet, if you have a long-term outlook and are content with front-loading your effort, a popular YouTube channel has huge potential for passive income. Ads, affiliate sales, sponsorships, branded integrations, and other passive income streams can all add up as you increase your audience, content, clicks, and views.</p>
<h3>10. Learn to Earn</h3>
<p>Some platforms reward users with cryptocurrency for using the learning center. It compensates users for their knowledge of the platform by encouraging them to watch videos and complete quizzes. Users receive these coins at the end of the course, and the content is often centered around a specific altcoin. Users can exchange these tokens for other tokens on the site, sell them for cash, or use the proceeds to buy tokens for another potential project, as some of them may not be suitable for long-term investment.</p>

<p>According to a recent report from market intelligence firm Messari, the<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/tron-deals-with-major-blockchain-and-gaming-groups-in-south-korea/"> Tron blockchain</a> experienced a notable surge in usage during the first quarter of 2023. Despite facing lawsuits from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Tron ecosystem tokens, the network remained resilient, displaying robust activity. The market cap of Tron&#8217;s native token, TRX, also saw a substantial increase of nearly 20% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ).<br /><br />In terms of revenue, Tron witnessed impressive growth, with total quarterly revenue reaching $90.04 million in Q1 2023. This marked an impressive 88% jump from Q4 2022 revenue of $47.96 million.<br /><br />The report highlighted a 7.7% increase in average daily transactions during the three-month review period, reaching approximately 7 million transactions. Messari attributed this growth partly to staking activity on the network. Although staking accounted for only about 3% of all transactions on the TRX network, the total transaction count originating from staking activities soared by 197% QoQ.<br /><br />The &#8220;State of Tron&#8221; <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-tron-q1-2023?">report,</a> commissioned by Tron itself, revealed that smart contracts triggered and TRX transfers dominated the transaction activity on the network, accounting for 88% of all transactions. <br /><br />Despite remaining relatively stable throughout Q1, these transaction types showcased the USDT smart contract as the primary driver of contract execution on TRON.<br /><br />Furthermore, transaction fees experienced a substantial surge during the first quarter. Statistics indicated a 59.2% increase in the average transaction fee denominated in TRX and an 80.2% increase when measured in USD. <br /><br />Committee proposal No. 79, approved in the previous quarter, played a crucial role in driving the hike in transaction fees. This proposal introduced changes to network parameters, increasing the energy required to execute smart contracts.<br /><br />Overall, the Tron blockchain demonstrated impressive growth in usage and market cap during Q1 2023, defying the challenges posed by SEC lawsuits. The network&#8217;s resilience, combined with the surge in revenue, transaction volume, and transaction fees, indicates a thriving ecosystem with increasing adoption and activity.</p>

<p>In a tweet on <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1657099651210969088">May 12</a>, Binance announced its decision to halt operations in Canada, following the footsteps of other proactive crypto companies that have withdrawn from the Canadian marketplace.</p>
<p>While acknowledging Canada&#8217;s sentimental value and expressing optimism for the country&#8217;s crypto sector,<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-accused-of-deliberately-flouting-laws-by-cftc-chief/"> Binance</a> cited recent regulatory guidance as the reason for its departure, deeming it unfeasible to continue operating under the new conditions.</p>
<p>Despite disagreeing with the new guidelines, Binance expressed its intention to maintain engagement with Canadian regulators and return to the market when users regain the freedom to access a broader range of digital assets.</p>
<p>The regulatory landscape changed in February when Canadian securities regulators introduced new guidelines, mandating pre-registration filings and imposing specific rules on crypto companies.</p>
<p>Notably, companies operating in Canada are now required to segregate funds belonging to Canadian users and withhold margin or leverage trading from them.</p>
<p>Binance joins the ranks of Paxos, dYdX, Blockchain.com, and OKX, all of which have withdrawn their services from the Canadian market.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Kraken, Coinbase, Crypto.com, and Gemini have expressed their intent to continue operating in Canada.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/nexo-settles-with-sec-for-45-million/">Nexo</a>, a prominent cryptocurrency lending platform, has decided to dissolve two of its business units based in the United Kingdom as it grapples with regulatory challenges in various parts of Europe and North America. This move is part of a broader restructuring effort, although Nexo will continue its operations within the country.<br /><br />According to filings reported by<a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/crypto-lender-nexo-takes-steps-to-dissolve-uk-units-1.1918939"> BNN Bloomberg</a>, Nexo has applied to remove Nexo Financial Services Ltd. and Nexo Clearing and Custody Ltd. from the UK company register. In a message to Bloomberg, Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of Nexo, explained that the company is undergoing restructuring and reevaluating its approach to client services.<br /><br />Aside from crypto trading and custody, Nexo offers a range of crypto-based financial products, including debit card services, borrowing, and savings accounts. The savings accounts, as advertised on their website, can yield &#8220;up to 15% APR on your crypto,&#8221; with Bitcoin reaching as high as 7% and USDC up to 12%.<br /><br />Regulators in the United States have expressed skepticism towards crypto-based interest-bearing accounts, highlighting their unusually high savings rates compared to traditional accounts. Unlike chartered banks, crypto financial platforms are not covered by federal deposit insurance. Scrutiny heightened in mid-2022 after several crypto lending platforms, including Celsius, Voyager, and later BlockFi, encountered financial difficulties.<br /><br />Nexo clarified that it is not facing the same dire financial situation as those firms. However, it continues to face ongoing scrutiny and charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission in the coming months. In December, Nexo announced its departure from the United States due to regulatory obstacles.<br /><br />Furthermore, Nexo&#8217;s Earn product is currently inaccessible in Canada due to the complete ban on crypto margin trading imposed by regulators in the country. The company&#8217;s troubles also extend to Bulgaria, where its offices were raided in January on allegations of money laundering, tax fraud, and computer fraud related to unlicensed banking services.</p>
<p>Trenchev dismissed these accusations as &#8220;ludicrous&#8221; and responded by filing a $1 million lawsuit against Bulgaria.</p>

<p>In a significant development within its ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/blockfi-set-to-pay-back-over-100000-to-california-users/">BlockFi</a> has been granted authorization to refund $297 million to select customers, as reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/blockfi-gets-court-permission-return-297-million-wallet-customers-2023-05-11/">Reuters</a> on May 11. This decision pertains specifically to customers who held funds in BlockFi&#8217;s Wallet rather than its interest-bearing accounts.<br /><br />The ruling was delivered by Judge Michael Kaplan, who determined that while wallet users maintained ownership of their deposits, customers who stored funds in interest-bearing accounts relinquished ownership and granted control to BlockFi. Subsequently, the company utilized those assets for its lending activities.<br /><br />However, customers who transferred their funds to the wallet accounts as a last-minute measure when BlockFi filed for<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/crypto-lender-blockfi-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection/"> bankruptcy</a> in November last year will not be eligible for the refund. Approximately 48,000 users attempted to move a total of $375 million from interest accounts to wallet accounts during that period.<br /><br />Although customer lawyers contended that this amount should also be returned, Judge Kaplan dismissed the claim, citing BlockFi&#8217;s failure to finalize those transactions and its prerogative to block such transfers during the service halt.<br /><br />BlockFi&#8217;s legal representatives previously argued that returning the $375 million sum would dilute the value of funds recoverable by wallet users. They further asserted that such a payout could impede BlockFi from refunding any funds altogether due to a lack of fund segregation.<br /><br />The tumultuous series of events began when BlockFi temporarily suspended user withdrawals and activity on November 10, 2022, in response to the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. Subsequently, the company filed for bankruptcy on November 28.<br /><br />Earlier in March, BlockFi had already initiated refunds of $100,000 to users in California.</p>

This decision was part of a broader action that involved transferring 16 other struggling digital assets, including JasmyCoin (JASMY), OMG Network (OMG), WazirX (WRX), Serum (SRM), OAX (OAX), and more.<br /><br />Binance <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1656231470959063041?s=20">CEO Changpeng</a> &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao explained that rather than directly delisting these tokens, the exchange opted to move them to the innovation zone based on a suggestion from a community member. CZ emphasized that this relocation serves as a prelude, allowing the failing projects to improve. However, CZ made it clear that if these projects fail to demonstrate progress, delisting remains a possibility.<br /><br />The innovation zone on Binance was specifically designed to provide users with a platform to trade innovative projects characterized by higher volatility and risks compared to other tokens. Binance will periodically review and assess projects that meet these criteria, monitoring their development closely. If deemed appropriate, these projects could be migrated to Binance&#8217;s main platform.<br /><br />Both Voyager (VGX) and FTX (FTT) have experienced a significant decline in interest since filing for bankruptcy in 2022. VGX, for instance, has dropped from over $1 to approximately $0.15911 at the time of writing, representing an 83% decline over the past year. Its market capitalization has also plummeted to around $40 million from a peak of over $300 million, with a daily trading volume below $10 million.<br /><br />Similarly, FTX&#8217;s FTT has witnessed a rapid decline from its previous heights. The token, associated with the bankrupt exchange, has fallen by over 96% to $1.18594 after reaching an all-time high of over $84 in 2021. Currently, its market capitalization stands at $390.05 million, with a trading volume of $11 million.<br /><br />As the situation unfolds, Binance&#8217;s move to the innovation zone provides a new opportunity for these struggling tokens to potentially turn their fortunes around.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/tether-predicts-700-million-q1-profit-cto-reveals/">Tether</a>, the dominant player in the stablecoin market, recently <a href="https://tether.to/en/tethers-latest-q1-2023-assurance-report-shows-reserves-surplus-at-all-time-high-of-244b-up-148b-in-net-profit-new-categories-for-additional-transparency-reveals-bitcoin-and-gold-allocations/">released</a> its Q1 2023 financial report, revealing an impressive net profit of $1.5 billion. BDO Italia, an auditing firm, attested to the accuracy of the report, adding credibility to the figures.<br /><br />The reserves report provided a comprehensive breakdown of Tether&#8217;s assets as of March 31, showcasing a significant increase in reserves to $2.44 billion. Notably, the report introduced new asset categories, such as physical gold, diversifying Tether&#8217;s holdings. Additionally, the first quarter witnessed remarkable growth in both profit and token circulation, with a 20% increase.<br /><br />Tether&#8217;s total consolidated assets amounted to a staggering $81.8 billion, with a substantial portion invested in US Treasury bills. In a strategic move to enhance security and liquidity for its users, Tether revealed its plan to reduce reliance on traditional bank deposits and instead engage with the repo market.<br /><br />Paolo Ardoino, the CTO of Tether, expressed satisfaction with the net profits, highlighting how they underscored the platform&#8217;s stability. Ardoino emphasized Tether&#8217;s continuous monitoring of the global economic landscape to safeguard customer funds. However, concerns have been raised by former SEC official John Reed Stark regarding Tether&#8217;s operations.<br /><br />Stark cautioned that an attestation report should not be equated with a conventional financial audit, casting doubt on the financial stability of a firm like Tether that operates without a certified financial audit. He also raised concerns about Tether&#8217;s regulatory status, pointing out its lack of SEC registration and investor protection. Stark&#8217;s remarks highlight the importance of ongoing scrutiny of Tether&#8217;s operations and regulatory compliance.<br /><br />While Tether&#8217;s Q1 performance paints a lucrative picture, the company must address the concerns raised by industry experts and regulatory bodies to ensure transparency and build trust within the crypto community.</p>
