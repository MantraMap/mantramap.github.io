			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">With thousands of cryptos in the dip, finding tokens that will deliver gains in the short and long term has become a hassle. However, recent analyses have pointed to Uwerx, a new crypto that has defied market odds with its presale and bullish token surpassing expectations. </p>
<p class="s5">The WERX token has witnessed over a 100% surge due to its utility, with analysts predicting that WERX, which started at $0.005, could reach $1 by Q1 of 2024.</p>
<p class="s5">This article will give deeper insights into what makes Uwerx unique, its presale, and the 2024 price predictions for Chiliz (CHZ). </p>
<p class="s8">&gt;&gt;BUY WERX TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Chiliz (CHZ) 2024 Predictions As It Gains Bullish Sentiments
<p class="s5">Chiliz (CHZ) was recently listed as a security by the SEC. This action which took a huge toll on many cryptos seems to have not had much effect on Chiliz (CHZ), as evidenced in its token&rsquo;s recent performance. Chiliz (CHZ) has continued trending, recording above 17% increase in the past week. </p>
<p class="s5">This is quite surprising as the token has been in the red for over two months before the SEC&rsquo;s action. Hence, the recent traction is bewildering. </p>
<p class="s5">Chiliz (CHZ) continues to display strong potential, meaning it will likely gain a price increase. The CHZ token sells at $0.07591, but 2024 predictions show it could reach $0.15. </p>
<p class="s5">The recent bullish sentiments Chiliz (CHZ) has witnessed show the token might not be entirely market dependent but is affected by the value it provides and the moves it makes.</p>
Chiliz (CHZ) Launches The Sports Blockchain, Gets Listed In The Asian Markets
<p class="s5">Chiliz (CHZ) is a Layer-1 protocol revolutionizing the entertainment and sports industry and bringing them to Web3. Chiliz&rsquo;s (CHZ) recent launch of the Sports Blockchain is a testament to this vision and its continued efforts to actively connect fans with their favorite teams and players.</p>
<p class="s5">This separates it from the tons of cryptos in the market, putting it in the spotlight since its 2016 launch. The Sports blockchain provides the infrastructure and facilities needed for sports. Chiliz(CHZ) has begun migrating Fan Tokens to the blockchain, and so far, it has moved that of PRSJ, RIVER, TIGERS, SHARKS, HASHTAG, and BENFICA.</p>
<p class="s5">Chiliz (CHZ), which faces delisting in the US, has been listed among the over 400 tradeable assets in the Indonesian market. This announcement has further boosted the CHZ token, signifying a future surge in trading activities. </p>
<p class="s8">&gt;&gt;BUY WERX TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Uwerx&rsquo;s (WERX) Presale Exceeds Initial Forecasts
<p class="s5">The speed at which Uwerx&rsquo;s presale progressed is still shocking, as it started just a few months back and is now in its final round, stage 5. The increased demand for WERX has led to increasing the presale WERX quantity to 427.5 million. 72.5 million WERX is available in stage 5, and WERX total supply is 750 million. </p>
<p class="s5">The WERX price has tremendously increased, as it is now at $0.047725, a huge surge from the starting price of $0.005. The same goes for its launch price, as WERX is set to launch at $0.095 - $0.115. There is an ongoing 15% purchase bonus to further benefit users at the current presale stage.</p>
Uwerx (WERX) Has Competitive Advantage Over Centralized Freelancing Platforms
<p class="s5">A recent report shows that 71% of companies hire freelancers to increase business agility, especially during economic uncertainty. These companies will usually go to freelancing platforms that provide better working conditions and services at a subsidized rate, which is why Uwerx will gain massive adoption.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx will be the first decentralized freelancing platform as it integrates blockchain technology. It will charge only a 1% service fee against the 10 or 20% charged by centralized platforms. Another innovative feature of this project is the Uwerx Vault, which is similar to the concept of staking. The Vault acts as a storage for users to store their tokens while simultaneously providing rewards. </p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx&rsquo;s Alpha version has been launched and now has features such as Freelancer Profile Creation, Hiring Dashboard Page, Forgot Password, Sign-Up and Logging Pages, Initial Step of Job Creation, Freelancer or Client Initiation, Job Creation Process Page, My Activity Page, Settings, Initial Step of Finding Talent, Milestone, and Application Boosting using the WERX token.</p>
<p class="s11">The Job Creation Page was revamped to the Post Job and Apply Page to make it easier for freelancers to apply for jobs. Features like Freelancer and Client Dashboards and Tools will soon be released.</p>
<p class="s11">The platform has gained over 1,825 Telegram members, 1,652 Twitter followers, and 6,953 sign-ups. SolidProof and InterFi Network have conducted audits on Uwerx and approved its security.</p>
<p class="s11">Uwerx will soon be transitioning to its Beta version, which is now in the works. This will allow users to test the platform. Many developments have been made, and users will be updated soon. </p>
<p class="s11">The project&rsquo;s success also follows the agile methodology the developers use to release the project in bits while making improvements following users&rsquo; feedback. The team is user-based, welcoming users&rsquo; feedback and putting them into action. This feedback can be sent to their email, feedback@uwerx.network. </p>
<p class="s11">Following a modification of the WERX allocations, the team re-assigned only 7% of the total WERX allocation to themselves (previously 8%) and locked their token share, which will last for nine months. This action was hastened by the 82.8% of the community who voted for them to start before the presale ended, and it began on June 7. The presale ends on July 31. </p>
<p class="s11">The team will give up the ownership of the smart contract immediately after Uwerx launches on centralized exchanges. Also, a Test Airdrop will be conducted to validate receiving wallet addresses for users after 98.2% of the token holders voted for this. </p>
<p class="s11">Uwerx has all it takes to become a dominating force in the freelancing industry with its fundamental advantages over traditional freelancing platforms. Indeed, it is poised for massive adoption. </p>
<p class="s11">Its presale is the best opportunity to enter this blue-chip future at an extremely good price. Solook no further! Purchase the WERX token now for a 15% purchase bonus.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>InQubeta (QUBE) has joined Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on Reddit&rsquo;s list of tokens selected to enjoy bull runs in 2023. Ethereum has had the most substantial price growth in 2023 with its prices rising by over 60%. Bitcoin lagged behind Ethereum, despite having the larger market capitalization, with its prices only growing by about 40% at the height of its bull run.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency markets have been generally bearish since the two most popular tokens&rsquo; price growth earlier in the year, but that hasn&rsquo;t stopped InQubeta&rsquo;s presale from exceeding all expectations. Tokens allocated for the presale&rsquo;s beta stage were sold out before the period ended. Investors standing to increase the value of their investments by 400% thanks to incremental price changes at each of the presale's ten stages is one of the best deals in the cryptocurrency world.</p>
InQubeta (QUBE) making waves with Reddit investors
<p>Reddit investors know a thing about bull runs so it&rsquo;s prudent to consider which cryptocurrencies or other investment opportunities are popular on the forum. Redditors wreaked havoc on Wall Street whales a few years ago when the forum backed stocks like GameStop and AMC, squeezing hedge funds that were shorting them.</p>
<p>The Reddit mania led to $24 billion being traded on U.S. stock exchanges on Jan 27, 2021, exceeding the previous high of $8 billion set during the 2008 financial crisis. GameStop stock prices went skyrocketing, forcing investors shorting the stock to purchase some to minimize their losses, driving prices further up.</p>
<p>InQubeta is the latest cryptocurrency project to gain the attention of Redditors as its platform makes investments in artificial intelligence more accessible for everyday people. It&rsquo;s not surprising to see Reddit investors, many of whom view themselves as the little people sticking it to the big whales, embrace a democratic platform that empowers everyday people who might not meet the elitist standards of traditional investment channels, like minimum investments that surpass the average annual income in the U.S.</p>
The InQubeta way
<p>InQubeta makes becoming part-owner of an artificial intelligence startup as easy as buying non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the ecosystem&rsquo;s marketplace. Startups looking for capital make these equity-based NFTs on InQubeta&rsquo;s Ethereum-based blockchain and investors purchase them with $QUBE tokens.</p>
<p>The NFTs are sent to investors after sales are finalized and they&rsquo;re free to sell or hold on to them at any point. These NFTs work like stocks, and some come with extra rewards like a slice of the startup&rsquo;s profits.</p>
<p>Thanks to InQubeta, investing in what many are already calling the biggest tech revolution in human history is now more accessible than ever. The internet was the last significant tech breakthrough and it created many millionaires and billionaires. For instance, $2,000 invested in Netflix in the early 2000s would be worth over a million dollars today. InQubeta&rsquo;s approach to investing now makes similar investment opportunities available to all.</p>
<p></p>
Bitcoin (BTC) is almost halfway back to pre-2022 prices
<p>Bitcoin continues to enjoy the largest market capitalization in the cryptocurrency space and it&rsquo;s already enjoyed some decent growth in 2023. Many cryptocurrency experts are expecting a bigger bull run later in the year.</p>
Ethereum (ETH) growing faster than Bitcoin
<p>Ethereum has seen more price increases in 2023 than Bitcoin due to various reasons like Ethereum-based altcoins like InQubeta and Polygon (MATIC) making waves in mainstream and crypto investment circles. Ethereum will likely continue outpacing Bitcoin for the remainder of the year but don&rsquo;t expect it to keep up with InQubeta.</p>
Summary
<p>InQubeta has an excellent chance of seeing more growth than more popular coins like BTC and ETH thanks to incremental price changes during its presale and its tokens being undervalued. Investors can expect to increase the value of their portfolios by up to 400% during the presale period, and there are no limits for InQubeta prices from that point.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The latest partnership between Near Protocol (NEAR) and Alibaba caused the Near Protocol (NEAR) price to spike, leading experts to wonder whether the token can hold its upward momentum. Meanwhile, Tradecurve (TCRV), currently in Stage 4 of its presale, has exceeded everyone&rsquo;s expectations, surging over 80% in price and raising $2.8 million in a very short amount of time.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Near Protocol (NEAR) Spikes 12% After Alibaba Partnership
<p>The Near Foundation, the non-profit organization behind the Near Protocol (NEAR), recently partnered with Alibaba Cloud intending to accelerate Web3 growth in the Middle East and Asia. Namely, this Near Protocol (NEAR) partnership will provide remote procedure calls (RPC) as a service to Near Protocol (NEAR) users and developers, among other benefits.</p>
<p>As a result, Near Protocol (NEAR) surged 12% as soon as the announcement was made, driving its price to the $1.56 level. However, Near Protocol (NEAR) did not manage to sustain its upward movement, with the Near Protocol (NEAR) token currently trading at $1.36.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Tradecurve (TCRV) Surges 80%, Amassing Over 12,500 Users on Its One-Of-a-Kind Platform

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Better After 29427 Test:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 2 July 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) worked to remain above the 30000 figure early in the Asian session as the pair encountered month-ending volatility that saw a rapid depreciation to the 29417.14 area, representing a test of the 38.2% retracement of the appreciating range from 26165.98 to 31443.67.&nbsp; This quick downward move took place shortly after BTC/USD spiked higher to the 30277 area, its strongest print in several trading sessions, and opens up a possible test of the 28604.83 area.&nbsp; BTC/USD notched a June gain of approximately 11.9%, and the pair is now up approximately 83.5% year-to-date.&nbsp; The pair&rsquo;s recent print around the 31443.67 area was a twelve-month high and test of an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.</p>
<p>Following recent selling pressure, areas of potential technical support and buying pressure include the 29863, 29427, 28886, 28804, 28182, 28096, and 27306 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were also recently triggered above additional upside price objectives around the 29068, 29159, 29458, 30088, 30200, 30292, and 30477 levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Technicians are closely watching to see how much technical support develops around the 28095.44 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 30456.83 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 30515.87.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has been ordered by a federal court to turn over user account information and transaction history to the IRS so that it can check if the exchange&rsquo;s users underreported their taxes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The order comes amidst a growing crackdown on crypto and will require the exchange to provide significant user data to the authorities.&nbsp;</p>
The IRS Headache&nbsp;
<p>As a result of the ruling, Kraken will have to hand over swathes of user information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Internal Revenue Service had filed a court petition in the Northern District of California moments after Kraken had announced that it would settle charges brought against it by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC had charged Kraken with offering unregistered securities through its staking as a service program. The IRS had previously issued a summons to Kraken in 2021, but the exchange failed to comply. The IRS had stated in its February petition,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Despite discussions between the parties, Payward Ventures Inc. [one of the registered companies that make up Kraken] &amp; Subsidiaries has failed to comply with the summons and has not produced the books, records, papers, and other data demanded in the summons. Payward Ventures Inc. &amp; Subsidiaries&rsquo; failure to comply with the summons continues to this date.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The IRS has stated that it is seeking information on Kraken accounts that have carried out at least $20,000 worth of cryptocurrency trading in a single year between 2016 and 2020. On its part, Kraken has called the tax agency&rsquo;s summons an &ldquo;unjustified treasure hunt.&rdquo; It also argued that the summons went well beyond the boundaries set in a similar fight with Coinbase around six years ago.&nbsp;</p>
The Court Order&nbsp;
<p>The federal court ruling comes as regulatory authorities in the United States of America increase their crackdown on the crypto markets. The Securities and Exchange Commission has already filed lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, alleging that the former mishandled customer funds, misled investors, and broke securities laws, while the latter was running an illegal exchange. The order passed on Friday orders Kraken to turn over account details and user information such as taxpayer identification number, birth date, user name or pseudonym, phone number, email address, address, and several other documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the exchange will also be required to turn over transaction hashes and blockchain addresses that are already a part of the transaction data that it can share. The judge wrote that the IRS has a legitimate purpose and reasoning for seeking the materials in question, adding that it must determine the tax liability for exchange users within the stipulated time period. The IRS&rsquo;s demands are backed by the fact that taxpayers filing returns for Bitcoin-related investments are minuscule compared to the sheer volume of trading activity on Kraken. The order stated that Kraken had over 4 million clients in the time period between 2011 to 2017, conducting over $140 billion worth of trades. Additionally, it stated that the exchange was registering 50,000 new users daily.&nbsp;</p>
Several IRS Requests Rejected&nbsp;
<p>However, not everything went the way the IRS wanted. In fact, the judge outright refused several requests put forward by the IRS. The judge also rejected the tax agency&rsquo;s requests for receiving employment information and source of wealth from the exchange. The judge wrote in his analysis of some of the requests,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Court must determine whether the Government&rsquo;s summons is narrowly tailored, that is, whether it is &lsquo;no broader than necessary to achieve its purpose. The Court finds that to the extent the first three requests are aimed at establishing the identities of the Kraken account holders who fall within the Doe definition, the information sought in these requests is much broader than what is necessary to achieve that purpose for the vast majority of Doe users.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has become this week&rsquo;s highest gainer in the top 300 tokens by market cap following a 114.3% surge in price. The token continues its uptrend, spurred by its listing on EDX Markets.</p>
BCH Reaches One-Year High
<p>The token reached a one-year high this week, just days after it listed on the EDX Markets exchange. EDX is backed by several Wall Street heavyweights such as Fidelity Digital Assets, Citadel Securities, Sequoia Capital, and Charles Schwab.</p>
<p>Unlike other crypto exchanges, EDX only allows investors to trade bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and BCH.</p>
<p>Crypto research firm Santiment found BCH has benefitted from EDX&rsquo;s launch, rising trading volumes and social media interest.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">📈 With the assistance of #EDXMarkets, launched on June 20th, #BitcoinCash has been the biggest beneficiary with a massive +79% price gain in 4 days. Notably, $BCH has seen a 3-year high in social discussion rates, &amp; volume has easily eclipsed 2023 highs. https://t.co/6fz4RL28tH pic.twitter.com/MNn59zRy8T</p>

<p>The firm further found BCH&rsquo;s sudden price move attracted retail trader attention, with the token&rsquo;s trading volume this year hitting a record.</p>
BCH Surge Driven by South Korean Traders
<p>Industry analyst Colin Wu tweeted today that BCH&rsquo;s price increase may be due to trading activity on South Korean exchanges.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">South Korea may be the reason for the BCH PUMP. In the past 24h, the largest exchange in South Korea, Upbit, has recorded a trading volume of over $350 million for the BCH/KRW, contributing to 23.58% of the total trading volume for BCH.

<p>Wu noted South Korea&rsquo;s largest exchange Upbit recorded massive trading volumes on the BCH/KRW pair over the past 24 hours. He said more than $350 million in volume accounted for nearly a quarter of the total volume for BCH over that time.</p>
<p>BCH surged an incredible 31% over the past 24 hours, allowing it to top $300 for the first time since April 2022. The token, however, remains down 92% from its all-time high of $3,785 in December 2017.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">Mimo Exchange, one of Web3&rsquo;s fastest, cheapest and most secure decentralized crypto exchanges, is excited to announce the launch of its transformative NFT trading platform enabling more accessible, faster, cheaper transactions and a more user-friendly interface than any other similar marketplace.</p>
<p class="s7">Mimo's NFT marketplace will provide a seamless and secure platform for buying and selling NFTs. But better yet, thanks to IoTeX's high-performing blockchain, the Mimo NFT trading platform solves the current challenges in the sector, enabling lower transaction fees, faster transaction times, and an enhanced user-friendly interface.</p>
<p class="s7">The Mimo NFT marketplace will revolutionize the NFT industry by offering more efficient NFT trading, its low handling fee of only 1.5% of the transaction price, as well as with its exciting launch activities. Mimo is the ideal platform for NFT enthusiasts to buy, sell, and trade digital assets.</p>
<p class="s7">The Mimo NFT marketplace also addresses the non-fungible token industry's current issues, such as high transaction fees, slow transaction times, and security.</p>
<p class="s7">One of the critical barriers to mainstream adoption is the user interface. To this point, Mimo provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for experienced and novice users to discover and collect NFTs. We've designed our intuitive interface to provide a seamless user </p>
<p class="s7">The Mimo NFT Marketplace has integrated ioPay, IoTeX's official multi-chain and cross-chain crypto wallet, and all other Web3 wallets, including Metamask.</p>
<p class="s7">People who use IoPay, one of Web3&rsquo;s most unique, secure, and versatile crypto wallets that also has multichain support, for example, can directly buy and sell their NFTs on the Mimo NFT marketplace from within this crypto wallet without additional wallets or exchanges. </p>
<p class="s7">Mimo now supports purchasing cryptocurrencies with a credit card, providing even more convenience for using the Mimo NFT marketplace.</p>
<p class="s7"></p>
<p class="s7">An exciting aspect of the Mimo NFT marketplace is that it supports projects leveraging W3bstream, which means Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) startups or projects can issue their NFTs and list them directly on the Mimo NFT marketplace. It provides a new and unique way to interact and expand audiences.</p>
<p class="s7">Mimo has partnered with well-known NFT and blockchain projects to create a joint marketing campaign. This joint marketing campaign will offer users exciting opportunities and rewards for participating in Mimo's NFT marketplace.</p>
<p class="s7">To celebrate the launch, Mimo is offering 90% off on the entire transaction fee throughout July, encouraging affordable transactions for all. This limited-time offer enables users to join the Mimo community and experience the benefits of faster, cheaper, and more user-friendly NFT trading.</p>
<p class="s7"></p>
<p class="s7">Users can also look forward to several activities and giveaways during the launch event, including limited edition NFTs, exclusive access to pre-released NFTs, and competitions. The Mimo community will also have the chance to engage with our team through live AMAs, Q&amp;A sessions, and beta testing opportunities.</p>
<p class="s7">With the rise of NFTs as a new asset class, there is a need for a dedicated NFT marketplace on IoTeX to support the growing demand for NFTs in several Web3 sectors, such as art, gaming, music and for the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) sector, which is today the most promising crypto category in the entire blockchain space. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Up 85% Year-to-Date:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 1 July 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained in a modest uptrend early in the Asian session as the pair continued to consolidate recent gains above the 30500 area after trading as high as the 31277 area.&nbsp; Buying power recently strengthened around the 30240.32 area during a slight pullback, a move that represented a test of the 23.6% retracement of the appreciating range from 26165.98 to 31443.67.&nbsp; &nbsp;BTC/USD notched a June gain of approximately 11.3%, and the pair is now up approximately 85.6% year-to-date.&nbsp; The pair&rsquo;s recent print around the 31443.67 area was a twelve-month high and test of an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.</p>
<p>Following recent selling pressure, areas of potential technical support and buying pressure include the 29863, 29427, 28886, 28804, 28182, 28096, and 27306 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were also recently triggered above additional upside price objectives around the 29068, 29159, 29458, 30088, 30200, 30292, and 30477 levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Technicians are closely watching to see how much technical support develops around the 28095.44 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 30415.23 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 30429.07.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Just as bitcoin was looking as though it was going to break the critical $31,000 price level, the SEC threw a wrench into the works with its rejection of all the latest ETF filings.</p>
Oh no! Another rejection
<p>The crypto market was alive and buzzing once again, looking as though it had finally emerged from a harsh crypto winter on the back of institutional ETF filings that looked as though this time might be approved.</p>
<p>Gary Gensler at the SEC was having none of it. Blackrock, Fidelity et al could be damned. The Biden administration is absolutely determined to try and break the crypto industry, and even if the biggest institutional money in the country wants in, it&rsquo;s not going to happen on Gensler&rsquo;s watch.</p>
<p>The news dropped like a bomb onto the crypto market. The Wall Street Journal was first to report it with the headline:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;SEC Says Spot Bitcoin ETF Filings Are Inadequate&rdquo;</p>

<p>Assuming that Blackrock and the rest had done their homework on the Bitcoin Spot ETF, it was hard to imagine what on earth else might be required by the SEC.</p>
Crypto market plummets
<p>In a matter of seconds bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market plummeted lower. Bitcoin immediately dropped to the exact bottom of its bull flag, made a beautiful touch, and then bounced back. It is currently sitting at the $30,200 price mark, which also happens to be the 0.618 Fibonacci level.</p>
<p>The altcoins fell even more drastically. The Total 3 chart (all cryptocurrencies except BTC and ETH) fell like a stone, losing over 4%, equivalent to around $13 billion in value.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH), probably the coin riding the highest up until the SEC announcement, rapidly fell over 13%, dropping from $314 to $272, before bouncing back around half way to $293.</p>
Was the news as bad as all that?
<p>Senior Bloomberg Analyst Eric Balchunas tweeted out soon after the announcement saying that in his view the news was not as bad as the headline suggested. He said that the SEC was really after the name of the crypto exchange for the &ldquo;surveillance-sharing agreement&rdquo; and required more details on SSA.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hold up a second, this isn't as bad as headline. The key paragraph is deep in story. Basically SEC wants them to name the "crypto exchange" and give more details on SSA. That's understandable, arguably good news. I was under impression they'd have to update that as well. pic.twitter.com/bh9qn65Xh2</p>
&mdash; Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 30, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>It does look as though the market is starting to digest this, and if the ETFs aren&rsquo;t being outright rejected then a surge in the opposite direction might be expected to take place. Hold on to your hats!</p>

<p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH), probably the coin riding the highest up until the SEC announcement, rapidly fell over 13%, dropping from $314 to $272, before bouncing back around half way to $293.</p>
Was the news as bad as all that?
<p>Senior Bloomberg Analyst Eric Balchunas tweeted out soon after the announcement saying that in his view the news was not as bad as the headline suggested. He said that the SEC was really after the name of the crypto exchange for the &ldquo;surveillance-sharing agreement&rdquo; and required more details on SSA.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hold up a second, this isn't as bad as headline. The key paragraph is deep in story. Basically SEC wants them to name the "crypto exchange" and give more details on SSA. That's understandable, arguably good news. I was under impression they'd have to update that as well. pic.twitter.com/bh9qn65Xh2</p>

</p>
<p>It does look as though the market is starting to digest this, and if the ETFs aren&rsquo;t being outright rejected then a surge in the opposite direction might be expected to take place. Hold on to your hats!</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Solana&rsquo;s Cardinal protocol just announced its decision to wind down operations and shut down, citing economic conditions.&nbsp;</p>
Cardinal Starts 2-Months &ldquo;Notice Period&rdquo;
<p>Nearly a year after raising $4.4 million, Solana&rsquo;s NFT utility provider, Cardinal Labs, has decided to pack it in. The protocol was launched in early 2022 as an infrastructure provider to improve NFT utility on the Solana network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, on Wednesday, the Cardinal team took to Twitter to announce that they would be winding down operations and eventually shut shop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They wrote,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today is the first day of our 2 month &ldquo;notice period&rdquo; (6/28-8/26) during which we recommend any and all depositors of assets into our systems manually withdraw them. All of our website product UIs will remain live during the period so that no one should have any issue doing so.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;Product Market Fit Difficult&rdquo;
<p>The team tweeted that the macroeconomic conditions have been very challenging for the protocol. They claimed that product market fit has been difficult, and although there has been some usage of the protocol&rsquo;s staking, rentals, and identity products, the market has not scaled up as they had hoped it would. Until blockchain tech adoption happens on a larger scale, the protocol&rsquo;s offerings are &ldquo;stuck in the context of the crypto maximalist community.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team also noted that the code behind the protocol will always be open source and accessible by all, even after the deployments are no longer live. They also reassured users that their assets were safe and would be returned to owners by the end of the process.&nbsp;</p>
Wind Down Schedule&nbsp;
<p>August 26 would mark the end of the two-month notice period, so users will need to complete all withdrawals by that date. The team has also dropped the closing schedule, which revealed that activities like creating staking pools, token management, NFT rentals and rental extensions, management of social media handles, and new deposits would be suspended on July 19.</p>
<p>The team tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we move towards closing up shop, our focus now shifts to carrying out a wind down as smoothly as possible so that the Solana ecosystem doesn&rsquo;t skip a beat&hellip;We realize that many people and teams rely on our protocols, and we want to minimize the impact of this transition on the ecosystem as much as possible, so we&rsquo;ve worked deliberately to find a path that does just that.&rdquo;</p>

Another Solana Project Shuts Down
<p>Twitter user and crypto expert JagoeCapital pointed out that Solana-related protocols are not faring well in the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cardinal announced a $4.4 Million raise just 11 months ago led by Solana Ventures and ProtagonistXYZ with headline participation from Alameda Research, Animoca Brands and Delphi Digital. Today they announced they will be shutting down. It&rsquo;s becoming a common theme with Solana projects.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Blockchain Association, a prominent lobbyist group for the cryptocurrency industry in the United States, has called on SEC Chair Gary Gensler to recuse himself from enforcing rules on the crypto space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission under Gensler has taken a hostile approach to crypto, filing lawsuits against several prominent crypto firms.&nbsp;</p>
Blockchain Association Pens Open Letter&nbsp;
<p>The call for the Securities and Exchange Commission Chair to remove himself from crypto-related matters was issued in the form of a statement released by the Blockchain Association. It comes after cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase filed a notice of intent on Wednesday, requesting a court to dismiss the regulator&rsquo;s lawsuit against the exchange. In the letter, the Blockchain Association contends that Gensler has repeatedly asserted that everything other than Bitcoin is a security and that his statement gives the appearance that he cannot approach the issue with an open mind. The letter alleged that repeatedly expressing the same view meant that the SEC chair had prejudiced the central issue regarding digital asset-related enforcement proceedings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, the letter alleged that Gensler&rsquo;s vote on whether or not to proceed with filing an action was biased. The Blockchain Association also stated that any SEC enforcement action must follow the &ldquo;Wells Process,&rdquo; which would give the target of the enforcement action enough time to present evidence and arguments for their case. However, thanks to Gensler&rsquo;s unbiased perspective, core questions related to the crypto industry would not receive a fair assessment from the SEC. Chief Policy Officer at the Blockchain Association, Jake Chervinksy, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear that the digital assets industry cannot expect a fair assessment from Chair Gensler. His steadfast view that all digital assets except bitcoin are securities means that he cannot approach enforcement decisions with a fair and impartial mind, as required by the SEC&rsquo;s Wells process and federal law. The time has come for Chair Gensler to recuse himself from all decisions related to digital asset-related enforcement matters. If he refuses, then I expect enforcement targets will begin raising the matter of his recusal in SEC proceedings and in federal district courts.&rdquo;</p>

Coinbase And The SEC&nbsp;
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission had sued Coinbase, alleging that the platform offered users at least 13 crypto assets that are securities and should have been registered with the SEC. It had also sued Binance on similar charges just a day prior. In its reply, Coinbase stated that the Securities and Exchange Commission was well aware of the crypto exchange&rsquo;s digital asset operations thanks to its public offering registration, which was done in April 2021. It further added that out of the cryptocurrencies that the SEC called securities, 6 were already trading on Coinbase when the agency reviewed the exchange&rsquo;s public offering registration. Coinbase stated in its filing,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only change is in the SEC&rsquo;s position regarding its powers. That position is untenable as a matter of law, and its assertion through this enforcement action offends due process and the constitutional separation of powers.&rdquo;</p>

SEC Action On Crypto&nbsp;
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has undertaken considerable legal action against crypto exchanges during the ongoing year. Kraken was fined $30 million for offering crypto staking programs, with the SEC stating that the exchange was offering users unregistered securities. The agency also issued a warning to the Paxos Trust Company, an issuer of the Binance stablecoin, that it faces possible legal action. This led to Paxos freezing the minting of the stablecoin, which the SEC stated was an unregistered security. Coinbase criticized the SEC&rsquo;s actions in its filing, saying that the SEC&rsquo;s action in the current scenario was unlawful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather than test its new view through notice-and-comment rulemaking, the SEC has chosen to roll out its ever-aggressive agenda through punitive retroactive enforcement actions. Agency enforcement authority is important but not boundless. The SEC&rsquo;s action here is beyond those bounds and unlawful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Blockchain Association was also critical of the SEC, stating that the federal agency&rsquo;s actions under Gensler had further muddied regulatory waters and forced lawful crypto companies operating in the country to reconsider their operations and move to friendlier jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>
The Political Divide&nbsp;
<p>Gensler&rsquo;s hostile approach to crypto has found support with many Democrats, who have lauded his efforts. However, lawmakers on the other side of the aisle have roundly criticized the SEC and Gensler&rsquo;s approach. Republican Congressman Warren Davidson also introduced a bill called the SEC Stabilization Act on the 13th of June. The bill sought to restructure the federal agency and remove Gensler as chair.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance&rsquo;s crypto custody licence application has reportedly been rejected by the German BaFin regulator.</p>
Another setback
<p>Still the largest crypto exchange in the world by trading volume, Binance is continuing to labour into strong headwinds, suffering regulatory pushback in some European countries, and of course currently being sued by the US regulator.</p>
<p>The latest setback for Binance was reported by the German-based Finance Fwd website. The article stated that the BaFin regulator had either officially denied a crypto custody licence application, or had verbally notified Binance that its licence had been rejected.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Binance was quoted as saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if we cannot share details of our discussions with the regulators, we will continue to work to meet Bafin's requirements. It is an ongoing process&rdquo;</p>

<p>They added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are confident that we have the right team and the appropriate measures to continue our discussions with the regulatory authorities in Germany.&ldquo;</p>

<p>The rejection in Germany will be a difficult pill to swallow for Binance&rsquo;s CEO Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ. The ongoing defence of his company and him personally in the US is a weight around the neck of the crypto exchange.</p>
Battlegrounds need to be won
<p>With such a globally important regulator as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accusing CZ of embezzlement of customer funds among other allegations, obtaining regulatory licences in other countries is going to be difficult, at least until it is known how the accusations are likely to pan out.</p>
<p>Given that Binance is such an important exchange in the crypto ecosystem many may be hoping that it is able to resist the SEC. Both Binance and Coinbase are very important battlegrounds that need to be fought and won if the crypto industry is to reinject some momentum into the beleaguered asset class.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Slovakian Parliament this week voted in favour of a bill that would lower taxes on income derived from cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>Members of the Slovak Republic&rsquo;s National Council, or parliament, voted to approve an amendment that would lower cryptocurrency taxes, along with other measures that would affect crypto holders.</p>
Crypto Income Tax Reduced to 7%
<p>Bloomberg Law reports that Slovakia&rsquo;s National Council voted in favour of reducing personal income tax on profits derived from the sale of crypto held by a user for at least one year. As it stands, cryptocurrency profits are taxed on a sliding scale of either 19% or 25%.</p>
<p>The approved amendment will see taxes lowered significantly to 7%.</p>
<p>The amendment further declares payments received in cryptocurrencies up to 2,400 euros, or $2,600, will not be taxed. Additionally, the bill excludes cryptocurrency income from a health insurance contribution of 14%.</p>
Slovakia Will Lose 30 Million Euro Through Tax Cuts
<p>The newly amended tax policy comes only weeks after parliament passed a constitutional amendment that codifies citizens&rsquo; right to use cash as payment. The amendment was made due to talk about a digital euro.</p>
<p>According to a local Slovakian media outlet, the Ministry of Finance estimates it will lose around 30 million euros annually due to the tax cut. &nbsp;</p>
US Lags as Europe Makes Regulatory Strides
<p>Slovakia, as one of the 27 member states of the European Union (EU), has been promoting cryptocurrency regulations across the region. The EU voted in favour of its landmark MiCA bill, which will make Europe a hub for digital assets. The bill will take effect in 2024.</p>
<p>The UK also made a significant step toward its crypto goal. The House of Lords voted to enact the Financial Services and Markets Bill, which will see cryptocurrencies become a &ldquo;regulated activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Europe, Hong Kong, Singapore and even Dubai compete for their share in the booming crypto market, the situation is less than ideal in the US. With full backing from the Biden administration, the SEC drives the industry away from its shores and ultimately into the arms of those who embrace it.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Melania Trump, the former first lady of the United States, has launched a new NFT collection to celebrate the country&rsquo;s Independence Day, inspired by the nation&rsquo;s iconic landmarks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collection, called &ldquo;The 1776 Collection,&rdquo; consists of a six-piece range of NFTs consisting of images sourced from across the United States of America.&nbsp;</p>
Trump Family NFTs Make A Comeback&nbsp;
<p>The Trump family is back in the NFT space with the launch of Melania Trump&rsquo;s new NFT collection inspired by the upcoming Independence Day holiday. The launch of the new collection comes only a couple of months after former president Donald Trump released the second set of his NFT trading cards. The new set of collectibles launched by the former first lady is part of &ldquo;The 1776 Collection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The NFTs are based on the Solana blockchain and feature several iconic images, including prominent landmarks such as Mount Rushmore and the Statue of Liberty, affixed to animated placards. Each NFT is priced at $50, with the collection comprising seven different designs, making up a total of 3500 NFTs. The NFTs can be purchased through a website called USA Collectibles, with Melania Trump retweeting the company&rsquo;s original tweet about the NFT collection going on sale. The USA Collectibles website also offers POTUS TRUMP NFTs, which feature photos of former President Trump and the former first lady. Melania Trump stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The 1776 Collection of artwork draws inspiration from several iconic landmarks of our nation, which I had the privilege of visiting during the time I served as first lady. Each piece provides a view into our nation&rsquo;s history, culture, and patriotism. I am proud to celebrate our great nation and remain inspired by the words contained within the Declaration of Independence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The collection went live on the 29th of July.&nbsp;</p>
Portion Of Proceeds To Benefit Foster Kids&nbsp;
<p>According to reports, a portion of all proceeds from the collection will go towards Fostering The Future, an initiative by BeBest. The initiative helps children in the foster care community secure educational opportunities and scholarships. Primarily, the Fostering the Future initiative aims to grant computer science scholarships to children coming out of the foster care system, helping them achieve the academic foundation needed to secure technology-based jobs. The former first lady also added that her commitment towards the foster community has grown stronger since leaving Washington DC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Melania Trump also added that she supports former President Trump&rsquo;s reelection campaign and looks forward to working with him once again and restoring hope for the future and leading America. She stated that if she could serve as the first lady again, she would continue to prioritize initiatives that focus on the well-being and development of children, ensuring that they reach their full potential.&nbsp;</p>
The Trumps And NFTs&nbsp;
<p>The Trumps have considerable history in the NFT ecosystem going back at least a couple of years. It was Melania Trump who first jumped into the NFT space with the release of her first NFT in December 2021. The NFT was also based on the Solana blockchain. However, Solana Labs, the entity behind the Solana blockchain, clarified that it was not a Solana-led initiative. The former first lady released more NFTs in 2022 before former president Donald Trump released his popular digital trading cards collection, consisting of around 45,000 NFTs. The collection was launched on Polygon, an Ethereum scaling solution, and each NFT was priced at $99. Furthermore, each NFT in the collection was tied to special perks, such as a potential dinner with the ex-president.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the collection was widely ridiculed, it sold out within 24 hours and became the talk of the NFT space, causing their resale value to surge. At the peak of their popularity, the cards were starting at a price of over $1000 on secondary marketplaces. The former president then released a second collection, consisting of 47,000 NFTs, causing the original NFTs&rsquo; price to fall considerably. At present, the original Trump NFTs start at around $185, while NFTs from the second collection start at approximately $54.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Melania Trump, the former first lady of the United States, has launched a new NFT collection to celebrate the country&rsquo;s Independence Day, inspired by the nation&rsquo;s iconic landmarks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collection, called &ldquo;The 1776 Collection,&rdquo; consists of a six-piece range of NFTs consisting of images sourced from across the United States of America.&nbsp;</p>
Trump Family NFTs Make A Comeback&nbsp;
<p>The Trump family is back in the NFT space with the launch of Melania Trump&rsquo;s new NFT collection inspired by the upcoming Independence Day holiday. The launch of the new collection comes only a couple of months after former president Donald Trump released the second set of his NFT trading cards. The new set of collectibles launched by the former first lady is part of &ldquo;The 1776 Collection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The NFTs are based on the Solana blockchain and feature several iconic images, including prominent landmarks such as Mount Rushmore and the Statue of Liberty, affixed to animated placards. Each NFT is priced at $50, with the collection comprising seven different designs, making up a total of 3500 NFTs. The NFTs can be purchased through a website called USA Collectibles, with Melania Trump retweeting the company&rsquo;s original tweet about the NFT collection going on sale. The USA Collectibles website also offers POTUS TRUMP NFTs, which feature photos of former President Trump and the former first lady. Melania Trump stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The 1776 Collection of artwork draws inspiration from several iconic landmarks of our nation, which I had the privilege of visiting during the time I served as first lady. Each piece provides a view into our nation&rsquo;s history, culture, and patriotism. I am proud to celebrate our great nation and remain inspired by the words contained within the Declaration of Independence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The collection went live on the 29th of July.&nbsp;</p>
Portion Of Proceeds To Benefit Foster Kids&nbsp;
<p>According to reports, a portion of all proceeds from the collection will go towards Fostering The Future, an initiative by BeBest. The initiative helps children in the foster care community secure educational opportunities and scholarships. Primarily, the Fostering the Future initiative aims to grant computer science scholarships to children coming out of the foster care system, helping them achieve the academic foundation needed to secure technology-based jobs. The former first lady also added that her commitment towards the foster community has grown stronger since leaving Washington DC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Melania Trump also added that she supports former President Trump&rsquo;s reelection campaign and looks forward to working with him once again and restoring hope for the future and leading America. She stated that if she could serve as the first lady again, she would continue to prioritize initiatives that focus on the well-being and development of children, ensuring that they reach their full potential.&nbsp;</p>
The Trumps And NFTs&nbsp;
<p>The Trumps have considerable history in the NFT ecosystem going back at least a couple of years. It was Melania Trump who first jumped into the NFT space with the release of her first NFT in December 2021. The NFT was also based on the Solana blockchain. However, Solana Labs, the entity behind the Solana blockchain, clarified that it was not a Solana-led initiative. The former first lady released more NFTs in 2022 before former president Donald Trump released his popular digital trading cards collection, consisting of around 45,000 NFTs. The collection was launched on Polygon, an Ethereum scaling solution, and each NFT was priced at $99. Furthermore, each NFT in the collection was tied to special perks, such as a potential dinner with the ex-president.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Prominent crypto wallet service provider, Ledger, has announced its latest venture into the world of institutional trading technology.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Dubbed "Tradelink," this new trading and settlement network technology is set to revolutionize the landscape for asset managers, custodians, and exchanges/OTC. Aiming to streamline operations and boost efficiency, Tradelink will allow trading on multiple exchanges without the need for on-chain liquidity re-balancing.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This will ensure that users maintain custodial ownership of assets while engaging in off-exchange trading. Additionally, Tradelink seeks to mitigate trading collateral risks across various third-party platforms, offer easy integration with preferred counter-parties, and significantly reduce transaction fees.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The company&rsquo;s official announcement stated:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Today, we are proud to announce that Ledger is entering the institutional trading technology market with the first open network to enable custodial trading via exchange and custodial partners. This solution will provide unparalleled control, security, flexibility, and transparent governance over an enterprise&rsquo;s digital asset trading."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Ledger's VP of Enterprise Revenue, Sebastien Badault, emphasizes how Tradelink will empower users, asserting:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;By unlocking better trading options for enterprises, we are empowering asset managers, custodians, and exchanges to navigate the changing landscape with confidence while making the whole ecosystem a safer and more transparent place.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">At launch, Tradelink will be accessible to all Ledger Enterprise clients at no additional cost. Initial partners will include well-known asset managers such as Laser Digital and Hodl Group, digital asset trading and orchestration platforms like Wyden, and platform partners including Crypto.com, Bitstamp, Huobi, and more.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch of Tradelink comes after Ledger's recent controversial update, which raised security concerns among its users. However, the company remains undeterred and has just closed a $109 Million Series C extension fundraising round, pushing its valuation to $1.4 billion.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Badault further elaborates on the company's vision for Tradelink:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;We are creating a future-proof solution that will give Ledger Enterprise customers flexibility and security allowing institutions to de-risk their businesses. For almost a decade, Ledger has been building security and governance solutions for the crypto ecosystem. It is this core security foundation that can now be used to reduce counterparty risk and enable custodial trading for institutional investors.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Ledger&rsquo;s innovative Trading Operation technology, coupled with its commitment to transparency and regulatory compliance, positions the company at the forefront of an increasingly evolving market, navigating the ever-changing regulatory and overall market landscape with confidence.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Mastercard, a leading provider of credit card services, is expanding its footprint into the burgeoning digital asset space.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In an ambitious move, the payments giant plans to launch a blockchain-based marketplace for financial applications, propelling the evolution of payment solutions beyond traditional parameters.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Diving Deeper into Blockchain Technology</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In the quest to foster innovation in the financial technology space, Mastercard is poised to launch the beta version of its Mastercard Multi Token Network (MTN) in the UK in the coming months. The venture is being touted as an "app store powered by blockchain technologies for building regulated financial applications."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard's Executive Vice President and Head of Crypto and Blockchain, emphasized the value of the underlying technology that powers crypto, stating that it is "actually quite useful." </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Developers leveraging MTN will gain access to a myriad of tools that the company has been developing, one of which includes a private Ethereum-based blockchain, specifically crafted for the creation of novel applications. Mastercard's deep-seated commitment to the digital asset sector is further affirmed by products such as 'Crypto Secure,' 'Crypto Source,' and 'Crypto Credential.' These are geared towards enhancing transparency and trust in the digital asset space.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Developers working on the beta version will also be able to experiment with tokenized commercial bank deposits and blockchain data that provides real-time insights into a person's bank account balance.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Mastercard's Vision for the Future of Payments</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Mastercard's vision for the MTN is to "provide a set of foundational capabilities designed to make transactions within the digital asset and blockchain ecosystems secure, scalable and interoperable &mdash; ultimately enabling more efficient payment and commerce applications." </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The company's official announcement highlighted the importance of trust in the new digital ecosystem, stating, </p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"To realize the potential of blockchain and digital assets as critical infrastructure for storing and moving value, we&rsquo;re launching the Mastercard Multi-Token Network."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Mastercard equates the current trajectory of digital asset and blockchain technologies to the internet's growth arc, predicting a similar transformational impact on the global economy.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"We believe that digital asset and blockchain technologies today are on a similar trajectory, one day becoming critical infrastructure for storing and moving value."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Mastercard's venture into the blockchain app store space represents a major shift towards the adoption of crypto technology in the financial industry, showcasing the company's steadfast commitment to promoting a wider range of secure, accessible, and always-on payment solutions.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch of the MTN, which the company describes as one of their most ambitious projects to date, is a crucial step towards fulfilling their vision for the future of payments. Mastercard anticipates making the MTN available to more markets around the world in due course, fostering an environment where the wider digital asset industry can thrive.</p>
