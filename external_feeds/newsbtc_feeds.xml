					<description><![CDATA[Ripple’s token price is climbing above the $0.50 resistance against the US Dollar. XRP price is signaling more upsides toward $0.55 or $0.565. Ripple’s token price started a decent increase above the $0.500 resistance against the US dollar. The price is now trading above $0.505 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a major bullish trend line forming with support near $0.5050 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might continue to rise toward the $0.545 and $0.550 resistance levels. Ripple Price Forms Bullish Trend In the past few days, Ripple’s XRP gained bullish momentum above the $0.45 resistance against the US Dollar. It outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum to start a steady bullish trend above $0.465. There was a clear move above the $0.480 and $0.488 resistance levels. Finally, the bulls were able to push the price above $0.500. A high is formed near $0.5286 and the price recently saw a minor downside correction. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $0.4432 swing low to the $0.5286 high.

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum price started a decent increase above the $1,870 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH could attempt an upside break above the key $1,920 resistance. Ethereum is slowly attempting a recovery wave from the $1,840 support zone. The price is trading above $1,870 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,870 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a strong increase if it clears the $1,880 and $1,900 resistance levels. Ethereum Price Holds Support Ethereum’s price managed to stay above the $1,840 support. ETH formed a base and recently started a recovery wave from the $1,838 low, similar to Bitcoin. There was a break above the $1,870 resistance level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,916 swing high to the $1,838 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,870 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ether is now trading above $1,870 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There are also chances of a short-term inverse head and shoulders pattern on the same chart. Immediate resistance is near the $1,880 zone. The next major resistance is near the $1,885 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,916 swing high to the $1,838 low. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com A proper move above the $1,880 and $1,885 resistance levels might send Ether toward $1,920. The next resistance sits near $1,940, above which Ethereum could rise toward $2,000. Any more gains above the $2,000 resistance zone might send the price toward the $2,120 resistance. Fresh Decline in ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,880 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,870 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next major support is near the $1,855 zone. If there is a break below the $1,855 support, the price could decline toward the $1,840 support. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,800 level or even $1,740 in the coming sessions. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI &#8211; The RSI for ETH/USD is above the 50 level.

					<description><![CDATA[The recovery of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at the start of the year brought about hopes that the bear market had finally come to an end. However, the market has since reversed with assets in the space losing a good portion of their Q1 gains. With the current trend, it is more than likely that the bear market is not over. Historical Bitcoin Trends Suggest Otherwise Over the last four bull markets that Bitcoin has seen since its inception, a number of things stand out. The first is that the bear market following a bull market does not seem to come to an end until the year of the halving. Related Reading: Here Are The Top 3 Chinese Coins To Buy As China Leads The Bull Run The Bitcoin Halving is an important event because it cuts down the BTC block rewards in half, hence reducing the number of new BTC being released into circulation. This is a bullish event and has always heralded the start of the bull market for the cryptocurrency. Currently, the market is still about a year away from the next Bitcoin halving set to happen in 2024, and if historical trends are anything to go by, then the bear market is likely to persist through 2023 and into early next year before the first hallmarks of the bull run are seen. Following previous trends, there could still be more pain for BTC to come.

This means that investors are not doing anything bullish like buying more Bitcoin at this time, so the bear market is persisting as sellers continue to dominate.

					<description><![CDATA[Lido, the liquidity staking protocol that supports staking, is now under some of the Ethereum community members&#8217; crosshair. There are fears that the platform is centralizing Ethereum and could make the blockchain fragile. As of June 1, Lido is the largest decentralized finance protocol. DeFiLlama data shows that the platform manages $13.2 billion  in staked assets.  At this level, Lido has nearly twice the total value locked (TVL) as in MakerDAO, one of the original decentralized money markets in the sphere.  MakerDAO has $6.29 billion in TVL and only serves Ethereum. Lido Is Ethereum&#8217;s Weak Point? Concern from critics is not only about the dominance of Lido in terms of TVL but the number of validators using the protocol.  According to on-chain data, over 19 million Ethereum has been staked in the Beacon Chain, that is, the proof-of-stake network.  However, out of this amount, 6 million Ethereum has been staked through Lido. This translates to roughly 36% of all staked Ethereum passing through the liquidity staking protocol. Moreover, parallel data shows that 32% of all Ethereum validators use Lido infrastructure.  In Ethereum&#8217;s proof-of-stake system, validators are needed to verify transactions and secure the network against external attacks.  Related Reading: Litecoin Attempts To Revitalize The Crypto Market With Bullish Breakout The distribution of validators, who now don&#8217;t have to run energy-consuming and expensive rigs, is critical for decentralizing the Ethereum network.  Global distribution of Ethereum validators would translate to a robust platform where users and operators of protocols, presently managing over $26 billion of assets, don&#8217;t have to worry about a majority attack. It is this level of centralization that is emerging in Lido that some Ethereum community members are concerned could destabilize the network.  In the past, Prysm, a client operator, lost a significant portion of its market share when it was discovered that over 66% of all Ethereum proof-of-work nodes were using their software. Could this same intervention be require to suppress Lido&#8217;s expansion? According to the critics, the current community is lacking in educational material and initiative to address problems as they emerge. Thus far, with 32% of all validators using LidoDAO infrastructure, it is more than twice the limit Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, had recommended for every entity wishing to host the network&#8217;s validators.  LDO Prices Could Drop With centralization questions emerging, LidoDAO could be forced to decentralized, even by breaking down into multiple entities. However, for LDO holders, any action to break up the protocol&#8217;s dominance could have a drastic effect on prices. Related Reading: The $24,000 BTC Bullseye: Is Bitcoin Headed For A Summer Swoon? As of June 1, LDO, the governance token of LDO, is one of the top performers.

					<description><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency exchange Gate.io has recently been facing rumors of insolvency following the arrest of Multichain CEO Zhaojun and concerns about the Multichain treasury being backed by 30%. These rumors have led to increased withdrawals from the exchange, with a net outflow of $131 million in the last 24 hours alone. To put this into perspective, the 7-day net outflow from Gate.io is $144.8 million, per data compiled by Nansen.  Related Reading: The $24,000 BTC Bullseye: Is Bitcoin Headed For A Summer Swoon? Gate.io Denies Liquidity Issues  The rumors about Gate.io&#8217;s insolvency stem from a tweet alleging a connection between the exchange and Multichain following the arrest of Multichain CEO Zhaojun. The tweet claimed that Gate.io was facing insolvency due to its involvement with Multichain and the potential impact of Zhaojun&#8217;s arrest on the Multichain treasury. Despite these rumors, Gate.io has disputed insolvency claims and reassured its users that all funds are safe. The cryptocurrency exchange has recently stated to address rumors about its operations and withdrawals. Gate.io has reassured users that its operations are sound, withdrawals are working properly, and there are no problems with rumored operations or withdrawals. Furthermore, Gate.io emphasizes its commitment to providing users with safe, fast, and reliable virtual asset services and encourages users to be cautious of any unsolicited calls or messages claiming to be from Gate.io. The exchange currently holds $2.4 billion in assets, including 18% in Gate.io’s native token GT, 15% in Ethereum (ETH), 15% in Bitcoin (BTC), and other cryptocurrencies. Despite these reassurances, the increase in withdrawals from Gate.io highlights the impact that rumors and speculation can have on the crypto market, particularly in times of uncertainty. However, Gate.io has stated that it has no direct connection to Multichain and that Zhaojun&#8217;s arrest does not affect its operations. The exchange has also emphasized that all funds are held in cold storage, providing an additional layer of security for user assets. Binance CEO CZ Issues Warning Binance CEO CZ has recently advised investors to Secure Asset Fund for User (SAFU) after citing a tweet from Multichain, which reported multiple issues with their protocol due to unforeseeable circumstances. The tweet stated that the team had done everything possible to maintain the protocol running but could not contact CEO Zhaojun and obtain the necessary server access for maintenance. The tweet also mentioned an issue with the scanning node network of Router5, which affected the normal cross-chain service of some chains. To protect users&#8217; interests, the corresponding cross-chain service for the affected chain was suspended on the User Interface (UI). This issue was also reported to have occurred on Router2 the week prior. Related Reading: Litecoin Attempts To Revitalize The Crypto Market With Bullish Breakout The timing of CZ&#8217;s advice to SAFU and the issues reported by Multichain has led to speculation that this may be an early warning to investors about the potential dangers associated with Gate.io. However, it is important to note that CZ did not explicitly mention Gate.io in his tweet, and there is no direct connection between Gate.io and Multichain.

<p>The LTCBTC and LTCETH charts also appear to support a change in the tides between these top crypto titans. Once Litecoin breaks out from a lengthy downtrend line, it doesn&#8217;t usually stop climbing for months at a time.</p>

<p>Past breakouts saw a 9,000% rally and a 600% rally – what might this trend line break bring for results? If the once-forgotten cryptocurrency starts climbing, it could pull the entire crypto market higher and reignite the bull run. Furthermore, it could restore LTC&#8217;s place in the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) has been on a rollercoaster ride for weeks. However, the largest cryptocurrency in the market seems poised to breach the $30,000 mark again if it continues its bullish momentum. Nevertheless, cryptocurrency experts are eyeing a key technical price level that could signal further volatility for the world&#8217;s most popular cryptocurrency. According to crypto expert and Economist Mr. Ben Lilly, the $24,000 price level is acting like a bullseye for Bitcoin, signaling a potential price dip in the coming months. Lilly&#8217;s analysis is based on Bitcoin&#8217;s 200-day moving average (200d MA), which he believes is a key technical indicator of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price cycles. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Frenzy: More Than 15 Billion Tokens Scorched In May Bitcoin Braces For Volatility Each halving cycle for Bitcoin, which occurs roughly every four years, begins with the 200d moving average (MA) failing, as shown in a chart shared by Lilly. This failure tends to dictate multi-year price cycles, and Lilly believes history repeats itself. Based on this theory, Lilly predicts that the failure of the 200d MA level could happen sometime between June and August of 2023, which could result in a dip below $24,000. This prediction is supported by the fact that low-leveraged liquidity pools are building at the level where the 200d MA will likely be in June, which Lilly has marked with a bullseye in his theoretical analysis. If the history of Bitcoin&#8217;s price cycles is any guide, then this retest is likely to fail, which could result in further volatility for the cryptocurrency. Lilly expects this failure to occur with end-of-June options, citing the recent unwind of May contracts as a subtle sweep lower. However, it&#8217;s important to note that the 200d MA is rising faster than before, as each passing day removes one day from the November lows and replaces it with a recent price. This acceleration can be seen in the last week on the 200d MA, which is ticking up faster. Still On The Path To Higher Prices? On the other hand, despite recent volatility in the cryptocurrency markets, one expert remains optimistic about Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term prospects. Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Jackis believes that the current market conditions indicate a long re-accumulation period before Bitcoin moves higher. According to Jackis, Bitcoin is still making higher lows and is above all critical moving averages, which is a positive sign for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s long-term growth. While there may be short-term downside movements, Jackis believes these are simply shakeouts and that the big picture remains bullish. Jackis sees a big move coming in the future, which he has mentioned in previous posts. His bet remains on the upside, and he now sees no clear signs of bearishness in the market. One key factor that Jackis points to is the monthly close, which recently occurred with a sweep. This provides the biggest market picture; for now, Jackis does not see any bearish signs.

As of this writing, BTC is currently trading at $26,900, having filled the gap on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), previously highlighted by NewsBTC as a crucial level to observe before the uptrend could continue. Nevertheless, there is still a likelihood of further downside movements, with many industry experts anticipating high levels of volatility.
