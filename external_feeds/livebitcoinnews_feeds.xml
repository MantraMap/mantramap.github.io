<p><strong>Introducing Dexo</strong></p>
<p>Decentralized exchanges are known for offering security, anonymity, and transparency. Most decentralized exchanges currently in the market today are doing a great job in these areas. However, they are still plagued by cons such as failed trades, delayed order execution, front-running, high slip­page, and the absence of many other advanced features which are being offered by centralized exchanges.</p>
<p>Dexo is a New-Generation intermediate blockchain ecosystem that harnesses C-DEX to bridge the gap between centralized and decentralized worlds of cryptos. C-DEX is a one-of-its-kind decentralized cryptocurrency exchange with the potential to change the way crypto traders and investors engage with DEXs. It combines the pros of centralized and decentralized exchanges to offer a holistic trading experience for its users.</p>
<p>C-DEX takes decentralized trading to a whole new level by solving users&#8217; problems. Users can trade directly from their wallet app. Unlike centralized exchanges, Dexo doesn’t hold users&#8217; funds, meaning users will have 100% ownership of their own funds.</p>
<p>In addition, with C-DEX, the user can effectively perform all the traditional DeFi activities including most innovative features which are currently being offered by only large, centralized exchanges, such as advance order-book trading, zero gas fee on non-executed trades, index trading, gamification, and NFT market place. Dexo aims to cater to a wide spectrum of DeFi products with the latest innovation in blockchain technology to bring ease and convenience to its users.</p>
<p>With a multi-talented, dynamic team of blockchain network experts, technologists, entrepreneurs, and engineers from all walks of life, Dexo strives to connect all isolated blockchains and establish a cross-chain asset exchange network, providing all necessary underlying support for the DeFi ecosystem and letting every digital asset holder experience a truly safe, free and transparent DeFi service.</p>
<p><strong>About DEXO Token</strong></p>
<p>DEXO is the native BEP-20 Token that fuels the entire Dexo ecosystem. It acts as both a utility and Dexo governance token. Based on BEP-20, DEXO has a total supply of 1 billion (i.e., 1,000,000,000) tokens, of which 32% is provided for presale, 2.46% is provided for exchange listing and liquidity, 9.32% is allocated to the team, 2.43% is allocated to advisors and legal team, 14.96% will be used for marketing, 1% is provided for airdrop, 10.58% is allocated for trading rewards, 10.62% is allocated for staking rewards, 4.1% is provided for bug bounty program, and the remaining 12.53% is reserved for treasury.</p>
<p>DEXO will be listed on LBank Exchange at 11:30 UTC on December 21, 2022, investors who are interested in the Dexo investment can easily buy and sell DEXO token on LBank Exchange by then. The listing of DEXO token on LBank Exchange will undoubtedly help it further expand its business and draw more attention in the market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>INTERNET CITY, DUBAI, Dec 16, 2022 – LBank Exchange, a global digital asset trading platform, has listed PayPointCoin (PPC) on December 16, 2022. For all users of LBank Exchange, the PPC/USDT trading pair is now officially available for trading.</p>
<p>As a universal loyalty program protocol, <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x6fc0d20c7dE9a0ae891B39b3DD916F5ffcc7f33F" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">PayPointCoin</a> (PPC) uses blockchain technology to track all transactions within the protocol, providing more rewards to loyal customers. The PPC token has been listed on LBank Exchange at 8:00 UTC on December 16, 2022, to further expand its global reach and help it achieve its vision.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing </strong><strong>PayPointCoin</strong></p>
<p>Addressing some of the challenges that current loyalty programs face due to inefficient data management, and lack of data privacy and ownership, PayPointCoin is a universal loyalty program protocol that can revolutionize the way that merchants track and distribute rewards points and coupons so that more perks and benefits will be provided to loyal users. It uses blockchain features such as smart contracts, wallets, and tokens to track all the transactions within the protocol.</p>
<p>Specifically speaking, PayPointCoin allows transaction ledgers to be shared across a network of participants. When a new transaction occurs (e.g. loyalty points are issued, redeemed or exchanged) a unique PayPointCoin is created and assigned to that transaction. PayPointCoins are grouped into blocks and distributed throughout the network, updating all ledgers at once.</p>
<p>By leveraging the blockchain technology, PayPointCoin makes it easy to track each transaction and its history, while making it irreversible, avoiding double-spending, fraud, abuse and other types of transactions manipulation. In addition, by allowing multiple parties to record and access transactions in near real-time, blockchain increases the opportunity for loyalty rewards program providers to reduce adjustment inertia for credit points more quickly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, PayPointCoin is supposed to reduce costs associated with errors and fraud by reducing system administration costs with smart contracts that report transactions securely, traceably and transparently to legacy systems. Large loyalty rewards program providers with well-developed programs in the early stages of building interconnected loyalty networks have a unique opportunity to provide value-added services to other businesses.</p>
<p>Last but not least, for consumers juggling different loyalty programs, blockchain provides instant redemption and can be exchanged for multiple loyalty points currencies on a single platform. With only one &#8220;wallet&#8221; for points – the PayPointCoin Wallet, consumers do not have to look for options, restrictions and usage rules for each program.</p>
<p><strong>About PPC Token</strong></p>
<p>PPC is the native token of PayPointCoin ecosystem. Based on ERC-20, PPC has a total supply of 2 billion (i.e., 2,000,000,000) tokens, of which 30% is provided for the ecosystem, 25% will be used for marketing, 20% is allocated for investment, 10% is provided for partners, 7% will be used to provide liquidity for transactions on the platform, 5% is allocated to the team, and the remaining 3% is allocated to advisors.</p>
<p>In addition, 100% of the revenue stream is used to buy back tokens from the market. They are then burned each month, reducing the total circulating supply, and increasing the value of PayPointCoin tokens.</p>
<p>The PPC token has been listed on LBank Exchange at 8:00 UTC on December 16, 2022, investors who are interested in the PayPointCoin investment can easily buy and sell PPC token on LBank Exchange right now. The listing of PPC token on LBank Exchange will undoubtedly help it further expand its business and draw more attention in the market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Buenos Aires, Argentina, December 20, 2022</em>–<a href="https://bc.game/i-946j27rm-n/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">BC.GAME</a>, AFA’s official crypto casino sponsor, is celebrating Messi and Argentina’s legendary win with a huge lottery event.

<p><strong>Argentina Wins Over France </strong></p>
<p>On a night full of anticipation and heart-pounding moments, Argentina takes home the championship in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Argentina defeated France by 4-2 in a penalty shootout in the nerve-wracking final match held in the Lusail Stadium in Lusail, Qatar.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.afa.com.ar/es/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Argentinian football team</a>’s victory against France this Sunday night adds another win to Argentina’s World Cup championship titles list. This marks Argentina’s third World Cup win since their last World Cup championship title in 1986, making it 36 years since the country last won the World Cup.</p>
<p><strong>Messi’s Dream to Win the 2022 World Cup  </strong></p>
<p>Lionel Messi has obtained every possible football achievement throughout the entirety of his football career except one: winning the World Cup. After losing the finals to Germany in 2014, the 2022 World Cup marked his another chance to win the World Cup title.</p>
<p>Thanks to Argentina’s well-deserved victory, Messi has finally achieved and added the football’s grandest title to his roster of achievements.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not long ago, <em>Live Bitcoin News</em> reported that the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-ftx-arena-is-changing-its-name-following-exchange-collapse/" data-wpel-link="internal">FTX Arena for the Miami Heat</a> was going to change its name following the collapse of FTX, the now disgraced cryptocurrency exchange based in the Bahamas. The company wanted nothing to do with the firm’s rotten legacy, and now Cal – aka the California Memorial Stadium/ FTX Field – is <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/ncaafb/welcome-to-cals-ftx-field-a-naming-rights-deal-funded-by-cryptocurrency/ar-AA1479xl" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">looking to do the same</a>.</p>
<h2>Cal Doesn&#8217;t Like the Letters FTX Anymore</h2>
<p>Cal has stated that what happened with FTX is wrong and it wants no part in whatever shady deals FTX may have conducted. It doesn’t need this kind of trouble and is now looking to engage in a legal name change so the FTX letters are removed from its banner forever.</p>
<p>Cal serves as the home football field for the Golden Bears team. A few years back, Cal announced that it was joining hands with the now fallen digital trading platform and would be taking on a name change as a means of supporting the company’s legacy and operations.</p>
<p>The naming deal was set to last a full ten years. At the time, Cal director of athletics Jim Knowlton said the field had allegedly found a “great partner” in the digital exchange, and they were looking forward to a future filled with profit and possibilities. He stated in an interview at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe we have found a great partner in FTX. FTX is a growing company at the forefront of innovation in an emerging technology, one that fits well at both Cal and in the Bay Area. This agreement extends well beyond field naming rights, which is part of our strategic plan to diversify revenue streams in support of our student-athlete experience, and includes commitments for our Cameron Institute, Cal Veterans, and students in need here in Berkeley. We are looking forward to building our relationship now and in the years ahead.</p></blockquote>
<h2>One of Crypto&#8217;s Most Embarrassing Moments</h2>
<p>The collapse of FTX is likely going to go down as one of the most devastating (and embarrassing) things to happen within the confines of the crypto space. FTX first came to fruition in the year 2019. From there, it looked like a glorious future was written in the clouds for the exchange, and the company’s head executive – then 27-year-old Sam Bankman-Fried – was lauded as a genius businessman of sorts by several experts in the arena.</p>
<p>However, that reputation has faded fast as just a few weeks ago, the now crushed exchange ran to Binance for help, begging the larger competitor to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-ii-binance-said-it-would-buy-the-firm/" data-wpel-link="internal">buy it out in</a> part to an ongoing liquidity crunch the company was experiencing. While it looked like the deal was going to go through, Changpeng Zhao – the head of Binance – <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">eventually backed out</a>, claiming the problems the firm was facing were too big.</p>
