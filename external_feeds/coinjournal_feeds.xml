<p dir="ltr">Gaming and metaverse tokens jumped sharpy on Wednesday morning.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Decentraland, Sandbox, and Enjin were among the best performers.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">This price action could benefit Metacade&rsquo;s MCADE token.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Gaming-focused cryptocurrencies jumped in the past 24 hours as momentum in the industry returned.&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/decentraland/"><u>Decentraland</u></a>&rsquo;s MANA jumped by 11.5%, making it one of the best-performing crypto tokens. In the same period, Sandbox&rsquo;s SAND soared by 7.40% while&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/enjin/"><u>Enjin Coin</u></a>&rsquo;s ENJ rose by 7%.&nbsp;<a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=price_prediction"><u>Metacade</u></a> was not left behind as MCADE has risen by over 28% from the lowest level this month.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Gaming tokens jump</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Gaming is one of the top industries that will be disrupted by the blockchain technology. Data by Grandview Research showed that the industry was valued at over $4.8 billion in 2022 and that it will have a compounded annual growth&nbsp;<a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/blockchain-gaming-market-report#:~:text=How%20big%20is%20the%20blockchain,USD%207.89%20billion%20in%202023."><u>rate</u></a> of 68.3% in the next few years.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The industry, which has been controlled by giant companies like Microsoft, Take-Two Interactive has been ripe for disruption for years. And blockchain technology makes this possible by ensuring that people can game easily and make money in a simple way.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most of the existing gaming platforms using blockchain enable people to play games and then earn returns for their wins.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is unclear why gaming tokens like&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/decentraland/what-is-decentraland/"><u>Decentraland</u></a> MANA, SAND, and Enjin jumped. A likely reason is that investors were simply buying the dip after the tokens dropped sharply in the past few weeks. At its lowest level this week, MANA was down by more than 37% from its highest point this month.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Metacade?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=price_prediction"><u>Metacade</u></a> is one of the newest players in the decentralized gaming platform. The developers conducted a token sale earlier this year that raised over $16 million, making it one of the most successful token sales in the world this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since then, the developers have made several milestones. For example, they have inked several exchange-listing deals that give millions of people access to the token. As with most tokens, MCADE was first listed in Uniswap, the biggest DEX in the world. It was then listed in key platforms like MEXC and BitMart and the developers hope to list it in other exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade has also partnered with one of the biggest gaming and metaverse developers, who will build the game. Expectations is to launch the game in the next few months and also transition the ecosystem into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Is it safe to invest in Metacade?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade, like other crypto tokens, is a relatively volatile and illiquid token, meaning that you need to be cautious when allocating funds in it. In the past, people who invested vast sums of money in one or two tokens have lost a lot of it. Therefore, I suggest that you do good risk management strategy and just allocate a small portion of your cash into it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are three main reasons to invest in Metacade. First, it is in an industry that is expected to grow rapidly in the next few years. Second, there are numerous bullish catalysts for the token, including exchange listings and game launch. Finally, MCADE has a favorable risk-reward proposition.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Metacade price prediction</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/04/17/1684296607703-df093994-9bf6-4621-8e0a-5fed73bdf59b.png" style="width: 693px;height: 337.26px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="693" height="337.26"></p>
<p dir="ltr">The 4H chart shows that the MCADE price has made a strong recovery in the past few days. It has managed to pare back some of the losses it made earlier this week. The MACD has moved above the neutral point while the price has jumped above the 25-period moving average.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, there is a possibility that Meatacade will continue rising as buyers target the next psychological level at $0.30. A drop below the support at $0.018 will invalidate the bullish view.</p>

<li>HCW analyst says Bitfarms Ltd still has another 40% upside.</li>
<li>The bitcoin miner reported strong results for its Q1 this week.</li>
<li>Bitfarms stock is already up about 150% for the year at writing.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://bitfarms.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitfarms Ltd</a> is already up close to 150% versus the start of the year but an H.C. Wainwright analyst is convinced that it&rsquo;s not out of juice just yet.</p>
<h2>Bitfarms stock has another 40% upside</h2>
<p>On Tuesday, Kevin Dede reiterated his &ldquo;buy&rdquo; rating on the bitcoin miner with upside to $2.0 &ndash; up another 40% from here.</p>
<p>His bullish call on Bitfarms stock arrives a day after the company said its revenue noted an 11% sequential growth in the first quarter. Dede acknowledged that mining costs were up more than 12% versus Q4 but wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitfarms still harnesses some of the lowest cost of power among its peers by predominately drawing hydropower. Bitfarms prides itself on its renewable energy sources.</p></blockquote>
<p>Its adjusted EBITDA more than quintupled versus the previous quarter to $6.3 million in Q1, as per the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitfarms-ltd-bitf-reports-q1-125512440.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earnings press release</a>.</p>
<h2>Bitfarms has a strong balance sheet</h2>
<p>Also a positive was &ldquo;hash rate&rdquo; that increased about 7.0% in the recently concluded quarter to 4.8 EH/s. More importantly, Bitfarms sees that climbing further to 6.0 EH/s by the end of the third quarter.</p>
<p>Strength of the balance sheet was among other notable reasons why Dede remains constructive on Bitfarms stock. The Toronto-headquartered firm now has $19 million in debt only versus $140 million about 10 months ago.</p>
<p>The HCW analyst now expects Bitfarms to generate $132.4 million in revenue this year versus his previous forecast for $119.9 million. In the <a href="https://hcwco.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=53b09851-6b9d-49e1-8de1-ec1efc074fbb&amp;mime=pdf&amp;co=Hcwco&amp;id=jayson.derrick@investoogroup.com&amp;source=mail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research note</a>, he also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Its 10 sites across 4 countries mitigate geographical risks. In front of halving, BITF positions itself with strategic mix of stability, liquidity, prudent financial mgmt, and plans for growth.</p></blockquote>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Investors have been angling for a share of $ASI as token presale accelerates</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">$ASI gears for its first listing in the second quarter</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Investors have earmarked a 10x gain for $ASI</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The idea of crypto becoming mainstream has been a hotly contested topic. There have been proponents and naysayers in equal measure. To proponents, however, their wish doesn&rsquo;t seem more likely than when leading US states like Texas recognize the asset class. It means more room for new crypto projects. An example is AltSignals, which, within a few weeks in&nbsp;<a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=price_prediction"><u>presale</u></a>, has been attractive to users thanks to its innovative AI-based trading platform.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Texas state adds crypto to its Bill of Rights</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Legislators in the US state of Texas have voted to amend its Bill of Rights to add digital assets. 139 lawmakers voted in favour of the move, against two, in what would see the state include cryptocurrencies in the state law. Individuals can own, use, and store digital assets in the proposed law.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The proposed legislation is significant as crypto remains an unrecognised asset class under federal law. Leading federal regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, have attempted to reign on the sector with punitive measures. If passed into law, the Texas bill will prohibit the government from hindering ownership or holding of any form of digital asset, allowing it to become mainstream.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Essentially, regulatory uncertainty has been of great concern to crypto innovators. As more jurisdictions like Texas clear the hurdle, crypto will have more room for growth. That will allow new projects like AltSignals to enjoy wider backing.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Why has AltSignals been a success so far?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.altsignals.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>AltSignals</u></a> is a UK trading signal service that was started in 2017. Although it began as a free signal service, strong demand for its trusted services saw it expand quickly, attracting novice and new traders alike.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">So far, AltSignals has generated over 3,780 signals, generating massive returns to its trading community of over 50,000 on Telegram. The company uses algorithm-based indicators to generate quality signals in digital assets, forex, stocks, and CFDs. One of its popular instruments is Binance Futures, which has consistently generated returns for investors with over 80% accuracy.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>ActualizeAI, the new AI-trading platform by AltSignals</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals is moving a step higher in its signal generation service. The platform is integrating artificial intelligence for quality trade signals and risk management. ActualizeAI will be AltSignals&rsquo; new AI-based trading service, whose membership will be given by ownership of a new crypto token, $ASI.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In line with the expected change, AltSignals is releasing $ASI through a presale that is currently 68.72% complete. $ASI owners will unlock membership in ActualizeAI, accessing the trading platform for trading signals and other benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are exclusive presale opportunities for $ASI investors, with members also having a say in the governance through their stake. Members can also participate in trading tournaments and earn $ASI contributing to the platform&rsquo;s developments.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>$ASI prediction in 2023 as presale demand soars</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals token is still in presale, but the demand for the token has been high so far. With less than 32% remaining for the presale to close, analysts have been projecting a 1000% surge in the $ASI price once it debuts on exchanges. This is a genuine projection, given that AltSignals already has an existing community to fuel the demand for the token.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Predictably, $ASI can finish the year at $0.15 or a 10x increase. The token has a listing date in the second quarter of 2023, allowing ample time to hit the projected gain before the end of the year.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Should you invest in $ASI in May?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">$ASI price is still low and trades at $0.015 in the initial stage of the presale. Investing while the token is in the presale means getting the token at a discount and enjoying the advantages of being an ActualizeAI member. By the time the token starts to move on exchanges, early investors would be the first to benefit from price increases.</p>

<li>The company still holds an additional 188,000 stETH tokens, worth about $342 million.</li>
<li>Celsius filed for bankruptcy in 2022</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Celsius Network, a cryptocurrency lending platform that filed for bankruptcy amid the crypto winter, is unstaking millions of dollars&rsquo; worth of ether (<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/eth/">ETH</a>).</p>
<p dir="ltr">The funds being unstaked are currently held as staked ether tokens on Lido Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that allows users to stake ETH and earn rewards. Lido Finance enabled withdrawals of staked ETH as part of an upgrade this week.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Celsius withdrawing staked ETH</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Once withdrawn, Celsius will receive the underlying ETH in exchange for the stETH tokens. <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x4A87EcDfb459eb36d25226D9CCd7Ec4f684AB3Fc#tokentxns" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Blockchain data</a> indicates that Celsius has initiated withdrawal requests for 240,000 stETH worth roughly $437.7 million, with an additional 188,000 stETH tokens, worth about $342 million, remaining.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is likely Celcius will use the withdrawn ETH as part of its restructuring and creditor repayment efforts, with creditors owed $4.7 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">LDO is one of the best performers amongst the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap over the past seven days.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Lido DAO rallied by 20% in the last seven days but is slowly retracing.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The token&rsquo;s rally comes after the Lido v2 mainnet launch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">LDO outperforms the other major cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p dir="ltr">LDO, the native token of the Lido DAO, is the best performer amongst the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap over the past seven days.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The token added 20% to its value over the past few days despite the poor performance of the broader cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The rally was majorly fueled by the mainnet launch of Lido V2. Lido V2 enables Ethereum stakers to burn their stETH (staked ETH) and exit the protocol at a 1:1 ratio.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another major catalyst behind this latest price rally is the return of depositors to the Ethereum network following the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/what-is-the-ethereum-shanghai-upgrade-when-is-it/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shapella upgrade</u></a>. As an Ethereum liquid staking platform, it is not surprising that Lido DAO has seen a surge in transactions over the past few weeks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lido DAO enables users to pool their funds to become validators on Ethereum. This allows investors to bypass the Ethereum network&rsquo;s requirement of depositing at least 32 ETH.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What next for LDO?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Following its rally, what next for LDO? At press time, LDO is trading at $2.26 per coin, up by more than 4% over the past 24 hours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, LDO&rsquo;s rally comes as the broader cryptocurrency market continues to underperform. If the fundamentals of the broader crypto don&rsquo;t improve, LDO could retrace some of its profits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">LDO could test the $1.92 support level in the near term if the bearish trend in the market persists. However, if the bulls continue to be in control, LDO could rally toward the $2.5 resistance level over the next few hours or days.&nbsp;</p>

<li dir="ltr">The Bedrock upgrade could be a major positive for Optimism, boosting the price of OP.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Increased adoption of Optimism could see further demand for OP, helping its price.</li>
<li dir="ltr">OP price was down 3% in the past 24 hours and 23% in the past two weeks as the token traded near $1.63 at the time of writing.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Optimism (OP), a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, has seen the price of its native token fall by 23% so far in May (as of 16 May, 2023).</p>
<p dir="ltr">The decline comes amid a broader sell-off in the cryptocurrency market, with <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> struggling for a foothold above $27,000 and <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> retesting support areas near $1,800.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sentiment across the broader crypto market continues to lean bearish after last week&rsquo;s downturn. Optimism price could therefore fluctuate with overall market outlook, particularly as cryptocurrencies are likely to react to macroeconomic news.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But one thing that could aid an uptick in positivity for the altcoin&rsquo;s price is the upcoming Bedrock upgrade.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Optimism price outlook- when is the Bedrock upgrade?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">On Monday, the L2 platform <a href="https://twitter.com/optimismFND/status/1658202279147601921" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> the expected release date for the launch as 6 June 2023.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#128680;The official date of OP Mainnet&rsquo;s upgrade to Bedrock has been set: June 6, 2023 at 16:00 UTC!</p>
<p>The upgrade will require 2-4 hours of downtime for OP Mainnet.</p>
<p>Visit Mission Control for full details on what to expect:<a href="https://t.co/o6UjKZaVKy">https://t.co/o6UjKZaVKy</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Optimism (&#10024;&#128308;_&#128308;&#10024;) (@optimismFND) <a href="https://twitter.com/optimismFND/status/1658202279147601921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">Bedrock is a major upgrade to the Optimism network that will make it faster, cheaper, and more secure.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Among the things to come with the Bedrock upgrade are network improvements to the effect of full EVM compatibility, higher scalability and reduced transaction fees.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Optimism (OP) price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Looking at OP price, it&rsquo;s down nearly 3% in the past 24 hours, 23% in the past two weeks and nearly 39% in the past 30 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As CoinJournal recently <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-price-predictions-tron-optimism-stacks-stx/">highlighted</a> in a price prediction for Optimism, Tron and Stacks, it appears the bears have the upper hand. This outlook remains with the current price at $1.63 being -49% from the all-time high of $3.22 reached on 24 February 2023.</p>

<p></p></span></span>
<p class="fr-img-space-wrap2">While price reaction to the confirmation wasn&rsquo;t great, a flip in sentiment over the next two weeks could see OP/USD take a new leg to the upside.</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">Again, a successful upgrade could help boost the price of OP, with Optimism becoming a more attractive option for developers and users and increasing demand for the OP token. OP is currently oversold, but faces key resistances around $1.82 and $2.16.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the downside, especially if the bearish technical picture holds, the token&rsquo;s price could fall to $1.15 and $0.87.</p>

<li>The native tokens of metaverse projects saw a significant price surge after news of Apple venturing into mixed reality.</li>
<li>Apple is expected to release its highly-anticipated mixed-reality headset in the coming weeks.</li>
<li>The development is causing another surge in metaverse tokens among them Metacade&rsquo;s MCADE token.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/metacade/">Metacad (MCADE) price</a> has surged by 20% today as the hype on the much anticipated Apple mixed-reality headset.</p>
<p>Apple is expected to release its new mixed-reality headset in the coming weeks, something that some believe could breathe fresh life into the metaverse industry.</p>
<h2>What does the new mixed reality headset mean for Metacade?</h2>
<p>When news first broke in January this year, about Apple&rsquo;s plans to release a mixed-reality headset, the native tokens of metaverse projects like <a href="https://coinjournal.net/decentraland/what-is-decentraland/">Decentraland&nbsp;</a>and Sandbox witnessed significant surges in price.</p>
<p>The Metaverse token is once again surging after a bear market that hit the entire crypto market over the past weeks. <a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Metacade&rsquo;s</a> native token, the MCADE, is leading the surge with a surge of 20.59% today.</p>
<div class="fr-img-space-wrap"><span class="fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib fr-draggable"><span class="fr-img-wrap">
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/04/16/1684253636440-7f247c6e-db11-43c7-8f78-9bfe328fa8b8.jpg" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="694" height="252"><span class="fr-inner">The daily chart of Metacade price</span></p>
<p></p></span></span>
<p class="fr-img-space-wrap2">&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>The trend was highlighted by an independent developer Udi Wertheimer, who in a hard-hitting comment pointed out the absurdity of influencer-driven meme coins saying it could be the same case for metaverse tokens following the release of the Apple headset.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">CT is completely oblivious to the fact that Apple is about to launch a mixed reality headset in 3 weeks</p>
<p>Metaverse shitcoins are going to pump so hard it&rsquo;s not even funny</p>
<p>But you morons keep buying influencer coins</p>
<p>Ok</p>
<p>&mdash; Udi Wertheimer &#129497;&zwj;&#9794;&#65039; (@udiWertheimer) <a href="https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1658205805743579146?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>eToro&rsquo;s market analyst Josh Gilbert held a similar view to Udi Wertheimer and in an interview with a popular media outlet said that he believes the new headset will likely set the crypto market ablaze because of Apple&rsquo;s high-quality, market-shifting products.</p>
<p>Gilbert however cast some doubts that the success of the launch is critical to the revival of metaverse-related cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2>The correlation between virtual reality and metaverse tokens</h2>
<p>The majority of crypto participants believe there is a huge correlation between virtual reality and metaverse tokens. That said, it is worth noting that while the Metacade which is just a few months old already started game development on its platform after successfully completing its presale and listing of its MCADE token on several popular crypto exchanges, Decentraland is currently in the process of building its own VR capabilities.</p>
<p>For some history into the correlation between metaverse projects and cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrencies like MANA and SAND related to the metaverse exploded in popularity during the 2021 crypto Bull Run several metaverse projects backed by seemingly bottomless war chests of venture capital created groundbreaking immersive virtual worlds for users.</p>
<p>According to Gilbert, the performance of metaverse tokens will depend on the widespread uptake of the metaverse among everyday users.</p>
<p>Generally, metaverse projects receive a lot of support from gamers and game developers who have been at the forefront of giving metaverse tokens real-life utility. Almost every new metaverse project and their native tokens receive a very great market uptake.</p>
<p>Metacade, for example, has had quite a significant uptake right from the time it announced its presale. Firstly, the presale sold out so quickly. Secondly, Uniswap and popular centralized cryptocurrency exchanges like BitMart and MEXC Global have already listed the token showing the huge competence amount crypto participants among the crypto community.</p>
<p>However, while the hype around the highly-anticipated Apple headset is likely to trigger some significant MCADE price movement, it is not certain whether the effect will last since a fully immersive metaverse experience is likely still a long way off going by the gap between the initial launch of the iPhone and the availability of apps that fully integrate with the hardware.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The EU finance ministers have unanimously approved the MiCA cryptocurrency regulation.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The regulation could boost crypto adoption and usage in Europe.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals could be a big winner as more retail and institutional traders could enter the crypto market.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has evolved over the last decade, and many feel that there is more development in store. Following the Bull Run of 2021, regulatory agencies globally have been working to roll out favourable regulations that would ensure consumer protection and promote innovation in the industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the most important crypto regulations, MiCA, has been approved by finance ministers across Europe. This implies that the regulatory framework could soon be adopted across the continent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Could this latest development lead to the massive adoption of cryptocurrencies, and what does this mean for trading-focused tokens like AltSignals?</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">EU finance ministers finally approve MiCA</h2>
<p dir="ltr">European Union finance ministers vote unanimously to adopt Europe&rsquo;s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">MiCA sets clear regulatory guidelines and requirements for using digital currencies and related services and activities across the EU. The legislation covers various areas, including cryptocurrencies, digital assets, stablecoins, and utility tokens.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once the bill is passed into law, MiCA is expected to take effect before the end of 2023 or in 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What Does this mean for the cryptocurrency market?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The adoption of MiCA in Europe could serve as an excellent boost for the cryptocurrency industry in Europe and even beyond.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Market experts believe that clear regulations would make it easier for industry players to know how to provide services and open the market up to more investors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jeremy Allaire, CEO of USDC stablecoin issuer Circle, stated earlier this year that he is optimistic that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/davos-2023-new-regulatory-definitions-needed-digital-assets-circle-ceo-2023-01-16/"><u>MiCA will create the conditions for a thriving competitive market</u></a> in the EU.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market is worth over $1 trillion at the moment, down by more than 60% from the all-time high of $3 trillion recorded in November 2023.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the adoption of MiCA, cryptocurrency adoption in Europe could increase over the coming years and, subsequently, the total capitalisation of the market.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is AltSignals?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">One of the cryptocurrencies that could benefit from this latest development is AltSignals.&nbsp;<a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>AltSignals</u></a> is a trading platform designed to provide trading signals for stocks, forex, indices, cryptocurrencies, and CFDs.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The project is still in its presale stage, and the developers have raised nearly 70% of the funds needed to improve their services. AltSignals will be using some of the funds to develop ActualizeAI, a solution that could make it easier for more people to enter the cryptocurrency trading scene.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignal&rsquo;s ActualizeAI will be fully automated and work 24/7, just like the cryptocurrency market. With this solution, traders can easily determine entry points in the market, execute more accurate trades, and deploy proper risk management strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The AltSignals platform is powered by the ASI token. Token holders would be granted access to various services offered by AltSignals.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Visit the official AltSignals website</u></a> to learn more about their presale.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How does MiCA adoption affect AltSignals?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals could be a big beneficiary of MiCA in Europe thanks to its position as a niche-focused project.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The lack of clear regulation is one of the reasons some investors, especially institutional investors and traders, are yet to enter the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With MiCA, there would be regulatory clarity in Europe, and more individual and institutional investors and traders could troop into the market. If or when that happens, tools such as AltSignals could play a huge role in ensuring cryptocurrency adoption.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Retail and institutional traders can leverage AltSignals to trade various cryptocurrencies. They could also use the solution to trade other asset classes like forex, commodities and stocks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The adoption AltSignals could see ASI&rsquo;s value surge over the next few years. At the moment, AltSignals is still in its&nbsp;<a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>presale stage</u></a>, and ASI is sold for $0.015 per token. The team has raised more than $740k so far and looks likely to hit the $1 million goal soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a coin with utility, ASI could be one of the biggest winners, especially as the cryptocurrency market could be on the verge of another bull cycle.,&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Are cryptocurrencies good investments?&nbsp;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The results recorded by millions of investors over the past decade already answer this question.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, no other asset class has outperformed cryptocurrencies. The ROI recorded by cryptocurrencies far outweighs those recorded by stocks and commodities over the past decade.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, Polygon, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu, have given early investors thousands of percentages in ROI.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Keep in mind that we mentioned early investors, as they usually purchase cryptocurrencies when their prices as still low. ASI could also follow this path thanks to its utility as a trading-focused token.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Is now a good time to buy AltSignals?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">This could be a good time to buy promising cryptocurrency projects like AltSignals. If the developers deliver on their promises, AltSignals could have huge adoption within the cryptocurrency trading community.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The launch of ActualizeAI could help boost AltSignals&rsquo; adoption rate, especially amongst crypto traders. If that happens, buying ASI could be an excellent investment, as the utility of the token will increase over time.&nbsp;</p>
