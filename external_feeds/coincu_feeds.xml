<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>LeetSwap, the largest DEX on the Base chain, tweeted that several liquidity pools on the platform may have been hacked.</em></li>



<li><em>The team has now suspended transactions on the platform to conduct an investigation.</em></li>



<li><em>The LEET price immediately dropped 5.4% following the platform&#8217;s announcement.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to the official announcement of the largest DEX on Base, <a href="https://leetswap.finance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LeetSwap</a>, it is possible that some of their liquidity pools were hacked.</strong></h5>

<p>A few minutes ago, the leading DEX platform on Base issued a notice stating that our factory has a security pause function because their DEX was forked from Solidly. The platform found that some of the pool&#8217;s liquidity may have been compromised.</p>



<p>Currently, the team has paused all transactions to conduct an investigation. Users will not be able to trade on this exchange until further notice from the project. Several user reports have also pointed to various bugs on the platform.</p>

<p>The LeetSwap exchange emerged a few days ago when the memecoin $BALD appeared on the Base ecosystem, which has increased thousands of times, attracting the attention of users in the context of the market without many positive fluctuations. There is a lot of talk in the community about the hacked DEX being the next step of the BALD token drag carpet, a memecoin that has seen a huge increase in TVL from 0 to $55 million in just 24 hours of launch.</p>



<p>A series of memecoin projects based on Base also showed signs of <a href="https://coincu.com/207432-memecoin-bald-rug-pull-price-dropped-pver-80/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rug pull</a>. Even the $BALD project suddenly dropped 99% when a large amount of liquidity was withdrawn, thereby creating suspicion of the rug pull project.</p>

<p>Wintermute researcher Igor Igamberdiev said that the vulnerability comes to a function in the code of the pools on LeetSwap, which allows users to withdraw all the liquidity in the pool in a few simple steps.</p>

<p>According to CertiK statistics, July is the period to record the highest loss from crypto attacks so far in 2023, with $303 million being stolen from many well-known DeFi protocols. Although both the number of attacks and the damage caused by crypto-attacks in the first half of 2023 has decreased compared to 2022, the problem continues to be a problem for the crypto industry.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>A US federal judge denied Terraform Labs&#8217; request to dismiss Terraform Labs&#8217; lawsuit with the SEC.</em></li>



<li><em>The judge also argued that he disagreed with the approach taken in the SEC case against Ripple.</em></li>



<li><em>This decision could cause the SEC to reverse course to appeal the case against Ripple.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/31/judge-rejects-ripple-ruling-precedent-in-denying-terraform-labs-motion-to-dismiss-sec-lawsuit/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=coindesk_main&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=editorial&amp;utm_term=organic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinDesk</a>, US Federal Judge Jed Rakoff of the Southern District of New York dismissed Terraform Labs&#8217; request to dismiss the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charges on Monday.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1024x576.png" alt="US Judge Denies Terraform Labs Petition To Dismiss SEC Lawsuit" class="wp-image-207528" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="US Judge Denies Terraform Labs Petition To Dismiss SEC Lawsuit 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The judge said that the SEC has fully demonstrated its authority and &#8220;has made a reasonable recommendation&#8221; that TerraUSD (UST) and LUNA may have violated securities laws.</p>



<p>Additionally, Jed Rakoff rejected the judgment of Judge Analisa Torres, who recently ruled that Ripple Labs offers XRP to retail investors on the secondary market and does not violate securities laws.</p>



<p>Judge Rakoff does not distinguish between cryptocurrencies based on how they are sold. For him, selling directly to large institutional investors or through a 3rd party to retail investors ‚Äì does not affect whether those tokens are considered securities or not.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;But Howey makes no such distinction between purchasers. And it makes good sense that it did not. That a purchaser bought the coins directly from the defendants or, instead, in a secondary resale transaction has no impact on whether a reasonable individual would objectively view the defendants&#8217; actions and statements as evidencing a promise of profits based on their efforts.&#8221;</p>
<cite>He said.</cite></blockquote>

<p>Prior to that, during a hearing on Thursday, June 15, representatives of Terraform Labs<a href="https://coincu.com/195637-us-considers-terraform-labs-for-securities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> faced</a> the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a Manhattan court to prove that the public-owned cryptocurrency issuer is not a security.</p>



<p>At yesterday&#8217;s hearing, Dentons, a law firm representing Terraform Labs against the SEC, presented new documents supporting their petition to dismiss the securities commission lawsuit.</p>



<p>The SEC challenged Dentons&#8217; efforts, saying the documents, which included internal SEC emails and other important information, were irrelevant. The regulator reiterated that the collapsed algorithmic stablecoin of Terraform UST should be treated as a security.</p>



<p>In stark contrast to Judge Torres&#8217; ruling with Ripple. These are two different lawsuits. Jed Rakoff&#8217;s ruling will not change the results already from the Ripple case, but this could be the basis for the SEC to take decisive appeal actions in the Ripple case.</p>

<p>In addition to this development, <a href="https://coincu.com/200998-dcg-has-responses-to-the-lawsuit-from-gemini/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DCG</a> has been actively engaged in resolving the challenges faced by its subsidiary, <a href="https://coincu.com/200865-genesis-global-2b-dispute-ftx-delay-creditor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genesis Global Holdco</a>. The lending subsidiary filed for bankruptcy in January, leading to legal battles with major creditors, including Gemini Trust, controlled by the Winklevoss brothers. Gemini Trust <a href="https://coincu.com/188995-gemini-alleges-dcg-failed-to-pay-630m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a lawsuit against DCG and <a href="https://coincu.com/162363-genesis-creditors-sue-dcg-and-barry-silbert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barry Silbert,</a> alleging &#8220;fraud and deception&#8221; related to a failed lending venture.</p>

<p>Despite the disputes and challenges, DCG is making efforts to resolve the Genesis Capital Chapter 11 cases and close the bankruptcy proceedings soon, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-31/barry-silbert-s-digital-currency-group-names-mark-shifke-as-cfo#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>.

<p>On a positive note, DCG has also been streamlining its operations, shutting down various businesses, such as the TradeBlock subsidiary that provided trade execution.

<p>As DCG moves forward with its new CFO, the company remains focused on resolving its legal battles and streamlining its operations to navigate the ever-evolving crypto landscape successfully. The developments at DCG will undoubtedly be closely watched by the cryptocurrency community and the wider financial industry.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>NFT Now, a leading web3 digital media platform, announces job cuts due to declining demand for digital collectibles.</em></li>



<li><em>The NFT sector experiences a significant downturn as cryptocurrency prices plunge and investors become more risk-averse.</em></li>



<li><em>Other prominent NFT companies, including Dapper Labs and OpenSea, also face staff reductions to navigate the challenging market conditions.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>NFT Now, a renowned web3 digital media platform leading the charge in tokenized media, has made a significant announcement regarding job cuts amidst a notable downturn in demand for digital collectibles.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2359.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2359-1024x538.png" alt="image 2359" class="wp-image-207501" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2359-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2359-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2359-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2359-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2359-1140x599.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2359.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="NFT Now Announces Job Cuts Amidst Cooling NFT Market 8"></a></figure></div>


<p>The company&#8217;s president, Alejandro Navia, <a href="https://twitter.com/AlejNavia/status/1686024751377006594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took</a> to Twitter (X) to share the news, explaining that they had expanded too rapidly during the bullish market phase, necessitating a reduction in staff.</p>



<p>The concept of web3 media or tokenized media publications aims to address the challenges faced by web2 media firms by capitalizing on NFTs to build a strong community around their content creation. NFT Now is currently on a mission to empower cultural makers and encourage the widespread use of NFTs and <a href="https://coincu.com/201454-web3-ventures-investment-q1-2023-down-80/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">web3</a>.</p>



<p>In a notable achievement, the media company launched its Now Pass token in March, which rapidly sold out at 0.25 ETH per token, generating an impressive $1.1 million in total revenue.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2360-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2360-1024x576.png" alt="image 2360" class="wp-image-207502" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2360-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2360-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2360-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2360-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2360-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2360-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2360.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="NFT Now Announces Job Cuts Amidst Cooling NFT Market 9"></a></figure></div>


<p>However, the once-booming NFT sector has cooled off considerably compared to the peak demand it experienced during the pandemic era, primarily due to reduced liquidity injections. The market witnessed a significant selloff earlier this month as cryptocurrency prices declined, and investors became more cautious in light of concerns regarding high inflation, central bank rates, and the possibility of a recession.</p>



<p>NFT Now isn&#8217;t the only company in the industry facing difficulties in the current market conditions. Various firms are grappling with falling revenues and struggling to find ways to sustain their resources and survival.</p>



<p>For instance, <a href="https://coincu.com/202245-dapper-labs-laid-off-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dapper Labs</a>, helmed by CEO Roham Gharegozlou, recently bid farewell to 51 brilliant &#8220;colleagues and friends&#8221; as part of their efforts to adapt to the current market challenges. The company had already implemented staff reductions earlier, with a 20% cut in February following a 22% reduction in November of the previous year.</p>

<p>Even the well-established NFT marketplace, <a href="https://coincu.com/204559-opensea-enables-peer-to-peer-nft-trading-deals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenSea</a>, has had to resort to cost-cutting measures, trimming 20% of its workforce to navigate the prolonged slump in digital asset markets.</p>



<p>The current state of the NFT industry underscores the need for companies to recalibrate their strategies and reevaluate their operations in the face of a rapidly evolving market landscape. Despite the challenges, stakeholders in the space remain hopeful that the sector will eventually find its footing and continue to innovate the future of tokenized media.</p>

<p>As Yuga Labs ambitiously develops Otherside, its innovative and interoperable metaverse, the acquisition of Roar Studios brings onboard a team of visionary tech pioneers. They will lend their expertise, specialized knowledge, and leadership to help enhance Yuga&#8217;s metaverse strategy and revolutionize content creation and social interactions within the virtual world.</p>



<p>Daniel Alegre, CEO of Yuga Labs, expressed his excitement about the partnership, stating that Roar Studios has reimagined the metaverse&#8217;s media experience. He warmly welcomed the talented Roar team into the Yuga family and highlighted their dedication to creative content and social connections. Alegre firmly believes that Roar&#8217;s valuable contributions will propel the execution of Yuga&#8217;s grand vision for Otherside and their broader ecosystem.</p>



<p>Following the acquisition, Eric Reid, Founder and CEO of Roar Studios, is slated to lead Otherside as its CEO, leveraging his two-decade-long experience in building teams and curating film, television, and music content.

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/201538-yuga-labs-demands-removal-of-ethereum-punks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yuga Labs</a>, since its inception in April 2021 with <a href="https://coincu.com/205614-baycs-made-by-apes-ushers-in-a-new-era/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bored Ape Yacht Club</a>, has been a trailblazer in the NFT space, continuously exploring the potential of web3 technology. Notable achievements include releasing intellectual property licenses to NFT holders, acquiring rights to major collections like <a href="https://coincu.com/155801-cryptopunks-fraction-token/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CryptoPunks</a> and Meebits, and launching the interactive metaverse project Otherside, which challenges traditional notions of play spaces.</p>



<p>Having secured a seed round of $450 million at a valuation of $4 billion in March 2022, Yuga Labs remains committed to pushing boundaries and unlocking real-world utility for NFTs. The acquisition of Roar Studios serves as a strategic move to fortify their metaverse ecosystem and steer the course of the future in web3 technology.</p>



<p>With Eric Reid on board as the General Manager of Otherside, working alongside Yuga&#8217;s seasoned executive team, the future looks promising for this dynamic collaboration. Reid&#8217;s vast industry experience and creative acumen are expected to play a pivotal role in evolving Otherside&#8217;s vision and transforming it into an immersive, user-centric platform, further cementing Yuga Labs&#8217; position as a frontrunner in the metaverse realm.</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-143" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a fraud lawsuit against the controversial entrepreneur, who is currently residing in Finland, alleging that he raised more than $1 billion through the unregistered offer and sale of crypto asset securities to retail investors globally.</p>



<p>The SEC&#8217;s complaint specifically pointed out that the cryptoassets <a href="https://coincu.com/139984-sec-issues-subpoenas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hex</a>, PulseChain, and PulseX all fall under the category of securities. According to the lawsuit, Heart consistently touted these investments as a guaranteed pathway to immense wealth for investors, going as far as claiming that HEX was destined to be the most appreciating asset in the history of humankind.</p>



<p>The accusations against Heart and PulseChain are grave, as the SEC claims that they defrauded investors by misappropriating at least $12.1 million of PulseChain investor funds. Shockingly, these funds were allegedly used by Heart to indulge in extravagant purchases, including a 555-carat diamond, luxury cars, and high-end watches.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Commentary-SEC-Global-Offices-GettyImages-1230842615-scaled.webp"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Commentary-SEC-Global-Offices-GettyImages-1230842615-1024x683.webp" alt="SEC Sues HEX Founder Richard Heart For $1 Billion Securities Fraud" class="wp-image-207487" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Commentary-SEC-Global-Offices-GettyImages-1230842615-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Commentary-SEC-Global-Offices-GettyImages-1230842615-300x200.webp 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Commentary-SEC-Global-Offices-GettyImages-1230842615-768x512.webp 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Commentary-SEC-Global-Offices-GettyImages-1230842615-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Commentary-SEC-Global-Offices-GettyImages-1230842615-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Commentary-SEC-Global-Offices-GettyImages-1230842615-750x500.webp 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Commentary-SEC-Global-Offices-GettyImages-1230842615-1140x760.webp 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="SEC Sues HEX Founder Richard Heart For $1 Billion Securities Fraud 15"></a></figure></div>


<p>One of the main points of contention in the lawsuit is Heart&#8217;s failure to disclose the transfer of $217 million in investor assets to a private wallet, which the SEC argues was used to conceal his misappropriation of PulseChain investor assets for personal use. This deception involved employing a decentralized aggregator and a Mixer to obscure his actions further.</p>



<p>Richard Heart is renowned as the founder of Pulsechain, PulseX, and the Hex project, all of which have faced controversies during their existence. The SEC&#8217;s focus is primarily on the staggering amount Heart raised by selling tokens for these projects, which adds fuel to the lawsuit&#8217;s fire.</p>



<p>Moreover, the <a href="https://coincu.com/207270-sec-asks-coinbase-stop-all-except-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a> takes issue with Heart&#8217;s offering of a Staking product associated with HEX, PulseChain, and PulseX tokens, promising investors returns of up to 38%. The SEC deems these actions to be hazardous for investors and thus justifies the charges brought against Heart.</p>



<p>Eric Werner, Director of the Fort Worth Regional Office, stated that Heart enticed investors to purchase unregistered crypto asset securities and then deceived them by using their assets for extravagant luxury purchases. The SEC aims to protect investors and hold Heart accountable for his actions through this legal action.</p>



<p>The SEC&#8217;s press release also encourages members of the Hex community to come forward with any information they might have related to the case.</p>

<p>Richard Heart faces serious allegations of securities fraud by the SEC. Beyond the unregistered offer and sale of these securities, the lawsuit also accuses Heart of defrauding investors through the misappropriation of assets. </p>



<p>The SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties as a result of the alleged misconduct. Last year, the SEC <a href="https://coincu.com/139984-sec-issues-subpoenas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subpoenaed</a> a large number of HEX influencers, as Coincu reported.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, HEX is trading at $0.0064 with a drop of over 28% on the day.</p>

</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Shanghai Municipal Government has <a href="https://www.shanghai.gov.cn/nw12344/20230731/74d21b6a0d7e4f909168ad372c2b4f82.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set</a> forth an ambitious project implementation plan that aims to revolutionize the city&#8217;s urban infrastructure using blockchain technology from 2023 to 2025.

<p>Outlined in the plan are three key objectives that the government seeks to achieve. First, the government plans to strengthen the use of blockchain technology in critical sectors such as finance, industry, and trade. By doing so, they aim to elevate efficiency, security, and transparency, leading to a more robust and reliable economic ecosystem.</p>



<p>Second, the application of blockchain technology will extend to key areas like health, education, and transportation, aiming to optimize service delivery and increase citizen satisfaction. This move will revolutionize public service management and ensure better access and quality of services for residents.</p>



<p>Finally, the Shanghai Municipal Government is committed to employing blockchain technology to build a more effective, transparent, and accountable governance system. This measure will foster greater public trust and participation in city affairs.</p>



<p>This project aligns with Shanghai&#8217;s broader strategic goal of digital transformation, with the city taking significant strides towards comprehensive urban development. By harnessing the potential of blockchain technology, Shanghai is setting a new precedent for sustainable urban planning that will ultimately benefit all its residents.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the announcement highlights the project&#8217;s role in coordinating blockchain network resources across the Yangtze River Delta region, turning Shanghai into an international blockchain exchange hub.</p>



<p>The governor of Shanghai emphasized the city&#8217;s commitment to the development of blockchain infrastructure, with a target completion date set for 2025. The official implementation plan was released on July 31st, covering the period from 2023 to 2025.</p>

<p>In May, the city of Zhengzhou also announced initiatives to support metaverse companies in the region, showcasing China&#8217;s dedication to adopting emerging technologies like blockchain.</p>

<p>The data also revealed a notable shift in investor preferences, with altcoins, excluding <a href="https://coincu.com/207287-ethereum-ico-investor-emerges-after-8-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>, garnering significant attention. Last week alone, altcoins experienced inflows of $3 million, with a total of $19 million pouring in over the past eight weeks. Notably, <a href="https://coincu.com/200106-cardano-tvl-in-defi-hit-ath/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardano</a>, <a href="https://coincu.com/204372-solana-is-on-the-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solana</a>, and XRP emerged as the most favored altcoins, attracting inflows of $0.64 million, $0.6 million, and $0.5 million, respectively. Meanwhile, Ethereum and Avalanche witnessed minor outflows, totaling $1.9 million and $0.4 million, respectively.</p>

<p>In contrast to the minor outflows in digital asset investment products, the first half of the year saw substantial inflows close to $500 million. However, the past week&#8217;s trading volumes were lackluster, amounting to $915 million. This figure pales in comparison to the year-to-date weekly average of $1.5 billion, indicating reduced trading activity in the digital asset market.</p>



<p>CoinShares&#8217; data also provided insights into regional investment trends. Notably, North America emerged as the primary source of negative sentiment, with outflows totaling $11 billion from both the US and Canada. Conversely, <a href="https://coincu.com/198927-binance-custody-license-in-germany/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Germany</a> saw inflows of $5 million, while Switzerland and Sweden experienced outflows of $3.2 million and $2.6 million, respectively.</p>



<p>The broader Bitcoin market reflected the overall subdued sentiment, as it witnessed a total of $16 billion in trading volume on trusted exchanges during the past week. This figure is significantly lower than the weekly average of $52 billion seen this year.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, the past week&#8217;s <a href="https://coincu.com/206516-bitcoin-is-slowly-gaining-bullish-momentum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> price fluctuations did not correlate with any major news events. The largest cryptocurrency continued to trade below $29,500 throughout the week, with no substantial price movements reported.</p>

<p>As the cryptocurrency market evolves, investors are closely observing the rise of altcoins, particularly Cardano, Solana, and XRP, which are gaining traction. Despite the recent outflows from Bitcoin investment products, the overall sentiment remains optimistic, highlighting the resilient nature of the digital asset market.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>eToro facilitates a $120 million secondary stock sale to early employees and angel investors, reflecting investor interest in the firm.</em></li>



<li><em>The termination of a proposed SPAC deal led to a valuation of $3.5 billion, down from the earlier sought-after $10 billion, but eToro raised $250 million from investors in a subsequent funding round.</em></li>



<li><em>eToro&#8217;s strategic partnership with Twitter and regulatory approval as a virtual currency exchange in Spain further enhance its position in the global market.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a move to provide liquidity for its early employees and angel investors, eToro, the multi-asset investment platform offering stocks, cryptocurrencies, and contracts for different transactions, conducted a secondary stock sale, according to a <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/31/robinhood-rival-etoro-agrees-120-million-secondary-share-sale.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC</a></em> report.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2343.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2343-1024x576.png" alt="eToro Agrees To Sell $120 Million In Shares At Discounted Valuation" class="wp-image-207468" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2343-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2343-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2343-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2343-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2343-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2343-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2343.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="eToro Agrees To Sell $120 Million In Shares At Discounted Valuation 24"></a></figure></div>


<p>The company allowed its existing investors to purchase shares from these stakeholders, raising a total of $120 million, according to sources familiar with the matter. This valuation is slightly below the $3.5 billion figure achieved in a previous Series A funding round earlier this year.</p>



<p>The secondary stock sale, characterized by the absence of newly issued shares and the consequent lack of net proceeds for the company, serves as a barometer of investor sentiment towards eToro&#8217;s shares. It comes as a significant development following the company&#8217;s decision to terminate a SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) transaction and its planned private placement financing in July of the previous year.</p>



<p>Previously, eToro had announced intentions to go public through a merger with a blank-check company, Fintech V, in a deal valued at $10 billion. However, due to fluctuations in equity and crypto prices, investor concerns about tech exposure, and a slump in trading activity experienced by retail brokerages, the deal fell through.</p>



<p>Undeterred, <a href="https://coincu.com/194523-etoro-bans-u-s-users-from-trading-popular/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eToro</a> managed to secure a $250 million investment from notable backers such as SoftBank Vision Fund 2, ION Investment Group, and Velvet Sea Ventures at a valuation of $3.5 billion. This valuation was significantly lower than what the company had sought in its initial attempt to go public via the SPAC route.</p>



<p>In recent times, eToro has been making waves in the financial industry with a string of noteworthy achievements. Among them was a partnership with <a href="https://coincu.com/205612-twitter-x-upgrade-enhances-financial-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> (now known as X), enabling users of the social media platform to access stock and crypto trading by using &#8220;cashtags,&#8221; denoted by a dollar sign before a stock or asset&#8217;s ticker symbol.</p>

<p>Additionally, eToro <a href="https://coincu.com/206925-etoro-secures-bank-of-spains-virtual-asset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> approval from the Bank of Spain to operate as a virtual currency exchange and electronic wallet custody service provider. This regulatory milestone underscores the company&#8217;s commitment to consumer protection and innovation. Spanish users can now access eToro&#8217;s diverse range of asset classes, investment tools, and educational resources, empowering them to grow their knowledge and wealth.</p>



<p>The recent secondary stock sale and ongoing developments highlight eToro&#8217;s resilience and strategic approach amid a rapidly evolving financial landscape. As the company continues to chart its path, it remains poised to make further strides in the investment industry, offering its users innovative and accessible opportunities in the world of finance.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The German data protection supervisory office has been conducting an investigation into OpenAI&#8217;s chief executive, Sam Altman, and the Worldcoin Project since November 2022.&nbsp;</strong></h5>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5c38a4cd-96d8-4bc3-b9a2-052efc6a9581_6a9bf06d-1024x683.jpeg" alt="5c38a4cd 96d8 4bc3 b9a2 052efc6a9581 6a9bf06d" class="wp-image-207459" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5c38a4cd-96d8-4bc3-b9a2-052efc6a9581_6a9bf06d-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5c38a4cd-96d8-4bc3-b9a2-052efc6a9581_6a9bf06d-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5c38a4cd-96d8-4bc3-b9a2-052efc6a9581_6a9bf06d-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5c38a4cd-96d8-4bc3-b9a2-052efc6a9581_6a9bf06d-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5c38a4cd-96d8-4bc3-b9a2-052efc6a9581_6a9bf06d.jpeg 1098w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="German Data Watchdog Investigates Worldcoin Project Over Biometric Data Concerns 26"><figcaption>German Data Watchdog Investigates Worldcoin Project Over Biometric Data Concerns 28</figcaption></figure>



<p>The probe is centered around concerns related to the large-scale processing of sensitive biometric data. Michael Will, chairman of Bavaria&#8217;s data protection supervisory office, revealed that the investigation was initiated due to worries surrounding the handling of biometric data in the <a href="https://coincu.com/205302-worldcoin-token-openai-ceo-sam-altman/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/205302-worldcoin-token-openai-ceo-sam-altman/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worldcoin Project</a>. As the company behind Worldcoin, Tools For Humanity, has a local German subsidiary, the Bavarian state regulator is leading the investigation under EU data protection rules.</p>



<p>The scrutiny on Worldcoin extends beyond Germany, with other European countries also taking a closer look. Recently, the French privacy watchdog announced its own investigation into the project. Additionally, the U.K. data watchdog has expressed its intention to review Worldcoin following its launch.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sam-altman-worldcoin-orb-1024x768-1.jpeg" alt="sam altman worldcoin orb 1024x768 1" class="wp-image-207460" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sam-altman-worldcoin-orb-1024x768-1.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sam-altman-worldcoin-orb-1024x768-1-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sam-altman-worldcoin-orb-1024x768-1-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sam-altman-worldcoin-orb-1024x768-1-750x563.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="German Data Watchdog Investigates Worldcoin Project Over Biometric Data Concerns 27"><figcaption>German Data Watchdog Investigates Worldcoin Project Over Biometric Data Concerns 29</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sam Altman is the man in charge of the Worldcoin project, which has attracted a lot of attention due to its strategy of providing users with digital identification and cryptocurrency incentives by means of iris scans, which are derived from their biometric data. The idea behind the initiative has piqued people&#8217;s interest, but it has also prompted questions over the privacy of users&#8217; data and the appropriate application of biometric information.</p>



<p>Authorities in a variety of nations are conducting thorough investigations into initiatives such as Worldcoin to guarantee compliance with data protection rules and to protect the privacy rights of individuals. This is because data protection standards are getting increasingly stringent.</p>



<p>The investigations by multiple European data watchdogs highlight the importance of transparency and accountability in projects involving sensitive data. As Worldcoin and similar initiatives progress, they will need to address these concerns and adhere to data protection regulations to build trust among users and regulators alike.</p>
