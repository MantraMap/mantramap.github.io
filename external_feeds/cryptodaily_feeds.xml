			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Prominent crypto wallet service provider, Ledger, has announced its latest venture into the world of institutional trading technology.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Dubbed "Tradelink," this new trading and settlement network technology is set to revolutionize the landscape for asset managers, custodians, and exchanges/OTC. Aiming to streamline operations and boost efficiency, Tradelink will allow trading on multiple exchanges without the need for on-chain liquidity re-balancing.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This will ensure that users maintain custodial ownership of assets while engaging in off-exchange trading. Additionally, Tradelink seeks to mitigate trading collateral risks across various third-party platforms, offer easy integration with preferred counter-parties, and significantly reduce transaction fees.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The company&rsquo;s official announcement stated:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Today, we are proud to announce that Ledger is entering the institutional trading technology market with the first open network to enable custodial trading via exchange and custodial partners. This solution will provide unparalleled control, security, flexibility, and transparent governance over an enterprise&rsquo;s digital asset trading."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Ledger's VP of Enterprise Revenue, Sebastien Badault, emphasizes how Tradelink will empower users, asserting:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;By unlocking better trading options for enterprises, we are empowering asset managers, custodians, and exchanges to navigate the changing landscape with confidence while making the whole ecosystem a safer and more transparent place.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">At launch, Tradelink will be accessible to all Ledger Enterprise clients at no additional cost. Initial partners will include well-known asset managers such as Laser Digital and Hodl Group, digital asset trading and orchestration platforms like Wyden, and platform partners including Crypto.com, Bitstamp, Huobi, and more.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch of Tradelink comes after Ledger's recent controversial update, which raised security concerns among its users. However, the company remains undeterred and has just closed a $109 Million Series C extension fundraising round, pushing its valuation to $1.4 billion.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Badault further elaborates on the company's vision for Tradelink:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;We are creating a future-proof solution that will give Ledger Enterprise customers flexibility and security allowing institutions to de-risk their businesses. For almost a decade, Ledger has been building security and governance solutions for the crypto ecosystem. It is this core security foundation that can now be used to reduce counterparty risk and enable custodial trading for institutional investors.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Ledger&rsquo;s innovative Trading Operation technology, coupled with its commitment to transparency and regulatory compliance, positions the company at the forefront of an increasingly evolving market, navigating the ever-changing regulatory and overall market landscape with confidence.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">In an ambitious move, the payments giant plans to launch a blockchain-based marketplace for financial applications, propelling the evolution of payment solutions beyond traditional parameters.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Diving Deeper into Blockchain Technology</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In the quest to foster innovation in the financial technology space, Mastercard is poised to launch the beta version of its Mastercard Multi Token Network (MTN) in the UK in the coming months. The venture is being touted as an "app store powered by blockchain technologies for building regulated financial applications."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard's Executive Vice President and Head of Crypto and Blockchain, emphasized the value of the underlying technology that powers crypto, stating that it is "actually quite useful." </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Developers leveraging MTN will gain access to a myriad of tools that the company has been developing, one of which includes a private Ethereum-based blockchain, specifically crafted for the creation of novel applications. Mastercard's deep-seated commitment to the digital asset sector is further affirmed by products such as 'Crypto Secure,' 'Crypto Source,' and 'Crypto Credential.' These are geared towards enhancing transparency and trust in the digital asset space.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Developers working on the beta version will also be able to experiment with tokenized commercial bank deposits and blockchain data that provides real-time insights into a person's bank account balance.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Mastercard's Vision for the Future of Payments</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Mastercard's vision for the MTN is to "provide a set of foundational capabilities designed to make transactions within the digital asset and blockchain ecosystems secure, scalable and interoperable &mdash; ultimately enabling more efficient payment and commerce applications." </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The company's official announcement highlighted the importance of trust in the new digital ecosystem, stating, </p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Mastercard's venture into the blockchain app store space represents a major shift towards the adoption of crypto technology in the financial industry, showcasing the company's steadfast commitment to promoting a wider range of secure, accessible, and always-on payment solutions.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch of the MTN, which the company describes as one of their most ambitious projects to date, is a crucial step towards fulfilling their vision for the future of payments.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Worldcoin, a cryptocurrency project led by Sam Altman, co-founder of the AI bot ChatGPT, has announced a partnership with digital identity provider Auth0 to effectively manage World ID logins.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Altman's innovative venture aims to offer a global, financial identity to citizens around the globe. Worldcoin's open-source protocol, backed by a network of developers, economists, and engineers, is designed to foster collective ownership worldwide, enabling equal access regardless of class or economic status. Utilizing an iris scanning device, the World ID, Worldcoin aims to ensure secure access to several Web2 platforms while combating the issue of bots impersonating genuine users. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, the Worldcoin ecosystem also comprises the WorldApp payments network, promoting financial inclusion by facilitating cryptocurrency transactions. As part of its dedication to the significant challenges of the web3 world, Worldcoin supports the Optimism Collective, an initiative aiming to enhance Ethereum's scalability by reducing transaction costs.</p>
Worldcoin Collaborates with Auth0 for ID Verification 
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The crypto project has announced the launch of the "Sign in with Worldcoin" feature in Berlin, which uses the World ID biometric scanning system. This function is also set to be integrated with the Auth0 marketplace, the world's largest provider of digital identity solutions.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The &ldquo;Sign in with Worldcoin&rdquo; feature, based on zero-knowledge cryptographic proofs, will help users verify their digital identities while maintaining their privacy. This approach eliminates the risk of user data being shared with third-party services without consent, ensuring that all World ID-registered users are real people. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Auth0's services offer an alternative way for Worldcoin developers to create financial solutions tailored to a broad spectrum of individuals. Worldcoin's innovations introduce an effective measure against the spread of bots within virtual environments, a problem estimated to cause digital advertising fraud amounting to $100 billion worldwide by 2023.</p>
Mysterious Safe Deployments Linked to Worldcoin
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In other news, Worldcoin recently confirmed its role behind a series of Safe deployments to the Optimism network. A Safe, previously known as &ldquo;Gnosis Safe&rdquo;, is a multisignature smart contract wallet, widely used by development teams for added security in transactions.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A social media post from Tiago Sada, head of product for Worldcoin developer Tools for Humanity, revealed Worldcoin was behind the Safe deployments. Initially, these transactions led to speculation, including concerns about a possible Sybil attack or address-farming technique to profit from misdirected coins.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Worldcoin, which extensively uses Safes to offer gas-free transactions to verified humans, recently announced it was migrating its app from Polygon to Optimism. This migration seemed to be the cause behind the deployment of numerous Safes, reassuring the community that the network was not under any form of attack. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The ongoing evolution of Worldcoin signifies a promising direction towards secure digital identities, advancing privacy, and combatting fraudulent activity in the realm of social and web3 applications.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As the Ethereum (ETH) network continues to evolve, changes in its validator limit can significantly impact its performance, transaction fees, and adoption. By analyzing the latest market trends, the article will provide insights into Ethereum's (ETH) future price trajectory.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a presale token, Uwerx, is taking the crypto market by surprise with its astounding presale success. The project has made significant progress and updates to spice up its platform before launch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stay tuned to navigate Uwerx&rsquo;s success and Ethereum's (ETH) potential price prediction in light of the validator limit change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;BUY WERX TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
Predicting Ethereum's (ETH) Price Post Validator Limit Change
<p>As Ethereum (ETH) continues to make waves in the crypto market, one key factor closely watched by investors and analysts is the impact of the Validator Limit Change on its future price projection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Validator Limit Change refers to a crucial adjustment in the Ethereum (ETH) network to address scalability challenges and improve transaction throughput.</p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) has snowballed in recent weeks to hit new highs that strengthen its stance on the market. Ethereum (ETH) trades for $1,881.11 with a trading volume of $12 billion. As the second-largest crypto, Ethereum (ETH) has a market cap of $226 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Validator Limit Change is expected to further enhance Ethereum's (ETH) scalability, enabling the network to process more transactions efficiently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This upgrade has generated a positive sentiment among market participants, as it addresses long-standing concerns about network congestion and high transaction fees.</p>
<p>Analysts predict that the update could affect Ethereum (ETH) positively. Some experts anticipate Ethereum (ETH) surpassing $1,966 as the network's improvements take effect.</p>
<p>Regardless of the positive Ethereum (ETH) outlook, Uwerx promises to improve as investors expect a price surge in the coming months.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;BUY WERX TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
Uwerx (WERX) Price Prediction: Presale Sell-Out Nears
<p>The Uwerx revolution is in full swing, propelling the future of work toward unprecedented heights. With the presale nearing its end, Uwerx is gearing up to express its gratitude to early supporters through a Test Airdrop, acknowledging their unwavering trust and commitment to the project.</p>
<p>Uwerx's unwavering dedication to stability and long-term growth is evident in its decision to lock liquidity for an astonishing 25 years. This commitment ensures a reliable platform for users, fostering a sense of trust and confidence in the ecosystem. The team's tokens are locked for 9 months, demonstrating their deep-rooted belief in Uwerx's potential.</p>
<p>Breaking free from the traditional fee structures, Uwerx charges an industry-leading transaction fee of just 1%. This remarkable difference, compared to platforms like Upwork and Fiverr, with significantly higher costs, empowers users to retain a more significant portion of their hard-earned income, fostering financial independence.</p>
<p>Introducing the game-changing Uwerx Vault allows users to securely store their WERX tokens while earning rewards based on platform variables. This innovative feature ensures the safety of assets and encourages active participation and engagement, fueling a vibrant and dynamic ecosystem.</p>
<p>Ensuring the highest level of security, Uwerx subjected its platform to rigorous audits by reputable firms like SolidProof and InterFi Network. These comprehensive assessments provide users with peace of mind, knowing that their transactions and assets are protected within a robust and reliable infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Uwerx community thrives, with over 7,000 sign-ups, an active Twitter presence, and a vibrant Telegram group. This engaged and supportive community forms the backbone of Uwerx's success, fostering collaboration and collective growth.</p>
<p>Uwerx's presale has been nothing short of extraordinary, surpassing expectations and capturing the crypto community's attention. In Stage 5 of the presale, Uwerx offers tokens at an enticing price of $0.041 each. This presents a unique opportunity for investors to join the Uwerx ecosystem at an accessible rate. And with a generous 15% bonus accompanying each purchase, the value proposition becomes even more compelling.</p>
<p>Consider joining the presale now to take advantage of the anticipated price increase from $0.0415 to $0.047725. To benefit from the potential yield, ensure that you place your orders before Wednesday, 28th at 18:00. Any orders placed after this time will be completed at the corresponding price.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the Ethereum (ETH) network continues to evolve, changes in its validator limit can significantly impact its performance, transaction fees, and adoption. By analyzing the latest market trends, the article will provide insights into Ethereum's (ETH) future price trajectory.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a presale token, Uwerx, is taking the crypto market by surprise with its astounding presale success. The project has made significant progress and updates to spice up its platform before launch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stay tuned to navigate Uwerx&rsquo;s success and Ethereum's (ETH) potential price prediction in light of the validator limit change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;BUY WERX TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
Predicting Ethereum's (ETH) Price Post Validator Limit Change
<p>As Ethereum (ETH) continues to make waves in the crypto market, one key factor closely watched by investors and analysts is the impact of the Validator Limit Change on its future price projection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Validator Limit Change refers to a crucial adjustment in the Ethereum (ETH) network to address scalability challenges and improve transaction throughput.</p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) has snowballed in recent weeks to hit new highs that strengthen its stance on the market. Ethereum (ETH) trades for $1,881.11 with a trading volume of $12 billion. As the second-largest crypto, Ethereum (ETH) has a market cap of $226 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Validator Limit Change is expected to further enhance Ethereum's (ETH) scalability, enabling the network to process more transactions efficiently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This upgrade has generated a positive sentiment among market participants, as it addresses long-standing concerns about network congestion and high transaction fees.</p>
<p>Analysts predict that the update could affect Ethereum (ETH) positively. Some experts anticipate Ethereum (ETH) surpassing $1,966 as the network's improvements take effect.</p>
<p>Regardless of the positive Ethereum (ETH) outlook, Uwerx promises to improve as investors expect a price surge in the coming months.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;BUY WERX TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
Uwerx (WERX) Price Prediction: Presale Sell-Out Nears
<p>The Uwerx revolution is in full swing, propelling the future of work toward unprecedented heights. With the presale nearing its end, Uwerx is gearing up to express its gratitude to early supporters through a Test Airdrop, acknowledging their unwavering trust and commitment to the project.</p>
<p>Uwerx's unwavering dedication to stability and long-term growth is evident in its decision to lock liquidity for an astonishing 25 years. This commitment ensures a reliable platform for users, fostering a sense of trust and confidence in the ecosystem. The team's tokens are locked for 9 months, demonstrating their deep-rooted belief in Uwerx's potential.</p>
<p>Breaking free from the traditional fee structures, Uwerx charges an industry-leading transaction fee of just 1%. This remarkable difference, compared to platforms like Upwork and Fiverr, with significantly higher costs, empowers users to retain a more significant portion of their hard-earned income, fostering financial independence.</p>
<p>Introducing the game-changing Uwerx Vault allows users to securely store their WERX tokens while earning rewards based on platform variables. This innovative feature ensures the safety of assets and encourages active participation and engagement, fueling a vibrant and dynamic ecosystem.</p>
<p>Ensuring the highest level of security, Uwerx subjected its platform to rigorous audits by reputable firms like SolidProof and InterFi Network. These comprehensive assessments provide users with peace of mind, knowing that their transactions and assets are protected within a robust and reliable infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Uwerx community thrives, with over 7,000 sign-ups, an active Twitter presence, and a vibrant Telegram group. This engaged and supportive community forms the backbone of Uwerx's success, fostering collaboration and collective growth.</p>
<p>Uwerx's presale has been nothing short of extraordinary, surpassing expectations and capturing the crypto community's attention. In Stage 5 of the presale, Uwerx offers tokens at an enticing price of $0.041 each. This presents a unique opportunity for investors to join the Uwerx ecosystem at an accessible rate. And with a generous 15% bonus accompanying each purchase, the value proposition becomes even more compelling.</p>
<p>Consider joining the presale now to take advantage of the anticipated price increase from $0.0415 to $0.047725. To benefit from the potential yield, ensure that you place your orders before Wednesday, 28th at 18:00. Any orders placed after this time will be completed at the corresponding price.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Most crypto enthusiasts are familiar with older crypto giants that have made a lot of money for investors since their introduction to the crypto market. While these crypto giants have created a lot of profit for investors, it has become necessary for investors to seek out new DeFi projects to earn money from. Thankfully, new crypto projects with viable utilities are constantly added to the market, giving investors more options.</p>
<p>InQubeta (QUBE) is one of the latest crypto projects whose presale has already made money for investors after its Beta stage. InQubeta's presale indicates it could be more profitable than an older crypto giant like Cardano (ADA). More investors are putting their money into InQubeta to increase their profit margins in the coming months.</p>
<p>InQubeta's (QUBE) Presale Forges Ahead in the Crypto Market</p>
<p>InQubeta has successfully launched a presale that crypto enthusiasts are eager to participate in. With an ecosystem designed to offer an easy pathway to the AI market, InQubeta is slowly gaining the trust of reputable crypto investors. InQubeta's presale has recorded unprecedented success in the crypto market, increasing investors' chances of becoming wealthy through this project.</p>
<p>The QUBE token presale is divided into 10 stages, and each stage has an allocated number of tokens to be sold at a different price. The price of QUBE increases at the beginning of a new presale stage, ensuring the token's value grows as the presale progresses. The first presale stage, the Beta stage, was recently completed, pushing QUBE into its second presale phase, Stage 1.</p>
<p>The DeFi coin price of QUBE in its current stage is $0.00875, and there are 100,000,000 QUBE tokens to be sold. InQubeta's presale has raised over $600,000, and it will only raise more before the presale stages are complete. In the next stage, QUBE will be sold for $0.0098, drawing closer to its launch price of $0.0308. InQubeta is one of the most profitable new DeFi projects, as its presale also features bonuses for investors.</p>
<p>Once the presale ends, InQubeta's ability to link AI startups and investors will make it even more popular among investors. With an NFT marketplace that allows AI startups to connect with potential investors, InQubeta is set to become one of the best DeFi projects the crypto market has ever seen. InQubeta's NFT marketplace is built on the Ethereum blockchain, increasing its credibility and efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All transactions within InQubeta are paid for using the QUBE token. This increases the token's value, solidifying InQubeta's position as an excellent project to add to your portfolio in 2023. As more investors notice InQubeta's value, its DeFi coin price is only likely to increase, making it an excellent investment option for the future. Some believe it could 10x by the end of the year, and it definitely has all the key components of a crypto that could explode in value.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cardano (ADA) Maintains its Position as a Crypto Giant</p>
<p>Cardano was created using a research-based approach to crypto development. The crypto giant is one of the most popular blockchains for developers to build decentralized applications (dApps). It also offers a highly sustainable network with increased transaction processing speeds.</p>
<p>Cardano seeks to build a network that is not limited by bandwidth, promising a wider reach for blockchain developers in the crypto market. Cardano has remained one of the most profitable cryptocurrencies since it was launched. Its native token, ADA, runs operations on the platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Cardano is one of the best DeFi projects in the crypto market; however, investors are looking for new cryptos to diversify their portfolios. InQubeta's presale has created a more profitable opportunity for investors to earn more money. This is why InQubeta's presale is selling out fast and gaining momentum among investors.</p>
<p>The QUBE token may be the most profitable crypto token of 2023. Its ecosystem promises to give investors better investment opportunities that will increase the value of their holdings. Investing in its presale now is a great way to ensure you are not left out when InQubeta's price rises.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Chainlink (LINK) is currently one of the best cryptocurrencies. However, things in the crypto industry change rapidly, so you can never rely on only one coin.</p>
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) recently entered the cryptocurrency world, and although still in presale, it already faces an 80% price increase. Therefore, experts estimate that once Tradecurve (TCRV) tokens reach reputable exchanges, they can surge by 100x.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Chainlink (LINK) Price Predictions
<p>After establishing a partnership with Stella in order to secure its DeFi strategies, Chainlink (LINK) rebounded on a bullish run. But that didn&rsquo;t last for too long.</p>
<p>In the last 24 hours, Chainlink (LINK) decreased by 0.79%, currently standing at $6.09. The main reason for its price decline is Golteum&rsquo;s joining the Chainlink (LINK) BUILD program, which significantly pressures the Chainlink (LINK) coin. However, this should leverage the Chainlink (LINK) industry-leading technology and provide investors with secure, efficient, and transparent trading options.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, experts believe that Chainlink (LINK) will have a positive price movement in the upcoming period if this collaboration proves to work. Additionally, ChatGPT has bright expectations about the coin as well. It forecasts that Chainlink (LINK) will reach $12 if the tokens&rsquo; supply remains constant.</p>
<p>&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The past few weeks have been amazing for the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tradecurve?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Tradecurve&lt;/a&gt; project and community. 💎&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have over 12,000 users who have signed up for the presale, 4,400 holders, and have raised over $2.7 million. 🔥&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a LIMITED time only, the team is offering a 50% deposit bonus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;👉🧵👇 &lt;a href="https://t.co/CCwI4aICZr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CCwI4aICZr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Tradecurve (@Tradecurveapp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp/status/1673464018651205632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 26, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>
<p></p>
Tradecurve (TCRV) Brings Waves to the Crypto Industry
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) is a new project representing a decentralized platform that offers numerous trading options from a single account. More precisely, you can trade cryptocurrencies, CFDs, forex, options, commodities, EFTs, indices, and bonds. Due to combining all of these options in one platform, Tradecurve (TCRV) is the first project to offer something like this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Tradecurve (TCRV), you can enjoy total anonymity because the platform doesn&rsquo;t implement the lengthy KYC verification method. Also, Tradecurve has some pretty amazing benefits for investors. For instance, you can utilize copy trading that helps you implement successful traders&rsquo; techniques, high leverage starting at 500:1, and AI algorithmic or automatic trading. All you need to do is put crypto as a deposit and enjoy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Tradecurve (TCRV) doesn&rsquo;t stop here. The platform is considering developing a metaverse trading academy that will help less experienced traders connect with industry experts and learn their strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the main reason why Tradecurve (TCRV) draws so much attention is its native TCRV tokens that have faced an 80% price increase while still in presale. You can purchase the TCRV tokens for $0.018. In addition, Tradecurve has already raised $2.8 million from its goal of $20 million, which puts it in a great position to compete with the industry&rsquo;s giants &ndash; Binance and Kraken.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crypto analysts forecast that TCRV tokens will experience a 50x surge while in presale and an additional 100x once they get listed on a tier 1 CEX. So why don&rsquo;t you hurry up and take advantage of the Tradecurve (TCRV) 50% deposit bonus that is available until the 3rd of July?&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The House of Lords passed the Financial Services and Markets Bill today, which aims to regulate bitcoin and crypto in the UK.</p>
Rocket boost for the economy
<p>The upper house of the British government, the House of Lords, has voted to pass into law the Financial Services and Markets Bill that will see the UK embark on a path of acceptance of cryptocurrencies as &ldquo;regulated activity&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Such a bold move from the UK really puts it on the map as regards its announcement last year which stated that it wished to be a global hub for crypto, and flies completely contrary to the anti-crypto environment that permeates the Biden administration in the US.</p>
<p>Hailed as a &ldquo;Rocket Boost for [the] UK economy&rdquo; on the UK Gov website, the bill aims to make a &ldquo;technologically advanced financial services sector&rdquo; that is &ldquo;open&rdquo;, and which will &ldquo;grow the economy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As well as moving away from the US rejection of the crypto industry, the UK will repeal all the old laws that were passed in Brussels when it was a member of the EU. The UK Gov statement on its website affirmed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;By repealing old EU laws set in Brussels it will unlock billions in investment &ndash; cash that can unlock innovation and grow the economy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The statement also read that today&rsquo;s act will regulate crypto assets so that they can be safely adopted in the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as first suggested by Hester Peirce, US SEC commissioner and staunch defender of the innovations brought by the crypto sector, the UK will &ldquo;establish Sandboxes&rdquo; where crypto financial technologies can be tested before being released to the market.</p>
Crypto gold rush begins as US looks on
<p>As the UK government and regulators start to rewrite the financial rule book in order to grease the rails of innovation with full transparency and oversight of its regulators, this move has the potential to set a crypto gold rush in motion.</p>
<p>The European Union has its MiCA regulations coming into force in 2024, Hong Kong, with Chinese backing, is opening itself up as a potential go-to crypto hub in Asia, and other jurisdictions such as Singapore and Dubai are also competing for a share of the crypto industry.</p>
<p>Back over the pond in the US things are starting to look more and more gloomy as the SEC with full backing from the government drives the most innovative industry since the Internet away from its shores and into the welcome embrace of the aforementioned countries. The crypto industry will go where it is most welcome - and this certainly is not in the United States of today.</p>

<p>Such a bold move from the UK really puts it on the map as regards its announcement last year which stated that it wished to be a global hub for crypto, and flies completely contrary to the anti-crypto environment that permeates the Biden administration in the US.</p>
<p>Hailed as a &ldquo;Rocket Boost for [the] UK economy&rdquo; on the UK Gov website, the bill aims to make a &ldquo;technologically advanced financial services sector&rdquo; that is &ldquo;open&rdquo;, and which will &ldquo;grow the economy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As well as moving away from the US rejection of the crypto industry, the UK will repeal all the old laws that were passed in Brussels when it was a member of the EU. The UK Gov statement on its website affirmed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;By repealing old EU laws set in Brussels it will unlock billions in investment &ndash; cash that can unlock innovation and grow the economy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The statement also read that today&rsquo;s act will regulate crypto assets so that they can be safely adopted in the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as first suggested by Hester Peirce, US SEC commissioner and staunch defender of the innovations brought by the crypto sector, the UK will &ldquo;establish Sandboxes&rdquo; where crypto financial technologies can be tested before being released to the market.</p>
Crypto gold rush begins as US looks on
<p>As the UK government and regulators start to rewrite the financial rule book in order to grease the rails of innovation with full transparency and oversight of its regulators, this move has the potential to set a crypto gold rush in motion.</p>
<p>The European Union has its MiCA regulations coming into force in 2024, Hong Kong, with Chinese backing, is opening itself up as a potential go-to crypto hub in Asia, and other jurisdictions such as Singapore and Dubai are also competing for a share of the crypto industry.</p>
<p>Back over the pond in the US things are starting to look more and more gloomy as the SEC with full backing from the government drives the most innovative industry since the Internet away from its shores and into the welcome embrace of the aforementioned countries. The crypto industry will go where it is most welcome - and this certainly is not in the United States of today.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Several crypto traders crave attention, openly sharing their trades and promoting themselves for others to see and replicate. However, it's critical to be cautious of these traders who only showcase their winning trades. When you examine their profiles, you'll notice a complete absence of losing trades.</p>
<p>Instead of blindly following these "flawless" traders, platforms like Bybit and eToro offer copy trading functionality. This feature lets you discover traders whose strategies and performance you admire and subscribe to their updates.</p>
<p>Once you subscribe to your preferred traders, you can allocate some of your trading funds to them. By activating the autopilot feature on the platform, you can mirror their trades in real-time. It's as simple as finding a trader you resonate with, clicking the "COPY" button, and letting the platform take care of the rest.</p>
<p>In this article, we review the pros and cons of Bybit and eToro to determine which copy trading product is superior for crypto enthusiasts. But first, what does copy trading mean?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
What is Copy Trading?
<p>Copy trading is a form of investing or trading where individuals replicate the trades or investment strategies of other experienced traders. It allows inexperienced or busy traders to automatically copy the trades executed by professionals in real time, typically through a dedicated platform provided by a brokerage or social trading network.</p>
<p>Copy trading usually involves selecting a trader or multiple traders whose performance and strategies align with one's investment goals. Once a trader is chosen, their trades are automatically copied into the investor's trading account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The copied trades are executed proportionally to the investor's available capital, mirroring the actions of the selected trader. This way, investors can benefit from the knowledge and expertise of successful traders without having to actively trade or conduct in-depth market analysis themselves.</p>
<p>Copy trading has gained significant popularity in the retail market due to several reasons:</p>
Accessibility
<p>Copy trading allows retail investors to access the expertise and strategies of professional traders who might otherwise be out of reach. It allows individuals with limited knowledge or time to engage in the crypto market and potentially generate returns.</p>
Learning
<p>Copy trading can serve as a learning tool for inexperienced traders. By observing and replicating the trades of successful traders, individuals can gain insights into various trading strategies, risk management techniques, and market dynamics.</p>
Time-saving
<p>Many retail investors have limited time to dedicate to active trading or market research. Copy trading enables them to participate passively in the market while benefiting from the trades of experienced professionals. This eliminates the need for extensive research, analysis, and trade execution.</p>
Diversification
<p>Copy trading allows investors to diversify their portfolios by following multiple traders with different trading styles and asset preferences. This diversification can help spread risk and potentially enhance returns.</p>
<p>Due to its rising popularity and the demand from retail investors, copy trading has become a staple offering for Bybit, eToro, and many online trading platforms and exchanges. These platforms provide the necessary infrastructure and tools to facilitate copy trading, allowing investors to browse and select from a wide range of traders to copy. Some platforms also provide additional features such as performance statistics, risk metrics, and social interaction capabilities to facilitate the decision-making process for investors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Which is Better? Bybit Or eToro
<p>To determine which platform has the better copy trading platform, let&rsquo;s explore the pros and cons of copy trading on both platforms.</p>
Pros of Bybit Copy Trading
Improved Integration with Derivatives Trading Terminal
<p>Bybit has enhanced its platform with direct trading in a Master Trader Subaccount! Copy Trades are integrated with the main Derivatives Trading terminal, allowing investors to effortlessly copy trades from preferred traders on a single tan instead of a separate Copy Trading tab.</p>
Full Suite of Derivatives Trading Functions
<p>With the integration above, Master Traders can now take advantage of a comprehensive range of trading functions. Previously unavailable in the Copy Trading tab, features like Conditional Orders and Trailing Stops are now accessible to enhance trading capabilities. This integration empowers Master Traders with more tools and flexibility to execute their strategies effectively.&nbsp;</p>
Copy Trading via API
<p>Master Traders can now execute automated strategies with the support of V3/V5 USDT Perpetual OpenAPI. This integration enables the seamless execution of trading strategies, allowing Master Traders to automate their trading activities and optimize their trading performance.</p>
Trading on Autopilot with Third-Party Trading Tools
<p>Bybit now allows Master Traders to seamlessly connect their Subaccounts to third-party trading tools, including 3Commas and Insilico Terminal, through API integration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This enables Master Traders to leverage advanced trading features and execute automated strategies for enhanced portfolio management and increased profitability while effectively managing risks. Once the integration is set up, all trades conducted through these third-party tools will automatically synchronize with Bybit,</p>
Seamless Account Management
<p>Conveniently handle multiple Master Trader Subaccounts with ease. Bybit allows you to efficiently monitor and control all your Subaccounts in one place.</p>
Effortless Management of Trades
<p>Bybit has introduced an enhanced feature within the Asset Overview section specifically for Master Traders. Selected Derivatives accounts will now be clearly labeled as a "Copy Trading" account, providing investors with a clear distinction and easy identification.</p>
<p>With this update, investors can access important information such as Unrealized Profit and Loss (PnL), the total profit share you earned, and conveniently export Order and Trade history. This functionality provides a comprehensive view of trading performance, similar to how you would view your regular Bybit account Order and Trade history.</p>
Automated Strategies Badge
<p>In recognition of the increasing popularity of automated trading strategies among Master Traders, Bybit has introduced a new feature highlighting their usage. Now, when Master Traders employ automated trading strategies, a special badge will be displayed prominently on their profile page.</p>
Cons of Bybit Copy Trading
Unavailability in the USA
<p>Bybit Copy Trading is not currently available for users residing in the United States. This limitation restricts access to the Copy Trading feature for traders based in the USA, limiting their ability to take advantage of Bybit's functionalities.</p>
Geographical Restrictions
<p>In addition to the unavailability in the USA, Bybit Copy Trading may have other geographical restrictions that limit access to the feature in certain regions. These restrictions can vary depending on local regulations and compliance requirements, which may prevent traders from specific countries or jurisdictions from participating in Copy Trading on the Bybit platform.</p>
Pros of eToro Copy Trading
Chat With A Wide Selection of Traders
<p>eToro Copy Trading provides users with a diverse range of traders. Users can explore and select traders based on their performance, trading style, and risk profile. Furthermore, the platform enables users to communicate with the chosen traders, allowing for potential knowledge-sharing and insights.</p>
Range of Tradable Assets
<p>Depending on the user's location, eToro offers a variety of tradable assets, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, forex, and commodities. This gives users diverse options for diversifying their investment portfolios and taking advantage of different market opportunities.</p>
Social Trading Community
<p>eToro functions as a social trading platform, allowing users to interact with other members of the eToro community. This social aspect enhances the trading experience by enabling users to share ideas, strategies, and insights with fellow traders. The community aspect fosters collaboration and learning among traders.</p>
Cons of eToro Copy Trading
Execution Delay
<p>One potential drawback of eToro Copy Trading is the possibility of execution delays. Since Copy Trading involves replicating the trades of other traders, there might be a slight delay between the original trade execution and its replication in your account. This delay can result in slight differences in trade prices and potentially impact the overall performance of your copied trades.</p>
Inactivity Fees
<p>eToro imposes inactivity fees on dormant accounts that have been inactive for a certain period of time. If you're not actively participating in Copy Trading or any other trading activities on the platform, and your account remains inactive for an extended period, eToro may charge inactivity fees. These fees can reduce the profitability of your overall investment and should be considered when using the eToro Copy Trading feature.</p>
Verdict
<p>Thanks to its recently improved and updated features, Bybit edges out eToro as the exchange with the best copy trading product. Furthermore, eToro offers multiple investment options but provides access to only 80 cryptocurrencies. Bybit, on the other hand, offers over 350 cryptocurrencies, spot trading, futures, margin trading, perpetual swaps, options, and leveraged tokens. It also offers financial services like lending and borrowing.</p>
<p>Regarding fees, eToro charges a 1% fee for buying and selling cryptocurrencies, while Bybit offers more competitive fees starting at 0.1%.</p>
<p>However, it's important to note that copy trading also carries risks. Past performance does not indicate future results, and blindly copying trades without understanding the underlying strategies and risks can lead to losses. It's crucial for individuals engaging in copy trading to conduct thorough research, diversify their copied trades, and manage their risk effectively.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Stops Cited Above 30994:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 30 June 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) sought to extend recent gains early in the Asian session as the pair rallied from the 29885.53 area and reached the 30753.74 area following steady upside activity that intensified around the 30127.80 area, an upside price objective related to buying activity that emerged around the 15460 and 19568.52 areas.&nbsp; The 50-bar, 4-hourly simple moving average has provided technical support for BTC/USD for a couple trading sessions.&nbsp; &nbsp;The pair&rsquo;s recent print around the 31443.67 area was a twelve-month high and test of an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; &nbsp;Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The crypto firm has filed a motion to dismiss the legal case brought against it by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), citing a lack of jurisdiction and violation of due process.&nbsp;</p>
Coinbase&rsquo;s Rebuttal To SEC
<p>The industry is closely following the legal battle between US-based crypto exchange Coinbase and the SEC. In the latest development in the matter, the crypto firm has claimed that the regulatory body has no jurisdiction over Coinbase&rsquo;s offerings. The company has even filed a motion with the US court to dismiss the SEC&rsquo;s complaints on the grounds that the digital assets listed in the Coinbase platform are not considered securities and therefore are not under the SEC&rsquo;s purview. This motion is in direct opposition to the SEC&rsquo;s claim that several cryptocurrencies offered on the exchange&rsquo;s wallets or trading platforms are unregistered securities.&nbsp;</p>
&ldquo;Cryptos Are Not Investment Contracts&rdquo;
<p>The SEC had taken its allegations against Coinbase to legal court in early June by filing a lawsuit against the crypto exchange. On June 29, the latter countered back via a 277-page response that declared that these cryptocurrencies do not qualify as investment contracts. This means that these cryptos are not an asset tied to a contract that a promoter could sell for a profit, and the token issuers are not obligated to the investors. Since the profit or loss generated from these crypto transactions depended entirely on the assets themselves and not the company that issued them, Coinbase claimed that they cannot be considered securities. The company mentioned the Supreme Court ruling of the Howey case to support its position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Coinbase filing states,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of the assets the SEC has now identified are, in fact, securities, and for that and other reasons, secondary transactions in those assets are also not securities. [&hellip;] None of these satisfy Howey&rsquo;s definition of an &ldquo;investment contract.&rdquo; In arguing otherwise, the SEC has advanced a novel construction of the operative term that is divorced from [&hellip;] statutory context the Supreme Court and the Commission itself long ago agreed must inform the term&rsquo;s meaning.&rdquo;</p>

Coinbase Claims Abuse Of Process
<p>Notably, the company&rsquo;s rebuttal has also pointed fingers at SEC Chair Gary Gensler and his fluctuating stance on the regulating body&rsquo;s jurisdiction. Coinbase also pointed out its repeated requests for clarity on regulation and its voluntary compliance with the rules of various overlapping regulators, including the SEC, its senior staff members, and the courts regarding the application of securities laws to the crypto industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, the motion claims that the case must be dismissed solely on the grounds of violation of Coinbase&rsquo;s rights to due process and alleged abuse of process.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>FTX is reportedly looking to revive its crypto exchange, according to Wall Street Journal report. </p>
<p>The once-leading crypto exchange FTX which suffered a spectacular collapse and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2022, is reportedly exploring the possibility of reviving the FTX.com exchange.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reports that FTX&rsquo;s newly appointed CEO, John Ray, said the company has begun &ldquo;the process of soliciting interested parties to the reboot of the FTX.com exchange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FTX experienced a severe liquidity crisis in November, prompting customers to withdraw an estimated $6 billion over fear that their assets were unsafe on the exchange. The Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) led crypto empire collapsed after news broke that FTX and its sister trading firm Alameda Research had been sharing assets to boost the company&rsquo;s balance sheet.</p>
<p>FTX&rsquo;s improper trading of customer funds via Alameda saw SBF step down as CEO of the exchange. The disgraced CEO was charged with various federal crimes, including money laundering, fraud, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.</p>
SBF&rsquo;s Request To Dismiss Charges Is Rejected
<p>On Tuesday, &nbsp;New York federal Judge Lewis Kaplan denied the FTX founder&rsquo;s request to dismiss most of the criminal charges against him over the collapse of the exchange.</p>
<p>The disgraced founder has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is now accused of misleading investors and lenders.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried will stand trial in October.</p>
FTX Halts Sale of Its Stake in Anthropic
<p>Bloomberg reported earlier in the week that FTX was set to sell its shares in the AI platform Anthropic but has decided to put the brakes on the sale.</p>
<p>FTX currently holds over $500 million worth of shares in Anthropic, and the exchange has provided no specific reason for the halt of the sale.</p>
FTX Management Recover $7B in Liquid Assets
<p>FTX&rsquo;s newly appointed management team announced this week that it made &ldquo;substantial progress&rdquo; in asset recovery. It revealed that it has thus far recovered $7 billion of liquid assets.</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s new management published an investigative report with John Ray explaining the reality of what is going on at the exchange.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized exchange dYdX has announced plans to launch the public testnet of its Cosmos-based blockchain on the 5th of July, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The initial public testnet will initially only work with Bitcoin and Ethereum markets, but future upgrades plan to introduce over 30+ markets.&nbsp;</p>
Public Testnet Set For Launch&nbsp;
<p>The launch of dYdX&rsquo;s Cosmos-based blockchain is part of the decentralized exchange&rsquo;s mission to democratize access to financial opportunities further. The dYdX chain, which has been created in the Cosmos ecosystem, recently completed its Milestone 4 and has over 40 validators who are running the platform&rsquo;s software. The news was announced by the decentralized exchange on its official Twitter handle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are thrilled to announce that the dYdX Chain public testnet is set to launch on 7/05/2023 at 17:00 UTC!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The launch would also see testing commence for several functions. These would include viewing the order book, connecting wallets, and viewing account information. The decentralized exchange had stated in a blog post that it expected to launch its mainnet after completing Milestone 5 in September.&nbsp;</p>
Launch Ahead Of Schedule&nbsp;
<p>dYdX had transitioned from StarkEx, a layer-2 network built by StarkWare, to its own application-based blockchain created in the Cosmos ecosystem. dYdX&rsquo;s five-step plan focuses on gradual testing of the blockchain before its eventual mainnet launch. dYdX&rsquo;s endeavor to create its own application-based blockchain comes against the backdrop of several events in the global financial and crypto ecosystem that highlighted the urgent need for a more open, permissionless, and transparent financial systems and products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the dYdX announcement, the testnet launch is currently ahead of schedule, with the platform successfully completing its fourth milestone before the anticipated launch date. The third milestone (v3) saw the addition of several features to the stable internal testnet. These included dynamic funding rates, limit orders, and the use of ABCI 2.0, among several other features of the Cosmos SDK. V3 also saw documentation integration for validators and Market Makers, with the dYdX chain collaborating with a small group of internal validators to test out the network.&nbsp;</p>
The Fourth Milestone&nbsp;
<p>The fourth milestone will see the dYdX public testnet initially feature Bitcoin and Ethereum before integrating other cryptocurrencies through various upgrades. dYdX updated users about Milestone 4 through their official Twitter handle, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Milestone 4 marks the completion of features necessary for our public testnet launch, which will include a larger number of validators running our software (40+). AND we are shipping this ahead of schedule! This public testnet will launch with Bitcoin and Ethereum markets, but we anticipate that the open-source software will include approximately 30+ markets as the network gets upgraded!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The launch will also enable testing several core inflows through integrations, including web sockets, API, and the web frontend. The decentralized exchange has also appealed to its community members to provide feedback and suggestions after using the testnet. The news has also resulted in a minor increase in the price of the DYDX token. However, this has not been enough to break the token&rsquo;s overall bearish outlook. However, things are different in the Cosmos ecosystem, with the ATOM token registering a 15% increase in trading volume.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency platform KuCoin has announced that it will be introducing mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) rules as it looks to embrace regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The KYC rules will kick in as early as next month, with customers required to complete several mandatory identification checks to use services offered by KuCoin.&nbsp;</p>
KuCoin Embraces Regulations&nbsp;
<p>According to a press release issued by the KuCoin exchange, the KYC rules will kick in from the 15th of July. This means users will be required to complete KuCoin&rsquo;s KYC process to use the exchange and its services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consistent with KuCoin&rsquo;s core values, we are dedicated to fulfilling &lsquo;Know Your Customer&rsquo; obligation in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. We continually protect our customer&rsquo;s assets and combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and related financial crimes around the world. Based on this, KuCoin will enhance the Customer Identification and Verification Program. The enhancement will officially take effect on the 15th of July, 2023 (UTC).&rdquo;</p>

<p>Customers that do not complete the KYC process will be unable to trade or make deposits on the exchange, the press release stated. As a result, the introduction of these rules means current users will be forced to comply with KYC regulations to be able to access KuCoin&rsquo;s full suite of products and offerings. The press release noted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please take note of the following: Starting from the 15th of July, 2023 (UTC), newly registered users must complete their KYC in order to use KuCoin&rsquo;s products and services. For users who registered before the 15th of July, 2023 (UTC), if their KYC is not completed, they will only be able to use services such as Spot trading sell orders, Futures trading deleveraging, Margin trading deleveraging, KuCoin Earn redemption, ETF redemption, and will not be able to use the deposit service (withdrawals are not impacted).&rdquo;</p>

Better Compliance With Federal Regulations&nbsp;
<p>Cryptocurrency exchanges have come under considerable criticism thanks to a perception of being lax when it comes to Know Your Customer checks. Regulators have stated that such lax rules lead to fraud, terror financing, and money laundering. Jonny Lyu, the Chief Executive Officer at KuCoin, stated that introducing mandatory KYC checks would help the exchange better comply with federal regulations and enhance overall security. The CEO noted in the press release,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a people&rsquo;s exchange, KuCoin has always prioritized the security of users&rsquo; assets. As a globalized exchange, KuCoin closely monitors the crypto policies of various countries and respects compliance requirements, providing users with enhanced asset security. With the development of the cryptocurrency industry, crypto has gradually moved from a geek towards mass adoption. However, this process has also brought about certain security issues concerning on-chain assets. In light of this, KuCoin has strengthened our KYC system to comply with regulatory requirements worldwide and better protect the asset security of all cryptocurrency users through enhanced KYC rules.&rdquo;</p>

Growing Numbers
<p>KuCoin had stated in its annual review that it had over 27 million active customers on its platform at the end of 2022., with 13 million users joining the platform in 2022 alone. This represents a 102% growth year-on-year in the exchange&rsquo;s user base. The exchange revealed that its most significant jump in numbers came from the Asia-Pacific region, where it added over 7 million new users in 2022, representing an increase of 191% since 2021. Other areas that saw an increase in user base were Latin America (120%), Middle East &amp; Africa (120% and 109%), and Europe (100%).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transaction volumes also saw a considerable increase between January and December 2022, with trading volumes across the spot and futures markets crossing $3.6 trillion, representing an increase of 52% year-on-year. At its peak, KuCoin&rsquo;s daily trading volume in the futures markets reached a high of $23 billion, while the spot trading volume touched $12 billion.&nbsp;</p>

A last chance to purchase at these prices?
<p>Perhaps seeing the last chance at these prices, Microstrategy has bought more bitcoin over the last month at an average price of $28,136 per bitcoin. The news came to light after the company filed the purchase with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday.</p>
<p>All the bitcoin that Microstrategy now owns (152,333) at an average price of $29,668, puts the company above water on its purchases, given that today&rsquo;s bitcoin is worth just over $30,000.</p>
<p>With the bitcoin bull market perhaps just getting started, Microstrategy's purchases are likely to be worth quite a bit more in the next couple of years. It is maybe for this reason that the tech giant chose to make at least one more purchase now, having made its last one only two months ago.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With the latest update in the momentum of the crypto market prices, analysts are beginning to look at predictions for some of the most notable altcoins. Litecoin and Chainlink have specifically grabbed a lot of attention with their upswing, but amidst all of the bullish momentum, another player is on the horizon known as Tradecurve, which is currently in the presale run and has been making waves with its potential for exponential growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, we decided to go to AI-driven tools like Google Bard to see what kind of outlook it has for all three cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<ul>
<li>Litecoin is expected to surge to $500 by the end of the year</li>
<li>Chainlink can exceed investor expectations and can climb to $50</li>
<li>Tradecurve can climb in value by 100x, according to Google Bard</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
Litecoin Seen as One of the Best Altcoins According to Google Bard
<p>Google Bard predicts a bullish pattern in the future of the Litecoin cryptocurrency. The key reasons why Google Bard believes Litecoin can grow in value include the increased adoption of LItecoin as a payment method, alongside more people buying LTC as a form of investment.</p>
<p>Additionally, Google Bard noted how there is positive news surrounding the Litecoin cryptocurrency and a lot of speculation that can lead to sudden price movements. Litecoin is predicted to climb anywhere between $200 to $500, according to Google Bard, by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>As of June 26, 2023, Litecoin traded at a value of $88.64. Within the last seven days, the cryptocurrency saw its low point of value at $76.29, while its high point was at a value of $92.50. The overall price increase in the last seven days has been at 14.6%, and in the last year, Litecoin surged by 48.7%.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
The Bullish Future for Chainlink According to Google Bard
<p>Google Bard also had a bullish outlook for the Chainlink cryptocurrency, driven by its appeal in both investor circles and investors on a global scale. Positive news coverage surrounding the Chainlink cryptocurrency can fuel its growth alongside developments in its ecosystem. New features are consistently being rolled out, and 2023 has not been an exception to this growth. As a result, there is an estimation that Chainlink can climb between $25 to $50 by the end of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, as of June 26, 2023, Chainlink trades at $6.17. During the past week, the low point for Chainlink was at $5.02, while the high point was at $6.34. The overall price increase in the last seven days for Chainlink was at 20.9%, indicating a bullish pattern.</p>

Google Bard Estimates that Tradecurve Can Explode in Value
<p>Amidst this market rally, alongside Litecoin and Chainlink, another cryptocurrency grabbed attention from the market and grew by 80% since its beginning its Tradecurve, in the last week alone, it went up in value by 20%. Now, at Stage 4 of its presale, Tradecurve trades at $0.018, and at Stage 5 next week, it will climb by 40% to $0.025.</p>
<p>This growth has been fueled due to the array of unique features and the promising roadmap it has. What helps Tradecurve stand out from competitors such as Binance and Kraken, according to Google Bard, is that it will not require any sign-up KYC checks, which will make it inclusive for anyone from anywhere in the world. KYC procedures can be time-consuming and can involve manual verification, delaying the account creation process and removing anonymity completely.</p>
<p>Google Bard also noted how users can trade immediately just by making a deposit in crypto, which will be used as collateral on top of the platform. This fact, combined with the privacy provided by Tradecurve, will make it the most desirable trading platform for those who are conscious about their information and want to avoid it getting leaked from platforms that are heavily centralized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other features behind Tradecurve that can help it grow in value, according to Google Bard, include high leverage starting at 500:1, a VIP account system, negative balance protection, and the implementation of Proof of Reserves (PoR) alongside Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) as a security measurement.</p>
<p>So far, the team has raised $2.8 million, and 12,500 users have signed up. The team predicts that they will be able to raise $20 million and that they can onboard 100,000 users during the first three months of operation. According to Google Bard, due to all of these aspects, Tradecurve can climb to $1.8 by the end of Q4 2023.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Web3, with its vision of a digital world where individuals have control over their data and enjoy secure online transactions, holds great promise for the future. However, this vision is currently undermined by the prevalence of hacks and breaches that continue to plague the Web3 ecosystem. In 2022 alone, over 450 security breaches resulted in the theft of a staggering $4 billion USD in cryptocurrency, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced security measures.</p>
<p>Decentralized applications (DApps), including those utilizing traditional multisig wallets, face a myriad of vulnerabilities that malicious actors exploit. These vulnerabilities range from coding errors in smart contracts to compromised decentralized storage systems and targeted attacks on individual users through phishing and social engineering tactics. The repercussions of such attacks can be devastating, both for the affected individuals and for the broader adoption of Web3 technologies.</p>
<p>"To effectively address these concerns, security must be prioritized from the start," emphasized Junming Tan, Crypto Incident Response Investigator APAC at Chainalysis Inc. To protect their digital assets and identities, Web3 users are advised to utilize hardware wallets, enable two-factor authentication, and stay vigilant against phishing attempts. Martinet Lee, Head of Developer Relations at Quantstamp, emphasized the significance of verifying application authenticity and staying informed about potential threats.</p>
<p>Following industry standards can ensure higher security in Web3 projects. Tu Phan, Founder and CEO of Desig Labs, highlighted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;To keep users from harm in Web3, projects need to proactively prioritize security measures such as multi-factor authentication, encryption, and secure key management in the battle against hacks and exploits. Desig, for example, employs innovative techniques that eliminate the need for passphrases and leverages zero-knowledge technology to protect private keys from phishing attempts and key recreation by attackers.&rdquo;</p>

<p></p>
<p>However, addressing security challenges in Web3 requires more than just individual efforts. The establishment of regulatory frameworks and standards that cover secure development practices, data protection, privacy standards, and auditing requirements is paramount. Collaboration between regulatory bodies, industry experts, and technologists is essential to striking a balance between innovation and security. Open-source initiatives within the Web3 space, including decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), encourage community collaboration to enhance security practices and foster a more secure ecosystem.</p>
<p>Bug bounty programs and responsible disclosure programs play a crucial role in the Web3 security landscape. These initiatives incentivize ethical hackers to identify vulnerabilities, allowing developers to proactively address them. Responsible disclosure programs provide a platform for reporting vulnerabilities, ensuring timely mitigation, and reducing the window of opportunity for potential exploits.</p>
<p>Fortunately, emerging trends and technologies offer promising avenues for improved security in Web3 applications. Zero-knowledge proofs, for instance, enable private transactions and verifiable computations, bolstering privacy and security. Advancements in decentralized identity systems and blockchain interoperability contribute to stronger security measures. Projects like Desig Protocol are leveraging these novel technologies early on, aiming to provide a safe and secure environment for Web3 users, enabling them to explore and enjoy the space with confidence.</p>
<p>In their workshop session during the event, Tu Phan, Founder and CEO of Desig Labs, demonstrated how users can leverage Desig to enhance security, manage team finance, DAO or gaming guild operations, and explore any Web3 DApp on any chain with a single Desig wallet. The beta version of Desig will be officially launched in June, followed by activation campaigns with multiple prominent and emerging Layer 1s. Details will be released on their Twitter page.</p>
<p>By addressing security concerns head-on, both developers and users can contribute to creating a safer Web3 ecosystem. This approach will unlock the full potential of decentralization and the enhanced security offered by Web3, paving the way for a brighter and more secure digital future. With collaborative efforts, robust security measures, and the integration of cutting-edge technologies, we can build a Web3 ecosystem that ensures the protection of user data and facilitates secure online transactions.</p>
