										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/zksync-era-proof-boojum/">zkSync Era Announces New Proof System Boojum</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> layer-2 zkSync Era has released a new high-performance proof system called Boojum for radical decentralization. zkSync took to Twitter to announce the proof system on the 17th of July, noting that it is an upgrade that will cause zkSync to change to a proof system backed by STARK. In addition, the newly-launched system will offer upgraded performance as it runs on consumer-grade hardware.</p>
<h2>zkSync Era Unveils Boojum Upgrade</h2>
<p>zkSync is committed to building a secure, permissionless, and affordable blockchain network that will advance personal freedom universally. The Alpha version of zkSync Era went live in March with a SNARK-based system, and the network has had significant activity. The total value locked is $577 million in addition to 23,750,000 transactions over the past 30 days. Also, 9,735 source-code-verified smart contracts are on record. The Boojum upgrade will not cause disruptions as zkSync is designed to allow cryptographic upgrades without regenesis. In other words, users and developers are assured of no disturbance as the network deploys cryptographic upgrades. After working backstage on a cryptographic upgrade, zkSync is now transitioning to Boojum.</p>
<p>“Boojum is the name of our Rust-based cryptographic library, which we use to implement the upgraded version of the ZK circuits for zkSync Era and the ZK Stack. The name Boojum was inspired by Lewis Carroll&#8217;s poem &#8220;The Hunting of the Snark&#8221;, where the Boojum represents the most fearsome kind of Snark.”</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://zksync.mirror.xyz/HJ2Pj45EJkRdt5Pau-ZXwkV2ctPx8qFL19STM5jdYhc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">official announcement</a>, zkSync highlighted the properties attributed to Boojum, which includes PLONK-style arithmetization. This is the process that converts general computation into mathematical forms. As such, the ZK circuits “are simpler to write relative to some alternative formalisms, making the system easier to develop, audit, maintain, and upgrade”.</p>
<h2>More on the Upgrade</h2>
<p>Speaking further about Boojum, zkSync also referred to the FRI commitment scheme, which is a major component that contributes to the network’s efficiency. In addition, the ‘efficiency of “boring” parts of the system’. According to zkSync, it offers parallelized witness generation with Boojum. There is also an efficient development process if users change the circuit structure and pick different types of gates. Users can include their custom gate types in various fashions.</p>
<p>Basically, Boojum leveraged foundation papers on STARK, FRI, and DEEP-FRI to provide its two major selling points. They are world-class performance and the ability to reduce hardware requirements for decentralization.</p>
<p>The zkSync team has been developing Boojum for months, beginning with the designing stage. After then, the team moved to the testing stage, after which it shifted to Prime Time. zkSync assured that it will further audit and ensure the network&#8217;s security ahead of the full deployment of Boojum.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/jpmorgan-bitcoin-miners-halving/">JPMorgan Shows Hurdles Ahead for Bitcoin Miners as Halving Is Getting Closer</a></p>
<p>As the next <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) halving event approaches, analysts at American investment banking giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/jpmorgan-chase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co</a> (NYSE: JPM), led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, recently highlighted its challenges for miners.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/07/17/next-bitcoin-halving-event-could-be-a-stress-test-for-miners-jpmorgan/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>, the analysts noted that the hashrate for Bitcoin has recently reached new all-time highs. This surge in hashrate signifies the escalating competition among miners as they gear up for the next halving event <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-halving-2024-1-year-away/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected</a> in the second quarter of 2024.</p>
<h2>Challenges for Bitcoin Miners</h2>
<p>The report points out that the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/bitcoin-halving-2024-what-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">event</a> will decrease the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This reduction will directly impact miners’ revenues, as they will earn fewer Bitcoin for their mining efforts. Consequently, miners will face a decline in their income, which raises concerns about the profitability and sustainability of mining operations.</p>
<p>Additionally, the report highlights that the reduction in issuance rewards effectively increases Bitcoin&#8217;s production cost. This is because, miners must cover their operational expenses, such as equipment, electricity, and maintenance, with a smaller number of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the analysts emphasized that miners with lower electricity costs are expected to have an easier time sustaining their operations, while those with higher power costs may face challenges after the halving event is over.</p>
<p>Specifically, JPMorgan estimates that a 1% per kilowatt hour (kWh) change in electricity cost can lead to a $4,300 change in the production cost of Bitcoin. After the halving, this sensitivity is expected to double to $8,600, thus increasing the vulnerability of higher-cost miners.</p>
<p>The bank also highlights the rising competition among Bitcoin miners, reflected in the steep rise in the hashrate. The hashrate represents the total computational power dedicated to mining Bitcoin, and its increase indicates intensified competition within the mining industry.</p>
<p>As miners anticipate the halving event, more mining rigs are being deployed to capture a larger share of the diminishing block rewards. This influx of computational power contributes to the overall hashrate growth.</p>
<h2>Hashrate Post-halving Event</h2>
<p>The report highlights that the rapid growth in the Bitcoin hashrate is unlikely to continue at the same pace after the halving event. The analysts emphasized that without a sustained rise in the Bitcoin price above its production cost or a significant increase in transaction fees, the growth in the hashrate may be offset by the reduction in issuance rewards.</p>
<p>The potential slowdown in hashrate growth post-halving has implications for the mining ecosystem. If the Bitcoin price does not rise sufficiently or transaction fees do not increase significantly, miners may face profitability challenges. This scenario could lead to some miners exiting the market, particularly those with higher production costs or less efficient operations as we saw with <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/core-scientific-bankruptcy-mining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">series of bankruptcies</a> last year</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the relationship between hashrate, Bitcoin price, and transaction fees is dynamic and susceptible to change. A persistent rise in the Bitcoin price or a considerable increase in transaction fees may encourage miners to continue investing in processing power, hence promoting hashrate growth.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/elon-musk-twitter-negative-cash-flow/">Elon Musk Confirms Twitter&#8217;s Negative Cash Flow amidst 50% Plunge in Ad Revenue</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a>, the CEO of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla</a> and SpaceX, who also holds the position of CTO at Twitter, recently revealed the social media platform&#8217;s ongoing negative cash flow and the weight of its debt burden. Musk cited a 50% drop in advertising revenue and a significant debt burden as the reasons behind Twitter&#8217;s ongoing cash flow challenges.</p>
<p>Responding to a tweet about potential recapitalization options, the billionaire entrepreneur emphasized the need for Twitter to achieve positive cash flow before pursuing other endeavors. He further revealed that the popular social media platform he acquired for $44 billion did not witness the expected increase in advertising revenue in June but expressed some optimism for July.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re still negative cash flow, due to ~50% drop in advertising revenue plus heavy debt load. Need to reach positive cash flow before we have the luxury of anything else.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1680082007873953794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Musk also said that July showed more promise in advertising revenue while acknowledging that Twitter Spaces and the audio chat feature are currently generating costs without bringing revenue to the company.</p>
<p>The new development highlights the ongoing struggle to achieve positive cash flow at <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/twitter/">Twitter</a>, despite aggressive cost-cutting measures implemented since Musk&#8217;s acquisition of the company in October.</p>
<h2>Twitter Faces Annual Interest Payments of $1.5 Billion</h2>
<p>Since taking over Twitter, the Tesla CEO has implemented significant changes, including staff reductions and adjustments to content moderation policies. The billionaire wasted no time implementing a substantial <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/twitter-employees-new-round-layoffs/">workforce reduction</a>, cutting 75% of Twitter&#8217;s global employees following the deal&#8217;s completion.</p>
<p>The move aimed to streamline operations and reduce costs. In addition to the workforce reduction, Musk revealed that Twitter has successfully slashed its projected non-debt expenditures from $4.5 billion to $1.5 billion for 2023. Moreover, the acquisition deal came with a substantial debt burden for Twitter. Due to the debt, the platform now faces annual interest payments of approximately $1.5 billion, adding further strain to its financial situation.</p>
<p>A New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/22/technology/elon-musk-twitter-cost-cutting.html">report</a> also disclosed that Musk failed to settle hundreds of thousands of dollars in outstanding bills owed to travel vendors. The company&#8217;s executives accumulated these expenses before the official acquisition in 2022.</p>
<p>Despite the cost-cutting measures and workforce restructuring, Twitter continues to grapple with negative cash flow. The social media platform has faced challenges with advertisers reducing or halting their ad spending due to concerns relating to content moderation and uncertainty about Twitter&#8217;s future.</p>
<h2>Elon Musk Anticipates Twitter to Become Cash Flow Positive</h2>
<p>Insufficient earnings on Twitter suggest that the platform&#8217;s advertising revenue may not have rebounded as quickly as previously anticipated. In an interview with the BBC in April, Musk indicated that most advertisers had returned to the platform, and he expected Twitter to become cash flow positive within the second quarter.</p>
<p>To address the issues of poor advertising revenue and other financial challenges at Twitter, Musk appointed <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/linda-yaccarino/">Linda Yaccarino,</a> a former NBCUniversal marketing executive, as Twitter&#8217;s new CEO. Yaccarino&#8217;s background in advertising is expected to prioritize the revitalization of Twitter&#8217;s ad business.</p>
<p>As such, the new CEO has outlined plans to focus on video, creator, and commerce partnerships and has engaged in early discussions with various entities, including political and entertainment figures, payments services, and news and media publishers.</p>
<p>Last week, Twitter announced a revenue-sharing program for selected content creators. However, some users expressed disappointment at the program&#8217;s limited scope, which is currently only available to Twitter Blue verified subscribers who meet certain criteria.</p>
<p>The program distributes a portion of the ad revenue generated from ads placed in replies to tweets. Several influencers and creators, including controversial figures like Andrew Tate, have revealed that they received payments through this program.</p>

<p>Treasury Yields are falling further due to general uncertainty in the market regarding interest rates and monetary policies.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/treasury-yields-decline-us-global-economy/">Treasury Yields Decline as Investors Remain Cautious about US and Global Economy</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/treasury-yields-decline-us-global-economy/">Treasury Yields Decline as Investors Remain Cautious about US and Global Economy</a></p>
<p>Treasury yields in the US have fallen on Monday following cautious sentiments from investors about the state of the economy. The decline in US Treasury Yields suggests investors are worried about monetary policy as they anticipate official economic data.</p>
<p>The 10-year Treasury Yield, as of 5:40 am ET was at 3.787%, lower by 3 basis points. As of press time, the yield has fallen further to 3.775. A similar plunge was recorded in the 2-year Treasury, which was lower by 2 basis points at 4.725%</p>
<p>Last week, official data showed that the consumer price index rose by 0.2% compared to the month before, and was the lowest rise since March 2021. Figures from the consumer price index and other key economic data would likely sway the Fed’s decision on monetary policy in one way or the other.</p>
<p>Rising prices and inflation have caused the Fed to consistently increase interest rates. Over the last 11 meetings, the Fed has increased the interest rate 10 times. Now, projections have it that the <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/treasury-yields-fall-further-after-cooling-inflation-data-639e2360?mod=rates-market-data" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">probability</a> the Fed will increase interest rates again is 92.4%. The market projection puts the rate at 5.25%-5.5%, with the Fed likely increasing the rate on July 26.</p>
<h2>China’s Influence</h2>
<p>Several global factors may also be preventing the Treasury Yields from rising. The state of the global economy is in question for many reasons, including data from China. Although the Chinese economy climbed 6.3% year-over-year (YoY) in Q2, the climb was lower than the expected 7.1%. <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/jpmorgan-chase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JPMorgan</a> also reduced its growth expectation for China to 5% from 5.5%, after cutting the country’s growth from 5.9% earlier. According to JPMorgan economists, instability in the housing market is a serious factor. They said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Since 2Q, housing market weakness has intensified in both demand (related to weak income expectations and weak house price expectations) and supply (weak incentive for private developers to buy new land and start new projects) sides. This points at a major challenge for policymakers of how to balance the long-term goal of economic transformation and near-term objective of growth stabilization.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Last month, several other Wall Street banks <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/goldman-sachs-growth-outlook-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cut their outlook</a> on growth in China. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Standard Chartered, UBS, and Nomura, all posted reduced forecasts for the country’s growth.</p>
<h2>Treasury Yields Have Been Fluctuating</h2>
<p>As most of the world battles inflation and dwindling economies, the US has been no different as Treasury Yields have been wavering. Last month, CoinSpeaker <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/treasury-yields-interest-rate-hike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that the 2-year Treasury Yield lost 4 basis points to 4.656%, lower than it now is. The same report also put the 10-year Treasury yield at 3.808%.</p>
<p>In the previous month, negotiations regarding the US debt ceiling significantly <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-treasury-yields-congress-debt-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">affected</a> the 10-year and 2-year Treasury yields. At one time, the 10-year yield fell by 10 basis points to 3.719%, while the 2-year yield lost 7 basis points and hit 4.514%</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/fsb-regulatory-framework-crypto/">FSB Finalizes Global Regulatory Framework for Crypto</a></p>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international body that oversees and advises on the global financial system, has come up with the final version of the global regulatory framework for crypto-asset activities. Basically, the <a href="https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P170723-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">document</a> released by FSB consists of recommendations for companies involved in crypto activity, and these recommendations are divided into two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>high-level recommendations for the regulation, supervision and oversight of crypto-asset activities and markets;</li>
<li>revised high-level recommendations for the regulation, supervision, and oversight of “global stablecoin” arrangements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The aim of FSB was to provide a regulatory framework that would comply with the principle of &#8220;same activity, same risk, same regulation&#8221; and cover all possible risks related to crypto activity. According to FSB, crypto-asset activities must be regulated based on their economic functions and the risks they pose.</p>
<p>In addition to recommendations, FSB has collaborated with sectoral standard-setting bodies (SSBs) and come up with a work plan to mitigate various risks that cryptos might pose. Those include AML/CFT, data privacy, cyber security, consumer and investor protection, market integrity, competition policy, and more.</p>
<p>FSB commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Final recommendations incorporate learnings from events of the past year in crypto-asset markets and feedback received during the FSB’s public consultation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<div title="Page 10">
<div>
<div>
<p>Next, in September, the FSB and the IMF will deliver a joint report to the G20 that will synthesise the policy findings from work of the Funf on macroeconomic and monetary issues. Further, by the end of 2025, the FSB will review the status of the implementation of the recommendations at the jurisdictional level. In partnership with the IMF and the World Bank, the FSB will oversee applying the proposed standards in daily practice.</p>
<p>Aspects, where the work has already started, include multifunction crypto-asset intermediaries, banks’ stablecoin exposures and related activities, and tokenization.</p>
<h2>Need for Proper Risk Management</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>How did FSB develop the crypto regulatory framework? At the beginning of 2022, the crypto market was turmoiled by a chain of events that led to a sharp decrease in crypto assets. The collapse of Terra (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/terra/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LUNA</a>), the third largest cryptocurrency ecosystem after Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) and Ethereum (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH</a>) at that time, the bankruptcy of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ieo/platform/ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX exchange</a>, the crash of the crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), the banking crisis, and the global economic decline showed the need to predict and protect against the risks caused by high volatility of crypto-asset markets.</p>
<p>However, the approach to regulating crypto markets is different in the US, Europe, and Asia. Different jurisdictions have different views on what should be done with digital assets. In the case of the FSB, the framework provided calls for stricter regulation, but it does not cover all aspects of crypto-related activity. It does not include stablecoins and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Central Bank Digital Currencies</a> (CBDCs), which are also important and popular tools offered by the industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/nab-payments-crypto-exchanges/">NAB Blocks Payments to High-Risk Crypto Exchanges to Curb Scam Losses</a></p>

<p>National Australia Bank (NAB) will begin blocking payments to high-risk crypto exchanges in an effort to curb scam losses. NAB <a href="https://news.nab.com.au/news/scam-strategy-update/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> the ban on Monday. It noted that it was taking action to protect its customers from the risks associated with cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2>NAB’s Move Is Part of a Wider Trend</h2>
<p>According to the NAB, it has stopped over $270 million worth of customer payments between March and July using payment prompts. Insights from the NAB app show 12% of payments were abandoned when customers received a real-time payment prompt in the app.</p>
<p>Again, recent data from the Australian Financial Crimes Exchange showed that 50% of reported scam funds had cryptocurrency linkage. With over $1.5 billion lost to investment scams by Australians in 2022 and about $221 million of that to crypto scams the threat posed by scam losses is great.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Westpac and the Commonwealth Bank reportedly halted payments to Binance. ANZ also noted that it would start preventing payment to particular high-risk crypto trading platforms. Thus, the move to block payment to crypto exchanges is the latest in a series of measures by Australian banks to restrict cryptocurrency transactions.</p>
<h2>Ban to Affect High-Risk Crypto Exchanges</h2>
<p>While the ban is expected to affect Binance, NAB did not identify any specific cryptocurrency exchanges, noting its approach will be “consistent with the industry”. However, the bank stated that it will affect “high-risk” platforms with more scam events.</p>
<p>According to NAB executive for group investigations and fraud Chris Sheehan, they have observed many scammers using cryptocurrency platforms to quickly launder stolen funds. “We want to make it as hard as possible for these criminals and reduce the impact on our customers,” he said.</p>
<h2>Multiplied Woes</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, a ban that affects Binance’s operations will only increase its woes in Australia. The Australian Securities and Investment Commission canceled its local derivatives license in April. Later in May, Binance lost its local banking partner Cuscal. The Australian regulator has also <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-australia-offices-raided/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly</a> begun a probe into Binance&#8217;s operations in the country.</p>
<p>And it isn’t just Australia. Binance has come under fire in many of its operational jurisdictions in recent times. In the US, The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/cftc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CFTC</a>) and the SEC have accused Binance of operating without proper license and improper handling of customer funds. In the Netherlands, the exchange was forced to withdraw after failing to secure a license. The company is also facing accusations of illegal operations in France.</p>
<p>Despite the regulatory assaults, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has reiterated the company’s commitment to regulation. He <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/from-cz/binance-turns-6-8188278446020229815" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> that they &#8220;are not just open but eager to collaborate with policymakers to shape the future of digital assets&#8221;.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-internal-email-layoff/">Alleged Binance Internal Email Suggests Recent Layoff Is Due to Decline in Profit</a></p>
<p>The recent layoff at Binance affected more than 1,000 employees, which has sparked the interest of many in the crypto community. This downsizing comes at a time when reports indicate that some senior executives have left the company following Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao’s response to the US Department of Justice.</p>
<p>The regulatory issues <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> is facing also suggest it could be going through a difficult time. One of the latest reports around Binance’s case with the SEC is that Eeon, an entity representing Binance customers, seeks compensation from the exchange and the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>. Eeon claims that Binance customers’ interests have not been adequately protected by the crypto company and the regulators’ legal representatives. The entity wants compensation of 20% daily from the value of funds received from each customer, which amounts to $1,000 daily.</p>
<p>Adam Cochran, founder of Cinneamhain Ventures, shared a series of tweets on <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> showing that there was an internal email that revealed more about the layoffs. According to his posts, Binance is laying off workers mainly for cost-cutting measures. This information goes against the claim of Binance’s CEO that the company’s reason for downsizing is only a bid to get suitable talent.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/10</p>
<p>Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@cz_binance</a> if your layoffs weren&#39;t about cost cutting, why on June 19th did you announce on WEA that you suddenly cut extended benefits for all employees, &amp; *tell them* it was because of &quot;a decline in profit&quot;?</p>
<p>Not exactly trust building to lie about this&#8230; <a href="https://t.co/2MvP1ZPKEG">pic.twitter.com/2MvP1ZPKEG</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1680648344471842817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 16, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Adam challenged the company about why it is claiming the layoff is not about cost-cutting when, on June 19, the company announced that it needed to cut its workers’ extended benefits due to a profit decline caused by the present industry environment and regulatory issues. Binance also noted in the email that it would take other actions in the future in a bid to cut costs, and the reduction in the number of workers looks like another move in that direction.</p>
<h2>Binance CEO Denies Reports Spreading Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt in the Crypto Industry</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/changpeng-zhao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Changpeng Zhao</a> insists such reports are FUD, aiming to create fear, uncertainty, and doubt in the crypto industry. He claimed that the reported scale of the layoff at Binance was exaggerated. Furthermore, Zhao emphasized that the company is actively hiring, contrary to the perception that the layoffs are solely due to profit decline. The CEO insists that the company is rather looking for individuals who are a better fit for the company. He <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1679951762906595330" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As we continuously strive to increase talent density, there are involuntary terminations. This happens in every company. The numbers reported by media are all way off. 4 FUD. On the bright side, they just can’t resist talking about us. We are still hiring.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding the resignation of senior executives, the CEO mentioned that the reports about why the executives left are also wrong, and they are only spreading fear, doubt, and uncertainty in the crypto community.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/unstoppable-domains-ethereum-eth/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/unstoppable-domains-ethereum-eth/">Unstoppable Domains Partners with Ethereum Name Service, Adds .eth Domains</a></p>
<p>In the latest development, the digital identity platform Unstoppable Domains added support for Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains, in order to expand their offerings of Web3 decentralized domains.</p>
<p>In the Web3 domains space, Unstoppable Domains and Ethereum Name Service have been the two biggest service providers in the market. These players allow users to create human-readable domain names along with other crypto wallet addresses. Furthermore, decentralized domains act as a profile across the Web3 ecosystem while unlocking a host of different functionalities.</p>
<p>The introduction of .eth domain endings allows individuals to store their digital identity on the Ethereum blockchain. For e.g. .eth domains, allows users to replace their long wallet address (such as 0x74Fe1103d28fb79F4d83800003983390Dfc61234) with a shorter, easier-to-remember name like &#8220;me.eth&#8221;. With Unstoppable Domains, users will also be able to manage .nft or .x domains, all from a single place.</p>
<h2>Here&#8217;s What Unstoppable Domains Users Can Do</h2>
<p>Now, users have the option to purchase .eth names through Unstoppable, offering additional payment methods and functionality to simplify the management of ENS domains. When users buy .eth domains from Unstoppable, they undergo registrations through the ENS smart contract and provide the same features as domains registered directly through ENS.</p>
<p>Unstoppable also allows users to purchase .eth domains without connecting them to an existing Ether wallet. This is possible through Unstoppable Vault, a noncustodial service that enables users to secure Web3 domains even if they don&#8217;t have a cryptocurrency wallet initially.</p>
<p>To make things even more convenient, Unstoppable offers an auto-renewal mechanism for ENS users. This eliminates the need to manually renew .eth domains on the blockchain and minimizes the risk of losing a domain.</p>
<p>The integration with Unstoppable expands the payment options for .eth users. Users can now purchase their desired Web3 domain using various payment methods, including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>, 12 different cryptocurrencies, as well as conventional fiat options like credit cards, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayPal</a>, Google Pay, and Apple Pay.</p>
<p>With a combined total of 6.3 million registered domains, Unstoppable Domains and ENS are at the forefront of digital identity preservation. Matt Gould, the CEO and Co-Founder of Unstoppable Domains, emphasized the importance of simplifying the process of purchasing .eth domains to attract users who may not be familiar with Web3 technology. Speaking to CoinDesk, he <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/web3/2023/07/17/unstoppable-adds-support-for-ens-domains/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“People want to have a one place to manage all their Web3 domains across all different platforms. They don&#8217;t want to have to think about having to pay with a whole bunch of different types of cryptocurrency or having 1,000 different wallets they have to keep track of…that&#8217;s kind of that&#8217;s the experience that we&#8217;re leaning into.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Unstoppable Building .eth Management Tools</h2>
<p>Unstoppable is actively working on developing tools to manage .eth domains, which will offer features such as setting cryptocurrency addresses, managing on-chain profile data, and facilitating domain transfers.</p>
<p>While users who purchase .eth domains through Unstoppable can benefit from ENS integrations, it&#8217;s important to note that these domains will not be compatible with Unstoppable&#8217;s own set of approximately 800 integrations.</p>
<p>Additionally, Unstoppable provides support for various Web3 domains, including .nft, .crypto, .wallet, .dao, .bitcoin, .polygon, .BinanceUS, and .blockchain.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/aave-gho-stablecoin-ethereum-mainnet/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/aave-gho-stablecoin-ethereum-mainnet/">Aave&#8217;s GHO Stablecoin Launches on Ethereum Mainnet, Here&#8217;s All You Need to Know</a></p>
<p>Decentralized finance (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeFi</a>) protocol Aave has launched its GHO stablecoin on the Ethereum mainnet. The launch, which appears to have been well received, saw the circulating supply of the stablecoin quickly increase by $1.5 million within 24 hours of the launch. As of publication, however, over $2.19 million worth of GHO has now been minted.</p>
<p>The launch came shortly after an interesting community governance vote, which saw nearly all 424 participating addresses vote in favor of the new stablecoin.</p>
<h2>Aave to Capitalize on Transparency of Reserves</h2>
<p>According to Aave&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/AaveAave/status/1680216586047885312?t=uTNdK7_rN0SohnMMU_Nwdg&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announcement</a>, the algorithmic GHO stablecoin is pegged against the United States dollar and is backed by several digital assets. Most notably, its reserves include Ethereum’s native currency Ether (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH</a>), and Aave’s native token AAVE.</p>
<p>It might be worth mentioning that centralized stablecoins such as Tether (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/tether/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USDT</a>) continue to be subject to criticism. And most of the criticism usually borders around what appears to be a lack of transparency around its reserves.</p>
<p>However, Aave has moved to build on this key area of transparency with the GHO. To this end, the protocol highlighted that all assets backing the GHO stablecoin are fully verifiable and transparent even as on-chain data can confirm. Aave wrote in part:</p>
<blockquote><p>“All data regarding GHO transactions is available and auditable directly from the blockchain or via numerous user interfaces.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>GHO Stablecoin Adds to the Growing Ranks of Algorithmic Stablecoins</h2>
<p>From all indications, it may appear that DeFi-native algorithmic stablecoins are gradually growing through the ranks.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, MakerDAO&#8217;s DAI is arguably the first and foremost choice among algorithmic stablecoins at the moment. As of press time, the Ethereum-based stablecoin has a $4.28 billion market capitalization, per DefiLlama <a href="https://defillama.com/stablecoins">data</a>.</p>
<p>Also, there are other prominent algorithmic stablecoins including Frax, Ampleforth, and the rest. But the more recent addition was when DeFi protocol Curve also launched its flagship algorithmic stablecoin crvUSD in May.</p>
<p>Despite this growing trend, however, it should be noted that the general stablecoin market remains dominated by centralized issuers. That is Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC). The duo alone accounts for at least 87% of the total circulating supply of all US dollar-pegged stablecoins.</p>
<p>With Aave&#8217;s GHO, however, algorithmic stablecoins are also gradually coming up.  At the time of publication, GHO is trading slightly below the desired $1 peg at $0.9898. Although it fell lower to $0.9814 earlier on July 16, according to CoinMarketCap <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gho/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">data</a>.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-first-cybertruck-2023/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-first-cybertruck-2023/">Tesla Builds First Cybertruck after Years of Delay, Schedules Mass Production for End of 2023</a></p>
<p>First introduced in 2019, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla Inc</a> (NASDAQ: TSLA) has finally announced the building of its Cybertruck ahead of its Q2 2023 earnings call. The EV maker revealed the first Cybertruck built at Giga, Texas, during the weekend. When CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a> unveiled the Cybertruck at the Tesla Design Center in California in November 2019, the company noted that it would be in three variants. It also scheduled the production and delivery for 2021.</p>
<p>However, Tesla could not deliver the Cybertruck as planned and set a new production schedule for <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-cybertruck-production-2023/">summer 2023</a>. The CEO noted that the long-awaited Cybertruck could be the best product ever by Tesla when it becomes available before the end of 2023. Also, the company’s executives mentioned the incoming vehicle during the last earnings call. The executives said during the Q1 2023 earnings report that the team will organize a delivery event for the Cybertruck towards the end of the year.</p>
<h2>Tesla Builds First Cybertruck in 2023</h2>
<p>According to Tesla, the delay in the Cybertruck production was due to standard supply chain issues. In contrast to the company’s statement, leaked documents revealed some flaws in the vehicle’s basic design and engineering. A whistleblower revealed in January 2022 that the Cybertruck had challenges with structures, sealing, braking, and more. Despite the dark revelations, there were more than 1.5 million reservations for the vehicle as of November 2022.</p>
<p>With such a pace, there are probably more people interested in the Tesla Cybertruck this year, and more could show interest before the end of 2023. Notably, the company recorded over 250,000 reservations within a week of unveiling the vehicle. Tesla has allowed customers to deposit a nonrefundable $100 fee to pro-order since 2019.</p>
<p>In May, Musk told shareholders at the 2023 annual meeting that Tesla could deliver between 250,000 and 500,000 units yearly as soon as the production of the Cybertruck begins. While Kelley Blue Book stated that the Cybertruck would price from $50,000 for the single motor and rear-wheel drive model, Tesla may change the prices before the end of the year. On the other hand, the all-wheel drive version, with a towing capacity of over 10,000 pounds and more than 300 miles of range, could cost about $60,000. The most expensive variant of the Tesla Cybertruck will have three electric motors and all-wheel drive, a towing capacity of 14,000 pounds, and a battery range of over 500 miles. This will cost around $70,000.</p>
<p>Following the mass production of the Tesla Cybertruck before the end of 2023, it will have to compete with other electric pickups in the market. <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ford/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ford</a>’s F-150 Lightning has been making waves in the market, costing about $60,000.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/fintech-raisin-e50b-deposits/" rel="prev">next</a></p>
