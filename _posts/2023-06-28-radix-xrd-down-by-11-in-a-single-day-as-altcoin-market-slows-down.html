With decentralized finance (DeFi) gaining more traction, Radix (XRD) is touted to be one of the pioneers of this technological shift. It is a blockchain platform that enables the development of innovative DeFi applications. XRD, Radix’s native token, is one of the worst performers in the market today, recording an 11% loss in the past 24 hours. However, it is worth noting that the general altcoin market is in red today, as most assets are currently in a slight decline.  Radix Experiences Recorrection Following Recent Price Rally The price performance of Radix has been largely positive in 2023. In April, the XRD token reached its yearly peak &#8211; so far &#8211; at $0.139530. However, the cryptocurrency is currently on a 45% price decline, resulting from its slump in April and May.

According to crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen, this demonstrates that altcoins (collectively) offer more risk than reward when compared to Bitcoin.
