<ul><li>The United States SEC has signaled that it will appeal the recent ruling in the lawsuit against Ripple.</li><li>The securities regulator’s latest comments were part of a filing in the lawsuit against Do Kwon and Terraform Labs.&nbsp;</li><li>Do Kwon recently cited the Ripple ruling to support his motion to dismiss the SEC’s lawsuit against him.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has signaled that it may appeal the landmark ruling in its lawsuit against Ripple, which handed the crypto firm a major victory and set a precedent surrounding the security status of cryptocurrencies. The securities regulator’s intent to appeal came to light in its latest filing in a separate lawsuit against Do Kwon and his defunct Terraform Labs.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>SEC: Ripple Ruling Adds Baseless Requirements To Howey Test</strong></h2>



<p>The summary judgment motion by Federal Judge Analisa Torres last week identified XRP’s institutional sales as securities offerings. However, the judge ruled that retail or programmatic sales of XRP did not constitute an investment contract. This ruling was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/terra-do-kwon-ripple-ruling-dismiss-sec/">cited</a> by  lawyers representing Terraform Labs’ disgraced founder Do Kwon in the motion to dismiss the SEC’s lawsuit against him and his firm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-21/sec-signals-appeal-to-crypto-ripple-ruling-in-terra-response#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the SEC urged the judge overseeing its lawsuit against Kwon and Terraform Labs to not consider the Ripple ruling as a legal precedent. The securities regulator argued that Judge Torres’ stance on XRP’s programmatic sales created “an artificial distinction between the expectations of sophisticated institutional and retail investors. The regulator added that the Ripple ruling added “baseless requirements” to the decades-old Howey Test, which is used to determine if an asset qualifies as a security.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Institutional buyers in this case, such as trading firms that purchased Defendants’ crypto assets with no restrictions on resale, purchased because they viewed the assets as an investment opportunity into Terraform’s efforts.” </p><cite>SEC’s filing in the lawsuit against Do Kwon</cite></blockquote>



<p>The SEC asked the judge hearing Do Kwon’s case to reject the components of the Ripple ruling about XRP’s non-security status for retail sales and added that it was considering appealing the controversial ruling by Judge Torres. Interestingly, the securities regulator encouraged the Terraform judge to consider Judge Torres’ stance on institutional sales of XRP, which were deemed securities.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Binance France reported a loss of €4 million in the financial statements for 2022.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange’s French arm currently holds €1bn in crypto assets on behalf of its clients.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange started recording expenses eight months before revenue, which led to the multi-million euro loss.&nbsp;</li><li>Binance France expects to be profitable by the end of this year.</li></ul>



<p>Binance France has reported a loss of €4 million for the year 2022. The French arm of the world’s largest crypto exchange recently, which was established in November 2021, released the audited financial reports for last year. The crypto exchange’s financial statements were audited by Paris-based accounting and audit firm RSM France.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance France Holds €1 Billion On Behalf Of Clients</strong></h2>



<p>According to the audited <a href="https://www.binance.com/fr/blog/ecosystem/binance-france-publishes-2022-accounts--what-do-they-say-and-faq-7753651850896626460" rel="nofollow noopener">financial reports</a> released by Binance France earlier today, the exchange held €1 billion worth of crypto assets on behalf of its users residing in the country. Apart from that, the exchange also holds 7 million USDT in its own account. The majority of the French crypto exchange’s income came from trading fees charged from users on the platform. </p>



<p>The crypto exchange stated in its report that the reason for the €4 million loss was a mismatch in the dates that they started recording expenses and revenues. The accounts reportedly covered 14 months of expenses but only six months of revenue. The delay in receiving revenue was attributed to the lack of regulatory approval from France’s top market regulator, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers’ (AMF).&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cut-employee-benefits-low-profits/">Binance</a> France started operating as a crypto exchange only after registering as a virtual asset service provider (VASP) with the AMF in May last year, followed by another two months of formalities to onboard the French users. However, the exchange had started incurring expenses as early as November 2021, which led to 14 months of expenses being recorded in the financial statements. </p>



<p>If not for the mismatch, Binance stated that its French unit would be profitable in 2022. The exchange clarified that the international platform was profitable and that the French unit would also turn profitable in 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fentanyl precursor merchants in China are utilizing centralized crypto exchanges in Russia and Australia to accept digital payments in a bid to evade sanctions, a report from blockchain analytics shop <a href="http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.elliptic.co/hubfs/Elliptic_Report_Crypto%20and%20the%20Global%20Fentanyl%20Trade.pdf" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.elliptic.co/hubfs/Elliptic_Report_Crypto%20and%20the%20Global%20Fentanyl%20Trade.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Elliptic</a> said. </p>



<p>The study identified two crypto exchanges &#8211; U.S.-sanctioned Russian platform Garantex and an unnamed Australian exchange &#8211; that have served as payment gateways for merchants in China offering precursor chemicals and pill presses required to produce Fentanyl. The</p>



<p>Elliptics study on crypto&#8217;s use in the fentanyl supply chain comes at a time when the deadly synthetic opioid is causing massive public health issues in the United States, Europe, and the world at large.</p>



<p>Despite China&#8217;s fentanyl export restrictions, the study revealed that savvy operators have found ways to smuggle precursor chemicals overseas. Tactics include using disguised packaging, such as dog food or car wash detergent, and leveraging established carriers who may not frequently verify package contents.</p>



<h2>Crypto Exchanges Funnel $50 Billion In Street-Valued Fentanyl Ingredients</h2>



<p>According to the report, transactions to Bitcoin addresses, and USDT addresses on Tron and Ethereum blockchains were identified. In total, these addresses received $32 million in crypto for fentanyl precursor chemicals. </p>



<p>Elliptic estimates that if all these funds were used to buy fentanyl products, the goods could produce as much as $50 billion in drug proceeds factoring in street value. </p>



<p>The report was released amid a global crackdown on questionable crypto exchanges suspected to be money laundering intermediaries. In January, U.S. authorities <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariagraciasantillanalinares/2023/01/18/justice-department-shuts-down-700-million-russian-crypto-exchange/?sh=72806ed427c7" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariagraciasantillanalinares/2023/01/18/justice-department-shuts-down-700-million-russian-crypto-exchange/?sh=72806ed427c7" rel="noreferrer noopener">sanctioned</a> and shut down an almost unknown Russian exchange called Bizlato on money laundering suspicions.

<ul><li>FTX lawyers said that founder Sam Bankman-Fried and other executives used customer cash to fund personal their lifestyles.</li><li>Bankman-Fried and members of his inner circle like Caroline Elisson, and Nishad Singh spent $1 billion funding stock buys, property purchases, and fraudulent loans.</li><li>SBF is facing criminal charges from the DOJ while Ellison and Singh agreed to plea deals in America’s largest fraud case.</li></ul>



<p>FTX Trading Ltd filed a lawsuit against founder Sam Bankman-Fried and other company executives, seeking to recover $1 billion of customer cash misused for personal benefits, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ftx-sues-bankman-fried-others-recoup-fraudulent-transfers-2023-07-20/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ftx-sues-bankman-fried-others-recoup-fraudulent-transfers-2023-07-20/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a> reported.</p>



<p>Lawyers submitted court documents on July 20 claiming that the defendants stole customer assets to fund political donations, loans to executives, and luxury apartments. The suit named former CEO Bankman-Fried, ex-Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, co-founder Gary Wang and former Lead Engineer Nishad Singh as defendants.</p>



<p>According to lawyers of the bankrupt crypto exchange, Singh received $447 million in a supposed loan from FTX and Alameda but there was no intention to repay.</p>



<p>The defendants received at least $725 million in equity for shares that were never paid for, per the filing. Lawyers also alleged that Bankman-Fried’s brother Gabriel planned to acquire the island nation of Nauru.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the beleaguered exchange sent tens of millions for real estate purchases and legal fees to SBF’s dad, Allen Joe Bankman. Separate lawsuits seek to recover $71.5 million and $700 million respectively spent by SBF for <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-71-million-recovery-sbfs-sham-ngo/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-71-million-recovery-sbfs-sham-ngo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal aggrandizement</a> prior to FTX&#8217;s collapse in November 2022.</p>



<h2>FTX Debacle Continues</h2>



<p>In other related news, the U.S. Department of Justice asked a court to ban &#8220;extrajudicial statements&#8221; made by defendants and witnesses after FTX founder Bankman-Fried reportedly leaked Caroline Ellison&#8217;s private diary to the press. </p>



<p>Ellison who led SBF&#8217;s hedge fund and FTX sister firm Alameda Research agreed to a plea deal with federal prosecutors. Singh also was also in talks with DOJ attorneys over a possible deal. </p>



<p>While bankruptcy administrators track down stolen customer cash and prosecutors levy charges against former company leadership for wrongdoing, crypto observers remain puzzled about the whereabouts of known FTX executive Sam Trabucco and his noticeable omission from court proceedings. </p>

<ul><li>A consortium of investors is in the final stages of acquiring crypto news outlet CoinDesk.&nbsp;</li><li>CoinDesk is owned by the Digital Currency Group (DCG), which is currently embroiled in a lawsuit with its creditors.&nbsp;</li><li>Coindesk has been on the market since January 2023, following instability at its parent company.&nbsp;</li><li>Crypto exchange Binance was previously looking to acquire the crypto news website for around $75 million.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>A consortium of investors is reportedly in the final stages of purchasing CoinDesk, which is one of the largest crypto news outlets in the world. Owned by Barry Silbert’s crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group (DCG), CoinDesk has been on the market since January 2023, following financial instability at its parent company.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>DCG Plans To Retain A Stake In CoinDesk Post Sale</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, the consortium of investors is led by Matthew Roszak of blockchain-focused venture capital firm Tally Capital, and Peter Vessenes from Captial6, a venture capital and private equity firm. People familiar with the matter revealed that the deal, which is valued at $125 million, is in the final stages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CoinDesk’s parent company Digital Currency Group will reportedly retain a stake in the crypto news outlet, which it bought for $500,000 in 2016. DCG’s stake would cover media, events, data, and index business. As per <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/investor-group-nears-125-million-deal-for-coindesk-146a6faa" rel="noopener">WSJ</a>, the current management is expected to be retained by CoinDesk’s new owners. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, CoinDesk hired investment bank Lazard Ltd to explore a partial or full sale. At the time, CEO Kevin Worth revealed that the company had received “numerous inbound indications of interest”. One of these was from crypto giant <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-cut-employee-benefits-low-profits/">Binance</a>, which was looking to acquire CoinDesk for about $75 million. The offer was considerably less than early estimates, which indicated that the crypto news website could fetch as much as $300 million. </p>



<p>CoinDesk went on the market right around the time when DCG’s subsidiary Genesis filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At the time, DCG was facing allegations of financial discrepancies surrounding its liability to subsidiaries like Genesis. Earlier this month, DCG and its founder Barry Silbert were sued for fraud by the Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange Gemini, adding to the company’s woes.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Binance’s investment arm has invested $10 million in DeFi lending protocol Radiant Capital.&nbsp;</li><li>Radiant Capital’s native token RDNT gained more than 10% following the multi-million dollar investment by Binance.&nbsp;</li><li>The DeFi lender plans to use the investment for technology and product development.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Binance Labs, the investment and incubation arm of the world’s largest crypto exchange, has invested $10 million in the DeFi lending protocol Radiant Capital. Radiant is a decentralized lender built atop Layer Zero Labs, a part of Binance Labs&#8217; portfolio firms. The DeFi protocol aims to connect users from different chains enabling greater access to liquidity. </p>



<h2><strong>Binance’s Funding To Help Radiant Capital’s Ethereum Mainnet Deployment</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-labs-invests-$10-million-in-radiant-to-support--its-mission-to-lead-the-next-era-of-defi-lending-1438479277678345894" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> by Binance, the $10 million raised in Radiant’s strategic funding round will foster the DeFi lender’s tech and product development, paving the way for its expansion on oracle support, dual-emissions support, and collateral expansion. The funds will also help the protocol’s deployment on the Ethereum mainnet. Radiant Capital aims to onboard the next 100 million users into decentralized finance through these developments. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Radiant Capital&#8217;s commitment to facilitating seamless cross-chain transactions for DeFi, and performance on Arbitrum and BNB Chain demonstrates its potential for driving mass adoption. We look forward to seeing Radiant&#8217;s continued growth and further contributions to the ecosystem.&#8221; </p><cite>Yi He, Co-Founder of Binance </cite></blockquote>



<p>Radiant currently supports more than 20 collateral options and plans to expand its cross-chain functionality to additional chains. Data from <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/radiant" rel="nofollow noopener">DeFiLllama</a> shows that Radiant has more than $262 million in total value locked (TVL). In the BNB ecosystem, Radiant is the second largest lending protocol, with a TVL of $73.5 million. The DeFi lender’s bridges are built on the Delta algorithm of Layer Zero, which raised $120 million in a Series B funding round in April this year. </p>



<p>News of Binance Labs&#8217; investment in Radiant led to a 10% in its native token <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/radiant-capital/" rel="nofollow noopener">RDNT</a>, which reached as high as $0.319 earlier today. At the time of writing, RDNT was trading at a 3-week high of $0.308. The token’s daily trading volume surged 331% to $79 million. </p>



<p>Binance Labs&#8217; investment in Radiant Capital comes a week after it <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-lab-invest-15-million-xterio-game/">invested</a> $15 million in web3 gaming startup Xterio. </p>

Lawyers for founder Do Kwon and his company cited the recent summary judgment by Judge Analisa Torres in the Ripple vs SEC case.</p>



<p>Their legal team, represented by Dentons, argues that the recent <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/xrp-up-exchanges-resume-trading-ripple/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/xrp-up-exchanges-resume-trading-ripple/" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruling in the case of US SEC v. Ripple Labs</a>, delivered by Judge Analisa Torres, directly impacts their motion to dismiss.</p>



<p>According to the SEC, cryptocurrencies like UST, LUNA, wLUNA, MIR, and mAssets fall under the category of securities. However, the Ripple case demonstrates the SEC&#8217;s lack of legal grounds to claim that all cryptocurrencies, except for Bitcoin, are securities. </p>



<p>The defense highlighted distinctions between programmatic sales of digital assets which are not considered securities and institutional sales which are treated as securities under investment contracts per &#8220;Torres Doctrine&#8221;. </p>



<p>Furthermore, the defense for Terra and Do Kwon asserts that the SEC did not allege any direct or secondary market sales of UST. Lawyers filed a supplemental authority citing the Ripple judgment in a bid to throw out the SEC&#8217;s case against Terra and its founder alleging fraud and securities rulebreaking. </p>



<h2>New Terra CEO, Do Kwon in Jail</h2>



<p>The motion comes at amid a shift in company leader after Terraform <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-terraform-labs-appoints-new-ceo/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-terraform-labs-appoints-new-ceo/" rel="noreferrer noopener">appointed </a>Chris Amani as CEO.

<p>If tried and convicted of breaking South Korea&#8217;s Capital Markets Act, Do Kwon could spend 40 years in prison. The U.S. Justice Department also hopes to try Kwon on criminal charges in a federal court.</p>

<p>Bankruptcy CEO John Ray and the FTX bankruptcy team filed to recover millions in customer funds redirected to Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s Latona, a Bahamas-based non-profit organization focused on supporting scientific innovation. </p>



<p>The crypto exchange and sister firm Alameda Research transferred $71.5 million to the FTX Foundation and SBF&#8217;s NGO Latona which then invested the money in life science companies like Lumen Bioscience, Genetic Networks, and GreenLight Biosciences.</p>



<p>Lawyers for the bankrupt crypto exchange <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-DocketInfo" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-DocketInfo" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">argued</a> that Latona was a sham NGO touted to serve altruistic purposes when in reality, the firm used commingled funds from Alameda and FTX accounts for &#8220;Bankman-Fried’s personal aggrandizement&#8221;. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>While purporting to make these investments for altruistic purposes Bankman-Fried in fact pursued these transactions because he believed that doing so would generate goodwill and amass political capital and influence for himself.</p></blockquote>



<h2>FTX Fund Recovery</h2>



<p>Administrators for the bankrupt crypto exchange continue to hunt down misappropriated funds from SBF&#8217;s leadership of FTX and Alameda Research. Lawyers said bankruptcy CEO John Ray and his team had <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-5-billion-recovered-in-crypto-assets/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-5-billion-recovered-in-crypto-assets/" rel="noreferrer noopener">recovered</a> $5 billion in customer crypto and funds back in January. </p>



<p>In June, FTX attorneys filed to recover an additional $700 million transferred to investment shop K5 Global in 2022. The lawsuit alleged that Bankman-Fried transferred millions to K5 Global co-founder Michael Kives and Bryan Baum after attending a party featuring high-profile attended like ex-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.</p>



<p>Entities like the New York Metropolitan Museum also plan to return funds <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/met-museum-new-york-return-ftx-donations/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/met-museum-new-york-return-ftx-donations/" rel="noreferrer noopener">donated</a> by Bankman-Fried&#8217;s companies in a bid to stem legal clawback and bad press. </p>

<ul><li>Tesla Inc.&#8217;s crypto holdings remained unchanged for the fourth consecutive quarter.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto assets on the EV giant’s balance sheet are worth $184 million as of June 30, 2023.&nbsp;</li><li>The company’s digital asset holdings were revealed in the earnings report for the second quarter of FY 2023.&nbsp;</li><li>Tesla’s last Bitcoin trade was back in Q1’2022 when it offloaded 75% of its BTC holdings.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Tesla Inc, the largest electric vehicle manufacturer in the world, has maintained the same crypto holdings for a fourth consecutive quarter. In the earnings report for the second quarter of 2023, the EV giant revealed that it held $184 million worth of digital assets on its balance sheet as of June 30, 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Tesla Stock (TSLA) Tanks 3% Ahead Of Q2 Earnings Report</strong></h2>



<p>According to the <a href="https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/TSLA-Q2-2023-Update.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">earnings report</a> released by Tesla earlier today, no crypto assets were bought or sold in the second quarter of 2023. The last sale came in the second quarter of 2022 when the EV giant sold 75% of its Bitcoin holdings for $936 million. The latest numbers indicated that the company didn’t cash in on the recent BTC rally that took its price to a 1-year high of $31,000. The company’s share price dropped nearly 3% earlier today. The stock was trading at $291 at market close. </p>



<p>Tesla’s crypto holdings have remained consistent since the last quarter of 2022. Until September 30, 2022, the carmaker held $218 million worth of digital assets on its balance sheet. The company’s first Bitcoin purchase came in early 2021 when it spent a whopping $1.5 billion on the flagship cryptocurrency. This was followed by a rally in BTC’s price after CEO Elon Musk indicated that customers could purchase his electric vehicles by paying in BTC. However, the ambitious plan was abandoned after Musk cited environmental concerns associated with BTC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tesla and Elon Musk are currently facing a class action lawsuit filed by investors of Dogecoin. The investors are accusing Musk and his EV company of manipulating the price of the meme token and netting billions at their expense. The lawsuit cited a series of crypto wallets allegedly owned by Tesla; however, the latest response by <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/elon-musk-offensive-in-dogecoin-lawsuit/">Musk</a> claimed that his EV company was not associated with the wallets listed in the complaint.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Societe Generale, the third largest bank in France, has obtained a license from the country’s top market regulator to offer crypto products and services. The regulatory approval was given to the bank’s crypto division, Societe Generale Forge (SG Forge) by the Autorité des Marchés Financiers’ (AMF), and was the first crypto license granted to a crypto entity in France.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>License Will Aid The Development of Societe Generale’s EURCV Stablecoin</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.sgforge.com/first-dasp-license-amf/" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> by SG Forge, the regulatory license approval from the AMF will allow the firm to offer services, including trading, sales, exchange, and custody of crypto assets in the country. Several mainstream crypto entities, including crypto exchange Binance, are registered with France’s top market regulator, but SG Forge is the first licensed digital asset service provider (DASP) in the country. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“With the DASP license approval, Societe Generale – FORGE confirms its pioneering role in the crypto assets ecosystem. This step will allow us to continue supporting our institutional clients wishing to benefit from services on digital assets that meet the highest standards of compliance and banking security.” </p><cite>Jean-Marc Stenger, Chief Executive Officer of Societe Generale-FORGE</cite></blockquote>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/french-investment-bank-societe-generale-withdraws-7-million-from-makerdao/">Societe Generale</a> previously registered with the AMF in September last year. As a licensed digital asset service provider, SG Forge will be required to follow local rules related to business conduct, financial disclosures, etc., in the interest of regulatory compliance and investor protection. </p>



<p>The banking giant stated that the regulatory approval would allow it to be compliant with the recently approved Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) rules, which require all crypto firms to be licensed from a European nation by 2025 to operate in the European Union. SG Forge added that the license was an important step for developing its Euro Convertible (EURCV) stablecoin, which was deployed on Ethereum in April this year.</p>
