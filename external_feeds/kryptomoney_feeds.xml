<li>Expectations remain for a comeback of bulls into the crypto market come 2023</li>
<li>HBAR token is down 1.59% in the last 24 hours at $0.038</li>
<li>Pangolin, one of the most popular DEXs on the Avalanche blockchain is launching on Hedera</li>
</ul>
<p>Expectations remain for a comeback of bulls in the crypto market come 2023, although such indications seem not yet certain. The crypto market is seeing slight selling pressure at press time, with <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/crypto-influencer-reveals-why-he-moved-from-solana-to-hedera-hbar-internet-computericp-and-algorand/">Hedera’s HBAR</a> token down 1.59% in the last 24 hours to $0.038. Pangolin, a multichain decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) on the Avalanche and Songbird Networks, has announced it will launch on Hedera. Pangolin is one of the most popular DEXs on the Avalanche blockchain, with over $16 billion in total trading volume. This year, Pangolin launched on the Songbird Network and announced plans for NEAR, Flare, and now Hedera. In other news, the Hashgraph Innovation Program, a joint initiative between the Swiss Hashgraph Association and the Swiss Digital Assets Institute (SDAI), has gotten off to a successful start. The Swiss Hashgraph Association, which is based in the Greater Zurich Area, is supporting a total of 35 projects that aim to develop innovative applications on the Hedera network. The blockchain funding program is being operated together with the Swiss Digital Assets Institute.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $0.0553, $0.0500, $0.0456<br />Support Levels: $0.0377, $0.0300, $0.0250</p>
<h4>HBAR/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/hbar-price-analysis-whats-next-for-hbar-price-top-investment-company-joins-hedera-governing-council/">HBAR/USD</a> opened lower at $0.0380 and rose to $0.0391 on Wednesday. As buyers appeared focused on levels above $0.0390, the pair continued to range. A decisive decline below $0.0380 must be produced to analyze the bearish situation. The pair may continue to tumble, with pessimistic traders eyeing the area below $0.0300 as a likely target.<br /><br />Growth from the December 31st low of $0.0355 is viewed as a likely rebound phase within a longer-term consolidation trend. More gains are predicted as long as the $0.0300 support level holds. A robust breakout of $0.0456, on the other hand, would signal the end of the continuation of the bounce from the $0.0355 low, bringing the upside back into focus.</p>

<p>The HBAR/USD is still trading in a range from its recent low of $0.0355, with an intraday tilt to the downside. If the last support level of $0.0377 holds, the price is likely to rise further. A significant return above $0.0456, on the other hand, will recoup all profits made in December.<br /><br />The next target will be a mid-term level of $0.0440 as the 4-hour relative strength index hits the neutral zone. A break of revised support at $0.0377, on the other hand, might reverse the expected uptrend and expand the range from $0.0388 with a fresh decline phase below the level at $0.0355.</p>

<p>A fantastic achievement, the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-blockchain-data-size-hits-new-300-gigabytes-milestone/">Bitcoin blockchain</a> has now been operational for 14 years. The genesis block was mined on January 3, 2009, amid the height of the financial crisis, and today is the anniversary of that event. The controversial <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/mysterious-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-is-the-worlds-44th-most-powerful-person-in-finance/">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>, whose true identity is still unknown, started the Bitcoin genesis block.<br /><br />The genesis block, the very first one on the Bitcoin blockchain, was one of the most innovative ideas of this century and signaled the start of a new era in decentralized digital money.<br /><br />Cryptographers hypothesized that the 50 Bitcoins in the genesis block would be viewed as a reward for maintaining nodes on the network, thus they were not spent. The London Times&#8217;s <em>&#8220;Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks&#8221;</em> headline is also included in the document. <br /><br />Given that banks were being bailed out as a result of reckless banking activities, this was seen to be a statement on the state of money in general at the time.<br /><br />It has been hypothesized that Satoshi used this header to express opposition to the way major banks handled business before the advent of cryptocurrencies and how Bitcoin could render those same banks obsolete by offering <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-and-blockchain-the-backbone-of-decentralized-finance/">decentralized</a> methods for handling financial transactions.<br /><br />With 770,111 total blocks from its humble beginnings 10 years ago, the Bitcoin network itself has undergone a significant transformation. In terms of trading digital currencies, Bitcoin continues to lead the way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On Tuesday, disgraced former FTX CEO <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-charged-with-eight-criminal-offenses/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> pleaded not guilty to fraud charges in a federal court in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/03/sam-bankman-fried-pleads-not-guilty-to-fraud-charges-in-new-york.html">New York</a>.<br /><br />After his crypto exchange enterprise imploded last year, Bankman-Fried faces various allegations, including wire fraud and campaign finance law crimes. Bankman-Fried is accused of, among other things, misusing FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto trading firm and make political donations.<br /><br />Requests for comment from a Bankman-Fried spokeswoman were not immediately entertained. Last month, the former CEO of FTX was detained in the Bahamas. Later, after his parents co-signed a $250 million bail bond, he was extradited to the United States and granted release. Tuesday, Bankman-Fried&#8217;s attorney asked the court to withhold the names of the two additional co-signers of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s bond because doing so might expose them to threats and harassment.<br /><br />Following the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-s-sbf-bows-out-following-liquidity-crunch/">collapse</a> of the crypto behemoth due to a run on its native utility coin, FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in November. FTX, once valued at $32 billion, might still owe its top 50 creditors $3.1 billion.<br /><br />Many of Bankman Fried&#8217;s top lieutenants have already admitted guilt and are helping with the investigation into FTX-related criminal charges. <br /><br />According to U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York, Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s Alameda Research trading company, and Gary Wang, the other co-founder of FTX, pleaded guilty to the charges.<br /><br />The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have filed further civil complaints against Bankman-Fried.</p>

<ul>
<li>The price of Solana (SOL) has risen by more than 14% in the last 24 hours</li>
<li>SOL was trading at $11.77 at the time of writing</li>
<li>Solana ranks 16th largest cryptocurrency</li>
</ul>
<p>According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/">CoinMarketCap</a> data, the price of the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) has risen by more than 14% in the last 24 hours. In a New Year&#8217;s price pump, the crypto asset reclaimed $11 following several days of trading below double digits. SOL was trading at $11.77 at the time of this writing. The increase comes after Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin tweeted in the past week that <em>&#8220;smart people&#8221;</em> told him there is an <em>&#8220;earnest smart developer community in Solana&#8221;</em> and that the chain has a <em>&#8220;bright future.&#8221;</em> Buterin also expressed his desire that the Solana community <em>&#8220;gets a fair chance to thrive.&#8221;</em> However, Solana&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s pump hasn&#8217;t stopped the battering the would-be <em>&#8220;Ethereum killer&#8221;</em> has taken in recent months. The SOL token is down nearly 20% since the previous month and has shed over 95% of its value since reaching a peak of nearly $260 in November 2021. Solana ranks as the 16th largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $4.18 billion.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $26.00, $20.00, $12.00<br />Support Levels: $8.00, $6.00, $4.00</p>

<p>SOL rises today following a 24-hour bounce at $9.81 and a three-day positive streak. On the daily timeframe, the fall to lows of $7.96 on Dec 29 paved the way for a positive structure. The RSI is rising towards a neutral level of 50. If the bulls maintain control, the price is poised to breach the $12.10 barrier before reaching the MA 50 at $13.88.<br /><br />After clearing this significant barrier, the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/sol-price-analysis-solana-posts-3-gain-in-recent-hours-chipotle-mexican-grill-announces-solana-giveaway/">SOL/USD</a> pair may target the $20.00 level before advancing to the $26.00 level and the $38.78 all-time high set in November. Otherwise, a drop below the $9.81 low might push the bears toward the $5.0 critical level, where the bulls might re-attempt its upward trend.</p>

<p>SOL&#8217;s price movement has so far rallied off lows of $7.96 and past the moving average (MA 50) at $10.40, but investors will need more before committing again. Buyers face early resistance from the $12.10 handle, which coincides with the MA 200, after breaking through the $11.50 handle. If this significant boundary is crossed, the SOL/USD pair may aim for the $20.00 level before resuming its descent toward the $8.00 level.<br /><br />If buyers win more ground, the bulls may revisit the $35.50 resistance zone. If sellers re-emerge and drive the price down, the MA 50 around $15.00 could provide early limits ahead of the $8.00 low. To summarize, SOL/USD looks to be neutrally biased between $8.00 and $12.00.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Santiment, an on-chain analytics firm, predicts that something big might be brewing for the XRP price. The year 2022 was a rough one for cryptocurrencies, in which most digital assets including XRP underperformed.</p>
<p>With 2023 upon us, some crypto enthusiasts are looking out for XRP price action.</p>
<h2>Here Are Five Positive Catalysts</h2>
<p>According to a Santiment community post, for the last six months, the price of XRP has generally fluctuated between $0.28 and $0.54. It has also been declining since 2021, however, this is part of a bigger ascending trend that might potentially complete a triangle formation.</p>
<p>The price is currently at the bottom of this triangle, which some investors may perceive as a favorable chance with both low risk and great gain.<br /><br />Second, the group of XRP holders who own between 1 million and 10 million XRP has added to their holdings by 25% over the last six months, bringing the total to 4.09 billion XRP. At market bottoms, this degree of accumulation is common. <br /><br />Furthermore, with the exception of the FUD event in December 2020, this group of holders normally has a substantial influence on the price of XRP.<br /><br />Third, Binance&#8217;s funding rate for XRP is currently slightly negative, indicating a bearish sentiment among traders. However, it is vital to highlight that ordinary traders on Binance may not be able to precisely predict an asset&#8217;s short-term price changes.<br /><br />Fourth, short-term traders are currently facing average losses of -7%, according to the MVRV 30-day for XRP, which evaluates their profit or loss. As a result, they may be hesitant to sell their coins at a loss, thus causing the price of XRP to rise.<br /><br />Last, if the MVRV Long/Short difference (the difference between the average profit or loss of long-term holders and short-term holdings) is heading upward while the price remains largely sideways, it could signal that long-term holders are getting more confident and increasing their positions. <br /><br />Long-term holders are frequently perceived as &#8220;steady&#8221; investors who are less inclined to sell their investments based on short-term price swings, which could contribute to an increase in price in the future. This has been the case with XRP in recent months.<br /><br />After evaluating XRP using numerous metrics and technical analyses, Santiment analysts conclude that investing in XRP is similar to playing roulette. The price has been pretty stagnant for the past six months, and most retail traders on Binance seem bearish on XRP.<br /><br />Long-term investors are optimistic, while short-term traders may be afraid to sell, so who knows what will happen? Maybe XRP will be the next big thing, or maybe it will fail miserably.</p>

<p><a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Cardano">Cardano</a>&#8216;s decentralized finances were not the most robust component of the ecosystem, since it only started supplying convenient decentralized solutions in the second half of last year. This tendency was linked to the <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Cardano">network</a>&#8216;s core technology of transaction bookkeeping. However, things could change dramatically in 2023. <br /><br />The network&#8217;s current TVL is $50 million, a substantial decrease from the ATH reached in 2022 when the overall value of assets on the network remained at $350 million. Given the scarcity of decentralized solutions in the Cardano ecosystem, such a large number is remarkable.<br /><br />The Cardano network will issue a slew of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/stablecoin-the-most-stable-valued-decentralised-cryptocurrency-usdt-audt-usdc-dai/">algorithmic stablecoins</a> in the new year, which should provide considerably more value to the network than decentralized exchanges or yield farming platforms, given the convenience, they bring to networks and DeFi.<br /><br />If the market recovers in 2023, Cardano&#8217;s TVL might hit new highs, significantly surpassing the relatively modest $350 million seen in 2022. <br /><br />In comparison, Solana&#8217;s TVL crossed the $1 billion barrier in July 2021 and reached the network&#8217;s greatest value of locked funds in November, surpassing the $10 billion mark.<br /><br />The present quantity of locked funds is not going to propel Cardano as an ecosystem to new heights, which is why developers are betting big on the DeFi sector as one of the most important and easiest ways to bring new cash to the network. <br /><br />At the time of writing, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ada-price-analysis-how-will-impressive-2022-development-in-cardano-blockchain-impact-price-going-forward/">ADA</a> is battling on the market, with a continuous slump despite the favorable end of 2022 and beginning of 2023. The lack of inflows into the cryptocurrency market, as well as the impasse in the DeFi and NFT industries, contributed to the decline of ADA in 2022 and will continue to be the coin&#8217;s main source of pressure in 2023.</p>

<p>The Dogecoin Foundation has<a href="https://foundation.dogecoin.com/announcements/2022-12-31-corefund/"> announced</a> a new fund for Dogecoin Core developers to better promote the Dogecoin ecosystem in the coming year. The foundation announced on December 31 that it is contributing 5 million Dogecoin, which is approximately $360,000 at the time of writing, to the new fund to assist in the development of the Dogecoin platform.<br /><br />The money, according to the<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/doge-developers-publish-roadmap-for-the-first-time-in-tokens-history/"> Dogecoin foundation</a>, will be housed in a new multi-signature wallet administered by its members and will require three of five signatures from Dogecoin Core developers chromatic, Marshall Hayner, Michi Lumin, Patrick Lodder, and Ross Nicoll. Apart from supervising the release, these custodians will have no rights to the funds. The team wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The DOGE held in this wallet will disburse rewards to developers of Dogecoin Core for work on all contributions, no matter how big or small.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For each Dogecoin Core release, 500,000 DOGE will be distributed to developers that contributed to the release. To ensure openness, the team disclosed the wallet address where the funds are stored. The Dogecoin core team will also create blog posts for all expenditures, which will be publicized by the custodians via social media networks.<br /><br />Similarly, Dogecoin developers recently dismissed speculations that the network might switch to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism right away. The developers stressed that they simply want to issue a proposal on the subject. One of the developers, Lumin, chastised influencers who spread the notion and stated that they do not have the <em>&#8220;inside scoop&#8221;</em> on Dogecoin.<br /><br />On September 16, Dogecoin overtook Bitcoin as the second-largest proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency. After the Ethereum network moved to PoS consensus, the update was released. Some feel that Bitcoin&#8217;s proof-of-work consensus should be justified in light of the current development.<br /><br />Image Credit: Shutterstock</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ethereum-eth-trading-at-this-juncture-implies-one-thing-this-is-what-on-chain-data-says/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> is marginally up in the last 24 hours at $1200, according to CoinMarketCap data. In a blog post, the Ethereum team says there is a lot around the corner for 2023. It says it is actively working on an implementation of sharding, which is EIP-4844, or <em>&#8220;Shard Blob Transactions,&#8221;</em> to be more precise. It highlights a merge of the EIP-4895 <em>&#8220;Beacon Chain Withdrawals&#8221;</em> code, with plans to complete the five Ethereum Object Format (EOF) EIPs that are being considered for mainnet by building on top of the initial EIP-3540 implementation. This would enable the joining of an early EOF-focused testnet, which is likely in January 2023. The team also says it will continue working on in 2023, but not limited to, first, the Scheduled and tentative protocol upgrades. Second, withdrawals functionality as this feature will enable stakers to withdraw their balances from the beacon chain to their execution layer accounts. The consensus-layer core specs are nearing completion, and client teams are actively implementing and testing the functionality. Then comes EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding. The much anticipated Shanghai hard fork is already semi-scheduled, although the exact contents are still a bit debated.</p>

<p>Ethereum continues to trade within a narrow range for the umpteenth time, with the psychological $1,200 level offering solid support and keeping the downside protected for now, while the upside attempts have repeatedly struggled to register a daily close above the 4-hour moving average (MA 50).<br /><br />The end-of-year-thinned markets and lack of news keep the pair in a quiet mode, as mixed daily analysis adds to a directionless near-term mode. Following strong rejection at the MA 50, the pair is on track for a monthly close in a bearish candle, generating an initial signal that its consolidation and recovery rally may be stalling.</p>

<li>Shark and whale addresses holding 10 to 10,000 BTC have dumped a collective $10.75 billion worth</li>
<li>MicroStrategy stated it bought nearly 2,395 Bitcoin at about $42.8 million</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-is-down-63-in-2022-here-is-how-ethereum-solana-cardano-dogecoin-fared-these-are-predictions-for-2023/">Bitcoin</a> is trading marginally higher in the last 24 hours at $16,555. The leading crypto asset is down 3.6% in the last 30 days and 64.9% year to date. BTC’s decline this year puts it on pace for one of its worst annual stretches on record. According to Santiment, two weeks before Bitcoin&#8217;s all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021, shark and whale addresses holding 10 to 10,000 BTC dumped a total of $10.75 billion. Per Santiment, this drop, combined with circulation drying up, has led to a sputtering end to 2022. It observes that such returns are reminiscent of the 2018 bear market, which followed a late-2017 Bitcoin rally to an all-time high of $19,800 and saw dip buyers pay dearly as prices fell the following year. The 3.6% decline recorded in December reflected the continued collapse seen throughout the year. In a recent filing, MicroStrategy stated it bought nearly 2,395 bitcoins for about $42.8 million between the start of November and Dec. 21 through its MacroStrategy subsidiary. It then sold 704 of the tokens on Dec. 22 for nearly $11.8 million, citing tax purposes, before buying 810 BTC two days later.</p>
<p><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $20,000, $18,500, $17,500<br />Support Levels: $15,500, $13,000, $11,000</p>
<h4>BTC/USD Daily Chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1488" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63762 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-31.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-31.png 1488w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-31-300x139.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-31-1024x473.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-31-768x355.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-31-750x347.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-31-1140x527.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">BTC/USD Daily Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>A U-turn from the sell-off point around $25,214 in mid-August was unsettling to see on the daily chart. The decline brought the pair to $15,460 in November. From this point, another rally took place where <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/btc-price-analysis-btc-usd-is-at-bottom-of-current-cycle-as-large-scale-bitcoin-liquidations-end/">BTC/USD</a> struggled to reach another high point of $18,385 in December, which means the pair may be open to fresh selling. <br /><br />A persistent bear market would start if $15,500 was broken, which would confirm a dead cat bounce. Therefore, buyers could turn the situation around at $11,000, but the first barrier remains at $18,500 and $20,000, a crucial level to raise and overcome in the journey higher. This means that Bitcoin is at a critical level as a deeper fall might occur.</p>

<p>Bitcoin attempted a recovery wave above the $17,500 resistance against the US dollar. BTC/USD even climbed above the $18,000 resistance zone. Looking at the 4-hour chart, the pair struggled to clear a major resistance zone near the $18,300 level. The pair formed a high near $18,385 and started a decline in mid-December.<br /><br />Earlier, there was a move below the $15,500 support zone. The pair even spiked below the level before starting an upward move from the $15,460 swing low to the $18,385 high. It is now trading well below the $17,000 level, the moving average (MA 50), and the moving average (MA 200). Any more losses might open the doors for a move toward the $13,000 support zone.</p>

<p>The crypto market has had a particularly turbulent year, with several decentralized and centralized firms failing or trying to stay afloat. <br /><br />It appears that we are nearing the end of the bear market, with bad individuals and practices being cleansed in a dramatic and necessary process for the overall system&#8217;s maturation. <br /><br />Regardless, the Web3 innovations that emerge from this crypto winter will revolutionize the world. Following the events of 2022, the year 2023 is offered with a mixed perspective. Rather, the forecasts are mixed.</p>
<h2>Here Are Five Predictions</h2>
<p>1. Mark Connors, head of research for Canadian crypto asset manager, said he expects a price rebound in 2023 and TradFi businesses, among others, to take a more active role not just in finding applications for blockchain technology, but also in regulatory development.&#8221;Leadership will come from the corporate side, not the regulatory side,&#8221; Alex Connors predicts.<br /><br />2. Second, 2023 will be a watershed moment for digital assets. It will be the fundamental Layer 1s, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and TradFi firms using NFTs. In 2022, the ecosystem consisted of alt-level coins such as Solana, Algorand, and others supplying the majority of the non-Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoin market cap.<br /><br />3. According to Connors, the Fed might stop quantitative tightening before the third quarter. They will halt because the Treasury market might fail as it did in September 2019. Money markets will crash, the Fed will print, and cryptocurrency will fall as precipitously as it did in March 2020. As a market, we&#8217;re still in our infancy. We do not control our own fate based on pricing and adoption.<br /><br />4. Fourth, stablecoins will find additional uses outside of crypto capital markets, resulting in greater mainstream adoption — particularly among enterprises — and innovation inside Web3. Governments and private blockchain developers will continue to do research and development, with some announcing centralized public infrastructure such as central bank digital currencies or marketplace infrastructure.<br /><br />5. While cryptocurrency venture capital funding will continue to fall through the first half of 2023, this is not necessarily a bad thing; rather, it is normalizing to a rational level. Investors don&#8217;t want to catch a falling knife, so they&#8217;re waiting for a bottom while also considering broader macroeconomic issues and the potential of a worldwide recession.<br /><br />At the same time, new settlements (layer 1s/2s), interoperability (layer 0/bridge), lending, and trading protocols will be funded to fill the void left by previous hacks, treasury shortfalls, regulatory changes, and exchange collapses.<br /><br /><strong>Overall, Web 3 will continue to grow</strong><br />&#8220;Larger macroeconomic downturn market conditions should hopefully drive crypto initiatives away from speculation and more towards utility &#8211; one big utility category just being meaningful, entertaining, social interactions,&#8221; Alex Zhang, the de facto leader of Friends with Benefits DAO, predicts. <br /><br />He anticipates growth in &#8220;interoperable identity, on-chain social graphs, and crypto-abstracted social experiences,&#8221; as well as &#8220;more meaningful Web3 social platforms and protocols.&#8221;</p>
