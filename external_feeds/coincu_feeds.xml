<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/erapad_finance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EraPAD</a>, a groundbreaking DEX project integrated with Launchpad and developed on the cutting-edge zkSync ecosystem, is developing many outstanding features to support users. This innovative project boasts a host of remarkable features, setting it apart from traditional decentralized exchanges.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2365.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="553" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2365-1024x553.png" alt="EraPAD Review: Interesting Launchpad Integration Project On zkSync Era" class="wp-image-207515" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2365-1024x553.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2365-300x162.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2365-768x414.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2365-750x405.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2365.png 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="EraPAD Review: Interesting Launchpad Integration Project On zkSync Era 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>EraPAD represents a significant advancement in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), catering to the increasing demand for secure, efficient, and user-friendly solutions. Built on the zkSync ecosystem, EraPAD leverages zero-knowledge proofs, enabling swift and low-cost transactions while maintaining robust security. Let&#8217;s find out more about this project with Coincu.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is EraPAD?</h2>



<p>In the dynamic world of blockchain and decentralized finance, EraPAD emerges as a prominent player, revolutionizing the landscape with its automated trading protocol and decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the <a href="https://coincu.com/187304-top-5-new-projects-on-zksync-era-ecosystem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zkSync Era </a>ecosystem.</p>



<p>EraPAD&#8217;s origins lie in its fork version of Uniswap V2 and Curve, which forms the backbone of its automated market maker (AMM) DEX. This strategic foundation ensures that EraPAD inherits the best aspects of these well-established protocols while introducing innovations to enhance overall functionality and performance.</p>



<p>At its core, the project introduces essential features such as Swap, Farming, and Launchpad, empowering users with a variety of options for trading, staking, and participating in new project launches. By integrating these functionalities, EraPAD caters to diverse user preferences, offering a versatile ecosystem where traders and liquidity providers can thrive.</p>



<ul>
<li>The Swap feature on the platform enables users to trade tokens automatically and rapidly.</li>



<li>Users may utilize the Farming feature to bring liquidity into trading pairs and obtain EraPAD token incentives while participating in the market.</li>



<li>The Launchpad feature enables new projects to raise funds and issue tokens to investors using the platform.</li>
</ul>



<p>One of EraPAD&#8217;s key strengths lies in its commitment to delivering a seamless and efficient trading experience. The platform&#8217;s deep liquidity and high customization options contribute to a trading environment where users can execute transactions swiftly and conveniently. This focus on user satisfaction sets EraPAD apart from other DEXs, ensuring that it stays ahead of the curve in an ever-evolving DeFi landscape.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Highlights</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>EraPAD&#8217;s AMM Mechanism</strong></h3>



<p>One of the standout offerings of EraPAD is its unique <a href="https://coincu.com/167234-how-will-the-dex-war-explode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Automated Market Maker (AMM)</a> mechanism that allows users to tailor transaction fees to their specific preferences.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional AMM platforms, EraPAD empowers users to customize transaction fees for each trading pair. This flexibility ensures that users have full control over their trading experience, allowing them to optimize fees according to their individual needs. By offering pool configurations with varying fees for specific trading pairs, EraPAD provides unmatched convenience to traders, encouraging a more seamless and personalized approach to transactions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Liquidity of EraPAD</strong></h3>



<p>The liquidity aspect of EraPAD is further bolstered by its groundbreaking NFT staking feature. Users can stake their NFTs to enhance the liquidity of their holdings, unlocking a multitude of benefits through the platform&#8217;s protocols. One of the key advantages is the freedom to close or unlock NFTs at any time, affording users greater control over their profits and enabling various strategic maneuvers.</p>



<p>Moreover, EraPAD grants users the liberty to customize stake levels, ultimately leading to increased capital efficiency and higher returns. The unrestricted reusability of staked NFTs, facilitated by Nitro Pools and other mechanisms, adds another layer of convenience, allowing users to reuse their NFTs without any limitations.</p>



<p>The introduction of NFT staking on EraPAD marks a significant step forward for DeFi enthusiasts, as it brings unparalleled flexibility to their trading endeavors and optimizes capital utilization.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Launchpad project support</strong></h3>



<p>EraPAD extends its support to emerging projects through its Launchpad initiative. The Nitro Pools mechanism offers participating projects the autonomy to design flexible buying or selling strategies to maximize profits. This feature empowers projects with the freedom to execute transactions as per their own unique strategies without any constraints.</p>



<p>In a display of commitment to project success, EraPAD also provides tailored strategies when required, ensuring optimal efficiency and maximum profits for the participating ventures. The platform&#8217;s willingness to adapt and support projects with customized strategies sets EraPAD apart as a truly user-centric and project-friendly DeFi platform.</p>



<p>With EraPAD&#8217;s groundbreaking AMM mechanism, customizable fee structure, and NFT staking, the platform is spearheading the next generation of decentralized finance. By empowering users with unprecedented control over their trading experience and supporting projects with tailored strategies, it has solidified its position as a trailblazer in the evolving DeFi landscape. As the platform continues to make waves, the future of decentralized finance looks it than ever.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tokenomics brings sustainability</strong></h3>



<p>By introducing two main tokens, HIGG and zHIGG, EraPAD establishes a strong foundation for community empowerment and efficient governance within its ecosystem.</p>



<p>The HIGG token plays a pivotal role in empowering the community, granting users the ability to actively participate in platform-related decisions and governance processes. On the other hand, the zHIGG token serves as an escrow version, allowing users to engage in governance and play a crucial role in shaping the future of EraPAD.</p>



<p>To maintain a balanced and stable token ecosystem, EraPAD has implemented a token supply limit, effectively capping the maximum number of tokens that can be issued. By curbing the over-expansion of the token supply, this measure safeguards against potential inflationary pressures and ensures long-term stability for HIGG and zHIGG tokens.</p>



<p>An ingenious move by EraPAD is its planned allocation of a portion of the swap fee to zHIGG users as profits. This forward-thinking approach incentivizes users to actively hold and utilize zHIGG, fostering strong community participation while bolstering the overall stability of the tokens. This way, the project not only rewards its loyal users but also reinforces the resilience of its token ecosystem.</p>



<p>The combination of a well-designed tokenomics system, token supply limit, and the strategic allocation of swap fees contributes to a stable environment for EraPAD tokens. As a result, users and the community using the project can benefit from a reliable and secure ecosystem where their contributions are duly rewarded.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Features</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Swap</strong></h3>



<p>The Swap mechanism currently allows users to exchange between ETH-HIGG pairs with minimal slippage of approximately 0.05%. However, the platform is still in the developmental phase, and users have reported limited experiences, including potential suspensions in wallet connections and only one available trading pair, ETH-HIGG. EraPAD acknowledges the need for improvement in the liquidity market and urges potential traders to carefully evaluate their investment decisions.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Farming</strong></h3>



<p>On the other hand, the Farming feature has garnered considerable attention among investors due to its alluring benefits. Participants in EraPAD&#8217;s Farming will receive zHIGG governance tokens and stand a chance to receive additional rewards from EraPAD&#8217;s partners. The project is committed to distributing up to 5% of the total supply in profits to users. Although the exact numbers have not been disclosed, these offerings are expected to be enticing for those willing to engage in Farming. However, users should exercise caution and conduct due diligence as EraPAD is still undergoing development.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-08-01-at-02.23.53-1024x278.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="278" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-08-01-at-02.23.53-1024x278.png" alt="EraPAD Review: Interesting Launchpad Integration Project On zkSync Era" class="wp-image-207522" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-08-01-at-02.23.53-1024x278.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-08-01-at-02.23.53-300x81.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-08-01-at-02.23.53-768x208.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-08-01-at-02.23.53-1536x417.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-08-01-at-02.23.53-2048x556.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-08-01-at-02.23.53-750x204.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-08-01-at-02.23.53-1140x309.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="EraPAD Review: Interesting Launchpad Integration Project On zkSync Era 3"></a></figure></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Launchpad</strong></h3>



<p>The Launchpad is EraPAD&#8217;s flagship product, allowing users to purchase blockchain-based tokens through auctions with the assurance of secure transactions on the zkSync chain. Participating projects will allocate 10% of their total token supply for sale, with 6% purchasable with HIGG and 4% with zHIGG. Additionally, users can enhance their income by utilizing the referrer function and contributing early to the project. Furthermore, keeping the OG role on Discord, purchased at a 10% discount, is also possible.</p>



<p>Despite the opportunities, EraPAD acknowledges the risks associated with the Launchpad, such as potential rug pulls and scam projects. To safeguard liquidity for Launchpad projects, EraPAD has allocated 50% of the proceeds from the final token sale, matched with 7.5% HIGG in the UNI v2 liquidity pool.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-08-01-at-02.23.58.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="237" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-08-01-at-02.23.58-1024x237.png" alt="EraPAD Review: Interesting Launchpad Integration Project On zkSync Era" class="wp-image-207523" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-08-01-at-02.23.58-1024x237.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-08-01-at-02.23.58-300x69.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-08-01-at-02.23.58-768x178.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-08-01-at-02.23.58-1536x355.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-08-01-at-02.23.58-2048x474.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-08-01-at-02.23.58-750x173.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-08-01-at-02.23.58-1140x264.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="EraPAD Review: Interesting Launchpad Integration Project On zkSync Era 4"></a></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">HIGG token</h2>



<p>EraPAD now offers two kinds of tokens: a native token called HIGG and a governance token called zHIGG. These tokens serve a significant role in the EraPAD ecosystem, as they are utilized to assure the platform&#8217;s transparency, fairness, and efficiency.</p>



<p>The native token HIGG is used to make transactions on the platform, while the governance token zHIGG is utilized to control community decisions and platform operations.</p>



<p>These two tokens are essential components of the EraPAD ecosystem, ensuring synchronization and actively contributing to the platform&#8217;s long-term growth.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="section-9"><strong>Key Metrics</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Token name: EraPAD token</li>



<li>Ticker: HIGG</li>



<li>Blockchain: zkSync Era&nbsp;</li>



<li>Token contract: Updating</li>



<li>Token Type: Utility</li>



<li>Token Supply: 100,000,000 HIGG</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Use Cases</strong></h3>



<p>This token is used to pay platform transaction fees. This saves users a significant amount of time and effort when processing payments in conventional currencies.</p>



<p>HIGG is given to users as a reward for their active participation on the site. This encourages users to be more engaged in their usage and leads to a better HIGG platform experience.</p>



<p>Users who actively engage in activities such as liquidity provision, staking, or referring new participants can receive rewards in the form of tokens. This not only incentivizes users to participate more actively but also fosters a sense of community ownership, as everyone stands to benefit from the platform&#8217;s success.</p>

</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Roadmap</h2>



<p>EraPAD has released its project plan, which is divided into three major phases:</p>



<ul>
<li>The first phase focuses on product development and construction.</li>



<li>The second phase involves developing Launchpad to help with fundraising and project objectives.</li>



<li>DEX issuance and liquidity execution are the third phase.</li>
</ul>



<p>Nonetheless, the community&#8217;s reaction to the project&#8217;s airdrop strategy has been varied. Many people believe that this indicates that the project has not attained the intended degree of stability.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Investors &amp; Partners</h2>



<p>The project is actively working with partners such as GXChain, ReiNetwork, and Denet2022… Moreover, EraPAD just revealed that it has successfully raised $2 million from the Utilities Investment Fund.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>EraPAD is a DEX project mixed with a Launchpad built on the zkSync ecosystem that has many impressive capabilities. The project has rather decent incentive schemes for users. But, the statement is just that; the project is still in the process of completion and development, and users must exercise caution while engaging in farming.</p>

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/205867-eralend-by-3-4m-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eralend</a> is an attractive choice for those who want to capitalize on the financial potential of crypto assets without having to deal with the liquidity hassles and reliance on unreliable oracle data. This project has proven its breakthrough in creating an innovative loan and lending model, bringing great benefits to users. Yet, based on the current hack, it seems that it still has a long way to go.</p>



<p>Please provide <a href="https://twitter.com/Coincuofficial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coincu</a> to learn more about the project through this article.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is EraLend?</h2>



<p>EraLend is a trailblazing lending and borrowing platform, setting itself apart by being the first to be built on the <a href="https://coincu.com/203089-zksync-launched-new-nft-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZkSync</a> ecosystem. This innovative platform boasts lightning-fast transaction speeds and low costs, while also inheriting the robust security and decentralization features from <a href="https://coincu.com/207287-ethereum-ico-investor-emerges-after-8-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>.</p>



<p>Formerly known as Nexon Finance, the platform has quickly garnered attention as an active lending project operating on the zkSync platform. Its primary mission is to enhance the capital efficiency of crypto assets, revolutionizing the lending and borrowing services offered in the blockchain space. By doing so, EraLend aims to mitigate the risks associated with liquidity challenges and unreliable oracle data, presenting an attractive solution for users seeking to harness the financial potential of crypto assets without facing the usual hassles.</p>



<p>The core focus of EraLend remains centered on the zkSync ecosystem, wherein it concentrates on delivering exceptional borrowing and lending services. Capital efficiency in the crypto-asset sector is a primary objective, and the platform diligently works to minimize liquidity-related risks while ensuring that reliable oracle data supports its operations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Highlights</h2>



<p>One of EraLend&#8217;s key strengths lies in its ability to improve capital efficiency through its P2P lending model. Unlike traditional lending protocols, the platform empowers parties to directly negotiate asset values and loan terms, eliminating the disadvantage of fluctuating APY rates based on pool liquidity. This ensures that lenders can enjoy higher interest rates, while borrowers bear lower interest rates compared to protocols relying solely on pool liquidity.</p>



<p>The working mechanism behind EraLend&#8217;s lending solutions involves lenders and borrowers jointly depositing assets into a pool. Lenders earn interest on their loans, while borrowers can withdraw borrowed funds at any time. Although APY can be influenced by pool liquidity, the P2P model ensures optimal liquidity for both parties.</p>



<p>Moreover, EraLend significantly reduces its dependency on Oracle data for liquidation. By allowing users to consult various sources and make informed decisions about lending positions, the platform mitigates the risks associated with data errors. This approach enhances the platform&#8217;s security, as hackers cannot exploit misinformation from a centralized data source to manipulate transactions.</p>



<p>The team behind EraLend places a strong emphasis on user experience. The platform&#8217;s user-friendly interface eliminates unnecessary complexities, making DeFi more accessible and popular. Users benefit from almost instant transaction speeds and minimal transaction costs, and they have the flexibility to pay fees using their preferred tokens. Additionally, the platform&#8217;s open-source nature ensures transparency, while zkSync&#8217;s zk-rollup technology enhances the protocol&#8217;s security, protecting users&#8217; personal information and preventing external attacks.</p>



<p>To maintain the highest level of security, EraLend conducts monthly security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. Although no platform is entirely risk-free, EraLend&#8217;s commitment to auditing ensures it adheres to the most robust security standards, safeguarding users from potential threats.</p>



<p>However, recently EraLend was hacked to 3.4 million USDC. The attacker uses a method called a read-only re-entrancy attack, which is commonly used with projects with many smart contracts.</p>



<p>In the case of EraLend, the vulnerability lies in the “token burn” and “mint” functions for lending.</p>



<p>EraLend&#8217;s success stems from its innovative approach to P2P lending, offering users enhanced capital efficiency, security, and an enjoyable experience in the DeFi ecosystem. While users are encouraged to exercise caution when interacting with any new project, EraLend&#8217;s strides in security measures and transparency provide a promising outlook for the future of decentralized lending.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Institutional Secured: A Haven for Large Investors</strong></h3>



<p>Anticipated for launch in Q1 of 2024, EraLend&#8217;s Institutional Secured product is a highly anticipated offering aimed at safeguarding the interests of large investors. By providing an added layer of protection and tailored features, this product caters specifically to institutional players seeking a secure and reliable platform for their investments.</p>



<p>In addition, Eralend has incorporated zkSync Bridge into its application interface to boost user flexibility and convenience. This enables users to easily move assets to the zkSync network using the Eraend platform&#8217;s built-in bridge.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Profit making method</h2>



<p>At the core of Eralend&#8217;s revenue generation are two distinct types of liquidity pools: Pooled Markets and P2P Markets. In Pooled Markets, the platform collects fees for each lending and borrowing transaction executed within the liquidity pool. These fees contribute significantly to the project&#8217;s overall revenue, making it a crucial pillar of their business model.</p>



<p>The P2P Markets, another key revenue source for Eralend, facilitate direct borrowing and lending transactions between parties. Here, the platform also collects fees for each transaction, adding to its profitability and bolstering its financial foundation.</p>



<p>However, Eralend&#8217;s revenue-generating capabilities don&#8217;t stop there. The platform also earns from protocol fees, an essential component of its sustainable growth strategy. The protocol fee is determined as a percentage (x%) of the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) loan and is governed by the project&#8217;s board. This strategic approach allows Eralend to benefit from the borrowing and lending activities transpiring on its platform, ensuring a steady stream of income.</p>



<p>Moreover, Eralend has tapped into the potential of liquidation fees to further bolster its financial health. A percentage (x%) of the total liquidation fee-collected collateral adds to the project&#8217;s revenue, creating an additional revenue stream.</p>



<p>The combination of these diverse revenue streams has proven to be a winning formula for Eralend, enabling it to sustain its operations, expand its offerings, and continuously innovate in the DeFi landscape. The project&#8217;s commitment to transparency and governance has instilled confidence in its community, attracting both retail and institutional investors to participate actively in the Eralend ecosystem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Roadmap</h2>



<p>Eralend intended to launch a public test of Pooled v1 on the Testnet network in the first quarter of 2023, enabling consumers to participate and experience the product. Then there&#8217;s the implementation of Pooled v1 on the Mainnet, which will bring it to perfection and make it suitable for real-world usage. In the foreseeable future, the project has not revealed comprehensive details regarding the development strategy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Recently, an AMM/DEX project on Ethereum called Ambient Finance has received an investment of $6.5 million in the seed round from funds such as Blocktower Capital, Jane Street, Circle,… The project attracts the community swimming it promises to allow users to experience optimal trading with low costs and high liquidity. So what is Ambient? What are the features that make it so attractive?</strong></h5>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Ambient?</h2>



<p>Ambient (formerly CrocSwap) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol that allows for two-sided AMMs combining concentrated and ambient constant-product liquidity on any arbitrary pair of blockchain assets.</p>



<p>Ambient runs the entire DEX inside a single, smart contract, where individual AMM pools are lightweight data structures instead of separate smart contracts. This and other design decisions make Ambient the most efficient Ethereum-based DEX in existence.</p>



<p>Besides the usual token swap, Ambient also provides a feature that allows placing limit orders, providing liquidity to bring profits to users.</p>



<p>On July 12, the trading platform completed a $6.5 million seed funding round led by BlockTower Capital, with participation from Jane Street, Circle, Tensai Capital, Naval, Yunt Capital, Susa Ventures, Quantstamp and Hypotenuse Labs, as well as Ribbon Finance co-founder angel investor Julian, The Block researcher Steven, and more. The money raised will support the development of the team and R&amp;D to create a sustainable decentralized market.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-272.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-272-1024x576.png" alt="Ambient Review: Emerging DEX On Ethereum Brings Exciting User Experience" class="wp-image-208377" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-272-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-272-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-272-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-272-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-272.png 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Ambient Review: Emerging DEX On Ethereum Brings Exciting User Experience 12"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Highlights</h2>



<p>Ambient is developed as an entirely new codebase with best engineering practices and innovative smart contract architecture choices in mind. This gives it a number of core advantages over competing DEXs:</p>



<ul>
<li>Substantial gas savings compared to other leading DEXs</li>



<li>Combines concentrated (i.e. &#8220;UniV3 style&#8221;), ambient (i.e. &#8220;UniV2 style&#8221;), and knockout liquidity (behaves like limit orders which atomically fill and lock in a position in a single direction) within the same pool all on a single liquidity curve.</li>



<li>Dynamically adjusted pool fees, maximizing LP returns relative to market conditions and demand for liquidity.</li>



<li>Fees accumulated by concentrated LP positions auto re-invest back into the pool as ambient liquidity. Users earn compounded even without manually harvesting positions.</li>



<li>JIT (just-in-time) liquidity attacks are prevented through the use of minimum TTL parameters on concentrated liquidity positions. Ordinary LP positions therefore earn higher fees.</li>



<li>Ability for users to pre-fund tokens at the DEX in the form of &#8220;surplus collateral&#8221;. Much higher efficiency for active traders by deferring token transfers to net settlement.</li>



<li>&#8220;Gasless&#8221; transactions, where the user pays in the swapped token instead gas, through EIP-712 off-chain standard.</li>



<li>Unique support for &#8220;permissioned pool&#8221; primitive where the ability to govern and restrict a pool can be offloaded to general purpose smart contract oracles running inside or outside the protocol.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Mechanism of action</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Automated Market Maker (AMM)</strong></h3>



<p>In Ambient, liquidity is provided by a liquidity pool instead of individual orders. This means that there is a market between two tokens represented by each pool, and a single exchange rate is determined by a virtual reserve ratio. This allows for a stable and consistent exchange rate. The Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM) algorithm ensures that the product of the virtual reserves remains constant. This algorithm is used to adjust prices based on the size and direction of trades, thus balancing supply and demand and resulting in a price impact.</p>



<p>Accordingly, CPMM ensures that the value of assets in the pool will not change regardless of their quantity by adjusting the price of tokens based on token supply and demand, and liquidity in the pool:</p>



<ul>
<li>When a user buys more tokens, the price of that token will increase as the number of tokens remaining in the pool decreases.</li>



<li>Conversely, when users sell a lot, the price of that token will decrease.</li>
</ul>



<p>The CPMM model allows users to swap tokens anytime, as long as there is enough liquidity.</p>



<p>In addition, exchangers are required to pay a fee for liquidity based on the amount they trade. This fee is then redistributed among Liquidity Providers (LPs) based on their contribution to the pool. The fee rates may vary, but usually fall within the range of 0-1%.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Concentrated Liquidity</strong></h3>



<p>Concentrated liquidity helps users provide liquidity within a predefined price range on an individual AMM curve, with the advantage of capital efficiency. The liquidity provider only needs to commit the necessary collateral to support liquidity to a limited extent.</p>



<p>However, if the price curve goes beyond the order range, the LP will no longer accumulate charges. To get around this, Centralized Liquidity Providers can wisely define their price ranges or periodically &#8220;rebalance&#8221; orders by moving them back into the range.</p>



<p>Ambient also supports native liquidity with the advantage that the fees earned by Ambient Liquidity Providers will automatically pool back to their original positions without any manual management, costing The significantly lower gas fees required for the surrounding Liquidity Provider minting and burning positions, and the placement of all the surrounding Liquidity Providers on a given curve are interchangeable natively and can easily be bundled as &#8220;LP tokens&#8221;.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Knockout Liquidity</strong></h3>



<p>Knockout liquidity behaves identical to range-based concentrated liquidity, except the liquidity is atomically and permanently removed from the AMM curve at any point the curve price moves past the edge of the range. Knockout liquidity can either be set to remove when curve price falls below the bottom of the range (bids) or when curve price rises above the top of the range (asks).</p>



<p>Eliminate liquid orders that offer better prices:</p>



<ul>
<li>Waiting for cheaper price</li>



<li>Receive instead of swap payment</li>



<li>Avoid slippage on the AMM line</li>
</ul>

<p>The core functionality of Ambient is to allow users to exchange one type of token for another at fair market prices. If liquidity exists for a given pair in the DEX contract, then users will be able to swap between tokens. The frontend web app provides an interface for general-purpose swaps.</p>



<p>If adequate liquidity exists in a given for the pair, a swap will most likely be executed as a single hop. Single hops incur lower liquidity and gas fees, so they are preferred. A multihop swap is when swaps across multiple pools are chained, usually in the case when there&#8217;s little to no liquidity in any pair between the input and output token. The on-chain contracts take a pre-determined path. They were finding a cost efficient price multihop path, or routing.</p>

<p>The Trade feature in Ambient allows users to make trades by placing limit orders. Unlike other DEXs that support limit orders, Ambient Finance will execute users&#8217; orders gradually when the price is within a certain price range. This price range is typically 0.64% for highly volatile token pairs and 0.01% for stable token pairs. Ambient will also display information about the starting and ending price of order execution on the platform&#8217;s interface.</p>

<p>Ambient Finance&#8217;s Pool feature allows users to participate in the liquidity provision and receive a transaction fee reward from the protocol. There are two modes of liquidity provision including centralized liquidity provision and direct liquidity provision.</p>



<p>In centralized liquidity provisioning mode, users can provide liquidity within a predefined price range. This increases the efficiency of the liquidity provider&#8217;s investment and creates a deeper order gap in the token&#8217;s price range.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in direct liquidity mode, users provide liquidity across the entire price range of the token, creating liquidity across the entire price range. However, the reward received will be lower than the centralized liquidity mode.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Governance &amp; Policy</h2>



<p>Ambient protocol uses a three-layer division of responsibility:</p>



<p>​</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://2276651761-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FgoE7yYSVNNTbvsL9nuX9%2Fuploads%2FnbduxsIRnbdUJN2vd0vh%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=305ad866-d5ca-4aff-b9cf-4142671557e7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://2276651761-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FgoE7yYSVNNTbvsL9nuX9%2Fuploads%2FnbduxsIRnbdUJN2vd0vh%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=305ad866-d5ca-4aff-b9cf-4142671557e7" alt="Ambient Review: Emerging DEX On Ethereum Brings Exciting User Experience" title="Ambient Review: Emerging DEX On Ethereum Brings Exciting User Experience 16"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>​</p>



<ul>
<li>Governance fills the traditional role of a DAO. It includes full power over the protocol, and is controlled by M-of-N multisigs and timelock resolutions.</li>



<li>Policy is an intermediate layer that sits between the DAO governance and the DEX contract itself. It can ether directly relay resolutions from the governance layer, or delegate limited administrative control of the DEX to external smart contract policy oracles explicitly installed by DAO governance.</li>



<li>Mechanism is the underlying DEX contract itself. CrocSwapDex (the core smart contract holding dex liquidity and positions) is built with tunable parameters that can be dynamically adjusted by external policy oracles. That allows the protocol to improve and experiment with new functionality in a way that&#8217;s safer and more contained than directly upgrading the underlying DEX smart contract. </li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>The liquidity provision model in Ambient combines the characteristics of a decentralized exchange and a centralized exchange. And unlike other AMMs, liquidity is not fragmented for trading pairs. Ambient can also run the entire DEX system in a single smart contract, thus achieving lower transaction fees, greater liquidity rewards, and a fairer trading experience. As a trading protocol that combines the features of CEX and DEX, Ambient introduces new DeFi native functions to give users a first-class experience.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The recent court ruling that Ripple’s XRP token is not a security has resulted in a massive wave of positive sentiment across the crypto industry. But, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has vowed to appeal the ruling. As uncertainty looms, investors are turning to Filecoin (FIL) and <a href="https://vcspectra.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VC Spectra (SPCT)</a>. VC Spectra (SPCT) is in Stage 2 of its public presale, and it guarantees massive returns for its investors. Which of the three coins should investors go for?</strong></h5>



<p><a href="https://vcspectra.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>>>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</strong></a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">XRP Holders Need To Analyze the Market Carefully</h2>



<p>The legal validation that Ripple’s <strong>XRP is not a security</strong> when trading on exchanges triggered a ripple effect in the entire crypto market. In that context, both conventional investors and normal crypto enthusiasts are currently showing unwavering confidence in Ripple’s XRP. As expected, a <strong>massive influx of investments</strong> into XRP and XRP-focused products was recorded, reaching <strong>record-breaking figures</strong>.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the growing presence of <strong>crypto whales</strong> who own balances surpassing 100 million XRP each stands as convincing evidence of this increasing optimism surrounding XRP. But, XRP holders need to keep in mind that the U.S. SEC has said it might <strong>appeal the court’s ruling</strong>. An appeal might have an impact on the price of XRP, but analysts say that the crypto will maintain its bullish trend.</p>



<p>After the court ruling on July 13, XRP exploded from <strong>$0.473</strong> to highs of <strong>$0.821</strong> within 24 hours. Since then, XRP has managed to maintain a bullish trend and has formed a strong support zone around $0.701. Currently, XRP is trading at <strong>$0.703, up 44%</strong> in the past month. Analysts project XRP will maintain a bullish trend to close 2023 above <strong>$0.865</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>Filecoin (FIL) Has Enjoyed Steady Growth Recently</h2>



<p>Over the past few weeks, Filecoin (FIL) has experienced <strong>consistent growth</strong>. Based on Messari&#8217;s latest report, Filecoin&#8217;s (FIL) <strong>active deals have increased</strong> by 64% quarter-on-quarter. Analysts interpret this notable surge in active deals as a clear sign of the increasing adoption and use of Filecoin (FIL) within the market. The data suggest that <strong>Filecoin (FIL) is gaining traction</strong> and attracting many active participants.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Filecoin’s (FIL) network has recorded a remarkable <strong>60% growth</strong> in the number of large dataset clients within the same period. Notably, these bullish developments have had a strong positive impact on the price movement of Filecoin (FIL), causing it to trend upward.</p>



<p>The price of Filecoin (FIL) has surged by <strong>4.86%</strong> in the past seven days. At the time of publication, the trading price of Filecoin (FIL) is <strong>$4.526</strong>. Analysts expect the active deals will increase adoption of Filecoin (FIL), pushing its price higher to <strong>$4.725</strong> by the end of 2023.</p>

<li><em>Musk&#8217;s clarity amidst X&#8217;s financial integration buzz.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a recent statement on his social media platform, entrepreneur Elon Musk dismissed speculations about X (formerly Twitter) introducing its own cryptocurrency.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-294.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="563" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-294.png" alt="Elon Musk Clarifies That X Will Never Launch A Crypto Token" class="wp-image-208469" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-294.png 1000w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-294-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-294-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-294-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Elon Musk Clarifies That X Will Never Launch A Crypto Token 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>Responding to a cautionary message from user @cb_doge, who urged vigilance against fake tokens and misleading articles, Musk firmly <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1687662311010631680" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asserted</a>, &#8220;Elon Musk and X never launched a crypto token. And we never will.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/204161-tesla-doesnt-buy-any-bitcoin-4-quarters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Musk</a>, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency world, particularly <a href="https://coincu.com/204138-dogecoin-pops-up-over-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">associated</a> with Dogecoin, has a history of influencing market trends. He once playfully transformed then-Twitter&#8217;s logo into the <a href="https://coincu.com/205415-elon-musk-profile-appears-dogecoin-symbol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dogecoin</a> emblem, triggering a surge in the meme coin&#8217;s value.</p>



<p>However, Musk&#8217;s forthcoming venture, X, is reportedly seeking collaboration with a major financial data provider to establish a trading hub within the platform, according to <em><a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/08/03/2023/elon-musks-plan-to-own-the-meme-stocks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Semafor</a></em>. </p>



<p>Documents and insider sources revealed that X approached financial-data companies to solicit proposals involving real-time stock data and financial content integration. </p>



<p>Although potential partners are offered access to millions of highly qualified users, no financial compensation is promised. Interested firms were requested to specify their investment commitment to the project.</p>



<p>Musk tempered these reports on X, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1687146854172303360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asserting</a> that &#8220;no work is being done on this to the best of my knowledge.&#8221; While not a definitive denial, this statement suggests that such a service might be in the pipeline, albeit not immediately.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time the idea of an X-based trading hub has surfaced. Earlier this year, social investing platform eToro announced plans to offer trading services for cryptocurrencies and other assets directly through X, an arrangement aimed at users of the then-named Twitter platform. </p>



<p>As X continues to evolve, the integration of financial services could mark another significant step in its transformation.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Judge dismisses class action lawsuit against Tether and Bitfinex, finding lack of credible injury claims.</em></li>



<li><em>The lawsuit questioned USDT&#8217;s value claims but lacked evidence of diminished actual value.</em></li>



<li><em>Tether sees the dismissal as an affirmation of their transparency and vows to uphold promises.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Chief Judge Laura Taylor Swain of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District Of New York has delivered a significant legal victory for Tether and its sister company <a href="https://coincu.com/208248-new-york-man-reveals-hack-bitfinex/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitfinex</a> by dismissing a class action lawsuit against them.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-291.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="880" height="400" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-291.png" alt="Tether And Bitfinex Triumph As Judge Dismisses Class Action Lawsuit" class="wp-image-208457" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-291.png 880w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-291-300x136.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-291-768x349.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-291-750x341.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" title="Tether And Bitfinex Triumph As Judge Dismisses Class Action Lawsuit 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>The lawsuit, brought forth by Matthew Anderson and Shawn Dolifka, targeted Tether&#8217;s claims regarding the backing of its stablecoin, USDT, alleging that these statements were false and misleading.</p>



<p>In a notable turn of events, Judge Swain issued a comprehensive and insightful 6-page decision that dismissed the class action lawsuit. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs&#8217; claims lacked merit and plausible allegations of injury. </p>



<p>According to the court, the complaint failed to present evidence demonstrating that USDT had suffered a diminished actual value. This ruling sheds light on the robustness of Tether&#8217;s legal position and underscores the inadequacy of the plaintiffs&#8217; claims.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/207430-tethers-q2-rserves-surge-to-3-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tether</a>, in response to the favorable decision, shared its satisfaction through an official blog post. The post highlighted that the dismissal occurred at an early stage of the legal proceedings, emphasizing the absence of legal merit in the plaintiffs&#8217; allegations. </p>



<p>The company&#8217;s commitment to its promises and its dedication to safeguarding its user base and the broader community were reaffirmed in the <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-and-bitfinex-win-comprehensive-legal-victory-as-us-district-court-dismisses-class-action-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/194368-tether-ctos-1b-usdt-mint-sparks-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paolo Ardoino</a>, Tether&#8217;s spokesperson and Chief Technical Officer, took to Twitter to express the company&#8217;s contentment with the court&#8217;s ruling. </p>



<p>He stressed that the court had correctly recognized the lack of plausible allegations of injury and the absence of evidence supporting the claim that USDT&#8217;s value had diminished.</p>

<p>This development showcases the ongoing legal challenges and scrutiny that stablecoin issuers face and highlights the importance of transparency and accurate communication in the cryptocurrency space. </p>



<p>The court&#8217;s decision not only reflects Tether and Bitfinex&#8217;s legal triumph but also contributes to the evolving legal framework surrounding stablecoins and their representations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Global X applies for spot Bitcoin ETF and dynamic BTC futures allocation.</em></li>



<li><em>Coinbase collaborates for SEC approval alongside Fidelity and BlackRock.</em></li>



<li><em>SEC remains cautious on spot Bitcoin ETFs due to surveillance concerns.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Global X has <a href="https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/regulation/rule_filings/pending/2023/SR-CboeBZX-2023-058.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">submitted</a> an application for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), following a trend of industry players seeking to provide Bitcoin-based investment options, according to recent filings.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-288-1024x512.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-288-1024x512.png" alt="Global X Joins Bitcoin ETF Race With Dynamic Strategy Amidst Regulatory Scrutiny" class="wp-image-208449" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-288-1024x512.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-288-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-288-768x384.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-288-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-288-750x375.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-288-1140x570.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-288.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Global X Joins Bitcoin ETF Race With Dynamic Strategy Amidst Regulatory Scrutiny 20"></a></figure></div>


<p>Additionally, Global X has filed to launch an ETF that will dynamically allocate between Bitcoin futures and its recently introduced Treasury bill ETF, <em>Financial Times</em> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e2ab0609-dc28-49d9-9ac1-40de8add036c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>.</p>



<p>The Global X Bitcoin Trend Strategy ETF aims to systematically allocate between U.S. and Canadian Bitcoin futures contracts and the Global X 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF. The latter, launched this year, has already gathered $42 million in assets.</p>



<p>If approved, the fund would offer investors exposure to Bitcoin with essential safeguards not always available in direct Bitcoin investments. Global X&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF application is the ninth active filing with U.S. regulators in this category.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/204930-global-x-etfs-coindesk-for-new-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Global X </a>has enlisted <a href="https://coincu.com/208303-coinbase-seek-full-dismissal-of-sec-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> as its surveillance-sharing partner, a strategy also adopted by pending applicants like <a href="https://coincu.com/202622-fidelity-fires-up-bitcoin-etf-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fidelity</a> and <a href="https://coincu.com/207822-us-committee-probes-blackrocks-in-chinese/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlackRock</a>. This move addresses prior SEC concerns about surveillance-sharing agreements and market manipulation.</p>



<p>The first U.S. Bitcoin futures ETF, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, launched in 2021, followed by similar offerings from VanEck and <a href="https://coincu.com/208417-valkyries-bold-move-converting-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valkyrie</a>. </p>



<p>Despite this, several issuers have sought to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs, with concerns about potential manipulation and surveillance leading the SEC to reject these applications.</p>



<p>BlackRock&#8217;s recent application for a spot Bitcoin ETF initiated a wave of new applications from firms like VanEck, Valkyrie, Fidelity, Invesco, WisdomTree, Bitwise, and Ark Invest.</p>



<p>Although various applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs are in progress, none have gained SEC approval thus far. The agency has extended deliberation windows and opened matters to public comments to avoid immediate decisions.</p>



<p>ETFs investing in futures contracts face challenges in maintaining exposure as contracts expire, impacting returns and disconnecting performance from underlying assets. </p>



<p>Amidst evolving ETF landscapes, market participants are striving to offer innovative investment avenues while addressing regulatory concerns.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The News York Attorney General has sued Former CEO Celsius Mashinsky for alleged cryptocurrency fraud.</em></li>



<li><em>Mashinsky is accused of defrauding hundreds of thousands of investors out of billions of dollars in cryptocurrencies by repeatedly making false and misleading statements about lenders&#8217; safety.</em></li>



<li><em>Mashinsky has denied the criminal charges.</em></li>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-04/ex-celsius-ceo-mashinsky-must-face-new-york-civil-fraud-suit#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Letitia James, the top cop in New York, filed the lawsuit nearly six months before the former CEO was charged with a federal crime. On Friday, a judge rejected Mashinsky&#8217;s attempt to dismiss the case.</p>



<p>James&#8217; lawsuit, filed in January, previews an unsealed indictment last month in Manhattan in which prosecutors claim that between 2018 and June 2022, Mashinsky orchestrated a wide-ranging scheme to mislead Celsius customers about &#8220;core aspects&#8221; of the company&#8217;s business and inflate the value of its proprietary token, CEL. Former director Alex Mashinsky has refused to accept criminal charges.</p>



<p>New York County Supreme Court Justice Margaret Chan said Mashinsky defrauded investors by touting Celsius as a safe alternative to banks and masking its risks, including daily investment losses of hundred million dollars.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;There are reasonable allegations to support a plausible inference that Mashinsky&#8217;s meaningful misstatements induced or promoted new investors to deposit assets in Celsius&#8217;s earned-interest accounts&#8221;</p>
<cite>New York County Supreme Court Justice Margaret Chan said in her ruling.</cite></blockquote>



<p>The civil suit seeks to ban Alex Mashinsky from doing business in New York and order him to pay damages for violating laws, including the state&#8217;s Martin Act, which gives James broad powers to pursue securities fraud cases.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Valkyrie plans to convert its Bitcoin Strategy ETF into a Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF on October 3, two weeks ahead of the other 13 ETFs&#8217; planned launches.</em></li>



<li><em>The move allows Valkyrie to expand its offering beyond Bitcoin futures contracts and potentially outpace competitors in the ETF space.</em></li>



<li><em>The SEC filing initiates the comment period, enabling public and institutional opinions on the ETF&#8217;s market impact and investor protection measures.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Valkyrie, a cryptocurrency asset management company, intends to convert its Bitcoin Strategy ETF into a combined Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF on October 3, 2023, according to a recently filed 497 form.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-285.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="500" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-285.png" alt="Valkyrie&#039;s Bold Move: Converting Bitcoin Strategy ETF To Include Ether" class="wp-image-208437" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-285.png 900w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-285-300x167.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-285-768x427.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-285-750x417.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="Valkyrie&#039;s Bold Move: Converting Bitcoin Strategy ETF To Include Ether 22"></a></figure></div>


<p>This move is notably two weeks ahead of the planned launches by the other 13 ETFs that have submitted applications for similar offerings. <a href="https://coincu.com/203584-sec-accepts-valkyries-etf-application/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valkyrie</a>&#8216;s current Bitcoin Strategy ETF, launched in 2021, primarily invests in Bitcoin futures contracts and is available through Nasdaq.</p>



<p>Bloomberg&#8217;s Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1687566431502716928" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highlighted</a> that Valkyrie&#8217;s proposed early launch might be a strategic maneuver to outpace the competition. The proposed date aligns with Valkyrie&#8217;s ongoing efforts to enhance its ETF offerings.</p>



<p>Valkyrie resubmitted its Bitcoin ETF proposal on June 21, shortly after <a href="https://coincu.com/207822-us-committee-probes-blackrocks-in-chinese/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlackRock</a>&#8216;s proposal. It&#8217;s worth noting that Valkyrie humorously adopted the &#8216;BRRR&#8217; ticker, referencing a popular meme that represents the sound of money printing. </p>



<p>Additionally, the firm adjusted its filing to include crypto exchange Coinbase as a &#8220;surveillance-sharing&#8221; partner, drawing parallels with BlackRock&#8217;s proposal.</p>



<p>The filing&#8217;s listing on the SEC&#8217;s official calendar initiates the comment period, allowing the public and institutions to express their opinions on various aspects, including market impact and investor protection.</p>



<p>This development coincides with <a href="https://coincu.com/100814-proshares-launches-short-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ProShares</a> and <a href="https://coincu.com/208365-bitwise-joins-race-with-2-ether-futures-etfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitwise</a> submitting ETF applications to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday. </p>



<p>The applications aim to provide exposure to both Bitcoin and Ether, signaling a growing interest in cryptocurrency ETF offerings.</p>

<p>Since the OTC sale began on August 1, Curve founders have sold 114.025 million CRV to 24 investors/institutions in exchange for $45.61 million in funds. Michael held too much CRV and was criticized by many. Although this OTC sale of CRV tokens will speed up CRV decentralization, it could also pave the way for future problems.</p>

<p>The OTC trading price of CRV this time is $0.4, about 30% lower than the current market price. Despite the half-year lockup period, the tokens given to investors are fully unlocked.</p>



<p>These positions will not be sold immediately, but some investors can hedge their risk through centralized exchange perpetual contracts proportional to the CRV/USDT perpetual contract trading pair continuing to be negative, meaning the bearish sentiment is dominating.</p>



<p>One of the reasons pioneering projects are more attractive to finance is that they are more likely to pay compensation if an accident occurs.</p>



<p>While it&#8217;s not Curve&#8217;s fault, the loss happened to Curve, and it hurt some of the users who trusted Curve. <a href="https://discord.com/invite/9uEHakc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord</a> has discussions about compensation, but there is no clear official statement.</p>



<p>The ideal end is for the hacker to <a href="https://coincu.com/208406-jpegd-recovered-5494-4-weth-10-bonus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repay</a> all of the loans or most of them, and the rest could be covered by Curve or related projects. For CRV holders, the rights and benefits will not be greatly reduced, for users with losses, the money can also be recovered to restore confidence. Currently it is actually developing along this route and projects like Alchemix, JPEG&#8217;d have recovered some money after trying to contact the hackers.</p>
