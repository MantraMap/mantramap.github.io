<p class="s7">Collateral Network (COLT) Current Antics Sets It Up For Higher Earnings</p>
<p class="s7">The Collateral Network (COLT) approach toward profit earning continues to grab attention due to its feasibility. Because initiatives like Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP) tend to follow similar patterns, they are usually susceptible to comparable market pressures, which impacts their profitability. However, that's not the case with Collateral Network (COLT), and let&rsquo;s see why. </p>
<p class="s7">The blockchain-based, ground-breaking crowdlending platform, Collateral Network (COLT), is backed by real-world assets that are not easily influenced by market volatility. So with the help of Collateral Network (COLT), borrowers can quickly and easily unlock the value of their assets, and lenders of the community can make passive income by lending small sums of money to the assets represented by NFTs.</p>
<p class="s7">At the core of the Collateral Network (COLT) innovative strategy lies its use of fractionalized NFTs, which reflect borrowers' assets that are then allocated to lenders in small amounts to fund the loans the borrowers need. With this arrangement, Collateral Network (COLT) lenders receive interest payments as the borrower settles a loan.</p>
<p class="s7">But that's not all. COLT owners are also entitled to several benefits, including lesser borrowing rates, access to premium auctions and staking rewards. </p>
<p class="s7">Moreover, several forecasts have indicated a 35x surge in the value of Collateral Network (COLT) at the expiration of its presale. With its price already up 40% to $0.014, this forecast surely seems plausible. Given all it has to offer, many observers believe Collateral Network (COLT) is poised to surpass both Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP) in profit earnings.</p>

<p class="s7">Arbitrum (ARB) Token Holders Reject Proposal</p>
<p class="s7">The focus of circulating reports has been the outright rejection of a proposal put forth by Arbitrum (ARB). A proposal to return 700 million $ARB, worth around $1bn, to the DAO treasury has been rejected by the Arbitrum (ARB) community almost unanimously. The aforementioned Arbitrum (ARB) governance proposal, termed &lsquo;AIP 1.05,&rsquo; asserts that the DAO's treasury resources were clearly overstepped when 700 million Arbitrum (ARB) tokens, worth at least $1bn, were issued preemptively and without authorization.</p>
<p class="s7">The voting started on April 8th and is scheduled to end on April 15th. Over 113 million people, which is equivalent to 83% of all votes cast, have voted against the idea thus far. Whereas only 20 million Arbitrum (ARB) token holders, equivalent to 15% of votes cast, support moving through with the proposal. </p>
<p class="s7">Meanwhile, the Arbitrum (ARB) price has risen 11.80% in the previous 24 hours, at the time of writing, to $1.57. Also, it has a $1,996,647,034 market cap.</p>

<p class="s7">Optimism (OP) Move For A Major Upgrade Garners Approval</p>
<p class="s7">From the latest updates making the rounds, Token House, the body in charge of the Layer 2 Optimistic Rollup network Optimism (OP), has approved the Mainnet upgrade for Optimism Bedrock. The Bedrock network upgrade gives the L2 network more modularity, simplicity and Ethereum parity to enhance Optimism (OP) performance and security. The Bedrock update aims to lower Optimism (OP) transaction fees, enhance throughput properties and increase sync speeds. As per the projections, the change can cut protocol and security expenditures by 47%.</p>
<p class="s7">Reports from the initiative highlighted that the Bedrock expansion proposal received the largest voter turnout in OP Governance history. At least 27.945 $OP were in favor of the plan, while 37.217k $OP were opposed to it.</p>
<p class="s7">Optimism (OP) is currently available for $2.67, having increased in value by 7.73% over the previous 24 hours, at the time of writing. The current market capitalization for Optimism (OP) is $839,385,294.</p>
