Some analysts are already warning about the dangers of deflation, even calling on the Chinese government to deliver cash handouts in order to push consumer demand.</strong></p>
<h2>Low Inflation Numbers in China Worry Analysts</h2>
<p>China, one of the biggest economies in the world, has <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/economic-indicators/article/3220134/china-inflation-consumer-prices-ease-further-april-producer-prices-remain-deflation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> its lowest inflation numbers in more than two years, according to data coming from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The Consumer Price Index (CPI) registered an increase of 0.1% year-over-year, dropping from 0.7% <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/chinas-inflation-rate-drops-to-lowest-in-18-months/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> in March.</p>
<p>The drop in prices was caused in part by a decline in food and beverages prices, which went from 2.4% in March to less than 1% in April. Core inflation, which does not include prices of food and beverages, rose 0.7% year-over-year. The numbers are below the expectations of the country for this year, established around a 3% ceiling that is not likely to be touched.</p>
<p>The numbers have been worrying analysts, who take them as a testament to the slow and rocky economic recovery of China after the coronavirus pandemic. However, Zou Lan, an official with the Peoples Bank of China (PBOC), dismissed these worries, stating that &#8220;there is no basis for long-term deflation or inflation,&#8221; and that consumer demand is expected to warm up during the second half of this year.</p>

<h2>Proposals to Avoid Deflation</h2>
<p>Standard Chartered has explained they expect inflation levels to hit 0% in the next months, &#8220;as a crude-oil price spike in the first half of 2022 created a high comparison base.&#8221; However, even with a slow inflation level, the bank has predicted a growth rate of more than 5% without adjusting interest rates, which are now at 1%.</p>
<p>Experts who are worried about the possibility of deflation have made different proposals to avoid it. Li Daokui, a professor of economics at Tsinghua University and former member of the PBOC advisory board, has <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/24/economy/china-deflation-economy-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called</a> for the government to deliver cash handouts to citizens to spur demand. Last month, Li stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even with a conservative estimate, 500 billion yuan in consumption vouchers will drive one trillion yuan in overall consumption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The state would also receive over 300 billion yuan in taxes derived from the spending directly enabled by the cash handouts, according to the professor.</p>

<h2>Binance Bows Out of Canada Due to Regulatory Guidance</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency exchange Binance has <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1657099651210969088?s=20">decided to withdraw</a> from the Canadian market. The company noted that it was the home country of its founder and cited regulatory guidance as the reason for its decision. Binance claims that the new regulatory climate in Canada makes it less feasible for its digital currency business to operate in the country.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, today we are announcing that Binance will be joining other prominent crypto businesses in proactively withdrawing from the Canadian marketplace,” Binance tweeted on Friday. The trading platform’s social media account added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, new guidance related to stablecoins and investor limits provided to crypto exchanges makes the Canada market no longer tenable for Binance at this time. We put off this decision as long as we could to explore other reasonable avenues to protect our Canadian users, but it has become apparent that there are none.</p></blockquote>
<p>The news follows the U.K. court setting aside an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/uk-high-court-rules-to-set-aside-interim-proprietary-injunction-against-binance/">interim proprietary injunction</a> against Binance. The court ordered Binance to keep a certain amount of cryptocurrency after a victim of cryptocurrency fraud claimed to have traced the stolen funds to the exchange. Additionally, last week, a report <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-reportedly-investigated-in-us-for-russia-sanctions-violations/">said</a> Binance was being probed by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) over alleged Russian sanction violations.</p>
<p>In the announcement on Friday, Binance said Canadian users will receive an email containing crucial details about how their accounts will be affected in the future. Despite the regulatory climate surrounding stablecoins and investor limits, the exchange expressed its willingness to collaborate and communicate with Canadian regulators.</p>
<p>Although Binance does not necessarily agree with the current regulations, it said it remains open to working towards a solution. The exchange concluded that it remains optimistic that a thoughtful framework will be established in the future, which could potentially pave the way for Binance to resume its services for Canadians.</p>

While Lido Finance dominates the market with 74.35% of the TVL, competing liquid staking protocols Rocket Pool and Frax Ether have recorded double-digit gains of 34% to 42% in the past 30 days.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Number of Ethereum Locked in Liquid Staking Derivatives Nears 9 Million</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Liquid staking protocols continue to grow, with the top decentralized finance (defi) protocols recording an additional 441,110 ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>). As of May 12, 2023, the total value locked (TVL) in liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) stands at <a href="https://archive.ph/HiKgM#selection-1553.16-1553.23">8,872,715 ether</a>, equivalent to $16.101 billion. This marks a significant increase from the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethereums-liquid-staking-protocols-attract-400000-ether-after-shapella-upgrade/">8,431,605 ethereum</a> locked in liquid staking protocols on April 30. In just 12 days, the number of ether deposits surged by an impressive 5.23%.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Despite the recent addition of 441,110 ethereum, the TVL in LSDs is currently worth less than it was on April 30, owing to ethereum&#x2019;s decline in market value. Back then, the TVL held in LSDs was valued at $16.139 billion, making today&#x2019;s numbers a 0.235% loss, standing at $16.101 billion. Notably, Lido dominates the market with a 74.3596% share, accounting for 6.59 million <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> of the 8,872,715 ether locked in today. The second-largest LSD protocol is Coinbase Wrapped Staked Ether, with 1,145,137 staked ether.&#13;<br />

&#13;<br />
This week, Lido&#x2019;s TVL jumped by 4.87%, while Coinbase&#x2019;s staked <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> value dipped by 1.47%. Rocket Pool witnessed an increase, with its TVL jumping by 5.27%. Frax Ether and Stakewise also saw gains, recording a 5.21% and 0.48% increase, respectively, in just seven days. Looking at the 30-day metrics, Lido&#x2019;s value locked rose by 11.10%, while Coinbase&#x2019;s staked <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> TVL saw a 3.95% reduction. Frax and Rocket Pool emerged as the 30-day leaders, with Rocket Pool surging by 34.37%, and Frax recording a 42.55% increase.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Rocket Pool is closing in on Coinbase in terms of the number of staked <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>, with 622,633 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> locked, while Frax Ether only has 187,551 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> locked. However, Rocket Pool&#x2019;s deposits would have to grow by 84%, or more than 523,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>, to surpass Coinbase&#x2019;s number of staked <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> locked into the protocol.&#13;<br />

<h2>IMF Warns About U.S. Debt Default</h2>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations would have &#8220;very serious repercussions&#8221; on both the American and global economies.</p>
<p>IMF Director of Communications Julie Kozack was asked at a press briefing on Thursday about “the knock-on effects” on the global economy, particularly for emerging markets, of “the debt ceiling crisis that is happening now between the White House and Congress, with the prospect of a potential default as early as June 1.”</p>
<p>She replied, “First, it&#8217;s important to note that these discussions in the U.S. are taking place at a time that is very difficult for the global economy,” adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our assessment is there would be very serious repercussions, not only for the U.S. but also for the global economy should there be a U.S. debt default. And we strongly encourage the parties in the U.S. to come together to reach a consensus to urgently address this matter.</p></blockquote>
<p>She was further asked to elaborate on &#8220;what some of those consequences might be for other countries, particularly developing economies.&#8221;</p>
<p>The IMF director said: “One of the repercussions, of course, that we would see, we could potentially see, is higher interest rates, some broader instability and economic repercussions.” Emphasizing that “we have seen a world in the last few years that have been affected by many shocks,” she stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, we would want to avoid those severe repercussions, and for that reason, we, again, are calling on all of the parties to come together, reach consensus, and resolve the matter as quickly as possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>The IMF said in April: “We expect global output growth to fall from 3.4% last year to 2.8% in 2023, before rising to 3% in 2024.” The Fund also cautioned at the time that more severe financial market disruptions could cause output growth to plummet to 1.0%, characterized by a severe pullback in asset prices and a sharp decrease in bank lending.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the Treasury may not be able to pay all of the government’s bills <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-warns-us-could-default-on-its-debt-by-june-1/">as early as June 1</a> “if Congress does not raise or suspend the debt limit before that time.” The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) similarly estimated that a U.S. default could occur in early June.</p>
<p>The IMF spokesperson was also asked about the impact of the &#8220;regional banking crisis&#8221; in the U.S. Kozack said:</p>
<blockquote><p>What we have seen is that as we have transitioned from a period of low interest rates to a period of higher interest rates, and as that transition has taken place quite rapidly, it has exposed some vulnerabilities in some banks, particularly here in the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>“The authorities in the U.S. have taken rapid action to address those vulnerabilities and that is most welcome. But it is very important that policymakers remain vigilant as more hidden vulnerabilities may emerge in this new high-interest rate environment,” she noted.</p>

Following the bill SB 7054 being signed into law, Florida’s Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) now explicitly forbids the use of a federally adopted CBDC as money.</strong></p>
<h2>Florida Puts the Brakes on CBDCs</h2>
<p>The Sunshine State has officially outlawed the use of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) following the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/florida-takes-a-stand-against-cbdcs-anti-cbdc-bill-receives-overwhelming-support-in-house-and-senate/">approval</a> of SB 7054 or HB 7049 by the Florida House of Representatives and Senate. Governor Ron DeSantis put pen to paper and <a href="https://twitter.com/GovRonDeSantis/status/1657031170628960260?s=20">signed the bill</a>, cementing the ban on Friday. The signing ceremony, which took place in Fort Myers, was attended by Wilton Simpson, the state&#8217;s 13th commissioner of agriculture, and Kathleen Passidomo, president of the Southwest Florida Public Service Academy at Fort Myers Technical College.</p>
<p>The new anti-CBDC law will come into effect on July 1, 2023. “They&#8217;re going to be able to have the window into what you&#8217;re doing with the money and the ability to control where that money is going,” DeSantis <a href="https://www.cltampa.com/news/florida-gov-desantis-signs-bills-banning-cbdc-blocking-credit-card-companies-from-tracking-gun-sales-15624806">said</a> during the signing ceremony. “They could block, if you filled up your gas tank too much, hey, they&#8217;re fighting global warming, ‘You can&#8217;t do any more.’ Maybe you bought a firearm last week. They don&#8217;t want you to buy another one this week.”</p>
<p>Several GOP lawmakers, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmaker-launches-cbdc-anti-surveillance-state-act-to-protect-americans-right-to-financial-privacy/">Tom Emmer</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-introduces-bill-to-ban-direct-to-consumer-central-bank-digital-currency/">Ted Cruz</a>, have introduced bills opposing the use of CBDCs. Governor DeSantis is urging other politicians and states to follow Florida&#8217;s example and take a stand against CBDCs. However, not everyone is on board with this decision. Nobel laureate and Keynesian economist Paul Krugman <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-paul-krugman-criticizes-florida-gov-ron-desantis-opposition-to-central-bank-digital-currency/">criticized</a> DeSantis, stating that it&#8217;s &#8220;highly unlikely that a state government would have the right to prohibit&#8221; the use of a CBDC.</p>
<p>While some Republican state leaders are opposed to CBDCs, others are more welcoming. Surprisingly, Democratic senator <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/senator-elizabeth-warren-demands-answers-from-fidelity-for-allowing-bitcoin-in-retirement-plans/">Elizabeth Warren</a> of Massachusetts, who is known for her strong stance against corruption in the banking industry, is in favor of CBDCs. In a recent interview with NBC&#8217;s Chuck Todd, Warren expressed her support for CBDCs, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elizabeth-warren-explains-her-anti-crypto-army-stance-waves-of-democrats-oppose-her-bitcoin-criticism/">stating</a> that &#8220;it&#8217;s time for us to move in that direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Governor DeSantis, on the other hand, remains resolute in his belief that CBDCs pose a threat to Florida&#8217;s financial stability and is determined to lead the charge against them. &#8220;I&#8217;m just glad we are thinking ahead here in the state of Florida because once this genie is out of the bottle, I think it will be very hard to put back in,&#8221; DeSantis <a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/florida/article_b9834cb8-f0ec-11ed-b73d-0392081ed139.html">said</a> in Fort Myers. There is a widespread belief that DeSantis has his sights set on the White House and will be running for president of the United States in the 2024 election.</p>

<h2>139.7 Bitcoin Worth $3.7 Million Suddenly Moves From Idle Wallet</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
A vintage wallet created on June 19, 2011, suddenly relocated 139.7 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, equivalent to $3.7 million at the time of transfer, on Thursday, May 11, 2023. Btcparser.com <a href="https://btcparser.com/?a=1H1Ab6Jkpx2ZtMbBZ9ctxaXPMDmf6k3JvK">flagged</a> this activity, which was confirmed at <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/block/789291">block height 789,291</a> at 8:14 p.m. (UTC). Shortly before that date &#x2014; April 24 &#x2014; the last 2011 bitcoin transfer from a dormant wallet took place and involved <a href="https://btcparser.com/?a=1Mjundq2zvjzRKy6VbTfPKsAZhVZe4dLtY">shifting 400 BTC</a> at block height 786,801.

The trial against him and another Korean, on charges of travelling on false documents, opened on Thursday with both pleading not guilty.</strong></p>
<h2>Court Grants Bail Request for Do Kwon, Puts Him Under House Detention</h2>
<p>A first instance court in Podgorica has agreed to release the founder and former chief executive of failed blockchain firm Terraform Labs, Do Kwon, and another South Korean citizen on bail, local and foreign media <a href="https://www.vijesti.me/vijesti/crna-hronika/656208/prihvaceno-jemstvo-drzavljani-juzne-koreje-branice-se-sa-slobode-ne-smiju-da-napuste-stan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>. They are charged with attempting to use forged personal documents in the small Balkan nation.</p>
<p>Do Kwon, or Kwon Do-Hyung as is his full name, was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/terraform-labs-co-founder-do-kwon-arrested-in-montenegro-says-interior-minister/">arrested</a> by Montenegrin authorities on March 23 while trying to board a flight for Dubai on a Costa Rican passport. He was detained together with a companion identified by his surname, Han. Previous reports have suggested that is the company’s Chief Financial Officer, Han Chang-joon.</p>
<p>On Friday, the court accepted 400,000 euros ($435,000) in bail for each of the two suspects, pending the outcome of their trial which started a day earlier, the Associated Press and the Vijesti news portal informed. However, they will not be allowed to leave their apartment which will be guarded by the Montenegrin police.</p>
<p>“They promised &#8230; they will not hide until the end of the criminal procedures, that they will regularly answer court summons and that they will be available at the address submitted by their attorney,” the court said. “If the defendants run away or violate the surveillance measure, the bail will fall through,” the statement added.</p>
<h2>South Koreans Plead Not Guilty of Charges in Montenegro</h2>
<p>The accused South Korean natives have pleaded not guilty to the charges pressed against them by Montenegrin prosecutors. Authorities in both Seoul and the U.S. are seeking the extradition of Do Kwon in connection with the $40 billion crash of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_(blockchain)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terraform ecosystem</a>’s cryptocurrency luna and stablecoin terrausd. It has been estimated that around 200,000 people bought the coins and suffered heavy losses when their value evaporated.</p>
<p>Kwon disappeared after departing for Singapore in April 2022, right before the collapse of the two digital currencies, and was wanted on a red notice from Interpol for alleged fraud and financial crimes. He then fled to Serbia, where he reportedly registered a new firm, before eventually ending up in neighboring Montenegro, where he can be sentenced to up to five years in prison.</p>
<p>In late March, Do Kwon’s Montenegrin lawyer was quoted as saying that the crypto entrepreneur would have to first <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/do-kwon-to-stand-trial-in-montenegro-may-serve-time-before-extradition/">stand trial</a> in the country for traveling on fake documents before he is extradited. The fugitive may also have to serve prison time there before he is handed over to any other jurisdiction, Montenegro’s justice minister indicated.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, South Korean media reported that Kwon has refused to declare his assets, when he was asked how he planned to pay the bail during the hearing in Podgorica. According to the public broadcaster KBS, he told the court that his wife will make the payment, explaining that the two of them own a $3-million apartment in South Korea. Kwon is widely suspected of having stashed large amounts of money from the alleged crypto fraud, the report noted.</p>

<h2>Elon Musk to Leave CEO Post at Twitter and Become Company’s CTO</h2>
<p>Entrepreneur Elon Musk announced he has found someone to replace him as chief executive officer (CEO) of Twitter, making good on a promise to the social network’s users. In a tweet on Thursday, he also said he is staying with the company but in other executive roles.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Excited to announce that I’ve hired a new CEO for X/Twitter. She will be starting in ~6 weeks!</p>
<p>My role will transition to being exec chair &amp; CTO, overseeing product, software &amp; sysops.</p>
<p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1656748197308674048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The new CEO, whose identity Musk did not unveil in his initial post, will be on the job within a few weeks while the current head will take responsibilities as executive chairman and chief technology officer overseeing product, software and system operations.</p>
<p>In another <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1657050349608501249" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> on Friday, he revealed that the chosen one is longtime media executive Linda Yaccarino, who will primarily focus on the business side of things while Musk prefers to concentrate on products and technologies.</p>
<p>Yaccarino had already announced she was departing Comcast’s mass media conglomerate NBCUniversal, where she headed advertising and partnerships. She spent over a decade there after working as executive vice president and chief operating officer of advertising sales, marketing and acquisitions at Turner Broadcasting.</p>

<p>The angel investor <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-takes-control-of-twitter-fires-ceo-and-cfo-says-he-buys-twitter-to-help-humanity/">bought Twitter</a> for $44 billion in October 2022 and has been running it since, while insisting that’s a temporary occupation. After the acquisition, he immediately embarked on organizational restructuring.</p>
<p>This included massive layoffs to cut costs. He later explained that it “turns out you don’t need all that many people to run Twitter … If you don’t care that much about censorship, then you can really let go [of a] lot of people.”</p>
<p>While managing Twitter, Musk also implemented significant policy changes, some of which have been met with criticism. He has been trying to convince users to become paid subscribers and advertisers to return to the platform.</p>
<p>“I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!” Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1605372724800393216?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> in December, vowing to just run the software and servers teams after that. The pledge came after the majority of participants in a Twitter poll, which he himself created, asked him to step down.</p>
<p>Despite previously stating he does not want to be the CEO of any company and that he views himself as an engineer, Elon Musk remains the top executive of U.S. electric car maker Tesla and spacecraft manufacturer Spacex.</p>
<p>In March 2023, the tech entrepreneur registered a company called <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/musk-mulls-ai-startup-to-rival-chatgpt-maker-openai-report/">X.AI Corp</a> which, according to a filing in Nevada, has him as director. In an interview in April, Musk announced he plans to create his own artificial intelligence (AI) platform called “<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/musk-to-launch-truthgpt-says-microsoft-backed-chatbot-is-trained-to-lie/">Truthgpt</a>” to rival the offerings of tech giants in the field.</p>

<h2>Impervious to Market Slump, BRC20 Tokens Defy the Odds</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Built atop the Bitcoin blockchain, the recently established BRC20 token economy has seen significant growth in the past five days. As of Thursday, May 11, its total market valuation stands at <a href="https://archive.ph/FMZXI#selection-279.0-378.0">$427 million</a>, representing a 53% increase <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-brc20-token-economy-skyrockets-192-to-279-million-in-just-four-days/">since May 7</a>. Moreover, there are currently 14,450 BRC20 tokens in circulation &#x2013; up from 13,530 four days prior &#x2013; according to brc-20.io statistics.&#13;<br />

&#13;<br />
Dune Analytics <a href="https://dune.com/cryptokoryo/brc20">data</a> compiled by user &#x201C;cryptokoryo&#x201D; reveals that the number of BRC20 transactions totaled 4,809,532 on May 12 at 10:15 a.m. (ET). Unquestionably, Bitcoin miners have relished the additional fees contributed to the network&#x2019;s block subsidy in light of Ordinal inscriptions and BRC20 tokens&#x2019; arrival. Cryptokoryo&#x2019;s BRC20 analytics indicate that since their inception, miners have accrued 987.34 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> from BRC20 activities.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Although BRC20 tokens have resisted the wider crypto-economy&#x2019;s <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/">decline</a>, the BRC20 economy did plunge from the $525 million range to its present $427 million value &#x2013; an 18% loss within the last day. Presently, the BRC20 market boasts approximately $206,477,610 in 24-hour volume and is dominated by the token <a href="https://archive.ph/o/FMZXI/https://brc-20.io/token?n=ordi">ordi</a> in terms of market valuation. A single ordi is trading hands for $11.56 per unit.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Hot on Ordi&#x2019;s heels are BRC20 tokens vmpx, pepe, meme, and domo concerning market capitalization size. Alongside this burgeoning BRC20 economy, BRC20s, and <a href="https://ordinals.com/">Ordinal inscriptions</a> have contributed to the Bitcoin blockchain&#x2019;s current backlog. Although fees and unconfirmed transactions have decreased, between <a href="https://archive.ph/jp8n4#selection-1871.1-1871.8">280,000 and 310,000</a> unconfirmed transactions remain pending confirmation.&#13;<br />

Musk tweeted, “Excited to announce that I’ve hired a new CEO for X/Twitter. She will be starting in ~6 weeks.” Dogecoin neared a two-month low today.</strong></p>
<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h2>
<p>Shiba inu (SHIB) neared a five-month low on Friday, as markets reacted to the news that Elon Musk will be stepping down as CEO.</p>
<p>Musk, who acquired the social media company last year, has been at the helm since the takeover, but has now found a long-term replacement.</p>
<p>Following a high of $0.000008746 on Thursday, SHIB/USD dropped to a bottom of $0.000008549 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>As a result of this sell-off, shiba inu moved close to Monday’s low at $0.00000835, which was the weakest point the meme coin has hit since January.</p>
<p>Looking at the chart, this latest move occurred as the relative strength index (RSI) moved deep into oversold territory, with a current reading at 23.02.</p>
<p>This does give hope to longer-term bulls however, that a reversal could be on the cards.</p>
<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) also moved lower in today’s session, as the meme coin neared a multi-month low of its own.</p>
<p>DOGE/USD fell to an intraday low of $0.06957 earlier on Friday, hours after trading at a peak of $0.07268.</p>
<p>Similar to SHIB, today’s decline almost led to dogecoin recapturing a low of $0.0692, which was its weakest level since March.</p>
<p>DOGE has since bounced back from this earlier low, after bulls rejected a full breakout of a support point of $0.07000.</p>
<p>As of writing, the price is now at $0.07127, which seems to have occurred as traders moved to buy the dip.</p>
<p>Should today’s low be the hard floor, there will likely be a stronger rebound in the coming days.</p>
