<p>Internet and email service providers have been ordered by the Nepalese telecommunications regulator to block access to any cryptocurrency-related trading websites or face possible legal action. </p>
<p>Internet service providers (ISPs) in Nepal have received instruction from the country&rsquo;s telecommunications regulators to block access to all cryptocurrency trading websites. Those who fail to comply with the instruction have been threatened by legal action. The Nepal Telecommunication Authority (NTA) issued a notice to all ISPs and email service providers which orders them to prevent access to &ldquo;websites, apps or online networks&rdquo; related to any cryptocurrency activities according to reports by Cointelegraph.</p>
<p>In a September 2021 notice, the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), declared cryptocurrency trading and mining illegal, further stating &ldquo;encouraging&rdquo; others to make use of cryptos is also an activity that is punishable by law.</p>
<p>The NTAs recent notice said that virtual currency transactions &ldquo;are increasing in recent days&rdquo; and underscored the fact that cryptocurrency transactions are still illegal in Nepal. The NTA also issued a similar notice in April related to crypto websites requesting the public to inform the regulator if they have information &ldquo;related to the name of such website, app, or online network.&rdquo; The April notice also threatened legal action if &ldquo;anyone is found to have done or been doing&rdquo; crypto-related activities.</p>
<p>Despite being deemed illegal in Nepal, the country has been at the forefront of global cryptocurrency adoption and has been ranked 16th globally according to a Chainanalysis report.</p>
