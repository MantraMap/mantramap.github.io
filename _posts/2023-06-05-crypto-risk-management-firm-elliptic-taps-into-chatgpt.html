<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Top cryptocurrency risk management firm Elliptic has announced last Thursday, June 1 their move to integrate large-language model (LLM) ChatGPT for their risk management and intelligence gathering operations. According to the statement, Elliptic expects that they &ldquo;will be able to synthesize and organize intelligence on new risk factors in higher volumes and at a quicker speed than ever before.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Elliptic has been at the forefront of cryptocurrency risk management and security. It recently published a report (commissioned by Nikkei Asia) on the cryptocurrency losses inflicted by North Korean hackers from 2017-2022. The report said that Asian countries, with Japan at the top, made up three of the four hotspots of hacking. Japan is estimated to have lost $721 million in cyberattacks. Now, Elliptic has taken steps to improve their solutions with the help of ChatGPT.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">With the ChatGPT integration, Elliptic aims to bolster its capabilities in risk analysis and threat detection. According to CEO Simone Maini, their continuous pursuit of cutting-edge technology is crucial to their mission. "We pride ourselves in being on the forefront of blockchain innovation, and incorporating cutting-edge technologies to enhance how we work without compromising the high standards for which we are known is part of our DNA,&rdquo; she stated.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The success of ChatGPT has attracted the attention of many in the crypto space and see a world full of potentials enabled by the LLM. Solana (SOL) has recently announced their plans to integrate the LLM through a plug-in and enable user interaction with the Solana network itself. The plug-in will enable users to ask questions and have them promptly answered by ChatGPT. At the same time, Solana has also announced a grant program for AI-focused projects built on the network.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The use of AI for crypto projects, and especially for risk management and security is not without its risks. Many have noted the LLM&rsquo;s shortcomings and limitations especially when dealing with more complex queries. There is still a very big room for improvements in the LLM and for a security firm as big as Elliptic, mistakes can be very costly.</p>
