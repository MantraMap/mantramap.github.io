<p>Uniwap (UNI) and Aave (AAVE) have experienced an exponential increase since their launch. However, there has been a recent change in the crypto market so these coins are declining gradually. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, Uniswap (UNI) and Aave (AAVE) investors are seeking Uwerx (WERX) tokens; crypto analysts have predicted Uwerx (WERX) to increase above 8,000% by the end of 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why are Uniswap (UNI) and Aave (AAVE) investors shifting to Uwerx tokens? and What makes Uwerx so promising?</p>
<p>Uniswap (UNI) investors are seeking for alternative investments</p>
<p>Uniswap (UNI) has gained ground since its inception and has generated money for its investors. However, Uniswap (UNI) has been experiencing a sudden drop since June 2022, crashing more than $25,000 billion. This steep decline has caused investors to lose interest in Uniswap (UNI) and seek alternatives in stable crypto investments like Uwerx (WERX).</p>
<p>A Uniswap (UNI) token costs about $5.00, which is 80% lower than its peak price. Unfortunately, it may be difficult for Uniswap (UNI) to experience any notable increase for the rest of 2022 as a result of its continuous decrease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aave (AAVE) investors aren&rsquo;t making an optimal profit</p>
<p>Aave (AAVE) runs on the Ethereum blockchain and is used to lend or borrow digital assets directly without any intermediary. Aave (AAVE) has had a good run since its creation. The Aave (AAVE) token is the 44th largest cryptocurrency, with a market value of over $1.09 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, although early Aave (AAVE) investors made a major profit initially, Aave (AAVE) is currently down more than 84% from $666, preventing investors from generating maximal profit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx (WERX): A risk worth taking?</p>
<p>Uwerx is the first of its kind, blockchain based freelance platform that promises to revolutionise the freelance industry. It promises to provide lower fees and focuses on protecting intellectual property rights and transparency. It offers a fair and equal marketplace in comparison to Fiverr and Upwork. Uwerx will secure liquidity for 25 years after presale and has already received approval for its audit from the reputed InterFi Network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The WERX token is billed to see exponential growth in the coming years with predictions peaking at an astronomical $2 a in 2025. Investors have been presented with a unique opportunity and with the presale currently ongoing, it is a chance to get in on the ground floor of a project with a bright and prosperous future ahead. Currently, WERX is being sold for $0.0315 and the purchase bonus is at 20%, however this is likely to fall with the upcoming price increases.</p>
