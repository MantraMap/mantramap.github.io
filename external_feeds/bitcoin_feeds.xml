Contract vulnerability was the most common (60) type of attack during the period with losses of $264.1 million. The data indicates that most of the rug-pulling incidents occurred on the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> Chain (80) and digital assets worth $53.4 million were lost in the period under review.</strong></p>
<h2>Web3 Industry Lost $656 Million in H1</h2>
<p>In the first half of 2023, the Web3 industry lost as much as $656 million to hackers, phishing scams and the so-called rug pulls, the latest Beosin Web3 security <a href="https://www.footprint.network/@Beosin/Footprint-Beosin-H1-2023-Report">report</a> has said. As shown in the report, hackings alone accounted for approximately $471 million, nearly 72% of the total losses. Phishing scams accounted for almost 17% of the total losses ($108.3 million) while rug pulls, which rocked decentralized finance in 2021, accounted for the remaining $75.87 million.</p>

<p>The $197 million <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/euler-finance-flash-loan-attack/#:~:text=On%20March%2013%2C%202023%2C%20Euler,it%20is%20unfortunately%20the%20largest.">hack</a> on Euler Finance, which was blamed on North Korea-backed cybercriminals, is the biggest in 2023 so far. On June 3, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/atomic-wallet-hack-decentralized-finance-wallet-breached-millions-lost-in-attack/">reported</a> an attack on Atomic Wallet and at the time it was believed that hackers had siphoned as much as $35 million. However, according to the Web3 report, the total funds lost in the Atomic Wallet hacking is in fact $67 million which makes this the second largest so far. In the rest of the top 8 hacking in the H1 of 2023, cybercriminals are believed to have made off with $25 million or less, the report data shows.</p>

<h2>Most Rug Pulls Occur on the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> Chain</h2>
<p>When compared to the hacking losses in prior H1s, the report data shows that cybercriminals stole more in the first six months of 2022, about $1.9 billion. In 2021, hackers stole less, around $375.5 million.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-596288" title="Web3 Industry Losses Topped $656 Million in H1 of 2023 &#x2014; Study" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rug-pull.png" alt="Web3 Industry Losses Topped $656 Million in H1 of 2023 &#x2014; Study" width="1314" height="357" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rug-pull-300x82.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rug-pull-1024x278.png 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rug-pull-768x209.png 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rug-pull.png 1314w" sizes="(max-width: 1314px) 100vw, 1314px"></p>
<p>The report data also shows that a total of 85 decentralized finance (defi) projects account for the biggest portion of the losses &#x2014; $292.6 million. Contract vulnerability was the most common (60) type of attack during the period with losses of $264.1 million. Arbitrage attacks, private key compromises, and misconfiguration were the other common tactics used by criminals.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the data indicates that most of the rug-pulling incidents occurred on the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> Chain (80) and digital assets worth $53.4 million were lost in the period under review. The Ethereum blockchain had the next highest number of rug-pulls while the Dogecoin chain only had one such incident. According to the data, Fontech, which lost in excess of $30 million, was the top rug-pulled project in the first six months of 2023.</p>

Their CEO, a visionary with a penchant for challenging norms, declared, &#x201C;We&#x2019;re here to break the mould and disrupt the status quo, one irreverent name at a time&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The company&#x2019;s very existence is a testament to the fact that the blockchain revolution was ignited by a desire to defy the established order, not to capitulate to the corporate facade. Nothing proves this better than the carpet designs that have been laid down at over 200 of the company&#x2019;s locations.</p>
<p id="h.i4bz50iqviln"><strong>Anonymous Bitcoin ATMs in an Age of Data Exploitation</strong></p>
<p>As the digital age ushers in an era of relentless data collection, storage, and sale, Shitcoins.club boldly champions the cause of privacy. With <strong>no account registration, no apps, no phone verification, no bank account integration and no marketing permissions required</strong>, this crypto ATM operator is a breath of fresh air for those weary of having their data exploited. The CEO observed: &#x201C;We&#x2019;re the crypto ATM for people tired of having their data hawked to the highest bidder&#x201D;.</p>
<p id="h.mefs2blwlp92"><strong>Instead of paying a fee, you get a bonus at the anonymous Bitcoin ATMs</strong></p>
<p>And then, they are also known for setting their fees to 0%, enabling transactions at an even better price than the largest exchanges. The <strong>no fee discount</strong> is a marketing move that will be remembered for centuries to come! They run other great promotions like when the fee is +3% so you get extra cash value when you make a transaction, or when a QR code giving away free cash or crypto is sent out on Shitcoins.club&#x2019;s social media. The first person to scan the code wins!</p>

<ol class="lst-kix_5ytmv2vogpj-0 start" start="1">
<li>Find the nearest Bitcoin ATM. You can use the ATM operator&#x2019;s website Shitcoins.club where all available device locations are listed on the map, or Bitomat.com</li>

<p id="h.wedjgqovxa1l"><strong>Absolute limits of anonymity at Bitcoin ATMs</strong></p>
<p>Of course, in order for the operations to be legal, the KYC is still there, it is just set to the possible maximum in each of the respective countries. For example, in Spain it is 1000 EUR a day, in most European countries it is something between 1000 EUR and 15000 EUR while in Bosnia it is cheekily set to 999999999 EUR a day. Visit the operator&#x2019;s social media or their website about Bitcoin ATMs in order to learn about the details for your country.</p>
<p id="h.541y2jx5z68y"><strong>Talk with the community about anonymous Bitcoin ATMs; do you own research</strong></p>
<p>Shitcoins.club&#x2019;s active social media presence isn&#x2019;t just about promotional blitz; it is an ecosystem pulsating with dynamic events, frequent discounts that can <strong>lower the fees 4x below the global average</strong>, and the latest news about ATMs and KYC. If you wish to know more about the quality of their services, you need only to reach out to any of their customers &#x2013; each one a testament to the disruptive approach. Just talk to them, ask questions, see what they think!</p>
<p id="h.thz141d3riv1"><strong>Final Thoughts: Join the Uprising</strong></p>
<p>Join the revolution and remember: the blockchain uprising won&#x2019;t be televised, but it might just start at a discounted Bitcoin ATM near you.

<h2>&#x2018;Indefinite Forbearance&#x2019;</h2>
<p>Cameron Winklevoss, the co-founder of the crypto exchange Gemini, has warned Digital Currency Group (DCG) founder Barry Silbert that a lawsuit will be filed against him and his company on July 7 if refuses to accept creditors&#x2019; best and final offer.&#x201D; In an open letter shared via Twitter, Winklevoss, who accuses Silbert of dragging the process to resolve DCG&#x2019;s failure to make creditors whole, said a demand will also be made for the Genesis Special Committee (GSC) to file a turnover motion on or before July 7. Such a step will put DCG into default, the Gemini co-founder added.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Earn Update: An Open Letter to <a href="https://twitter.com/BarrySilbert?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BarrySilbert</a> <a href="https://t.co/ErsYpcEjQD">pic.twitter.com/ErsYpcEjQD</a></p>
<p>&#x2014; Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1676024844641550337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Winklevoss&#x2019; letter to Silbert is the Gemini boss&#x2019; latest salvo against DCG and its accused founder. As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dcg-fails-to-make-630m-payment-to-creditors-amid-genesis-negotiations-says-gemini/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News in May, Gemini co-founder claimed that DCG had failed to make a payment of around $630 million. At the time, Gemini suggested that it would extend &#x201C;forbearance&#x201D; to DCG in order to prevent a default.</p>
<p>However, in the letter explaining why creditors and Earn users have taken such a step, the Gemini co-founder blamed Silbert&#x2019;s alleged abuse of the mediation process. He argued that this process has given DCG a free and unending forbearance.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The mediation has given DCG an indefinite forbearance on the $630 million it owes Genesis &#x2014; for free. This gratuitous forbearance has seriously damaged creditors and Earn Users in two significant ways. First, it has denied creditors, including Earn Users, the $630 million that they were owed in May,&#x201D; Winklevoss explained in the letter.</p>

<h2>Unsecured Creditor Committee&#x2019;s Fiduciary Duties</h2>
<p>According to the Gemini co-founder, DCG&#x2019;s so-called indefinite forbearance has also undermined creditors and Earn users&#x2019; primary bargaining chip which forces Silbert to come to the negotiating table.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in addition to threatening to file a lawsuit as well as a turnover motion, Winklevoss vowed to work with the GSC &#x201C;to advance a non-consensual plan that adheres to a strict timeline and provides for immediate distributions to creditors and Earn Users.&#x201D; Winklevoss said a demand will be made for the Unsecured Creditor Committee (UCC) to fulfill its fiduciary duty of filing a &#x201C;lawsuit and taking depositions related to their investigation into the various intercompany loans and transactions between DCG and Genesis entities.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In the so-called best and final offer, DCG is required to make a forbearance payment of $275 million on or before July 21. The payment must be comprised of 4,632 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and U.S. dollars. A payment of $355 million which is described as Debt Tranche 1 must be made two years from the plan support agreement (PSA) effective date. An amount of $835 million must be paid five years from the effective date.</p>

According to local sources, digital yuan payments were implemented on July 1 in all city buses after being tested in just two bus lines.</strong></p>
<h2>Jinan Includes Digital Yuan Payments In Public Transportation System</h2>
<p>The city of Jinan, the capital of the province of Shandong in China, has recently announced the implementation of digital yuan payments in its public transportation system. According to <a href="https://www.sohu.com/a/692972918_114775" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local sources</a>, the Jinan Public Transportation Group, a company that manages the bus system in the city, included the digital yuan as a payment means for bus fares on July 1.</p>
<p>Now, almost 7 million citizens of Jinan will be able to use their digital yuan wallets provided by the People&#8217;s Bank of China (PBOC) to pay for bus rides in a push to accelerate the digital transformation of the city&#8217;s public transportation system. Before, the company had carried out a limited pilot program, only implementing these payments in two bus lines.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to promote digital yuan payments, the city has partnered with Jinan&#8217;s PBOC branch to bring discounts as part of the second phase of the &#8220;Digital Spring City Low-Carbon Travel&#8221; program, which will be open until September 30.</p>
<p>In August, digital yuan payments were <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-introduces-digital-yuan-payments-in-ningbo-subway-guangzhou-buses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented</a> by Ningbo Rail Transit to pay for subway tickets in the city of Ningbo.</p>

<h2>Digital Yuan Promotion</h2>
<p>While experts had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/chinas-digital-yuan-little-used-former-central-bank-official-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that the digital yuan&#8217;s usage had not picked up due to the existence of private, widely accepted digital wallets like Wechat and Alipay, the PBOC has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-of-china-calls-for-increasing-use-of-digital-yuan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focused</a> on improving the compatibility and integration of the Chinese central bank digital currency (CBDC) with these alternatives.</p>
<p>In March, Wechat <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/chinas-wechat-adds-support-for-digital-yuan-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the integration of the digital yuan in its payment services, paving the way for more than 1.2 billion users to pay using its system. Alipay, owned by the Alibaba group, also integrated this kind of CBDC payment in December.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the PBOC has also been integrating the digital yuan as a form of payment where state institutions are involved. In Changshu, the city&#8217;s employees <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-pushes-digital-yuan-for-wage-payments-in-changshu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">receive</a> their salaries in digital currency.</p>
<p>In June, one of Asia&#8217;s largest counterparty clearing institutions, the Shanghai Clearing House, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/shanghai-clearing-house-introduces-support-for-digital-yuan-settlements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">included</a> support for digital yuan for payments and settlements of commodities.</p>

Davidson explained that CBDCs corrupt money into a &#8220;tool for coercion&#8221; and detailed that there was no legal way of issuing such a currency without legislation.</strong></p>
<h2>U.S. Representative Warren Davidson: CBDCs &#8216;Corrupt Money&#8217;</h2>
<p>Warren Davidson, a U.S. representative for the state of Ohio and a member of the House Committee on Financial Services, has revealed its stance on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and the possibility of issuing a digital dollar in the country.</p>
<p>Commenting on a recent <a href="https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/central-bank-digital-currency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> published by the Washington-based Cato Institute, where the institution criticizes the idea of CBDCs and lists the risk associated with their issuance, Davidson <a href="https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1675875960082636800?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Central bank digital currency (CBDC) corrupts money into tool for coercion &amp; control. Thankfully, there is no legal way to implement CBDC in America without legislation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Davidson, who <a href="https://www.soundmoneydefense.org/news/2020/08/14/sound-money-caucus-capitol-hill-000275" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> the &#8220;Sound Money Caucus,&#8221; which promotes sound fiscal and monetary policy in the United States, explained that &#8220;a bipartisan coalition in Congress is working to actively ban CBDC development or implementation.&#8221;</p>

<h2>The Move to Avoid a Digital Dollar in America</h2>
<p>Davidson is not the only congressman worried about the hypothetical issuance of a digital dollar in the U.S. In May, Congressman Alex Mooney introduced the Digital Dollar Pilot Prevention Act to close any regulatory loopholes on this issue.</p>
<p>The bill was <a href="https://mooney.house.gov/congressman-mooney-introduces-the-digital-dollar-pilot-prevention-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advertised</a> as an instrument that would &#8220;prohibit the Federal Reserve from establishing, carrying out, or approving a program intended to test the practicability of issuing a CBDC.&#8221;</p>
<p>The July slated launch of Fednow, a payments system for banks and credit unions, has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/is-fednow-the-first-step-towards-a-central-bank-digital-currency-speculations-rise-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ignited</a> worries about its relation with the digitalization of the U.S. dollar. However, the Federal Reserve has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/not-related-to-a-digital-currency-us-central-bank-addresses-concerns-over-fednow-payment-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">denied</a> these allegations, stating that Fednow &#8220;is neither a form of currency nor a step toward eliminating any form of payment, including cash.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others have also railed against the effects of a Fed-issued CBDC. Economist Jim Rickards recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-jim-rickards-warns-of-a-cbdc-supported-social-credit-system-in-the-us-it-can-happen-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned</a> about how tissuing a digital dollar could support creating a China-like social credit system. Presidential Candidate John F. Kennedy Jr. referred to this topic, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kennedy-jr-government-could-ban-seize-bitcoin-cbdcs-could-lead-to-financial-slavery-political-tyranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a> that a &#8220;CBDC tied to digital ID and social credit score will allow the government to freeze your assets or limit your spending to approved vendors if you fail to comply.&#8221;</p>

It makes mistakes,” the billionaire stressed, adding that if the SEC had taken a similar approach to Japan, no one in the U.S. would have lost money when the crypto exchange FTX collapsed.</strong></p>
<h2>Mark Cuban Criticizes SEC and US Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p>Shark Tank star and the owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, has slammed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for choosing a wrong path to regulate the crypto sector.</p>
<p>Many crypto proponents have criticized the SEC and its chairman, Gary Gensler, for taking an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-enforcement-remains-focused-on-crypto-chair-gensler-says-hes-impressed-with-enforcement-results/">enforcement-centric</a> approach to regulating the crypto sector. The securities regulator recently took action against major crypto exchanges, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">Coinbase</a> and .</p>
<p>Cuban emphasized that the SEC “chose to litigate to regulate.” He stated, “You need to face the fact of the matter that crypto is one more technology that will succeed or fail based on its merits,” adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s the SEC that chose the wrong path to regulate crypto and cost billions. The SEC is not infallible. It makes mistakes. In this case, it chose the wrong course.</p></blockquote>
<p>While many people in the crypto sector have urged the SEC to provide clear rules for crypto firms to comply with regulations, SEC Chairman Gensler has repeatedly said that the law is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gensler-insists-most-crypto-tokens-are-securities-says-the-law-is-clear/">already clear</a> and existing frameworks are sufficient to regulate crypto.</p>
<p>Gensler has also said many times that crypto lending and trading platforms should come in and register. However, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong insisted that he and his exchange tried to register but it was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-ceo-responds-to-sec-lawsuit-accusing-crypto-exchange-of-securities-law-violations/">not possible</a> to do so.</p>
<p>Commenting on Gensler insisting that the existing SEC regulatory framework is sufficient to regulate crypto, Cuban opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was arrogant in thinking that its framework covered every possible situation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Several Southeast Asian countries are viewed as more friendly towards cryptocurrencies compared to the U.S., resulting in a growing number of entrepreneurs leaving the country. Venture capitalist Tim Draper, famed for predicting that the price of bitcoin would <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tim-draper-adjusts-timeframe-for-his-250k-bitcoin-price-forecast/">reach $250K</a> this year, for example, recently stated: &#8220;I think we’ve got a real problem because the SEC has been spreading fear and all of the innovators are leaving the country … This regulation by enforcement makes no sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Dallas Mavericks owner highlighted the contrast between the regulatory strategies of the U.S. SEC and the approach adopted by Japan&#8217;s regulator for the crypto industry. Cuban pointed out that when crypto exchange FTX crashed, “no one in FTX Japan lost money.” The Shark Tank star stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the USA/SEC had followed their example by setting clear regulations that required the separation of customer and business funds and clear wallet requirements, no one here would have lost money on FTX.</p></blockquote>
<p>The billionaire further explained: &#8220;In Japan, they were very loud in saying the obvious, that FTX wasn&#8217;t a crypto issue, it was a fraud issue.&#8221; He detailed that the best way to prevent crypto fraud is to &#8220;Set bright-line investor protection regulations, like Japan, that detail the protections required and require registration to confirm adherence. Anyone who doesn&#8217;t register is de-facto in violation, can&#8217;t operate and will be shut down. That&#8217;s how you protect crypto investors. The SEC has it wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, Cuban <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/billionaire-mark-cuban-offers-suggestions-on-how-sec-should-regulate-crypto/">offered advice</a> on how the SEC could regulate the crypto industry. He outlined the idea of implementing a crypto-specific registration process. In addition, he suggested that the SEC could develop a token registration framework to accommodate different types of tokens.</p>

Meanwhile, Putin shared that </strong><strong>more than 80 percent of commercial transactions between Russia and China are carried out in Russian rubles and Chinese yuan.</strong></p>
<h2>Putin: Use of National Currencies in Settlements Is Expanding</h2>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin took part in a virtual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation&#8217;s (SCO) Heads of State Council on Tuesday. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired the meeting. It was also attended by Kazakhstan&#8217;s President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s President Sadyr Japarov, Pakistan&#8217;s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Tajikistan&#8217;s President Emomali Rahmon, Uzbekistan&#8217;s President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, and Iran&#8217;s President Ebrahim Raisi.</p>
<p>“We intend to further deepen ties with the members of the Shanghai Organization, and these ties are becoming stronger and more multifaceted,” Putin said at the summit (translated by Google). “Russia&#8217;s trade with the association&#8217;s member states last year increased by more than a third, 37 percent, reaching a record $263 billion. And in January-April of this year, it added another 35 percent,” the Russian leader continued, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>The use of national currencies in mutual settlements is expanding. For example, more than 80 percent of commercial transactions between Russia and the People&#8217;s Republic of China are carried out in rubles and yuan. The share of the Russian currency in export transactions with all SCO countries in 2022 exceeded 40 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Russia takes an active part in the implementation of the SCO road map on the transition to national currencies in mutual trade, approved at the previous summit in Samarkand in Uzbekistan. It is important to continue this work, to take coordinated measures to remove regulatory barriers, establish the necessary payment infrastructure, and create an independent financial system,” Putin emphasized.</p>
<p>He also congratulated Iranian President Raisi on Iran becoming a full member of the SCO and expressed Russia’s support for Belarus to join the SCO as rapidly as possible.</p>
<h2>Xi Considers It Essential to Increase Share of Settlements in National Currencies</h2>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping stated at the opening of the SCO summit (translated by Tass):</p>
<blockquote><p>I consider it essential to increase the share of settlements in national currencies within the organization … We need to strengthen cooperation on sovereign digital currencies and work on establishing the SCO Development Bank.</p></blockquote>
<p>Countries worldwide are increasingly advocating for the use of their national currencies in trade settlements, shifting away from the U.S. dollar. The adoption of the Chinese yuan for trade settlements has gained momentum among some nations. Last week, the central bank of Argentina officially included the yuan as a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-allows-banks-to-open-yuan-accounts-economist-says-it-could-boost-chinese-currency-as-safe-haven-alternative-to-us-dollar/">recognized currency</a> for making deposits in bank accounts.</p>
<p>The BRICS group (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) is leading a global de-dollarization trend. The economic bloc also has a proposal for a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/expert-claims-proposed-brics-common-currency-poised-to-undermine-us-dollar-dominance/">common currency</a> that many expect to erode the dominance of the U.S. dollar if successfully adopted. Recently, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/10-southeast-asian-nations-challenge-dollar-dominance-with-push-for-local-currencies/">ASEAN members</a> also agreed to increase the use of national currencies in trade settlements.</p>

According to the creators of the concept, it can reduce the costs of inscriptions for Ordinal collections by over 90%. The launchpad Luminex, which announced the BRC69 token standard, insists that the &#x201C;brilliance of BRC69 lies in its simplicity.&#x201D;</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>BRC69 Token Standard Aims to Enhance Efficiency of Ordinal Inscriptions on Bitcoin</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
There have been several new concepts created on top of the Bitcoin blockchain via Ordinal inscription technology, and things have progressed further with the advent of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ordinal-inscriptions-surge-past-13-million-amid-game-changing-recursive-inscription-upgrade/">recursive inscriptions</a>. On Monday, the crypto startup <a href="https://luminex.io/">Luminex</a>, a firm that helps projects initiate launchpads, <a href="https://twitter.com/luminexio/status/1675832800761778183?s=20">revealed</a> the BRC69 token standard on Twitter.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;Today, we&#x2019;re excited to introduce BRC69, a revolutionary standard for creating Recursive Ordinals collections with ease,&#x201D; Luminex stated. &#x201C;This standard will be instrumental in launching Recursive collections on Bitcoin.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Luminex also shared the BRC69 token standard&#x2019;s Github, which discloses that the proposed standard employs recursive inscriptions to enhance the efficiency of inscribing on Bitcoin through the Ordinals protocol. By adopting this standard, onchain functionalities like pre-reveal collection launching and onchain reveals can become more accessible and captivating. The breakthrough lies in the automatic rendering of images on the Ordinals explorer, eliminating the need for extra steps.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-596313 size-full" title="New BRC69 Token Standard Promises 90% Savings for Bitcoin's Ordinal Inscriptions" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lum.jpg" alt="New BRC69 Token Standard Promises 90% Savings for Bitcoin's Ordinal Inscriptions" width="1280" height="500" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lum-300x117.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lum-1024x400.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lum-768x300.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lum.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px">&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Consequently, the Github summary says, costs are optimized, while the potential for engaging experiences is maximized. &#x201C;As the Ordinals protocol gains traction, more users are inscribing data into non-fungible Ordinals collections on Bitcoin,&#x201D; Luminex details. &#x201C;This increased usage has led to a higher demand for Bitcoin block space, subsequently causing a rise in Bitcoin network fees.&#x201D; The crypto startup added:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>In order to continue encouraging creators to launch their innovative ideas on the Bitcoin blockchain, we must optimize the current standard for launching Image Ordinals Collections.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
Recursive inscriptions enhance the efficiency of inscriptions by enabling interconnectedness among them. Luminex detailed that with the BRC69 standard, it can &#x201C;reduce the costs of inscriptions for Ordinals collections by over 90% &#x2014; This reduction is achieved through a 4-step process: (1) inscribe traits, (2) deploy collection, (3) compile collection, and (4) mint assets.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
At the time of writing, &#x200B;&#x200B;there have been <a href="https://ordinals.com/inscription/231a29bb7508e4be7d40139f43ffb34955aa89dfc0c789adea7fe97d0d626f15i0">14,685,362</a> Ordinal inscriptions minted on the Bitcoin blockchain. Furthermore, a token standard called BRC20 was created, and to date, there are more than 35,500 BRC20 tokens. According to <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis">statistics</a> collected by Dune Analytics, miners have collected 1,806.44 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, worth $56.14 million using today&#x2019;s <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> exchange rates.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<em><strong>What are your thoughts on the BRC69 token standard and its potential to reduce the cost and accessibility of Ordinal collections on the Bitcoin blockchain?</strong></em></p>

<h2>Stark Slams CBDC Creation</h2>
<p>Former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official John Reed Stark criticized cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in a lengthy tweet on Tuesday. Stark is currently president of cybersecurity firm John Reed Stark Consulting. He founded and served as chief of the SEC Office of Internet Enforcement for 11 years. He was also an SEC enforcement attorney for 15 years.</p>
<p>The longterm crypto skeptic wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The creation of a CBDC is perhaps the most absurd financial idea in the history of monetary policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>He argued: “First off, just like crypto and stablecoins, you must begin by answering the question of what problem does a CBDC actually solve. Why do we need a CBDC? There is no answer to that question.”</p>
<p>The former SEC official opined: “There already exists a litany of digital currencies that work incredibly well and are also trusted because they are regulated, audited and overseen by democratic government authorities and run by regulated, FDIC or SIPC-insured, U.S. registered financial institutions.”</p>
<p>He then criticized politicians and lawmakers who have voiced their support for crypto innovations, stating: “What is so incredibly disturbing is that under the auspices of ‘innovation,’ some politicians will preach the gospel of crypto while not only completely, ignoring crypto’s dire externalities, but also failing to understand that crypto is not innovative at all.”</p>
<p>Stark proceeded to caution about the risks of a central bank digital currency. &#8220;The risks of a CBDC remain myriad and raise a variety of important policy questions, including how a CIBC might affect financial sector market structure, the cost and availability of credit, the safety and stability of the financial system and the efficacy of monetary policy,&#8221; he detailed.</p>
<p>Concurring with Professor Hilary Allen of the American University Washington College of Law (AUWCL), who testified about stablecoins and CBDCs before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in December last year, Stark stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Not only does a CBDC create a multitude of unnecessary risks relating to global financial systemic stability, but a CBDC also opens up a Pandora’s box of global financial privacy problems, conflicts and cybersecurity concerns.</p></blockquote>
<p>He concluded: “The bottom line: The mammoth costs and challenges of creating a CBDC could not possibly be worth the risks and costs associated with actually having a CBDC.”</p>
<p>The former SEC internet enforcement chief agreed with U.S. Senator <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-introduces-bill-to-ban-direct-to-consumer-central-bank-digital-currency/">Ted Cruz</a> (R-TX) who launched a bill in March &#8220;to prohibit the Federal Reserve from developing a direct-to-consumer” central bank digital currency. “Whatever his rationale, Senator Ted Cruz gets it right with his CBDC prohibitive legislation — it’s a bad idea that needs to be stopped dead in its tracks,” Stark emphasized.</p>
<p>Several other lawmakers have introduced CBDC-related bills. In February, U.S. Congressman <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmaker-launches-cbdc-anti-surveillance-state-act-to-protect-americans-right-to-financial-privacy/">Tom Emmer</a> (R-MN) introduced the Central Bank Digital Currency Anti-Surveillance State Act “to halt efforts of unelected bureaucrats” from “stripping Americans of their right to financial privacy.” U.S. Congressman <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-halt-federal-reserves-digital-dollar-testing-citing-concerns-for-american-liberties/">Alex Mooney</a> (R-WV) announced in May that he has introduced the Digital Dollar Pilot Prevention Act that prohibits the Federal Reserve from establishing, carrying out, or approving a program intended to test the practicability of issuing a CBDC. Several states have also resisted CBDCs. Florida Governor <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/governor-ron-desantis-signs-bill-prohibiting-use-of-central-bank-digital-currencies-in-florida/">Ron DeSantis</a>, for example, signed legislation in May that bans the use of a central bank digital currency in his state.</p>

The records indicate that between March and May 2023, roughly $5.17 million in legal fees were billed to the estate.</strong></p>
<h2>Lawyers and Restructuring Officers Are Profiting From the Slew of Crypto Bankruptcy Cases</h2>
<p>Lawyers for Voyager&#8217;s creditor committee <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x193/11753/PLEADINGS/1175307042380000000001.pdf">unveiled</a> the legal costs concerning the company&#8217;s ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, which began in July 2022, on July 3, 2023. According to the filing, the third interim fee period (March-May 2023) has a compensation request of $5.17 million. The document states that this is the final provisional fee application invoiced by the law firm McDermott Will &amp; Emery LLP.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the filing asserts that the court granted the interim compensation order on August 4, 2022. The attorneys explain that Voyager&#8217;s Chapter 11 case was &#8220;the first to commence following a series of events in the cryptocurrency industry, which are collectively known as the &#8216;crypto winter.'&#8221; McDermott details that throughout the fee period, their litigation team advised the committee in all aspects of the Chapter 11 cases, including a variety of complex matters, which the committee took to maximize recoveries for general unsecured creditors.</p>
<p>Responsibilities included counseling the committee, participating in meetings and negotiations, and &#8220;taking all necessary action to protect and preserve the interests of the committee.&#8221; In April, Voyager Digital was also <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x193/11753/PLEADINGS/1175306282380000000008.pdf">billed $1.1 million</a> in legal fees by its law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis. Attorneys from Celsius, 3AC, Voyager, and FTX are reportedly reaping significant financial rewards as a result of these bankruptcy cases. John J. Ray III, CEO of FTX, is said to be earning <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/ftx-ceo-john-ray-is-making-1300-an-hour/441235">$1,300 hourly</a> supervising his firm&#8217;s bankruptcy and restructuring.</p>
