<p>Circle to launch USDC Stablecoin on top of Arbitrum</p>
<p>"USDC issued by Circle will be native to Arbitrum and will be considered the official version of USDC for the Arbitrum ecosystem. Over time, native USDC liquidity will grow and replace the currently circulating 'bridged USDC' liquidity that comes from Ethereum." announced Circle in their statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arbitrum will be renaming the Ethereum-bridged version of USDC on block explorers, and it will now be known as USDC.e. The firm also announced that there would be an outreach to ecosystem applications that will make the same change within their in-application user interfaces and other documentation.</p>
<p>Moreover, Circle noted numerous benefits of the native USDC launch on Arbitrum, such as the upcoming support by the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), which will eliminate bridge withdrawal delays. There will be an upgradable smart contract for any future improvements by the company and the possibility for institutional on and off-ramps, with other perks.&nbsp;</p>
