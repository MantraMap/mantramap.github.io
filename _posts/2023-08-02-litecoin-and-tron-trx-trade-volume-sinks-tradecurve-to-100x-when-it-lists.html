<p class="s6">Tradecurve (TCRV) is considered one such rare project, with which you can mint millions in the crypto industry.Therefore, its ongoing presale is getting oversubscribed during each stage. On the other hand, Litecoin (LTC) and TRON (TRX) are swinging wildly, making their holders nervous.</p>
<p class="s6">The crypto market is intrinsically volatile, but you can get some enormous returns on your investment if you choose a stable, and growth-oriented project.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Litecoin&rsquo;s (LTC) Trade Volume Sinks
<p class="s6">Amid the current dwindling market, Litecoin (LTC) has not been able to put up a strong performance. As per the data from Tradingview, the trading volume on the Litecoin network has been declining.</p>
<p class="s6">Subsequently, the price of Litecoin has tumbled, with its exchange rate falling by 18% in the past week. Currently, Litecoin is being traded at $72.58. Experts say that Litecoin&rsquo;s market health has worsened since the SEC described LTC as a security.</p>
<p class="s6">Thus, the hype around Litecoin&rsquo;s upcoming halving event has waned. Although the Litecoin community hopes to see a price rebound ahead of the halving event scheduled in August, the fading hype around it may hurt LTC in the long run.</p>
TRON (TRX) And DWF Labs Join Hands
<p class="s6">TRON (TRX) has been suffering with selloff pressure for the past many days. Subsequently, Tron&rsquo;s value on exchanges has taken a toll. The trading price of TRON has nosedived by more than 10% in the past seven days.</p>
<p class="s6">At the time of writing, TRON is changing hands at $0.0695. Meanwhile, to sustain its network growth and prevent the price from falling further, TRON has entered into a strategic partnership with DWF Labs.</p>
<p class="s6">Through this collaboration, DWF Labs will act as a liquidity provider for TRON. However, experts believe that TRON will not be able to get any immediate relief with this partnership.</p>
Tradecurve Shows Bullish Path To Dwindling Market
<p class="s6">After the collapse of the FTX exchange, which wiped out $2 billion in customer funds, traders have become apprehensive about the credibility of centralized exchanges. The situation has worsened with the latest lawsuits filed against well-established platforms like Binance and Coinbase. Therefore, traders are jumping ships to register on the Tradecurve (TCRV) exchange.</p>
<p class="s6">It is a new decentralized trading platform, which is set to enter the top 3 crypto exchanges list. The platform enables people to trade various classes of assets on a single platform, without relying on fiat payments.</p>
<p class="s6">To assure traders of their anonymity and privacy, Tradecurve has not implemented any KYC procedure on the platform. This makes it one of the first such crypto exchanges, eclipsing other centralized platforms like Coinbase, where users are mandated to input their sensitive details. It has also implemented 2FA security, and DeFi capabilities to ensure the protection of traders.</p>
<p class="s6">The platform offers many benefits to its token holders, including exclusive deposit bonuses, discounts on transaction fees, and high leverage starting from 500:1. The platform&rsquo;s presale stage 5 is live, and a token is now available for $0.025. The project&rsquo;s market value has been pegged to grow by 80x in the next few months.</p>
