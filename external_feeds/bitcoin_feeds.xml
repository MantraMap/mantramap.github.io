Ethereum-based NFTs made a significant contribution, accounting for 56.35% of the total weekly sales, or roughly $60.23 million, a modest 0.98% climb from the week before.</strong></p>
<h2>From Ethereum to Draftkings: Unpacking a Week of NFT Sales</h2>
<p>The past week marked a small uptick in NFT sales, rising 6.59% higher than the preceding week, with the total reaching $106.87 million according to <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/">metrics</a> provided by cryptoslam.io. Ethereum-based NFTs led the market, capturing $60.23 million, while Polygon-based NFTs took second place in weekly sales, commanding $13 million &#x2014; an increase of 92.07% over the previous week.</p>
<p>Solana&#x2019;s NFT sales seized just over $9 million, a 30.54% rise from the previous week. Following Solana, Mythos, Immutable X, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> Chain, and Bitcoin rounded out the list. Bitcoin-based NFT sales settled in the seventh position for the week, capturing $2.7 million. However, the seven-day sales from <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> dipped 24.90% lower than the previous week. Tezos made a notable stride, jumping 50.44% higher, yet only contributed a mere $376,024 to the week&#x2019;s NFT sales.</p>
<p>This week&#x2019;s crown for the top-selling NFT collection went to <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/draft-kings">Draftkings</a> issued on Polygon, with a staggering $7,891,650 in sales. Trailing behind were <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/dmarket">Dmarket</a> ($6.17M), <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/degods-ethereum">Degods</a> ($5.03M), <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/gods-unchained-cards">Gods Unchained</a> ($4.85M), and <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/bored-ape-yacht-club">Bored Ape Yacht Club</a> ($4.46M). The Draftkings collection experienced a remarkable 359.51% rise since last week, while Degods&#x2019; sales soared by 113.88%. Other collections that witnessed notable gains included Tensorian Shards ($1.89M) and Y00ts ($1.25M).</p>

<p>The past week&#x2019;s top-selling NFT was the <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/clonex/mint/11164">Clonex NFT #9,418</a>, fetching $360K just a day ago. Cryptopunk #4,757 claimed the second spot, selling for $326K about four days ago, and the third position went to Autoglyphs #203, selling for $304K. Interestingly, all five of the week&#x2019;s top-selling NFTs were Ethereum-based. In fact, the week&#x2019;s top 30 sold NFTs were all crafted atop the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

Within this ravaged financial terrain, one specific category â€” rebase tokens â€” suffered a tremendous deflation in worth over the previous 20 months. In a stark illustration of this downturn, the total value of the leading rebase tokens, once exceeding $8 billion in November 2021, has now plummeted to a mere $351 million.</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Winter Chills Rebase Tokens: A $7.68 Billion Loss in Value</h2>
<p>In 2021, the rebase token economy soared to an impressive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211121162057/https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/rebase-tokens">$8.03 billion</a>, concurrent with the crypto economy&#8217;s monumental valuation of $2.78 trillion. Fast forward to the present, and the crypto economy has contracted to $1.21 trillion, with a significant portion of value having been drained from the rebase token economy during 2022â€™s bear market cycle.</p>
<p>At their core, rebase tokens represent a category of cryptocurrencies capable of modifying their supply through a mechanism known as rebasing. This distinctive class of tokens strives to meet specific price targets or other financial objectives by dynamically altering the supply of tokens.</p>
<p>Having soared to heights exceeding $8 billion in November 2021, the rebase economy has since experienced a precipitous downfall, shedding a staggering $7.68 billion in value. A mere 20 months ago, Olympus DAO&#8217;s token OHM commanded a price of $856 per unit, while Wonderland&#8217;s token TIME boasted a value of $8,962 per coin.</p>
<p>As the calendar pages turned to August 11, 2023, <a href="https://archive.ph/p0L8w">archived data</a> reveals a dramatic shift: OHM has plummeted to $10.60 per coin, and TIME has tumbled to $13.60. OHM, once the titan of the rebase tokens with a market capitalization of $3.99 billion, retains its crown today, despite sliding to a modest $191 million.</p>

<p>TIME, which once comfortably held the second position with a market valuation of $2.05 billion, has now descended to the seventh spot, reduced to a mere $12.23 million. Positioned between TIME and OHM in the digital currency hierarchy are coins such as TEMPLE, SB, AMPL, FHM, and KLIMA.</p>
<p>The market has been brutal to several of these assets; TEMPLE has retreated 68.76% from its all-time high, while AMPL has declined by 73.55% from its peak. The data paints a detailed picture of OHM&#8217;s presence, with 26.66 million tokens spread across 6,927 unique addresses. 17,939,074 OHM is circulating today and Olympus DAO claims the liquid backing toward OHM is $11.34 per OHM.</p>

<p>OHM&#8217;s activity is further evidenced by a total of 365,981 transfers, with the Olympus DAO wallet holding 62.79% of the existing supply. On the other side, Wonderland&#8217;s TIME flaunts a circulating tally of 51,970,826.48 coins, held in 33,648 distinct addresses. A staggering 99.93% of this vast supply is nestled within the Wonderland TIME staking address.</p>
<p>Despite the severe decimation that rebase tokens have endured, reducing their value to a meager $351 million, this figure resonates like a faint heartbeat within the broader crypto economy â€” a landscape that has exhibited a more robust recovery. While rebase tokens languish, the greater digital currency world has demonstrated resilience, healing at a pace that outstrips the rebase token economyâ€™s slow recovery of rebase tokens.</p>

The rally began as a result of the hopes surrounding its upcoming layer 2 launch. Dogecoin also extended recent gains to start the weekend.</strong></p>
<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h2>
<p>Shiba inu (SHIB) was one of the notable gainers during Saturdayâ€™s session, as price surged to a multi-month high.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.00001001 on Friday, SHIB/USD rallied to a peak of $0.00001127 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The move came as SHIB surged for a fifth straight day, climbing to its strongest point since April in the process.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the latest rally occurred as the relative strength index (RSI) moved past a ceiling of 65.00.</p>
<p>Currently, price strength is at a reading of 74.27, with the next visible resistance zone at the 76.00 mark.</p>
<p>Should bulls hit this target, SHIB could possibly hit $0.00001200.</p>

<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) also raced higher during the weekend, as it too remained in the green for a fifth consecutive session.</p>
<p>DOGE/USD jumped to an intraday high of $0.07715 on Saturday, which came after a low of $0.07517 the day prior.</p>
<p>This resulted in the cryptocurrency climbing to its strongest level since August 2, when price peaked at $0.0786.</p>

<p>Similar to shiba inu, the dogecoin move came as price strength broke out of a resistance level of 55.00.</p>
<p>A ceiling of 60.00 now awaits bulls, in the event they are able to maintain this weekâ€™s momentum.</p>

The cryptocurrency continues to hover around a key support level, without either bulls or bears taking control. Ethereum was also marginally higher.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) returned to the green on Saturday, as traders of the cryptocurrency rejected a breakout of a key price level.</p>
<p>Following a low of $29,253.52 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD rose to an intraday peak of $29,517.77 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>The move comes as the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency by market cap began to consolidate, following a recent move above $30,000.</p>

<p>Bitcoin surged earlier this week, as markets reacted to Moody&#x2019;s downgrading the credit rating of several U.S. banks.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s consolidation occurred just as the relative strength index (RSI) flatlined around a support point near 49.00.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is now tracking at a reading of 48.70, with earlier gains in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> somewhat fading.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Additionally, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was also marginally higher to start the weekend, snapping a three-day losing streak in the process.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD peaked at $1,855.07 so far during Saturday&#x2019;s session, following Friday&#x2019;s low at the $1,839.57 level.</p>
<p>This is the first time since Tuesday that ethereum has climbed higher, and comes as profit taking from this week&#x2019;s high seems to have ended.</p>

<p>In order for momentum to once again shift, ethereum will need to break out of a ceiling at 50.00 on the RSI.</p>
<p>Price strength is currently tracking at 47.45.</p>

While some providers have already applied patches, others are still vulnerable.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitforge Vulnerabilities Disclosed</h2>
<p>Fireblocks, a cryptocurrency assets security and consulting company, has publicly disclosed Bitforge is facing a set of wallet vulnerabilities potentially affecting millions of customers. While the Fireblocks team discovered these issues back in May, it just announced their existence in a <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-23/briefings/schedule/#small-leaks-billions-of-dollars-practical-cryptographic-exploits-that-undermine-leading-crypto-wallets-32268" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presentation</a> titled &#8220;Small Leaks, Billions Of Dollars: Practical Cryptographic Exploits That Undermine Leading Crypto Wallets&#8221; as part of the Blackhat 2023 conference.</p>
<p>These vulnerabilities attack the Multi-Party Computation (MPC) algorithms of several vendors. The first vulnerability is related to GG18 and GG20, two protocols qualified by Fireblocks as &#8220;pioneering for the MPC wallet industry&#8221; and &#8220;widely adopted by companies in the space.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/blog/gg18-and-gg20-paillier-key-vulnerability-technical-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exploit</a> allows criminals to exfiltrate the private key and take control of the cryptocurrency in the attacked wallet. Fireblocks also presented a proof-of-concept for this attack.</p>
<p>Similarly, the second vulnerability deals with Lindell17, a signing protocol. Fireblocks states this exploit &#8220;originates from Lindell17 implementations deviating from the specification of the academic paper and ignoring or mishandling aborts in case of failed signatures.&#8221;</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/blog/lindell17-abort-vulnerability-technical-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vulnerability</a> was discovered in the Zengo wallet and later confirmed to work against Coinbase Wallet as a Service (WAAS), as in open-source protocol implementations. Zengo and Coinbase have already patched their wallets to deal with this exploit.</p>
<p>Jeff Lunglhofer, Chief Information Security Officer at Coinbase, thanked Fireblocks for the timely disclosure, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/new-bitforge-cryptocurrency-wallet-flaws-lets-hackers-steal-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">telling</a> Bleeping Computer that &#8220;while Coinbase customers and funds were never at risk, maintaining a fully trustless cryptographic model is an important aspect of any MPC implementation.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Vulnerability Checker</h2>
<p>Due to the number of wallets potentially affected by this set of vulnerabilities, Fireblocks has built a utility to allow wallet providers and users to check if their wallets can be exploited using these vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>At the time, only <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-urges-court-to-dismiss-sec-case-claiming-regulator-overstepped-its-statutory-authority/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> and Zengo are listed as secure against the Lindell17 exploit. Fireblocks <a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/BitForge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that not all wallet providers are shown because &#8220;it&#8217;s part of the DNA of the industry to work together to be stronger out of the public eye rather than calling companies out publicly and harming their credibility.&#8221;</p>

The leader suggested that the optimism which ensued after Tinubuâ€™s government floated the naira has now given way to pessimism.</strong></p>
<h2>The Naira&#8217;s Woes</h2>
<p>The president of the Association of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON), Aminu Gwadabe, has reportedly asked the Nigerian government to consider banning the crypto giant Binance. Gwadabe insisted that the crypto exchange platform is partly to blame for Nigeriaâ€™s persistent currency woes which have now seen the naira fall to a record low versus the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>The remarks by Gwadabe suggest that both the Bola Ahmed Tinubu government and some key players in Nigeria&#8217;s foreign exchange market are seeking to loosen the top crypto exchangeâ€™s stranglehold on the Nigerian market. To illustrate, sometime in early June it was widely<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nigerian-regulator-labels-binance-affiliates-local-operations-illegal/"> reported</a> that the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission had banned Binance Nigeria Limited, the crypto exchangeâ€™s supposed affiliate.</p>
<p>However, following the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cz-says-binance-has-issued-a-cease-and-desist-notice-against-nigerian-scammer-entity/">revelations</a> that Binance Nigeria Limited had no relationship with Binance, the SEC was forced to issue another <a href="https://sec.gov.ng/warning-against-investing-with-binance/">prohibition order</a> which barred any entity using the name Binance from operating in the East African state. The regulator also warned residents against using the platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p>Meanwhile, in remarks published by the Peopleâ€™s Gazette, Gwadabe highlighted Binanceâ€™s perceived dominance and how this poses a threat to the Nigerian economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you know about Binance, you will know that Binance trading is becoming the anchorage of both the investors and exporters window and the parallel market, which is unfortunate. So, we have to do something that can stop Binance. Itâ€™s a competition. We need to ban Binance and the only way to do so is if you have liquidity,&#8221; explained Gwadabe.</p>
<p>The ABCON president added that the optimism which ensued after Tinubuâ€™s government floated the naira, has now given way to pessimism.</p>

Over a dozen Russian banks are going to take part in the trials with real transactions and users scheduled to commence in mid-August.</strong></p>
<h2>Russia Prepares to Pilot Operations With New Digital Ruble</h2>
<p>Financial authorities and institutions in the Russian Federation are gearing up to start testing the countryâ€™s central bank digital currency (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDC</a>) in actual <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-to-launch-digital-ruble-transactions-with-real-users-in-august/">transactions between real users</a>. The trials are set to begin on Aug. 15.</p>
<p>Around 600 people and 30 companies will participate in the initial stage of the pilot, First Deputy Chair of the Central Bank of Russia, Olga Skorobogatova, unveiled at a press conference, quoted by the crypto news outlet Bits.media.</p>
<p>After verifying all operations conducted by the first group, the number of participants will be increased, she added. The tests will be carried out in 11 Russian cities, including Moscow where digital ruble transactions will be launched in the public transportation system.</p>
<p>The capital cityâ€™s subway has been a testing site for innovations, noted Maxim Liksutov, deputy mayor for transport. Local authorities plan to launch ticket sales for digital rubles in the Moscow metro and eventually introduce CBDC payments in other types of urban transportation, he added.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Skorobogatova revealed that 13 Russian banks will join the digital ruble pilot. During the briefing, First Deputy Chairman of the Board of Sovcombank, Sergey Khotimsky, said that commercial banks are also going to compete with the digital ruble platform, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>We will try to do the same as it was in the case of cash, when banks created services and introduced mechanisms to make non-cash money more profitable and interesting. And we will continue to do so.</p></blockquote>
<p>Khotimsky emphasized that Russian banking institutions would like the bank account to remain Russiansâ€™ main account. Officials have previously made it clear that the digital ruble, as the third form of Russian fiat, is meant to complement, not replace, paper cash or electronic bank money.</p>
<p>Legislation regulating the introduction of Russiaâ€™s central bank digital currency was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-state-duma-passes-digital-ruble-law/">adopted</a> by both houses of parliament in July. Also last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/putin-signs-digital-ruble-law-allowing-cbdc-payments-in-russia/">signed</a> the digital ruble bill into law opening the way for CBDC payments in the country.</p>

In a recent article, Brooks and Calomiris call for regulations to allow stablecoin issuers to have the clarity needed for the assets to thrive.</strong></p>
<h2>Stablecoins Might Help the U.S. Dollar Maintain Its Reserve Currency Status</h2>
<p>Brian Brooks, former U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, and Charles Calomiris, former chief economist of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/stablecoins-can-help-keep-the-dollar-the-worlds-reserve-currency-yuan-china-ef1047c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued</a> an op-ed article explaining how stablecoins could contribute to maintaining the status of the dollar as a reserve currency.</p>
<p>Brooks and Calomiris detail that stablecoins can be significant tools in the fight against worldwide de-dollarization, serving as catalysts for the demand for dollars for citizens in developing countries, even when their governments do not support dollarization per se.</p>
<p>They cite Argentina and Venezuela as examples of countries facing extremely high inflation levels with governments taking measures to cut dollar dependency, but whose citizens use dollars to protect their incomes and savings from losing value while stored in their national currencies.</p>
<p>In this sense, they explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Faced with the dismal prospect of saving their wages in local currency stored in local bank accounts, more citizens of high-inflation countries are opting to use dollar-backed stablecoins as a synthetic savings account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, referring to the recent decline in the usage of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, Brooks and Calomiris explain the problems that a de-dollarized world might bring the U.S., stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A de-dollarized world would damage the U.S. The dollarâ€™s reserve status reduces U.S. borrowing costs, which is crucial in an era when government borrowing and spending are at a record high and still climbing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Regulation Seen as Necessary</h2>
<p>Brooks and Calomiris raise a timely issue: regulation is necessary for these instruments to thrive and grow. They refer to the bill backed by Rep. Patrick McHenry, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, as a significant part of the puzzle to bring stablecoins to the mainstream level.</p>
<p>They stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is why Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenryâ€™s bill to regulate stablecoins is vital. It would establish federal and state oversight for stablecoin issuers, impose qualifications for reserve assets, and implement rules on redemptions and public disclosure.</p>
</blockquote>

The business intelligence firm now holds 152,800 bitcoins, acquired for a total cost of $4.53 billion, and it has plans to buy even more.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Microstrategy&#x2019;s Stock Outperforms Bitcoin, S&P500, Nasdaq, Gold, Silver</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The stock of business intelligence firm Microstrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) has risen 206% since the company adopted its bitcoin strategy, Executive Chairman Michael Saylor stated on Twitter Friday. He tweeted:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>Three years ago today Microstrategy announced that it had adopted bitcoin as its Primary Treasury Reserve Asset, purchasing 21,454 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> for $250 million, or ~$11,653 per bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
Microstrategy adopted its bitcoin strategy on Aug. 10, 2020. In comparison, during the same time period, bitcoin has experienced a 145% increase, while the S&P 500 has risen 33% and the Nasdaq 25%, according to a chart Saylor shared on Twitter. Meanwhile, gold has seen a decline of 5%, and silver has decreased 19%.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Blackrock, the world&#x2019;s largest asset manager, is a major shareholder of Microstrategy. In February, Blackrock disclosed that it owns 760,000 shares of Microstrategy Incorporated, which represents 8.1% of the company. The asset manager is also trying to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">launch</a> a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Earlier this month, Microstrategy disclosed that it now holds <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/microstrategy-increases-bitcoin-holdings-to-152800-btc-plans-to-buy-more-with-750-million-stock-sales/">152,800 bitcoins</a>, acquired for a total cost of $4.53 billion, or $29,672 per <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. The company is also planning to buy more <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> with stock sales of up to $750 million.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Saylor explained in August 2020 that his company&#x2019;s bitcoin strategy &#x201C;seeks to maximize long-term value&#x201D; for shareholders. He described the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency as &#x201C;a dependable store of value and an attractive investment asset with more long-term appreciation potential than holding cash.&#x201D; The executive added: &#x201C;Since its inception over a decade ago, bitcoin has emerged as a significant addition to the global financial system, with characteristics that are useful to both individuals and institutions.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
