Known to be one of the oldest cryptocurrencies in the world, Litecoin (LTC) has been making headlines as it reported record high transaction numbers. According to the altcoinâ€™s official Twitter account, it has serviced 39 million transactions as of December 29.Â  Add on to this the accompanying news that it has also hit second place in the unique addresses metric which grew to 52 million. These very bullish developments led to the token pumping 7% in the weekly timescale, according to Coingecko data.Â  The Litecoin Network completed over 39 million transactions in 2022.
