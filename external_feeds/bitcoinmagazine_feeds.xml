Hydroelectric power is a clean and renewable energy source that is more reliable and cost-effective than other sources, and will help reduce the carbon footprint of the mining operation. Brothers Eduardo Kopper and Roberto Kopper, who are the current owners, will retain the other 20% ownership and will continue to host the bitcoin mining operation. </p><p>“The Toro Dam is located approximately 25 miles from San Jose between two volcano craters,” states the release. “The site generates all its energy from green resources with a proven 98% run time over the years, and has a full-time staff in place under a new Operating &amp; Maintenance Agreement.”</p><p>The move is an example of firms originally outside of Bitcoin mining entering the industry <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/best-time-for-bitcoin-mining-opportunities">amidst a time of opportunity</a>. With the price of Bitcoin ASICs being so far down, and many mining firms readjusting their strategy, well-capitalized businesses could see a major return on investment given the right decisions. Essential to these returns is low-cost energy, of which this project takes advantage. </p><p>“All of our mining sites under development should generate immediate net cash flow to the company during a period when the bitcoin mining sector is down along with the overall capital markets,” said Gary C. Evans, Chairman and CEO of Evergreen Sustainable Enterprises. “Current mining site locations in development exceed six and include Arkansas, Kentucky, and Costa Rica.”<br><br>Eduardo Kopper, commenting on this new arrangement, stated that, “We are anxious to install 300 brand new bitcoin mining machines over the next few months at the Toro location.” Acknowledging the incredible opportunity at hand, he continued, “When the price of Bitcoin starts its upward trajectory, we will be extremely well positioned."<br></p><p>The original Generation Hemp Inc. firm will become a subsidiary of Evergreen, and it will retain its original operations and staff.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMDI2MTUyOTY3Nzc1NDUz/green-sustainable-bitcoin-mining.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung Asset Management To Launch Bitcoin ETF In Hong Kong: Report]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF will launch on Jan. 13, giving Hong Kong investors a mainstream avenue for indirect BTC price exposure.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/samsung-launches-bitcoin-etf-hong-kong</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/samsung-launches-bitcoin-etf-hong-kong</guid><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Samsung]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin ETF]]></category><category><![CDATA[bitcoin futures]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hong Kong]]></category><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Namcios]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 18:23:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3ODUzMTg2MDU3ODc5/samsung-adds-bitcoin-to-smartphone-wallet-app.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF will launch on Jan. 13, giving Hong Kong investors a mainstream avenue for indirect BTC price exposure.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Samsung Asset Management is launching a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Hong Kong.</p><p>The Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF (3135:HK) seeks to obtain a performance similar to spot BTC by investing in bitcoin futures products listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), according to a report by Fortune Korea. Cointelegraph also reported the news earlier on Thursday.</p><p>"Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF is a competitive product that reflects Samsung Asset Management's long-term futures-based ETF know-how and risk management experience," said Park Seong-jin, head of Samsung Asset Management's Hong Kong branch, per a translated version of the <a href="http://www.fortunekorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=25798">Fortune Korea</a> report. "It is a new option for investors who are highly interested in Bitcoin."</p><p>The latest crypto market rout hasn’t deterred Hong Kong from seeking to become a major hub for the industry. Its financial secretary, Paul Chan, <a href="https://time.com/6245551/hong-kong-crypto-hub/">recently reiterated that commitment</a>, adding that Hong Kong will work to attract new businesses from all over the world. The city’s first BTC-linked ETF, the CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/amid-crypto-turmoil-hong-kong-debuts-first-crypto-futures-etfs-2022-12-15/">went live last month</a>.</p><p>An ETF offering for an investment represents a significant mainstream adoption milestone. Freed from the complexity behind the asset itself, institutional and retail investors can enjoy price exposure through a simple, regulated avenue. As such, Samsung’s offering in Hong Kong promises to further expand awareness about bitcoin and access to bitcoin exposure in the region.</p><p>But that doesn't come without intrinsic drawbacks. Although investors can get exposure to fiat price fluctuations of the underlying asset through an ETF, they won’t possess that product itself, being that gold or BTC. And that is a subtle but very important difference, especially for bitcoin. Investors can only take advantage of Bitcoin’s true value proposition of censorship-resistant and sovereign digital money if they choose to purchase and self-custody BTC themselves –– which isn't rocket science, thanks to some <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides">great resources</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3ODUzMTg2MDU3ODc5/samsung-adds-bitcoin-to-smartphone-wallet-app.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin 2023: Build Back Bitcoin]]></title><description><![CDATA[With every bear market, we can build Bitcoin back stronger than ever.

The Bitcoin 2023 conference will be our next chance to do so.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Brandon Green, the chief of staff for BTC Inc and an organizer of the Bitcoin 2023 conference. Bitcoin 2023 and Bitcoin Magazine are both operated by BTC Inc.</em></p><p>If you’re reading this, congratulations, you’ve now experienced a true bitcoin bear market. Yes, the winter is cold, and no it may not warm up for a little while, but it is in these moments, when the freezing air fills your lungs and the ringing in your ears from the noise of the past two years starts to fade, that the entire mission comes back into focus and the signal starts to shine a path in front of you again.</p><p>It is a winter wonderland indeed. And while, somehow, it continues to surprise everyone that winter follows summer, let us not forget that spring is sure to come, too, and it’s best to start preparing for it properly.</p><p>We’ve experienced quite a few of these seasons at Bitcoin Magazine, and it seems like after each cycle, we get a little closer to figuring out how hyperbitcoinization will truly progress, and what we need to do as a community and industry in order to help get us there. Unfortunately, the mechanism by which we figure this out tends to be via pain and harsh lessons.</p><p>In 2013 to 2014, we learned “not your keys, not your coins” as the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/mt-gox-bitcoin-hack-teaches-us-today">largest exchange in all of Bitcoin</a> (by far) collapsed. In 2017 to 2018, we learned how governance should work in a system without defined governance via bitter fork wars. Now, in 2021 to 2023, we’re learning how the introduction of credit and debt cycles affect and distort markets, as well as the various attack vectors introduced by <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-dangers-of-paper-bitcoin">paper bitcoin</a> and IOUs, especially in a system with near-instant settlement.</p><p>Indeed, Bitcoin is taking us through a speedy crash course on the past 2,000-plus years of financial innovation. Anyone following Bitcoin’s trajectory closely can rightly consider him or herself an expert in monetary theory, among other things.</p><p>However, it is not enough to merely learn these lessons.</p><p>In the cold of winter, we do not hibernate; we build. It’s time to take these lessons from the past decade and apply them to the future of the global financial system. Many of the companies and projects helping us do that are already here, fine tuning their offerings and building a robust infrastructure for us to utilize. Many more have not even been imagined yet.</p><p>Bitcoin 2019 was founded four years ago, in the heart of the 2018 bear market on the heels of the bitter civil war. The goal was to “<a href="https://medium.com/@BitcoinMagazine/make-bitcoin-fun-again-47c6837788c3">Make Bitcoin Fun Again</a>”, heal wounds and help craft a path forward for this industry.</p><p>The industry surrounding Bitcoin grew tremendously over the proceeding four years, and our conference was designed to be an enabling force in that growth. Many of today’s Bitcoin-focused companies were founded at our events. Startups were pitched and funded. Companies met with and hired key employees. Business partnerships were forged in our meeting rooms. Products and services (and more!) were announced on our stages. You’d be hard pressed to find a company in our space that didn’t change the trajectory of their business by attending or sponsoring our conference.</p><p>In 2019, the community was divided and Bitcoin hadn’t properly been prioritized in the broader discourse. In 2023, the community is stronger than ever, but the industry surrounding Bitcoin has gotten absolutely rekt. The graveyard of companies that became overextended, overleveraged or outright fraudulent is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/fears-of-further-contagion-in-the-bitcoin-market">huge</a>. There are massive gaps in the products and services those companies created, and massive opportunities to build new products and services with the core tenets of Bitcoin as the focus. We have a unique opportunity to reimagine what a financial system with Bitcoin at its center looks like, and the Bitcoin 2023 conference will be our first chance to come together as a community and do just that.</p><p><a href="https://b.tc/conference">Bitcoin 2023</a> is coming on May 18, 2023. The companies and builders who attend have a chance to be the leaders who shape the future of our industry for years to come. The ideas generated among attendees and speakers can be the underpinnings of the next growth phase of the industry. We will build back with Bitcoin at the core of every product and service on the market. And we will prove to the world that an idea whose time has come cannot be stopped.</p><p>This next epoch will perhaps be the most pivotal to Bitcoin’s success. Bitcoin’s “prove it” moment is upon us, and the whole world is watching. The future of Bitcoin awaits.</p><p>Don’t sit on the sidelines. Enter into the arena.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzODM5Njc4ODI5NDM4NDQ4/bitcoin-cold-winter-ice.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dispatch From Guatemala's Bitcoin Lake, A Bitcoin Community Built On Grassroots Adoption]]></title><description><![CDATA[Just a few hundred miles from El Salvador, Guatemala’s Bitcoin Lake contrasts state-led Bitcoin adoption with a promising grassroots model.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dispatch-from-guatemala-bitcoin-lake</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dispatch-from-guatemala-bitcoin-lake</guid><category><![CDATA[Merchants]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Adoption]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin Lake]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Guatemala]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rikki]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 15:55:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NDE3MDQwMjc3MTIwNjg5/bitcoin-tree.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Just a few hundred miles from El Salvador, Guatemala’s Bitcoin Lake contrasts state-led Bitcoin adoption with a promising grassroots model.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Rikki, author and co-host of the “Bitcoin Italia,” and “Stupefatti” podcasts. He is one half of the Bitcoin Explorers, along with </em><a href="https://twitter.com/Lorinaura"><em>Laura</em></a><em>, who chronicle Bitcoin adoption around the world, one country at a time.</em></p><p>Laura and I <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/revisiting-el-salvador-bitcoin-year-later">continue</a> <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/lessons-from-adoption-bitcoin-el-salvador">our</a> <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/el-salvador-slums-need-bitcoin">adventures</a> <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/ups-and-downs-of-bitcoin-in-el-salvador">in Central America</a> with the aim of gaining an in-depth understanding of the peculiar characteristics of Bitcoin adoption in the very different countries there and reporting it without bias on our YouTube channel, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bitcoinexplorers">Bitcoin Explorers</a>.”</p><p>The great curiosity that grips us after spending more than a month in El Salvador, and leaving it behind, is to try to understand what people think about Bitcoin in countries where there has been no government propaganda, no media coverage and no lousy state app like the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-fixing-chivo-bitcoin-wallet">Chivo wallet</a> to complicate things. Countries where, therefore, adoption is not happening by decree, but solely through the free initiatives of citizens and through the work of private companies that believe in Bitcoin and build products and services on top of its protocol.</p><p>But the question we would like to try to answer is not the simplest one: Is bottom-up Bitcoin adoption better than the top-down adoption theorized by El Salvador President Nayib Bukele?</p><h2>Exploring Grassroots Bitcoin Adoption In Guatemala</h2><p>To find the answer, our latest destination was Guatemala, a country that is, in some ways, very similar to El Salvador. <a href="https://borgenproject.org/exploring-poverty-rate-in-guatemala/">As of 2017</a>, there were 16.5 million inhabitants there, nearly 60% of whom lived below the poverty line, likely unbanked or underbanked, and 23% lived in extreme poverty. At that point, 0.001% of Guatamalans held more than half of the country's wealth. These are ideal conditions for Bitcoin's intrinsic features to be appreciated.</p><p>Unlike El Salvador, however, Guatemalan government policy is not favorable to cryptocurrencies, in fact, it is quite the contrary. Significant laws and regulations have been passed in an attempt to <a href="https://en.centralamericadata.com/en/article/home/Cryptocurrencies_are_Illegal_in_Guatemala">harness the phenomenon and control it</a>.</p><p>Nonetheless, around Lake Atitlán, one of the country's <a href="https://www.adventurouskate.com/the-towns-of-lake-atitlan-guatemala/">hottest tourist destinations</a>, a small group of pioneers has been <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/guatemala-town-mining-bitcoin-with-used-oil">organizing an alternative economy experiment in Bitcoin for about a year</a>, along the lines of what has already been done in El Zonte by Bitcoin Beach. The name chosen for this experiment is Bitcoin Lake and this was our chosen destination.</p><p>We spent about ten days on the shores of the lake and what we documented surprised us in a positive way, beyond our wildest expectations.</p><p>We found ourselves in a place of rare beauty. A large body of water surrounded by volcanoes and impenetrable jungle — tropical nature in its purest expression.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>All article images taken by the author.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>On the banks of Atitlán rise several local settlements, some larger towns, such as Panajachel, where there really is everything one could want in order to spend a few weeks of leisure and rest, and other smaller villages, for example San Marcos, totally immersed in nature and definitely more suitable for those who want to relax, meditate or hike. These are very different locations that thus manage to meet the needs of all kinds of tourists. And indeed, the lake thrives on tourism. It is striking how many hotels, bars, restaurants and activities are offered to those who choose to spend their vacations here. </p><p>There is one thing, however, that unites every activity around here: cash. Even in Guatemala, access to electronic payment instruments is very limited and <a href="https://asocialnomad.com/guatemala/atms-in-guatemala/#:~:text=In%20most%20countries%2C%20there%20will,Guatemala%2C%20it's%20around%208%25.">credit card fees are exorbitant</a>. Any tourist would soon realize this, because as they travel here they will see that the few businesses that accept credit cards charge 5% or 10% more on your bill if you want to pay with Visa or Mastercard. This is another ideal condition in Guatemala, then, to build an alternative economy with Bitcoin. </p><p>And this is an opportunity that some local companies are understandably seizing. In addition to the plethora of open-source bitcoin wallets available, there are applications such as Osmo, which, in addition to allowing people to receive and send bitcoin, allows them to instantly convert them into quetzales, the local currency, or even U.S. dollars. There are local payment services such as IBEX that offer merchants a state-of-the-art implementation of the Lightning Network, ideal for larger businesses that also have reporting requirements. These services, thanks to the Bitcoin protocol, really do brilliantly replace a bank account or point-of-sale (PoS) provider. This is perhaps why there is so much enthusiasm on the lake for this technological innovation, and why adoption is growing so strongly. When you consider that the Bitcoin Lake experiment began not even a year ago, it is impressive how many businesses and merchants are already accepting bitcoin: a system that is faster, safer and cheaper than credit cards.</p><h2>What Is It Like To Live On Bitcoin In Bitcoin Lake?</h2><p>But what is it like, then, to live on bitcoin in Bitcoin Lake?</p><p>Super fun!</p><p>There are so many options available to Bitcoin travelers. We ate lunch and dinner at grassroots restaurants, had breakfast tasting the excellent local coffee, danced late into the night drinking great cocktails, even flew paragliders over the lake, rented a boat and took a tuc-tuc: all while paying in bitcoin. There are dozens and dozens of businesses that already accept them, and one is honestly spoiled for choice.</p><section><figure>

    </figure><div><em>View the 3 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dispatch-from-guatemala-bitcoin-lake">original article</a></em></div></section><p>The comparison with Bitcoin Beach is, in this respect, merciless. Atitlán is a much larger and more organized resort, so the supply in bitcoin will be greater considering such a wider reach for adoption. El Zonte, outside of the ocean and the surf, has little to offer and is a very small village, where at 8:00 at night you struggle to find an open restaurant. But Panajachel, for example, is a resort that manages to entertain well into the night. Here, you can happily come on vacation with your wife or pre-coiner friends while enjoying a wonderful Bitcoin holiday without the fear that they might get bored. </p><p>But how do merchants react when, upon entering their store, you ask if you can pay in bitcoin?</p><p>We were also very impressed by their reactions! They often gave us toothy smiles and said “yes” with a pride and enthusiasm not often encountered with most merchants in El Salvador. When it was time to pay a bill, they took their tablets or smartphones with incredible confidence, opened their wallets and, with four taps, showed us the correct QR codes — amazing awareness and knowledge of the technological tool.</p><section><figure>

    </figure><div><em>View the 2 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dispatch-from-guatemala-bitcoin-lake">original article</a></em></div></section><p>Needless to say, of course, this was not always the case. There were also those who panicked, those who answered us that, right now they could not accept our transactions because the owners were not there and the bitcoin wallet was on their smartphones, those who told us that today "Bitcoin is not working" and therefore, they were sorry, but they could only accept cash.</p><p>In short, there is everything and more in Bitcoin Lake and it is still so early! But the feeling we have is that there is a lot of curiosity in the streets. When we stopped to talk about Bitcoin with locals, we always sensed a keen interest. They often asked us questions, they wanted to know more. </p><p>"Is it true that it's free? Really with the right application, even if you pay in bitcoin, I can receive quetzales or dollars?" </p><p>No testy expressions, huffing faces or politically-aligned answers like, "I don't care about bitcoin because I hate Bukele."</p><p>In Bitcoin Lake, we were only a few hundred miles further north than El Salvador, but a totally different wind seemed to be blowing. We have no doubt that this will soon be a very popular destination among Bitcoiners. After all, for what reason should anyone visiting Bitcoin Beach in El Salvador not spend a few days here as well? There are private buses that directly connect El Tunco, the town right next to El Zonte, with Lake Atitlán. It only takes a few hours of travel time, is an extremely inexpensive transportation option and you will pass through majestic landscapes, traveling along safe roads.</p><p>Our journey in Central America continues but our impression is that this part of the continent is waking up. There is a lot of economic and tourism potential here, and Bitcoin meets real needs. The Bitcoin traveler's horizons, in short, are expanding rapidly and, as we have shown, the number of options is not limited only to El Salvador.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Rikki.

In fact, “Bitcoin Twitter” is virtually its own “country” that exists online. </p><p>I’ve had a Twitter account since 2009, but I never use it to tweet. There are several reasons for this (perhaps the subject of a different article) but, suffice to say, I’ve never found it to be a great use of my time. Like many Boomers, I see social media as a huge time and productivity drain. I also see it as perhaps the worst addiction of our age. </p><p><a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/256-tales-from-the-crypt-31106219/episode/378-building-a-billion-dollar-payments-105433581/">In a recent “TFTC” podcast episode</a>, host Marty Bent and guest Ryan Breslow, the CEO of BOLT, got into the topic of our addiction to technology and, specifically, Twitter. </p><p>Both admitted to having Twitter addictions. It appeared from the conversation that, while Bent admitted to his addiction, he had not done much to break his addiction, while Breslow had. In fact, Breslow described “his toughest personal challenge is managing his time on Twitter.” Breslow used to check it randomly and often everyday, which brought him the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brain-wise/201209/why-were-all-addicted-to-texts-twitter-and-google">dopamine hit that keeps all of us hooked on the technology</a>.</p><p>How many can say the same? Probably many of you who are reading this.</p><h2>No Silver Bullet</h2><p>Since I’m not on Twitter, it’s easy for me to feel excluded. I may have great ideas to contribute but they won’t be heard, unless I become more active on Twitter. My compromise approach has been to join Telegram, which has been just the right middle ground for me. </p><p>But, as Breslow pointed out, there is no silver bullet approach. Day to day, how are you managing your addiction? It turns out that few of us can resist the appeal of something that’s “always available, one button away.” Breslow adopted this rule for his posts: He checks his Twitter feed once to see how a post did. It’s easy to say and hard to do.</p><p>I’ve been writing about this growing addiction to our devices before the age of smartphones and before Bitcoin. In fact, I wrote about it with the advent of PDAs (which stands for personal digital assistant), in particular Blackberries, which were — during their heyday — sometimes called “crackberries.” I even wrote a chapter in my second book that ironically was titled “Fire Your PDA!” </p><p>I joked back then, that most people did not know that there was an on/off switch on their devices. And for those of you who are too young to remember, Blackberries were highly addictive in the age of email and <em>before</em> social media or texting. </p><p>Well, as anyone reading this article today can attest, the problem has only worsened with Twitter and other social media platforms, but it’s at least 10, or perhaps even 100, times worse. </p><h2>Kicking An Addiction</h2><p>Before I share specific experiments that you might implement in the new year to increase your awareness of this addiction, let me ask you these questions:</p><ol><li>Do you admit that you have a Twitter addiction?</li><li>Has it hindered or interfered with your relationships with a coworker, family member or friend?</li><li>Have you ever tried going a day without it?</li><li>Do you check Twitter (or another social media app) first thing when you wake up?</li><li>Do you keep your phone in your bedroom?</li><li>Do you keep your phone on your nightstand?</li><li>After you post something, do you check it compulsively?</li></ol><p>It’s a safe bet that if a family member or friend has ever asked you to stop reading your Twitter feed when you are with them, you are probably addicted to or misusing the technology. In fact, I’m betting that it’s harder for some of us to give up our addiction to social media than to give up our addiction to certain foods, like sugar. In fact, I’d say our addiction to devices is as damaging to our health as is our addiction to sugar. </p><p>What follows are several actionable “experiments” (from easiest to most challenging) that you can implement <em>today</em> that will be worth trying in 2023:</p><ol><li>Turn off notifications for Twitter for one week</li><li>Turn off notifications for Twitter for one week and check your usage data for the last week. Set a benchmark for the number of minutes you spend on the platform each week. Monitor this on the same day each week. </li><li>Establish a defined number of times per day when you will check the app on your device. Or set a block of time for when you check it. </li><li>Turn off your device for one hour per day. (This is actually a really good way to assess how compulsively you check it.)</li><li>Turn off your device for an entire day. Keep track of the number of times you go to check it and/or turn it back on.</li><li>Turn off your device when meditating or reading spiritual literature. Keep track of the number of times you go to check it and/or turn it back on.</li><li>Turn off your device when you are eating. Keep track of the number of times you go to check it and/or turn it back on.</li><li>Turn off your device when you are writing an article. Keep track of the number of times you go to check it and/or turn it back on.</li><li>Turn off your device when you are working, if possible.</li><li>Turn off your device for an entire weekend. </li><li>Delete Twitter from your phone for a day. </li><li>Delete Twitter from your phone for a week.</li></ol><p>Some of these experiments may be totally unworkable because of life situations, but the overall purpose for them is to assess how addicted you are to the device. The goal of the exercise is for you to gain greater control over Twitter or the social media app that has you in its grip. Ideally, if you spend less time on Twitter and devote more time to your friends and family, it will improve the quality of your life and productivity. Remember: We want the tech to serve us and not have us be addicted to the app or the tech. </p><p>Consider establishing one or more of the above as a possible 2023 New Year’s resolution.

The goal of the bond issuance would be to invest half of the money into bitcoin, and the other half into infrastructure necessary to build out the bitcoin industry in the Central American country. The bonds, according to the statement at the time, would yield 6.5% and enable a fast-track for investors to acquire citizenship in the country. <br><br>Exactly one year after the announcement of the plan, the bill that was voted on today <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/el-salvador-submits-bitcoin-bond-bill">was introduced</a> by El Salvador’s Minister of the Economy Maria Luisa Hayem Brevé to the country’s legislative assembly as the next step towards this plan. With today’s approval, the country is much closer to making the bitcoin bonds a reality.<br></p><p>El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office <a href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinofficesv/status/1613274373066051587?s=20&amp;t=jcmdOO7X9TxcF3068ckIbg">released</a> a statement in response to the vote that read in part, “Today El Salvador builds on our first-mover advantage by passing landmark legislation establishing a legal framework for all digital assets that are not bitcoin. The law also paves the way for the volcano bonds which we will soon begin issuing.” <br><br>In a statement to Bitcoin Magazine, Max Keiser, a Bitcoin educator and advocate who has also been a major proponent for El Salvador’s adoption of bitcoin since the process began, states that he believes “This is one of the most important milestones yet. Making Bitcoin legal tender in September, 2021 put El Salvador on the global financial map. This new law furthers the mission of President Bukele by establishing a foundation for a new global, digital securities layer built on Bitcoin.” </p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinofficesv/status/1613274510811140096"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5MzY1NjM3NzAzODA0ODk2/img_6320-1-1-1-1.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Luxor’s Hashrate Index 2022 Mining Year In Review Shows Bitcoin’s Resilience]]></title><description><![CDATA[Analysis shows that even though the mining industry saw major pressure this year, the network hashrate still grew immensely.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/hashrate-index-2022-year-in-review-report</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/hashrate-index-2022-year-in-review-report</guid><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[hash rate]]></category><category><![CDATA[Public Miners]]></category><category><![CDATA[luxor]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[hashrate index]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 19:56:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg3NTA4NzY4OTkxNDIyMjIz/from-delivery-to-hashing-in-15-minutes-setting-up-the-futurebit-apollo-node-and-miner.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Analysis shows that even though the mining industry saw major pressure this year, the network hashrate still grew immensely.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Hashrate Index has released its <a href="https://hashrateindex.com/blog/hashrate-index-2022-bitcoin-mining-year-in-review/">2022 Bitcoin Mining Year In Review</a>, an extensive report on the mining industry and markets surrounding it. <br></p><p>2022 was a difficult year for Bitcoin mining, with the bear market leading to a hashprice all-time low, bankruptcies and losses for miners. Despite this, hash rate still grew 41%, and Bitcoin mining still generated nearly double the rewards compared to the previous three years. The report covers all of these topics and more in detail.<br><br>One of the main focuses of the report is the growth of hash rate. </p><figure>

    </figure><p>Although the year involved many challenges to the mining industry, from an all-time low hashprice, to several public miner bankruptcies and even an arctic cyclone at the end of the year to top things off, hash rate still climbed, and at a much greater rate than 2021, which was stunted by <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/china-still-a-bitcoin-mining-hub-despite-ban">China’s mining ban</a>. <br><br>The report also describes a large decline in hashprice, with the high of the year being recorded on January 1 at $246.86/PH/day and only declining from there. Indeed, the year saw an all-time low in hashprice at $55.94/PH/day. <br></p><figure>

    </figure><p>One factor that played into this, according to the report, is increasing industrial electricity rates across the country. But many states have been insulated from this rise in cost through abundant energy production sources like Washington’s hydropower, or other states’ access to natural gas, leading to certain states retaining viable mining operations. The report also notes that “power strategies can take many forms, but a common theme is that miners exploit the unique low-consequence-interruptibility of the bitcoin mining process by adjusting their electricity consumption based on market signals.” This was on display most recently when Texas miners <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/1-5m-houses-could-be-powered-by-the-energy-texas-miners-returned">turned off their operations</a> in order to return energy supply to the grid, while getting paid nearly as much as they would have had they continued mining. </p><figure>

    </figure><p>Hashrate Index also highlighted the increase in hosting costs, which prior to 2022, hovered around $0.05-$0.06/kWh. But now, “Anything below $0.075/kWh is considered “a steal” given market conditions.”</p><p>Suffering public miners were also a focal point in the analysis.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Bitcoin mining stock performances in 2022 — Source: TradingView</figcaption>
    </figure><p>With the bull market in full swing, public bitcoin miners made big bets with their equipment purchases and expansionary moves. But the bear market hit some larger performers particularly hard, with behemoths like Core Scientific taking losses of nearly 100% — the company is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-bankruptcy">currently undergoing</a> Chapter 11 bankruptcy procedures. These were difficult-to-swallow pills for the market, but public miners did expand in terms of their hash rate dominance, ending the year at 19%. <br><br>Overall, the report signified Bitcoin’s resilience in the face of various major headwinds. Macroeconomic pressures, environmental anomalies and major public mining stocks tumbling more than 90% still couldn’t hamper major growth in network hash rate. Apparently, even such horrendous extraneous conditions as those on display in 2022 cannot temper the growth of the Bitcoin mining industry.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg3NTA4NzY4OTkxNDIyMjIz/from-delivery-to-hashing-in-15-minutes-setting-up-the-futurebit-apollo-node-and-miner.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MDkzOTk5MzMyMTA4MDAy/image1.png" height="398" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MDkzOTk5MzMyMTczNTM4/image2.png" height="398" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MDkzOTk5MzMyMTA3NDYz/image4.png" height="424" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MDkzOTk5MzMyMjM5MDc0/image3.png" height="398" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Bitcoin Can Radically Improve The Healthcare System For Patients]]></title><description><![CDATA[If healthcare providers were to adopt bitcoin, patients would see free-market and affordability improvements.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-makes-healthcare-fair-for-patients</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-makes-healthcare-fair-for-patients</guid><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lightning network]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Healthcare]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robert Hall]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjU5NjI0MzI1MjkzMjE4/bitcoin-healthcare-doctor.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">If healthcare providers were to adopt bitcoin, patients would see free-market and affordability improvements.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Robert Hall, a content creator and small business owner.</em></p><p>Nothing is more critical to long-term health than having access to healthcare when needed. But every jurisdiction around the world implements this process differently. <a href="https://worldpopulace.com/countries-with-universal-health-care/">Many countries socialize the cost of healthcare through the government </a>on a sliding scale from total government control to private market healthcare, with a sprinkle of government-provided health insurance for the poor and the elderly.</p><p>In the United States, we <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2022/demo/p60-278.html#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20private%20health%20insurance,percent%20and%2035.7%20percent%2C%20respectively.">primarily have a private healthcare system</a>. If you have the money, you can purchase healthcare services from any service provider you like. But the problem in America isn't a lack of healthcare providers; it is how healthcare services are paid for.</p><p>When you see your doctor, you don't know how much you will spend. But if you think about this for a second, it is very odd. Can you think of any other service for which you don't know how much you will spend before your visit? Hell, even some sort of estimate would be nice, right?</p><p>When you arrive at the doctor's office, you typically hand over your health insurance card and pay a copay. Do you know what a copay or coinsurance is and how it functions? Not many people do. All that most people know is that you hand over a card, pay a nominal fee and receive services.</p><p>After services are rendered, your doctor's office will send a claim to your health insurance company to be paid out. Once the claim has been paid out, you must pay the rest if there is a balance. Typically this happens months later, and by this point, you may not have the money to pay the balance.</p><p>How insane is this? Not only are you hit with a surprise bill that has yet to be budgeted for, but healthcare providers are also having difficulty <a href="https://revcycleintelligence.com/news/healthcare-revenue-falling-short-of-2022-goals-for-many-providers">finding qualified staff to process payments</a>. The government also <a href="https://medcitynews.com/2022/11/no-surprises-act-leads-to-thousands-more-disputes-and-delays-than-govt-expected/">passed the No Surprises Act last year</a>, making receiving payments even more cumbersome for healthcare providers<a href="https://medcitynews.com/2022/11/no-surprises-act-leads-to-thousands-more-disputes-and-delays-than-govt-expected/">. </a></p><p>Why do we need third parties to pay medical bills in the first place? Imagine having your car insurance company pay to fill up your gas tank. Weird, right?</p><p>Did you know that in 2021, <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-estimates-88-billion-in-medical-bills-on-credit-reports/">20% of Americans had medical debt, and 58% of bills in collections were for medical debt</a>? </p><p>As you can see, people are struggling with medical debt, which has a cascading effect on healthcare providers. <a href="https://healthywyoming.org/why-you-should-care-about-uncompensated-care/">Healthcare providers are losing revenue when their patients don't pay and have to raise prices to make the difference</a>. Does the healthcare consumer see a rise in prices directly? No, the health insurance companies see the increase in cost to provide services.</p><p>This increase in the price of healthcare goods and services is reflected in the price that is paid for health insurance. <a href="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/what-is-the-average-health-insurance-premium-4586358">The typical American family spends $22,221 </a>on health insurance every year. I don't know about you, but this is a lot of money. Imagine what you could do with $22,221 in your pocket.</p><p>The situation becomes troubling when considering the federal government and how much it pays for healthcare.</p><p><a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/medicare-insolvency-still-expected-by-2026-unchanged-by-covid-19-trustees/605877/">Medicare is projected to be insolvent by the year 2026</a>. That is a mere three years from now, yet no one is talking about this in the media, and no one significantly campaigned on this during the election. Medicare provides health coverage for <a href="https://www.fah.org/issues-advocacy/medicare/#:~:text=Created%20in%201965%2C%20Medicare%20serves,to%20approximately%2063%20million%20people.">63 million seniors and disabled Americans</a>.</p><p>What will they do when the government runs out of money to provide healthcare coverage to this population? As of 2021, <a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/medicare-insolvency-still-expected-by-2026-unchanged-by-covid-19-trustees/605877/">growth in Medicare spending had averaged 7.6% for the previous five years</a> and will not be slowing down anytime soon. This is a slow-motion train wreck amid an already broken healthcare system.</p><p>The system is broken and needs to change before it implodes and takes everyone down with it. How can we transform the healthcare system to one based on free market principles while helping healthcare service providers grow revenue and lower costs for their patients?</p><h2>Bitcoin To The Rescue</h2><figure>

    </figure><p>Imagine a world where you know how much your medical bills will be before services are rendered. Imagine a world where you could compare the prices of different medical procedures in the same way that you can when you go to the grocery store or shop on Amazon.</p><p>Bitcoin makes this world possible. If the world adopted a Bitcoin standard, the average consumer would have more purchasing power to pay for their medical bills. The deflationary nature of Bitcoin makes this possible.</p><p><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/there-will-never-be-more-than-21-million-bitcoin">There is only 21 million bitcoin that will ever be created</a>. The longer you hold it, the more it will increase in value. The more value it accrues, the more healthcare services it can be used to purchase. The increase in value will entice more healthcare providers to enter the market and offer their services for bitcoin. More competition between healthcare providers means more access to healthcare, better customer service and lower prices for all. Are you seeing how this all works now?</p><p>Healthcare providers would be incentivized to list the prices of their services in bitcoin to attract new patients to their practice.</p><p>Typical health insurance, where the insurance companies pay the bill for simple office visits, would disappear on a Bitcoin standard. There would be no need for it, as consumers would have enough purchasing power to pay their bills at the time of service.</p><h2>Lightning Network: A Boon To Healthcare Providers</h2><figure>

    </figure><p>Running a doctor's office is a business. There are overhead costs that have to be paid to stay in business. Rents must be paid, employees must be paid and supplies must be purchased.</p><p>Medical practices can use the Lightning Network to receive instant settlement from their patients and <a href="https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/medical-bills-cause-confusion-for-almost-40-of-patients">reduce confusion over medical billing.</a> Adopting Lightning payments would boost revenue and improve cash flow. </p><p>This cash flow could be used to invest in the business, buy better equipment and hire more staff. Not only does this benefit the company, but better equipment also leads to better healthcare outcomes, and more staff leads to better customer service. High-quality customer service will increase profitability over the long term. </p><p>According to a recent study, healthcare providers that provide “excellent” customer service<a href="https://www.leadsquared.com/industries/healthcare/customer-service-in-healthcare/"> reported a net margin that was 50% higher</a> than those that provide “average” customer service.</p><p>The Lightning Network will also lower transaction costs for medical practices. Payment processing takes a big chunk of the bottom line for healthcare providers and provides very little utility. <a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/average-credit-card-processing-fees-costs-america/">The average payment processor charges 1.5% to 3.5%, plus they often institute other confusing formulas</a> to bilk companies out of their money<a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/average-credit-card-processing-fees-costs-america/">.</a></p><p>Healthcare providers could save money on transaction fees if they switched to the Lightning Network. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/lighting-network-makes-bitcoin-scalable">The average fee for sending a Lightning payment is .01%! </a> Plenty of Lightning nodes don't charge a fee to send a payment.

And it’s also gaining traction as it’s become clear that the Twitter buyout by Elon Musk hasn't fundamentally changed anything about freedom of expression on the platform — users are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/15/23512004/elon-musk-starts-banning-critical-journalists-from-twitter">still being banned</a> for inconsistent and arbitrary reasons, and people are looking for a decentralized alternative that isn't something like Mastodon, where a <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/">server operator</a> still has the ability to control your identity. </p><p>Despite the recent attention, the Nostr protocol and first relay server implementation were actually created at the end of 2020 by developer <a href="https://github.com/fiatjaf">fiatjaf</a>. Before the big burst of attention, it was just a quiet, niche protocol simply trying to be a lightweight solution to the problems of Twitter and Mastodon. On both systems, your identity/username is simply a thing controlled by whoever is running the server. Mastodon being a federated system with multiple different servers all talking to each other doesn't fundamentally change that reality. Whoever's server you use to host an account is in total control of whether you can use it or not. Even running your own server, other server operators can black- or whitelist which servers will be allowed to talk to theirs. This has led to a lot of partitioning in the "Fediverse" of different Mastodon servers and makes the idea of just running your own meaningless. You can still ultimately be censored by other server operators, preventing their users from ever seeing your content in their feed. </p><p>The core differentiator between Nostr and something like Mastodon is that, instead of using a username owned by a server operator, each user utilizes a public/private keypair to handle that function instead. That is something that a server operator cannot simply seize from you or lock you out of. This is one of the core building blocks on top of which the overall Nostr protocol is built. </p><p>The next is "events." This is the basic object/data type used by clients and the relay servers that clients connect to in order to send and retrieve messages. The general idea of the protocol is that clients send events to relay servers, who then in turn store and index them, and other clients can communicate with relay servers to request events they have received and stored. In the original <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md">NIP 01</a>, three different event types are defined:</p><ul><li>0: Sends metadata about a user, such as username, picture, a bio, etc.</li><li>1: Sends text messages and basic content</li><li>2: Recommends relay servers for people following the event creator to connect to</li></ul><p>All events are structured in a specifically-defined way. They include the public key of the creator, a timestamp of when they were created, their type (or kind in the specification), the content payload and a signature from the event creator. They also can have tags referencing other events or users, and have an ID value which is a hash of everything except the creator's signature (similar to a TXID for Bitcoin transactions). This lets you guarantee that a message was actually created by the owner of the public key inside of it by verifying the signature (and the person who owns that key if it isn't compromised), and guarantee that the message wasn't altered after they signed it. Just like you can't alter a Bitcoin transaction after it's signed without voiding it, you can't alter a Nostr event after the creator signed it without it being an obvious fraud. </p><p>The event kind system was expanded quite substantially from that original NIP. There is an event type for encrypted direct messages, establishing a shared key by combining the sender's private key with the receiver's public key, which results in the same key you would get by combining the sender's public key with the receiver's private key (this is how <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0047">BIP 47</a> and Silent Payments work). There are also types for replaceable events and ephemeral events. In the case of a replaceable event (obviously), they are designed so that the original creator of the event can sign a new one to replace the old one. Relay servers following the specification will automatically drop the older event from their storage and begin serving the newer versions to clients upon receipt. Ephemeral events are designed so that they will be broadcast to anyone subscribing to their creator when sent to the relay, but relay servers are not supposed to store them. This creates the possibility of having messages seen only by people when they are online during its broadcast. There is even an event type to signal a reaction (such as likes or emojis) to other people's events. </p><p>Speaking of that last one, events can also contain tags. Currently there are tag types for events (to reference an exact Nostr event), public keys (to tag or reference other users) and subjects (to emulate functionality, such as email subjects). All of these can include pointers to specific relay servers from which the the data can be fetched so that users can actually interact across servers, i.e., a user posting their content to one relay server can interact with and reference content created by another user posting to a different relay server in a way that allows any user to coherently fetch the entire thread of interactions in the proper order and without massive complexity in figuring out where to find the relevant data. </p><p>Inside the original NIP, a specification is given for how clients are to interact with relay servers through a subscription message/data structure that includes filters for what events that client is interested in receiving. Those filters can specify users' public keys, exact events, types of events and even specific timeframes in which they want them based on the prior criteria. You can even submit prefixes of public keys or event IDs, such as "1xjisj…." and receive any event or events from a public key that begin with that short string (this can be useful for hiding from a relay server what you actually wanted to view). </p><p>Overall, the protocol is a very bare bones, generalized scheme for passing messages between users that covers the important things, such as guaranteeing the integrity of messages and who sent them with the use of public key identities, while also facilitating infrastructure on the backend for relay servers that can be extremely centralized or allow a user to run their own personal relay server, all while seamlessly interacting with each other and not causing massive chaos in the event of a user being banned from one relay server. They can move to another one or run their own and their de-platforming from the prior server does not lose them their digital identity or followers because they still maintain control over their private key and users can authenticate that when finding them elsewhere. </p><p>Relay servers can operate however they want as well. They can operate for free, can charge micropayments to post or download messages, and there is <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/13.md">even a NIP</a> for requiring hashcash-style proof of work to submit a message. They can be a single relay server for hosting and serving only your posts to other users, or they can be a server running at massive scale such as Twitter or Reddit (clients can display and organize information however they want, which allows emulating essentially any social media platform that exists today). All of this can interoperate seamlessly and without being able to shut out a user. You can prevent them from posting content to your relay server, but ultimately you can't stop them from viewing content you host on your relay server or stop other users from finding their content on other servers. </p><p>It is a very simplistic protocol with a large, open design space for people to build, guaranteeing users can always interact with each other regardless of what individual relay server operators choose to host or not host. This is simultaneously its greatest strength and greatest weakness. While it guarantees the freedom for developers to build without tight constraints by a complicated protocol, there are also many problems that it will inherently run into that are not handled by the protocol itself. </p><p>In the next piece I write, I will go into some of the issues I see occurring and potential solutions, but for now, I'll just say that in terms of the simplicity of the design and the possibilities that it opens up for people to build, Nostr has done a very good job, considering it is the brainchild of one person and only a handful of people have really contributed to the protocol specification itself so far. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Shinobi.

The letter also levies substantial claims of fraud against Barry Silbert and other key personnel at the companies.&nbsp;</p><p>The letter alleges that after Genesis Global Capital LLC, Genesis Trading’s $2.8 billion crypto lending arm, realized losses of at least $1.2 billion in the wake of cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital’s <a href="https://nymag.com/press/2022/08/the-collapse-of-the-crypto-hedge-fund-is-a-strange-tale.html">collapse</a>, instead of taking action to restructure and protect users, the fund tried to defraud others into believing that $1.2 billion of working capital had been injected into the company. <br><br>Instead of doing this, however, the firm allegedly marked a 10-year promissory note down as a current asset, which normally “refers to cash, cash equivalents, or other assets that can be exchanged into cash within one year,” according to the letter. However, Winklevoss writes that, “A promissory note with a principal repayment due in 10 years falls outside the definition of a ‘current asset’ by a country mile.” </p><p>Winklevoss also describes how Genesis was allegedly lending to Three Arrows Capital without regard to the risk of these loans, as the crypto hedge fund was apparently redirecting investment into Grayscale Investments’s GBTC, which limited the growing discount of the Trust. This risk was then passed on to the users of Gemini Earn. <br><br>The letter claims that greed is ultimately what has driven these investment decisions and apparently, the loss of Gemini Earn users’ funds. The letter concludes with a paragraph which reads, “There is no path forward as long as Barry Sibert remains CEO of DCG. He has proven himself unfit to run DCG and unwilling and unable to find a resolution with creditors that is both fair and reasonable. As a result, Gemini, acting on behalf of 340,000 earn users, requests that the Board remove Barry Silbert as CEO effective immediately, and install a new CEO, who will right the wrongs that occurred under Barry’s watch.”<br><br>While bitcoin that is held in custodians can be frozen and stolen, it is worthy of noting that bitcoin which is properly self-custodied in cold storage cannot be, as alleged in this letter. The users of Gemini Earn introduced third-party risk and unnecessary trust when they kept their funds on that platform, which then brazenly lent out said entrusted funds. Bitcoiners should clarify to those who are unaware the differences between these platforms and their risks and proper self-custodial storage of bitcoin. </p><p>In response to the letter, DCG’s Twitter account released an <a href="https://twitter.com/DCGco/status/1612852131333029893">official statement</a>, embedded below.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/DCGco/status/1612852131333029893"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/DCGco/status/1612852233506361356"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyODY4MzAyMTgyMTY0MTc2/legal-justice.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Homesteader Conversations: Feeding Your Family And Building A Bitcoin Community In Southern Portugal]]></title><description><![CDATA[A homesteader in Portugal shares her experiences running a farm, feeding her family and supporting a Bitcoin community through workshops.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-and-homesteading-in-portugal</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-and-homesteading-in-portugal</guid><category><![CDATA[Citadel]]></category><category><![CDATA[Feature]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[farming]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Captain Sidd]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwNDI3MzM2NzA3OTQxNjI1/flag-freedom-nation-adventure-innovation.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">A homesteader in Portugal shares her experiences running a farm, feeding her family and supporting a Bitcoin community through workshops.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>In the conversation for this article, Julia joined me from her home in Southern Portugal to chat about her homestead, local community and Bitcoin. I found many parallels between how Julia talks about Bitcoin and homesteading with what I have heard from many homesteaders and farmers in the U.S. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/what-i-discovered-about-bitcoin-culture">during my trip across the country this summer</a>. The work to understand and work on Bitcoin or a farm demand high upfront investment and very low time preference. </p><p>In my conversation with Julia, we touched on her backstory as a German who moved her life to Portugal, the growth of the Bitcoin meetup in her local community and what it takes to operate a homestead that feeds her family. </p><h2>Julia’s Backstory</h2><p><strong>Sidd:</strong> Let’s start with a bit of your backstory. Tell me about how you ended up in Portugal. Why did you move there and why did you stay?</p><p><strong>Julia:</strong> I'm originally from Germany, and coming to Portugal was really just a part of something that happens to you when you're in your late teens or early 20s. I first set foot on Portuguese terrain when I was 19 — I wanted to travel, so I looked around for some jobs. I found an opportunity to work in Portugal for three months, and I thought I would travel on to some other country after. But then, as life happens, I got offered a full-time job and I thought, “Yes, I'm going to resettle here in Portugal.”</p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>A view from the land in Portugal which Julia eventually settled on. All images included in this article are courtesy of Julia.</em><br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>Since then, my parents moved over together with my brothers shortly after me. I’ve been back to Germany a few times to visit some family, but my close family is here. The last time I went to Germany was maybe 15 years ago! I don't go back regularly. </p><h2>Local Community And Meetups</h2><p><strong>Sidd: </strong>Tell me about the community that you've built there. When I chatted with your friend earlier, she mentioned a local market that began in 2020. </p><p><strong>Julia:</strong> Our community has always been on the alternative side of things, but it was really COVID-19 that kicked this community and networking thing into gear. That's when everybody thought, “It's now or never to build a strong local community and economy.” And that's when the alternative markets started happening. People were looking for their tribe, because it became so apparent that there is a tribe: you're either on this side, or you're on the other side. In a way, COVID-19 has been a real blessing for community building here because it helped us grow into a very strong, little, tight-knit community.</p><p><strong>Sidd:</strong> Tell me about the alternative market. What’s sold there? Who is selling and who is buying? </p><p><strong>Julia:</strong> The market group currently counts over 1,000 members, and is based on private land with expected attendance of several hundred people from the Algarve. The Algarve region in South Portugal spans only 200 kilometers by 50 (kilometers) or so, and comprises the wider community who goes to the market. The local community who are producing and selling most of the goods at the market are within about a half hour drive of the market.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>Setting up at the market!</em><br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>Most of what is sold at the market are handicrafts, jewelry, homemade products, soaps, cosmetics, natural healing tinctures and so on, with some foods. All homemade items. It’s on private land so fewer regulations apply to what’s sold. </p><p><strong>Sidd: </strong>How many Bitcoiners are there in the community? Is there a Bitcoin meetup? </p><p><strong>Julia:</strong> I started to understand Bitcoin only at the beginning of last year. Since then, we’ve had this one individual in the community — I’ll call him Rick — who started educating people on Bitcoin. His girlfriend is also very much into creating networks and running events, so she hosts regular meetups. Before these events started, I didn't know anybody who was into Bitcoin. Now, I see Bitcoiners everywhere because I’m in the group. The same thing happened to me with homeschooling. Before I started homeschooling, I never knew there was a homeschooling community. The moment I started doing it myself, suddenly, it’s everywhere. </p><p>Portugal in general is a great magnet for Bitcoiners as well because the government brings a very relaxed approach to it. At the moment, you don’t have to pay capital gains tax. The government is discussing a possible capital gains tax, but for now it would only apply if you sell less than 12 months after purchasing.</p><h2>Julia’s Interest In Bitcoin</h2><p><strong>Sidd:</strong> So, tell me about your interest in Bitcoin. Where did it come from?</p><p><strong>Julia:</strong> I had been hearing about Bitcoin for years, but it wasn't until a video (which I can’t remember now!) triggered a particular interest that I really started investigating. It was really Rick who helped answer all my questions and foster my interest. Before I had someone to sit down with and ask my questions to, it was all very dodgy. Meeting Rick was my entrance to the Bitcoin rabbit hole. </p><p>I had questions about the energy use, and how bitcoins resist being copied with a click. I also sat down with Rick to talk about what decentralization actually means, and why it matters. When the philosophical stuff kicked in — like what does all of this mean for humanity — I really got hooked. I could see something so different for the future of humanity in this.</p><p><strong>Sidd:</strong> Let’s go back to homesteading. What parallels, if any, do you see between homesteading and Bitcoin? </p><p><strong>Julia: </strong>The ups and down. You have to just flow with the ups and downs, you will have good days and successful times and then it will go downhill again. You have to swallow that as well. It's like when you lose your whole flock of chickens in one night to a predator, that's that. You could then decide to give up and sell, or you just keep going. And I think also, speaking to the aspect of community, Bitcoin-only people are generally a very nice bunch. The same goes for farmers. They're very down-to-earth people, which I like.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MDQzNzYzNzg0MDY2Nzg2/pumpkin.jpg" height="464" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><em>A view from Julia’s land.</em><br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>There’s also a long-term approach to success shared between those two communities. You can't just create a successful farm in half a year. It's almost generational. It takes years until the soil responds and improves. Years of diligent day-to-day work, I would say. No quick-fix solutions. </p><h2>Overview Of The Homestead</h2><p><strong>Sidd:</strong> Tell me about your homestead. What are you producing?</p><p><strong>Julia:</strong> It's a small homestead, probably a couple of acres. It's really a family home. I bought it as a ruin in 2000, so we’ve been here over 20 years. At first I started by planting a few trees, and had my first successes and failures. Planting trees sounds easy, but with the hot and dry Portuguese summers, it’s not. </p><p>I was immediately confronted with the realities of nature. However, I persevered as I've always been interested in the relationship between health and food. That inevitably brings you to growing your own food, because nothing else you can buy out there is high quality enough to keep you healthy.&nbsp;</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MDQzNzYzNTE1NjMwNzkx/homestead-harvest.jpg" height="464" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><em>Beautiful sundried tomatoes from the garden.&nbsp;</em><br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>It really kicked into gear when I had children. My daughter is almost 10 years old now, so about 10 years ago I got serious: I want my own eggs and my own milk. And that's when I really started more and more homesteading and animal keeping. I’m very focused on animal production, without a lot of vegetable growing. The aim is to supply the family. And finally, after so many years, we’re there. We actually have a constant supply of raw milk and eggs. We also have some fruit trees, but I'm focusing on my chickens and my goats. We recently started with pigs who are great prolific providers. Having a freezer full of your own meat is also a very good feeling.</p><p><strong>Sidd:</strong> Are you at a point now where you’re overproducing and selling or having to store all this food?</p><p><strong>Julia: </strong>I can sell some excess now. In springtime during the high season for eggs, I’m very happy to sell eggs as well as a few liters of milk. We are turning the idea of the homestead into an educational one: we're running workshops on homesteading once or twice a month, depending on the season as well.&nbsp;</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk1MDQzNzYzNzg0MDAwNzEx/terra-robinia.jpg" height="829" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><em>Julia puts an educational spin on homesteading by running regular workshops to help the local community sharpen their skills.&nbsp;</em><br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>For example, we did one in September on vegetable fermentation to preserve vegetables from the fall harvest over the winter. We are now integrating Bitcoin education into those workshops as well. We have a bit of a farm shop too, which is just a big shelf in the kitchen where people can buy seeds, the beef jerky I make and other products.</p><h2>Labor, Scaling And Costs</h2><p><strong>Sidd:</strong> What labor is involved now in operating your homestead, and how does that change across the seasons?</p><p><strong>Julia:</strong> I do it alone, and it’s well organized. If you've got your infrastructure nicely set into place, then it's quite easy. However, you're still there twice a day every day for feeding and for moving goats around in the pen. We practice a regenerative, holistic approach so we never keep the animals in one place. Sometimes, I need some help moving big structures, so I will ask somebody in the community to help. I'm usually out for at least an hour in the morning, and then another hour in the evening, just for the daily basics.</p><p>Seasonal works do exist. In the winter it’s wet, and there’s more to do in terms of fixing shelters and fences. The summer is our dormant season here; it’s too hot to do any extra work. Summers are about getting feed, water and shelter for the animals. </p><p><strong>Sidd: </strong>How did you scale up your homestead? What did you start with and what did you add as you went on?</p><p><strong>Julia:</strong> I started with chickens, then pretty quickly expanded the number of chickens and started with goats. As just one person, there is not all that much scaling you can do. What you can do is stack: integrate one thing with another. I couldn't just suddenly run 20 goats, but I could integrate the goats with the pigs because that's not all that much more. That adds just a little bit to my daily chores. My husband still goes to work and I am homeschooling the kids, so I need to keep the labor on the homestead under control.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>One of Julia’s hardy goats.&nbsp;</em><br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>I'm now at a point where I can supply the family with milk and eggs to what we need and have that little bit of extra which pays for the animals’ feed, and that's kind of a sweet spot to be in. I don't see myself growing a lot at the moment. I might be able to buy another piece of land in the future and restructure some stuff. Possibly get a dairy cow instead of the goats, and maybe a beef cow instead of the pigs. We'll see.</p><p><strong>Sidd: </strong>Speaking of the feed, what costs are involved with the homestead that you're running?</p><p><strong>Julia: </strong>The cost of feed here over the course of the last 12 months has almost doubled. I do have to buy grain for the animals, even though they are out on pasture and occasionally getting kitchen leftovers. Other than that, we're very lightweight on costs. Structures like small shelters are often self-made with whatever I can find. The only other significant cost is in electric fencing. I have very low vet costs because I keep my animals very clean and healthy. I don't do the whole deworming and all that because I believe a healthy animal doesn't have worms. In that way, we're quite low on costs.&nbsp;</p><h2>Mistakes And Advice</h2><p><strong>Sidd: </strong>What major mistakes have you made on your homesteading journey?</p><p><strong>Julia:</strong> I think I wasted a lot of energy before I got to a true understanding of the land. That true understanding of the land came in 2015 when I did an extensive permaculture course online from Geoff Lawton. His course just put everything into place. Suddenly I knew how to harvest my water and where to put trees so they actually survive. I would recommend anyone starting a homestead to do one of those comprehensive training courses with a good teacher like Geoff or Allan Savory. Allan gave me a great understanding of how animals work in harmony with the ground and vegetation on the land. </p><p><strong>Sidd: </strong>Knowing what you know now, where would you have started with homesteading? Would you have done it the same way that you did it or would you have started differently?</p><p><strong>Julia: </strong>I think I took a fairly straightforward approach. There will always be a learning curve with mistakes and losses. I think for somebody just starting out, it's smart to begin with small animals. You can't run a cattle ranch with 100 heads overnight; you really have to grow into it in order to integrate your land and animals effectively. You have to be connected to your land and to your animals and the environment. You need to start small and feel your way. </p><p>Don't try to integrate too many species. It's all very romantic — them hopping around in the same pen — but in reality, it usually doesn’t work. They will either kill each other or eat each other's food. We've made all those mistakes. I thought I could just put some ducks with the chickens, but the ducks killed my chicks. Those are things you don’t know until you try and see for yourself. </p><p>Definitely read books, but really see if what you read in those books makes sense for you. People can get so lost wanting to grow their own food and be self-sustainable, yet having no idea what it takes. Growing your own vegetables is tough! They are so sensitive, they will die on you with any number of tiny mistakes and everything wants to eat them. So make sure you keep enough money in your back pocket to support you, and don't count on your food production.</p><p><strong>Sidd: </strong>Thanks for joining me today and sharing all your knowledge and experiences gained through your homestead.

Many users have lost faith in bitcoin-based lending products and the market appears to be at its historical bottom, both in terms of volumes and public confidence.</p><p>As usual, the mainstream media blamed <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/binance-ceo-ftx-clawbacks-51671128868">these crises on Bitcoin itself</a>. But is any of this Bitcoin’s fault? Does it make Bitcoin any less attractive? Does it even mean that we shouldn’t consider bitcoin as lending collateral? No!</p><h2>Bitcoin Is Super Collateral, It’s The Lenders Who Have Failed </h2><p>While Bitcoin's code is law, custodial lending platforms are trusted third parties, owned and managed by private entities. Trusted third parties are security holes. This was true before Bitcoin, and it is still true today.</p><p>Furthermore, most bitcoin lending platforms are poorly conceived, poorly developed and poorly managed. This doesn’t necessarily imply bad code. The code can be well written, properly audited and verifiably secure, but there may still be poor incentives that emerge from the design of the lending platforms. If the focus is to treat bitcoin as if it were a yielding asset, we are likely in for trouble.</p><p>The longer the “bitcoin lending” industry goes on, the clearer it becomes that most involved do not really understand how yield is generated. And as the saying goes, if you don’t know where the yield comes from, then <em>you </em>are the yield. What it really means is that your bitcoin is being used as the principal for risky investments, and it is likely only a matter of time before the house of cards starts to collapse.</p><p>I believe that the proper focus for integrating bitcoin into intermediated lending is to appreciate how valuable and unique bitcoin is, and to treat it as something to be borrowed against: to understand that bitcoin is super collateral. But what makes it so unique? </p><p>We can identify twelve characteristics that make it so:</p><h3>Bitcoin Is Liquid</h3><p>Bitcoin is an extremely liquid asset. It is traded 24/7, with no weekend breaks and no banking holidays. Massive liquidity pools across a variety of fiat currencies are available globally. For lenders, this means that if you want to convert your collateral into fiat, you can do it instantly — either because the borrower has been liquidated or because the loan was repaid from the collateral. </p><p>This also allows for the hedging of risks. Bitcoin may be the only kind of loan collateral which can be instantly and dynamically hedged: a serious competitive advantage.</p><h3>Bitcoin Is Programmable</h3><p>Bitcoin enables the creation of programmable lending products and ownership mechanisms. Among other benefits, this feature allows us to solve the problem of trusted third parties by building non-custodial lending mechanisms and storage systems. For example, we can distribute collateral claims or create conditional logic for redemption that will be automatically executed by the Bitcoin network, not the whims of a centralized financial institution.</p><h3>Bitcoin Is Scarce</h3><p>There will only be 21 million bitcoin.Your collateral is getting more valuable over time, which means there is less incentive for you to sell, and likely more lenders who are willing to accept it. </p><h3>Bitcoin Is Flexibly Transparent</h3><p>Bitcoin allows us to enable selective transparency of your assets when useful, but also allows complete anonymity when desired. In a lending scenario, for example, you can easily prove to a lender that you own and control the collateral under consideration.</p><h3>Bitcoin Is Sovereign</h3><p>Bitcoin is yours. You have keys to your bitcoin just like you have keys to your house and your car. Bitcoin is your personal property. If you use a house or a car as collateral, you won't own it — your lender would. With bitcoin, you can still conditionally own it during your lending agreement. In fact, with the right tools, you can not only use but continue to use this collateral during the period of the lending agreement.</p><h3>Bitcoin Is Secure </h3><p>Bitcoin is protected cryptographically, economically and socially. It is sensible to think of Bitcoin's lowest-level network security expanding to the set of tools built on top of it. For example, you can distribute ownership of your collateral between multiple independent parties, use offline wallets and utilize many more security methods.</p><h3>Bitcoin Is Market Driven</h3><p>Bitcoin is the essence of a market-driven asset. The price of bitcoin reflects the market almost instantly, and it's not determined by one or several individuals. It is extremely difficult to manipulate the price of bitcoin. Bitcoin costs almost the same in fiat in any part of the world and is determined by a global market. </p><h3>Bitcoin Is A Real-Time Asset</h3><p>Not only can we track the price of bitcoin collateral in real time, but Bitcoin's blockchain allows you to track your collateral address in real time also. Any price fluctuation can be reacted to appropriately. As mentioned, there are no weekends or holidays, and the market is always open to everyone, so nobody will close the market on a Friday and open on a Monday with different prices.</p><h3>Bitcoin Is Objective</h3><p>Bitcoin is honest. Bitcoin in Miami costs the same amount of fiat as it does in Lugano or Riga. Bitcoin doesn't care whether you like it or not. The price of bitcoin cannot be determined by your personal views or your forecasting capabilities. To borrow against bitcoin, you only need to have bitcoin. Your credit history, social score or anything else is irrelevant to the lender as long as you have the collateral to borrow against. </p><p>Take real estate, for example. The same amount of money can buy you different properties in different countries with the same levels of economic and social development. What makes the difference then? Why can you buy a mansion on the coast of the Mediterranean in Spain or Italy and, for the same amount of money, you won’t be able to afford a proper house in the Bay Area in the U.S.? </p><p>It’s due to humans' irrational valuation capabilities. Because real estate valuation is primarily based on human factors, banks evaluate your property as either too expensive or too cheap, depending on market conditions and their plans.</p><p>Or take stocks, for example. Your stocks in a certain company can have good underlying conditions and great potential growth opportunities, but suddenly the CEO of this company can tweet some stupid thing, and you are losing money or getting liquidated. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is fair.</p><h3>Bitcoin Is Global</h3><p>Bitcoin is globally accessible and globally distributed. For lending, this means that you can borrow remotely from anyone in the world, and you can lend money using bitcoin as collateral to anyone in the world. Bitcoin is neither limited to, nor exclusively exposed to, specific local markets.</p><h3>Bitcoin Is Digital </h3><p>In a digital age, with digital commerce, we need digital collateral. Bitcoin is already online. It's here, on your machine, your phone, your cold wallet. Bitcoin allows you to borrow remotely and instantly. There is no need to digitize bitcoin as you need to do with real estate, land, cars or any other assets. It's already digital. </p><h3>Bitcoin Is Decentralized</h3><p>There is no single point of failure in Bitcoin. Bitcoin has been attacked multiple times, and yet it is growing and expanding globally. No committee or person is responsible for Bitcoin. Having decentralized collateral significantly decreases your dependence on single events and failures of companies or people. You are protected by a distributed network. </p><h2>Will Lending Ever Match Bitcoin’s Potential? </h2><p>Powerful collateral requires powerful tools. Is it possible to build lending tools that will match bitcoins' value? In order to do so, we all need to take a step back and check <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin's white paper</a>. </p><p>After reading Bitcoin’s white paper, you will understand that in order to build a successful lending product (in fact, any type of Bitcoin product!), you need to meet three main criteria. If your product has all three, congrats you have passed the test. Let's call it “The Satoshi Test.”</p><ol><li>Your service should be non-custodial. Remember: not your keys, not your coins. When using custodial lending platforms, you are exposed to the risk of losing your collateral completely. Because, as soon as bitcoin hit platform wallets, they are no longer yours. This is exactly what happened to customers of the many lending and trading platforms that have failed in 2022.</li><li>Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer, electronic cash system. Once again: peer to peer. Instead of acting like a middleman, you need to provide technical tools for individuals or businesses to operate with each other. Or you can be a business that will allow customers to directly interact with your platform. A good example is a platform that allows customers to buy bitcoin directly into their own cold storage. </li><li>Your platform should be Bitcoin only, meaning that the only collateral you should work with should be bitcoin. Shitcoins are risky, and shitcoins' code is a ticking time bomb. By integrating many blockchains into your product, you are exposing the most valuable to the most vulnerable.</li></ol><p>There is an extra criteria that could be met: anonymity. If you are building non-custodial, Bitcoin-only, peer-to-peer products, this can and will allow you to offer anonymity and better privacy for your customers because security is not full without anonymity and the data of your customers should be protected, as well as their funds. </p><p>A good way to pass The Satoshi Test is to utilize multisig. Multisig is a simple and secure yet powerful tool. It allows you to offer peer-to-peer interactions to users, leverage non-custodial escrows and use only Bitcoin. It also allows you to offer better privacy for your users.</p><p>Take, for example, a multisig setup with three keys where the consensus mechanism is reached by entering at least two keys. This is called “two-out-of-three Bitcoin multisig.” In that type of setup, you — as a technical tool provider — can become one of the key holders, but you won’t have full control over customer funds (because you only have one key!), thus ensuring that these funds won’t be moved and rehypothecated. For example, the lender will have one key, the borrower will have another one, and the provider will have the third key. This kind of setup will allow users to verify that funds are only used by them, and that all parties must act according to rules in order to reach consensus, and that no single party can act in a dubious and shady way. </p><p>In fact, there are already powerful platforms that use Bitcoin multisig and offer peer-to-peer interactions. These platforms can provide lenders and borrowers from all over the world with easy two-out-of-three multisig setups, where each side (including the platform itself) has one key. The multisig is created on Bitcoin’s public blockchain, meaning that you can check your collateral at any time through any block explorer. And the best part is that no funds can be rehypothecated because the platform itself only has one key that ensures that every involved counterparty is acting in a good and professional way. </p><h2>Proper Lending Platforms Might Be Useful For HODLers</h2><p>Although the lending market at the moment is experiencing turbulence and contagion effects, it is a good time to educate yourself about proper lending platforms that might be useful for any true HODLer in the future. As soon as we enter the next bull cycle, there will be less incentive to sell bitcoin and more interest in holding it for the long term and borrowing against it. Be prepared, because bear markets don’t last forever. HODL and learn! </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Max Keidun.

New social systems are needed too.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Frank Nuessle, a publishing entrepreneur, former university professor and social system architect.</em></p><p>In this essay, I argue that Bitcoin and the Lightning Network are, by themselves, not enough to successfully implement an American sound money system, and that following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_economics">evolutionary economics</a>, new social technologies and new social system designs need to be part of the equation. </p><p>The primary purpose of money is to facilitate the exchange of value. Money is also our most critical, most important, baseline social system. Bitcoin is not yet money. Bitcoin fulfills one of the three functions of money in that it is a trustworthy technology for the electronic store of value. Once Bitcoin is integrated with newly-developed social system technologies, it no doubt will fulfill that primary purpose of money — to facilitate the exchange of value.</p><h2>The Problems With The American Fiat System </h2><p>Before launching into my argument, let me explain why my focus is on the implementation of an American Bitcoin economy.</p><p>First, being an American, I know more about America than anywhere else.</p><p>Secondly and more importantly, America has the most to lose when the U.S. dollar is no longer recognized as the world’s only reserve currency, or the dollar becomes worthless through exponential printing. Under either outcome, there will be hell to pay — cataclysmic disruption in the United States without there being a parallel sound money system operating successfully alongside the current Federal Reserve system.</p><p>Even today, the evidence is everywhere that the American economy is not working for everyone. Disruption and anger are spilling out all over. Mass killings happening every few days are waking people up to the fact that there is a mental sickness of hate and nihilism that seems to be spreading.</p><p>America’s national political parties are not meeting the moment. The monstrous scale of American financial inequality makes genuine democracy impossible. A few years ago, ABC News reported that<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/10-americans-struggle-cover-400-emergency-expense-federal/story?id=63253846"> 40% of Americans couldn’t raise $400</a> to cover an emergency. How can anyone think their votes give them the same political power as, say, Jeff Bezos who makes such an<a href="https://www.vizaca.com/how-much-does-jeff-bezos-make-a-second/"> obscene amount of money</a>?</p><p>And now the crypto industry has to deal with the perfidy of Sam Bankman-Fried, who The New York Times once nicknamed the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/14/business/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-crypto.html">Crypto Emperor</a>” because he embodied the pretension of the renegade, “people’s” billionaire. He lived the lifestyle embodied by Elon Musk, Bezos and other tech billionaires, but turned out to be too young to recognize that you can’t get there by cooking the books.</p><p>Maybe, Bankman-Fried’s downfall will be a wake-up call for the crypto industry to understand that Bitcoin and blockchain are not about individuals becoming the next billionaires, but are about utilizing Bitcoin technology to create real products and services that solve real human and planetary needs, and by so doing, moving America into an expanding state of societal well being. </p><p>In his book, “The Price of Tomorrow,”<a href="https://www.jeffreybooth.com/"> Jeff Booth</a> writes, “The trend of more wealth inequality, more polarization, and more discord is a major threat to our collective future. And it is all being caused by the same thing: adherence to an economic system designed for a different time.”</p><p>The current economic system favors large corporations and is the enemy of local commerce. This system extracts value from the local marketplace and delivers it to remote shareholders and to corporate management. </p><p>Bankman-Fried, like others in the get-rich-quick crypto community, lives out of the unexamined mindset that life is a dog-eat-dog struggle and that getting filthy rich is how you win the game. It is rumored that Bankman-Fried played video games during investor meetings. This mindset rules corporate capitalism, and let’s be honest, we all are afflicted, to some degree, with this mental state.</p><p>The most important product of many corporations today is no longer whatever they provide to customers, but the shares they sell to investors. In his book “Team Human,”<a href="https://rushkoff.com/"> Douglas Rushkoff</a> writes, “Corporations destroy the markets on which they depend or sell off their most productive divisions in order to increase the bottom line on their quarterly reports.”</p><p>In America today, producing money is more important than producing a sustainable product or service. The corporation takes money out of the local economy — out of the land and labor — and delivers it to its shareholders.</p><h2>The Importance Of Money As A Social System </h2><p>Money is the most important and powerful social system ever invented by man. Civilization began with the exchange of value. The primary purpose of money is to facilitate the exchange of value within a community. A community is a group of people who rely on each other.</p><p>The true nature of the human being is to be in relationship with the planet and within a community. Only a money system that is built upon that understanding can hope to fulfill the dreams we each have invested in the future of Bitcoin and in our own communities.</p><p>The Bitcoin sound money economy must be designed for the distribution of wealth, not just the exporting of capital to the already wealthy.</p><p>Clearly, the Lightning Network allows for the velocity of transactions that can make the Bitcoin sound money economy possible in the United States. Yet the Lightning Network is not enough.</p><p>I agree with Rushkoff, who believes that we cannot solve America’s problems solely with more technology. He writes that Bitcoin and blockchain “may disintermediate exploitive financial institutions, but it doesn’t help rehumanize the economy, or reestablish the trust, cohesion and ethos of mutual aid that is undermined by digital capitalism.” </p><p>Because Bitcoin, as a technologically-sound money system, represents a potential transformative evolution of our social reality, its successful implementation requires that we must delicately design its implementation to embed our best and most highly-refined human traits such as honesty, integrity, generosity and forgiveness. </p><p>To do so, we must remember the work of the evolutionary economist,<a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/experts/ebeinhocker"> Eric Beinhocker</a>, and his proposal that economic evolution is not a single process, but rather the result of three interlocked processes — physical technology, social system technology and system design fitness.</p><p>To be successful, Bitcoin through the Lightning Network must ignite the evolutionary search engine that is localized, free market capitalism.</p><p>Bitcoin and the Lightning Network are clearly the needed physical technologies, but what are the social technologies and the social system design that will allow the Bitcoin sound money system to spread like a virus? </p><h2>Integrating With The Current Fiat Money System</h2><p>To answer the above question, Bitcoiners must fully understand what we are up against when we think about social technologies to change the American preference for the current money system. </p><p>First, there is the very strong human resistance to change because nation-controlled money systems have been predominant for hundreds of years.</p><p>Secondly, money carries so much self-worth-related emotional baggage that there is a strong reluctance to talk openly about money and even less interest in the systems for money creation. Money, like sex, is just not talked about. </p><p>When considering the strong human resistance to change, it is helpful to understand a little bit of history. First, there is the historical axiom that whoever is in power in a society creates its money.</p><p>From the 10th to the 13th centuries, <a href="https://bernard-lietaer.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2004-Of-Human-Wealth-Beyond-Greed-Scarcity-Lieater-Belgin-annotated.pdf">a historical period in Europe</a> known as the Middle Ages, currencies were issued by local lords, and then periodically recalled and reissued with a tax collected in the process. This was a form of<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demurrage.asp"> demurrage</a> that made money less desirable as a store of value. The result was the blossoming of culture and widespread wellbeing throughout Europe. This prosperity corresponded exactly to the time period when these local currencies were issued.</p><p>We are talking about 600 years of enculturation which provide a strong psychological headwind against the successful implementation of an alternative, American, bitcoin-based money system. We have all faced this headwind when trying to convince friends or relatives about the significance of the Bitcoin innovation.</p><p>There is an interesting new concept from complex systems theory called “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/basins-of-attraction">basins of attraction</a>” that can help to visualize this headwind. </p><p><a href="https://www.darwinianrevolution.com/">A basin of attraction is any complex system</a>, such as a biological ecosystem, a human social system or ideas about a money system, that has multiple, local equilibrium states rather than a single equilibrium point. This is easier to understand with a visual representing two basins of attraction placed near each other.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Picture a ball, representing the ideas about a money system or money in general, lying at the bottom of one of these basins and think about how it must move to another basin of attraction for lasting change to occur.</p><p>You can imagine how the current money system will resist incremental change and that it will have the capacity to absorb many shocks to retain its historical attraction. There are over 600 years of pull into the state-controlled money system basin of attraction.</p><p>What’s needed is a new basin of attraction, a new configuration of ideas, with its own gravitational pull. </p><p>Bitcoin as sound money is that new basin of attraction. </p><p>Any conscious attempt to move that ball into a new bitcoin basin of attraction must include exposure and acceptance by a tipping point of public acceptance within a marketplace. To successfully move the culture to the bitcoin basin of attraction will require a change to the American story about money. More about that later in this essay.</p><h2>Money As A Measure Of Self Worth And Survival</h2><p>When considering the strong human resistance to thinking about money systems, it is helpful to dive into the deeper emotional issues people have about money.</p><p>Money is one of the primary taboos of American society, along with sex and death. Money is really the last taboo. Think about it: it’s less taboo today to talk about who you slept with last night than about how much money you have. It’s a real cultural blind spot.</p><p>To understand what those taboos have in common, we need to delve into collective psychology best described by archetypes. Archetypes are patterns of emotions and behavior that can be observed across civilizations and time periods.</p><p>One important archetype is<a href="https://archetypearise.com/greatmother/"> the great mother</a>, which represents the mother figure in mythology, religion and Jungian psychology. Repression of the great mother archetype is clear in the American collective consciousness. When you repress an archetype, it manifests itself through its specific shadows — with money, that turns out to be greed and fear of scarcity.</p><p>The earliest currencies all directly related to the great mother.</p><p>For instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer">thousands of years before the common era</a>, <a href="https://bernard-lietaer.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2004-Of-Human-Wealth-Beyond-Greed-Scarcity-Lieater-Belgin-annotated.pdf">the original Sumerian shekel</a> was closely linked to Inanna, the goddess of life, death and sexuality. Grain backed the money of the time. Farmers were given shekels for their grain which they could exchange for sex with the virgins of the temple. This was how they assured grain storage for the lean years they had often experienced in their history.</p><p>For the Sumerians, it was the priests who controlled the money. They gave receipts for wheat delivered to the temples as tax. The receipts could be used as currency to pay for sex with the temple priestesses or for other goods in the marketplace. These receipts were something like a modern-day, tax-funded welfare system — the wheat was a buffer stock, the sex, a fertility ritual and a charm against harvest failure (think of it as a type of early insurance).</p><p>It’s also interesting to note that the <a href="https://bernard-lietaer.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2004-Of-Human-Wealth-Beyond-Greed-Scarcity-Lieater-Belgin-annotated.pdf">English word “money” itself derives from</a> the Roman temple of Juno Moneta in Rome from whose basement the mint of the empire operated. Juno was the Italic goddess of the menstrual cycle, sexuality, pregnancy, birth… and, of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneta#:~:text=Juno%20Moneta%2C%20an%20epithet%20of,Martial%2C%20Juvenal%2C%20and%20Cicero.">money</a>.</p><h2>How To Convince Others Of The Value Of Bitcoin</h2><p>So, how does one burst through the very strong human resistance to change and the unconscious mental taboos that surround fears about money?</p><p>Many Bitcoiners have come to realize that you are never going to overcome their brother-in-law’s beliefs through the force of logic and evidence. People arrange the evidence to align with their existing beliefs and their outlooks on life.</p><p>These individual personal beliefs are woven into a cultural story that becomes a consensus reality about money or, in the language of cultural systems theory, America’s current basin of attraction for money.</p><p>The current American cultural story about money is a story about scarcity and about there never being enough. This is a design feature of the current debt-based money system where the money supply must grow to pay back the interest because there is literally “never enough” so people must fight over what there is. This design feature is the fiat money system growth imperative which must, at some point, go exponential or go through a process of debt forgiveness.</p><p>As<a href="https://charleseisenstein.org/"> Charles Eisenstein</a> writes, “As long as most people acquiesce to the present system, those heavily invested in its perpetuation (i.e. the already rich) will find ways to keep pretending that it is sustainable.”</p><p>To change existing opinions and beliefs about money requires giving people an experience that does not fit the existing story or an experience that resonates with a new story.</p><p>Buckminster Fuller <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/13119-you-never-change-things-by-fighting-the-existing-reality-to">used to say</a> that you never change anything by fighting the existing reality. To change a social system, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.</p><p>Eisenstein believes that the most direct way to disrupt the American story of scarcity is to give people an experience not based on scarcity. That could be “an act of generosity, forgiveness, attention, truth or unconditional acceptance.” This new story must be an invitation to a new way of being in the world, unafraid and connected. It must be an offer. One cannot compel another person to change beliefs.</p><p>Remembering Beinhocker’s three interlocked processes of economic evolution, we are back to the seminal question: “What are the social technologies and the social system design parameters that will integrate with Bitcoin technology to allow the Bitcoin sound money system to spread like a virus?”</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Frank Nuessle.

And there is one group, particularly in the Western world and United States, that has grown increasingly dissatisfied and, in some cases, hopeless above the rest: Gen Z. </p><p>But I believe there is one big reason for hope that this generation hasn’t fully realized yet: Bitcoin.</p><p>There are countless <a href="https://www.aecf.org/blog/generation-z-and-mental-health">studies and articles</a> discussing Gen Z and the mental health crises that this generation faces in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, inequality, politics, socio-economic and labor market conditions and more. Understandably so, these factors have taken a toll on this generation, and there continues to be an overarching narrative of hopelessness, from environmentalist groups that have, in many instances, placed the burden of future climate catastrophe on this younger generation that now faces <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-climate-change-keeping-you-up-at-night-you-may-have-climate-anxiety-202206132761">“climate anxiety,”</a> to politicians labeling each election as a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/11/03/remarks-by-president-biden-on-standing-up-for-democracy/">fight for our democracy/nation</a>. Previous generations were offered more reasons for optimism — including <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/chasing-the-dream/stories/boomers-american-dream/">relative affordability of the middle-class American dream</a> — than my generation of millennials being encouraged to be what we wanted to be and to see innovation and creativity at every turn. While my generation has also seen the crushing reality of the great financial crises, student debt and some similar anxieties to those faced by Gen Z, we still have the benefit of having grown up in an age of limitless possibility through the advent of the internet, which has better prepared us for the state of the world today. </p><p>I have seen firsthand the effects of these issues on the younger generation. In my role as the senior director of youth programs for a Somerville, Massachusetts-based nonprofit working with high school partners in our region, it’s clear to me that our youth are facing grim outlooks, from trying to get through school during COVID-19 and the dismal state of virtual learning at the time, to trying to prepare for the future and navigating work, college and mental health challenges, all while many of these students also work to assist with their own families’ basic needs. </p><p>Teachers are overworked and underpaid and students lack the support needed to navigate these issues. Families are burdened with rising inflation, lack of savings and college has yet (if ever) to become more affordable. Hope, if ever it is to be found, has not been the dominant narrative over these past few years. However, there is much to be hopeful for with Bitcoin. </p><p>Bitcoin, just like the internet, increases its use cases and possibilities each year. Since <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper</a> dropped on October 31, 2008 in the wake of a great financial crisis, hope has increasingly been found in the possibilities and use cases of Bitcoin.</p><h3>Bitcoin Is Hope For The Environment</h3><p>A popular narrative from mainstream media, politicians (particularly from the Democratic party, of which I am a registered voter), and large environmentalist groups is that <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-bitcoin-is-bad-for-the-environment">Bitcoin is bad for the environment</a>. End of discussion. </p><p>Unfortunately, many in Gen Z have been presented with this as fact, whereas the reality is that the possibilities of Bitcoin, particularly through mining and the <a href="https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/can-bitcoin-mining-save-the-environment">positive effects it can have on our environment</a>, are quite limitless and just being realized. Bitcoin incentivizes further build out of renewable energy and can off-set carbon emissions, stabilize energy grids, bring energy to remote destinations around the world via financial incentives and do so much more. Young people facing climate anxiety should be taught the benefits of Bitcoin on our environment and see all of the great potential in tackling climate change while also spreading prosperity and stability to those most in need. </p><h3>Bitcoin Is Hope For A More Socially-Just Economic System</h3><p>Gen Z is greatly concerned about injustice, inequality and corporate greed and it is <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/majority-gen-z-americans-hold-negative-views-capitalism-poll-1604334?amp=1">increasingly skeptical of “capitalism.”</a> Bitcoin offers equal access — a transparent system that cannot be manipulated or controlled. We are doing a disservice to this younger generation by <em>not</em> sharing with them the progressive ideas inherent in Bitcoin that promote financial freedom and greater equality. Shall we let banks and the rich be the early adopters of Bitcoin, or should we frame Bitcoin as something that incentivizes Gen Z to hold this freedom technology?</p><h3>Bitcoin Is Hope For Democracy </h3><p>Gen Z is increasingly skeptical of politicians and our political process in the United States. With Bitcoin, and on a bitcoin standard, fiat incentives in politics are more drastically limited. </p><p>Regardless of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-a-trojan-horse-for-freedom">intention</a>, Bitcoin is a system based on “don’t trust, verify,” which means more accountability in our politics, and less manipulation and trust needed. Now, this by no means completely fixes politics or guarantees a perfect utopian democracy, but it can give hope to this generation that wants their voices to be heard, and wants freedom and agency to control their narrative and see a better world. I think this is a much greater selling point than what the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/great-reset/">World Economic Forum</a> will offer.</p><p>This list of hope via Bitcoin is just the beginning. Gen Z deserves the opportunity to be presented with the stories of hope in Bitcoin, rather than beaten down with the future hellscape that has increasingly taken a devastating toll on this generation. While Gen Z fights for a better future, Bitcoin must play a central role in this fight for the outcomes they hope to achieve to become a reality. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Trey Walsh.

    </figure><p>Bitcoin maximalists have had a whirlwind of a year. From getting browbeat through the recent <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;category=&amp;chartStyle=line&amp;contractExpiration=1680220800&amp;ema=0&amp;m=market.PriceDrawdownRelative&amp;resolution=24h&amp;zoom=all">price drawdown</a> to being seemingly <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoiners-warned-you-about-ftx">prophetic bell-ringers of the dumpster fire that is “crypto,”</a> much of what has been written in the mainstream remains net negative. What’s concerning is that their centralized, authoritarian counterparts (referred to here as fiat maximalists) somehow maintain an air of superiority in the mainstream. Oddly, both Bitcoin maxis and fiat maxis have some similarities in their structure. But <em>how</em> they each attempt to achieve their goal is where they differ dramatically.</p><p>As a child of the early gaming systems, I fancied the “Street Fighter” and “Mortal Kombat” series. I’d even consider myself a formidable “Tekken” opponent. From those experiences, I often frame real-world comparisons using the “choose your fighter” paradigm. Whether I’m choosing which side of a debate has the best arguments, which ideology delivers the optimal outcome or which strategy is best suited for a game, I end up creating a mental list of attributes from which I can better choose my course of action. </p><p>So, what would it look like to size up Bitcoin maxis versus fiat maxis? Does one side have a stronger argument? Does one ideology deliver optimal outcomes versus the other? Or is it simply that one strategy is better suited to win in “the game” of monetary dominance? Let’s compare…</p><h2>Structurally Similar</h2><figure>

    </figure><p><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/who-cares-about-bitcoin-maximalism">Shinobi recently defined</a> Bitcoin maxis as those who focus on Bitcoin, share criticism of other technologies and are constantly preaching the virtues of Bitcoin. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/why-bitcoin-maximalism-is-critical">Stephan Livera defines</a> Bitcoin Maximalism as “the view that we’ll live on a bitcoin standard…” and that “maximalists want to clearly distinguish Bitcoin from ‘crypto.’” A potential framing of the toxic aspects of Bitcoin maximalism could be those preaching further out on the spectrum of decentralized (versus centralized), individualistic (versus collectivist) and laissez-faire (versus authoritarian), often confrontationally and controversially.</p><p>Conversely, when we apply these terms to fiat maxis, we can start to see some common themes. They focus on fiat currencies, criticize Bitcoin and pseudo-competing technologies, and are constantly preaching the virtues of the almighty dollar or similar coercive currencies. The fiat maxi maintains the view that we will all continue with the fiat standard. They also try to lump Bitcoin and “crypto” together. The toxic aspects of fiat maximalism tend to be those further out on the spectrum of centralized (versus decentralized), collectivist (versus individualistic), and authoritarian (versus laissez-faire). These are the ones who want you to eat the bugs, live in a pod, and, as the <a href="https://twitter.com/wef/status/808328302213689344">World Economic Forum states</a>, “own nothing” and “be happy.”</p><p>When compared with these categorizations, it’s easy to see how we’re all so similar; we all want what we want in the way we want it. We’re not so different, you and I. We’re two sides of the same coin! Time to start singing “Kumbaya”? No? Well, although Bitcoin and fiat maxis are structurally similar in regards to their monetary systems, <em>how</em> they go about achieving it is where they contrast starkly.</p><h2>Stark Contrasts</h2><figure>

    </figure><p>“<a href="https://www.cyberdefinitions.com/definitions/GFY.html">GFY</a>” is a common anthem of the toxic Bitcoin maxi. If that makes you uncomfortable, pause for a moment, take a deep breath, and challenge yourself to understand why that’s not such a bad thing. </p><p>Comments like these are overt in nature, which is a feature not a bug. <a href="https://tomerstrolight.medium.com/bitcoiners-are-not-toxic-they-have-integrity-bd866d2773e9">Tomer Strolight wrote</a> “that thing that some people consider a ‘bug’ in bitcoin that they call ‘toxicity’ is in fact the virtue of integrity.” Most of the GFY-like comments are preceded by those either disingenuously or erroneously attacking Bitcoin; toxic Bitcoin maxis draw a line in the sand. <a href="https://tomerstrolight.medium.com/bitcoiners-are-not-toxic-they-have-integrity-bd866d2773e9">Strolight further offers</a> the concept of “principle-based toxicity,” which he considers an “intolerance of what Bitcoiners consider fatal compromises to Bitcoin.” This includes surrendering decentralization, sound engineering or security, all in exchange for adoption of some form.</p><p>If something I value is being attacked, I want to know that the people around me are willing to help defend it. Furthermore, personal growth happens when there’s a firm foundation upon which to build. If I’m surrounded by people willing to tell me the truth, I’m more likely to make sound decisions. As odd as it may sound, GFY is sincere; Bitcoin maxis are letting the intended recipient know they’re full of it and will not tolerate anything short of the truth, which is similar to the truth provided by Bitcoin’s consensus algorithm.</p><p>Personally, my BS detector has improved dramatically since I started studying the virtues of Bitcoin. While this is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N_of_1_trial">N of 1</a> observation, I’ve encountered many similar anecdotes from Bitcoiners. That being said, there’s value in standing your ground while also calmly calling out someone’s inconsistencies in a constructive way. We should all strive to attain <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor">Michael Saylor</a>’s ability to maintain a positive, collaborative, illustrative and welcoming frame.</p><p>Contrast all of that with the covert nature of the toxic fiat maximalist. These are the people who engage in what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublespeak">George Orwell referred to as “doublespeak,”</a> language that deliberately obscures, disguises, distorts or reverses the meaning of words. Common to the toxic fiat maxi, this language does not display integrity. It is often used divisively in order to garner more control; it’s insidious in nature.</p><p>Whether it’s <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pelosi-healthcare-pass-the-bill-to-see-what-is-in-it/">Nancy Pelosi's obscure</a> "we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it" comment to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/elizabeth-warren-progressives-should-love-bitcoin">Elizabeth Warren’s divisive</a> “shadowy faceless group of super coders,” all of these are just word salads attempting to coerce the public into a preapproved mindset; it’s obfuscatory optics. Nothing they say offers solid truths; it’s hot air intended to puff up their perceived sense of power. Words are weapons they wield to sway public perception. At least <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/the-bis-wants-absolute-control-of-your-money-via-central-bank-digital-currencies/">Agustin Carsten was direct</a> when he said that, with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), “central bank(s) will have absolute control on the rules and regulations.” </p><p>So, seriously, kudos to you for that.</p><h2>Choose Your Fighter</h2><figure>

    </figure><p>It’s time to choose your fighter. Who do you want to associate with? Someone who has a principled approach and provides a clear conception of reality (regardless of political correctness) or a wordsmith with the intent to deceive? Someone who wants to allow you to be you (regardless of what “you” stands for) or someone who will attempt to exert influence over others who don’t share their conception of what ought to be?</p><p>In a weird way, the preferred monetary medium is irrelevant (at least in the vacuum of this framing). What is relevant is the outcomes of human behavior seemingly created by each system. I often wonder what size the effect of the chosen monetary system has upon the individuals within said system. It’s as if Bitcoin is a forcing function for facts while fiat is a forcing function for falsehoods.</p><p>This fight continues to play itself out on the main stage of society. I believe it’s imperative to not only choose the side of truth and reason, but also to share these facts with those you love. A bottom-up, grassroots approach is the ethical way to garner consensus. Where fiat maxis will coerce you with their doublespeak to continually create their ruling-class legacy in their image, Bitcoin maxis will continue to authentically advocate for truth and reason.</p><p>Bitcoin maxis are the antithesis of fiat maxis; Bitcoin maxis exude integrity, sincerity and truthfulness whereas fiat maxis exhibit corruption, artificiality and equivocation. Bitcoin is to signal what fiat is to noise. In a head-to-head match, I choose Bitcoin maxis hands down, every time. Good ideas don’t require force. Adoption is increasing. Our time will come.

Last time we touched on these dynamics was in “<a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/the-bitcoin-ghost-town">The Bitcoin Ghost Town</a>” in October, where we highlighted that an extremely low volume and low volatility period in bitcoin price, GBTC and the options market was a concerning sign for the next leg lower. This played out in early November.</p><p>Fast forward and the trends of declining volume and low volatility are back once again. Although this could be indicative of another leg lower to come in the market, it’s more likely indicative of a complacent and decimated market that few participants want to touch. </p><p>Even during the November 2021 capitulation period, there was a historically low period of volatility. Sometimes the most market pain can be felt when having to wait for a clear change in trends. The bitcoin price is providing that pain as we’ve yet to see the type of explosion in market volatility that has defined market pivots and major directional moves in the past.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>While there are many different ways to define, classify and estimate bitcoin volume in the market, they all show the same thing: September and November 2021 were the peak months of action. Since then, volume in both the spot and perpetual futures markets have been in steady decline.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Overall market depth and liquidity has also taken a major hit after the collapse of FTX and Alameda. Their destruction has led to a large liquidity hole, which is yet to be filled due to the lack of market makers currently in the space.</p><p>By far, bitcoin is still the most liquid market of any other cryptocurrency or “token,” but it’s still relatively illiquid compared to other capital markets since the whole industry has been crushed over the last few months. Lower market depth and liquidity means assets are prone to more volatile shocks as single, relatively large orders can have a greater impact on market price.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>On-Chain Apathy</h3><p>As expected in the current environment, we’re also seeing more market complacency when looking at on-chain data. Although continuing to rise over time, the number of active addresses — unique addresses active as either a sender or receiver — remain fairly stagnant over the last few months. The chart below highlights the 14-day moving average of active addresses falling below the running average over the last year. In previous bull market conditions, we’ve seen growth in active addresses outpace the existing trend fairly significantly.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Since address data has its flaws, looking at Glassnode’s data for active entities shows us the same trend. Overall, bear markets reversing are the result of many factors, including growth in new users and an increase in on-chain activity.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In our July 11 release “<a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/when-will-the-bear-market-end">When Will The Bear Market End?</a>”, we made the case that the brunt of the price-based capitulation had already been felt, while the real pain ahead was in the form of a time-based capitulation.</p><blockquote><p>“A look at previous bitcoin bear market cycles shows two distinct phases of capitulation:</p><p>“The first is a price-based capitulation, through a series of sharp selloffs and liquidations, as the asset draws down anywhere from 70 to 90% below previous all-time-high levels.</p><p>“The second phase, and the one that is spoken of far less often, is the time-based capitulation, where the market finally begins to find an equilibrium of supply and demand in a deep trough.” — <a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/when-will-the-bear-market-end">Bitcoin Magazine PRO</a></p></blockquote><p>We believe time-based capitulation is where we stand today. While exchange rate pressures can certainly intensify over the short term — given the macroeconomic headwinds that remain — the conditions that look likely to persist over the short and medium term look to be a sustained period of chop with extremely low levels of volatility that leave both traders and HODLers questioning when volatility and exchange rate appreciation will return.</p><hr><p><em>Like this content? </em><a href="https://bm.b.tc/3Wlped5"><em>Subscribe now</em></a><em> to receive PRO articles directly in your inbox.</em></p><figure>

Many of us said that it would only get stranger, but I’m not sure anyone was truly ready for what would transpire.</p><p>In this short article, I’m going to have a quick look at the good, the bad and the ugly of 2022, and I’ll talk a little about what decisions I’m making for 2023 onwards. I’ve been controversial at the best of times, to say the least, and perhaps unnecessarily toxic at the worst. I’ve decided that this needs to change because it’s neither healthy, nor useful. There are others who can hold that mantle. My focus herein shall be education. And more of it.</p><p>Anyway, let us get on with the review of the year of the bear.</p><h2>The Good</h2><p>This was a year of cleansing — a cold shower for the Bitcoin industry at large, which was caught up in the froth and hyperbole of the “crapto” industry.</p><p>Many of us came into 2022 expecting to see bitcoin rally back through all-time highs, through $100,000 and off to $250,000. It was almost a done deal. Major Bitcoin-focused social media accounts were adamant that, because bitcoin is now held on the balance sheets of large institutions and public companies, the days of “80% drawdowns are behind us.”</p><p>While we pointed out shitcoins, scams and the like, we were well and truly caught off guard with the level of fraud and shenanigans underlying much of the frothy price movement.</p><p>Let’s list them out:</p><p>First, we had the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/terra-collapse-teaches-about-crypto-and-bitcoin">shitshow over at Luna</a> with our friend Do Kwon, the stablecoin superman who thought he could do what no central bank in history has ever been able to do: maintain a peg.</p><p>He was positioned as a wonderboy of the financial world. Mike Novogratz even tattooed Luna on his shoulder in classic, frothy, peak-cycle fashion:</p><figure>

        <figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/novogratz/status/1478555865389096966"><em>Source</em></a></figcaption>
    </figure><p>Of course, this stupidity blew up and took a bunch of idiots with it.</p><p>Next, we had Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and the “crapto hedge funds.” The <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/07/crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-founders-are-missing.html">managers of said fund disappeared</a>, along with their clients’ money, only to <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/07/12/three-arrows-capital-3ac-founder-su-zhu-kyle-davies-insolvency-bankruptcy-court-administrator/">reappear months later</a> to post inspirational tweets. Seriously.</p><p>The “no pants when the tide goes back” out continued as the contagion spread. It took out <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy">Celsius</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/voyager-digital-files-for-bankruptcy">Voyager</a> and friends, as some claimed that these bank runs were somehow the fault of the people who warned of their demise. Crazy.</p><p>And then, of course, we had the big daddy of them all: Scam Bankman-Fraud (SBF) and FTX. This kid put Bernie Madoff, Elizabeth Holmes and Enron to shame, combined. I’ll discuss him a little later in the “ugly” part (very fitting) but the benefit, i.e., “the good,” was multi-faceted.</p><p>It taught many people a number of key lessons:</p><ol><li>Crypto is crapto, and it's not Bitcoin</li><li>Not your keys, not your coins</li><li>Altruist, wonder-boy nerds are more than likely actors and scammers, not saviors</li></ol><p>And it took out an entire portfolio of shitcoin “companies” that <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/ftx-lost-up-to-2b-in-user-funds-10b-sent-to-alameda-report">Alameda had invested in by siphoning user funds through their accounting shenanigans</a>.</p><p>Sure, the bitcoin price was slammed, but considering the level of stupidity that we saw, and the backdrop of fiscal tightening, bitcoin is doing OK.</p><p>A lower price has meant that the classes of 2020 and 2021 have been able to accumulate bitcoin like never before. They had their 2019 moment. Perhaps even their March 2020 moment (although I hesitate to speak too soon). I’m not sure many of them would ever have become whole coiners had this gift not fallen in their laps. </p><p>And, in addition to that, we saw the elimination or re-evaluation of a lot of the ridiculous Ethereum envy that we saw emerging from the technical fringes of Bitcoin. Many went from raising money at stupid valuations for ideas that quite frankly do <em>not</em> matter now, to being very, very quiet. </p><p>So, all in all, there was much pain, but like on leg day or, perhaps more accurately, like a hardcore detox and water fast, we’ve had a clean up of the industry. A flushing of much of the shitcoinery (not all of it, unfortunately, but a lot), a clean up of the froth in bitcoin, the minting of a whole new cohort of Bitcoiners, and the “earning of stripes” for the last cohort from 2020 onwards.</p><p>Next…</p><h2>The Bad</h2><p>I’ve kind of killed my ammunition for this section because, if anything, it would’ve been used to point out what occurred in the aftermath of all the Ponzi schemes blowing up, and how they ran off with everyone’s money.</p><p>So, in the absence of pointing that out, let’s explore what else may have been bad about this year. At least in relation to Bitcoin.</p><h3>1. CBDCs</h3><p><br>It seems that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have moved closer to reality and are now well within the Overton window of economic discourse. This normalization is bad, because most people are stupid enough to continue supporting the very tools that will lead to their gulagification. The one saving grace we have is the incompetence of the institutions rolling this stuff out, but it may be balanced by the will to comply from the same people who fell for the lies of 2020 and 2021. It’s a shame that we’re all so politically and economically connected.<br></p><h3>2. Delay Toward Hyperbitcoinization</h3><p>This is a tricky one, because one day I believe we’ve been delayed, the next I think we have lightened the load and we’ll make it there quicker. I’m not sure where I stand, but there is a fair argument that says, “Had all of these stupid distractions and shitcoins not existed, and had the fraudsters not frothed and blown things up, perhaps 2021 and 2022 growth would have been a little more steady and sustainable — and we’d not have to go through this cleansing.” </p><p>It’s akin to the argument that you wouldn’t need to detox if you were more sensible with your diet in the first place. And this may be true. But alas, if society were a single human being, it would be an obese degenerate eating Cheetos and watching Netflix, who is in desperate need of a detox. Should we expect more?</p><h3>3. Infighting</h3><p>This one is also tricky, because I have been a very vocal advocate of weeding out adversaries, spooks and stupidity through unfettered discourse, which at times can and should be toxic. But…. I’m at the point where I think it’s unhealthy — and I, for one, have been a culprit in making it that way. I think a lot of us took on the mantle of “toxic” a little too literally, and instead of being useful, helpful or inspiring, we’ve just turned into a bunch of keyboard-warrior trolls. <br><br>I no longer think this shit is healthy. Instead of fighting the enemy, we’re fighting each other. Instead of producing meaningful content, we’re constantly making memes — which, granted, are very, very effective pieces of content, but at this point, many of them are just “in jokes” and don’t serve anyone or anything outside of a small click.<br><br>That’s fine if you want to just spend your days trolling, but similar to my own personal and stupid tirades on Twitter and often controversial (and sometimes ridiculous) takes, they don’t help anyone. I think many of us are so frustrated (I was squarely in this camp for 2022) that we can’t have the impact we want, that we’ve picked targets closer to us. Perhaps that’s the effect that Twitter has on people. My hope is that the discourse improves, and I intend to start with myself and perhaps inspire others. Time will tell.<br></p><h3>4. Wealth Effect Shattered</h3><p><br>For many Bitcoiners, (I think) we’d made plans based on an increasing purchasing power and envisioned a style of life that a greater bitcoin price could accommodate.<br></p><p>I personally did. I went hard at the beginning of the year after a few changes in personal circumstances. I didn’t keep much dry powder and, as such, I thought I had completed the greater part of my stacking, and that any future additions (flow) would only be marginal in relation to my stock. As such, I was caught in a tight spot when I had to juggle getting married, with sourcing new forms of revenue and reinventing myself as a content creator, in the middle of a bitcoin bear market, among other things. I get the sense that I was not the only one caught off guard in that sense. I, and many others, managed to find a way through it, but in many cases, it was not an easy process and I think it may have added to the subconscious frustration that manifested on Twitter. I’m calling myself out here first and foremost.</p><p>Other than these four standouts, there was obviously further insanity in the broader geopolitical and macroeconomic landscapes.</p><p>The stupidity of the State continued to exceed all of our expectations, which leads me into the final section…</p><h2>The Ugly</h2><p>The ugly part of 2022 was the utter injustice of everything.</p><p>The world is morally, socially and psychologically broken.

    </figure><p>As I said, if any of this ugliness tells us anything, it's that the world has lost its moral compass entirely. The evil are praised and bailed out in plain sight, while the good are locked up, and the key thrown away.</p><p>Ross Ulbricht is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-from-prison">serving two life sentences</a> for the alleged “crime” of building a goddamn online marketplace for consenting individuals to buy things from each other. The fact that the items are “illegal goods” as per the dictates of the State matters not. That’s just a ridiculous position set out by bureaucratic parasites who will often do the drugs themselves. Whether you’re pro or against drugs (I’m personally against them), the fact remains that Ulbricht took nothing from anybody and is suffering the severest of punishments for simply connecting people online, and protecting his business interests.</p><p>Edward Snowden is another example. Like Ulbricht, it’s not a “this year” thing, but he’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden_asylum_in_Russia#:~:text=citizenship%20by%20birthright.-,2022,passport%2C%20according%20to%20his%20lawyer.">living in exile somewhere in Russia</a>, as if he’s a criminal for “leaking” the <em>truth</em> to the American people.</p><p>And likewise, Julian Assange is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment_and_arrest_of_Julian_Assange">rotting in a cell somewhere</a> for literally reporting on the truth.</p><p>As Shakespeare <a href="https://literarydevices.net/something-is-rotten-in-the-state-of-denmark/">wrote</a>, “There is something rotten in the state of Denmark”</p><p>It’s hard not to get black pilled in the face of such absurdity. But I do believe there is some hope. My hope lies in the fact that, as I’ve said before, Bitcoin’s greatest impact on the world will be the reintroduction of localized economic consequences. The downstream effect of this, I believe, will be better governance and better, more just leadership — because without a money printer, you cannot paper over bad decisions and you are held to greater account.</p><p>I can only hope that such economic and mega-political impacts occur within the lifetime of people such as Ulbricht, Snowden and Assange, who are unjustly serving sentences for crimes not committed.</p><p>If not, then at the very least, it’s my belief that the era that our children or children’s children grow up in will be on a Bitcoin standard, and that such stupidity will be much harder to get away with.</p><p>It will be a more beautiful place in that sense, because beauty is a harmony and a symmetry.</p><p>Right now, the world is so out of center, so out of symmetry that we are seeing criminals walk free and fly in luxury, while heroes and leaders languish in cells.</p><p>And for those who want to claim that “beauty is subjective,” I'm sorry, but you’re either myopic or stupid. Beauty is an objective pattern, just like the fractals that exist from the microscopic through to the galactic.</p><p>Economics, society and civilization themselves are beautiful when they adhere to such symmetry and harmony.</p><p>It’s my hope that Bitcoin’s neutral, unchangeable presence will make beauty a reality once more, and I hope that by the end of the decade I am writing a guest piece called: “The Good, The Bad And The Beautiful” to commemorate how far we’ve come.</p><p>But, until then, we have a battle on our hands. So here’s to a better, more wholesome and meaningful 2023, where we each show up with greater strength and integrity than we have in the past.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Aleks Svetski.

But there are also many low-profile ripoffs that fly under the mainstream media radar.</p><p>Houston Attorney Andrew J. Cobos of the <a href="https://www.cobos.law/">Cobos Law Firm</a> includes Bitcoin-related legal disputes in his litigation practice. According to an interview with Cobos for this article, one of his current cases involves an elderly woman who, in 2017, was approached by a young pastor at her church, who encouraged her to invest in bitcoin with his help. The woman and the man entered into an oral agreement that she would transfer $80,000 to him, and he would use her money to buy bitcoin and safely store it for her. Now, the plaintiff in the case, the elderly woman, accuses the man of stealing her bitcoin through the knowledge and use of her private keys. Trial in this case is set for Spring 2023 in Harris County, Texas (<a href="https://www.hcdistrictclerk.com/Edocs/Public/CaseDetails.aspx?Get=KkdyeCwESDx%2fJ9I1y6%2f61YsoiQ5JVyca2nekkdqAVpt8h8ALjl110N8mEh+V71OtcoI0YTv7jz6OdXtj5M%2fJh3X0Yg6aqNZfi+Vu5Uz4r5E%3d">case number 2021-51487</a>). </p><p>According to the lawsuit, the pastor purchased and held the bitcoin for the elderly woman until July 2020, when the woman requested that the bitcoin be returned. The pastor then ordered and set up a Trezor hardware wallet containing 7.742 bitcoin, and gave the woman the Trezor device along with a “seed phrase card” that the pastor had completed. Days later, the woman opened the Trezor to discover that all of her bitcoin had been removed from the Trezor device. </p><p>Cobos has alleged that the pastor maintained a copy of the seed phrase card and recreated the wallet after giving her the Trezor, and thereafter transferred all of the bitcoin to a separate wallet that he controlled. The elderly woman contacted the pastor to inquire about the missing assets and was told that his system was “hacked.” With no recourse through law-enforcement, the elderly woman turned to a trial lawyer and the court system for help. </p><p>According to Cobos, this kind of malfeasance seems to be on the rise with Bitcoin’s growing adoption, as newbies to the space are being exploited by street-level fraudsters. Though it is novel case law, such fraud is not new to the Bitcoin space. Even some of the most sophisticated investors have been involved in this type of litigation. </p><p>Back in 2012, the Winklevoss twins contracted with Charlie Shrem to buy $750,000 in bitcoin, which was worth only $18.81 at that time. According to <a href="https://casetext.com/case/winklevoss-capital-fund-llc-v-shrem/">court documents</a> WCF (the Winklevoss' fund) alleged that Shrem could not account for $61,000 of the money they transferred to him, and that he had purchased 5,000 bitcoin for himself. WCF claimed that the stolen bitcoin was worth $26 million at the time of the filing.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://casetext.com/case/winklevoss-capital-fund-llc-v-shrem">case text</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“WCF hired an accountant in February 2013 to perform an audit, and the auditor found that Shrem could not account for $61,000 sent to him, which was the equivalent of about 5,000 Bitcoin at the time based on the average price of $12.15 per Bitcoin. Shrem disputed this, but never provided additional information. Another company hired by WCF identified that Shrem's Bitcoin address received 5,000 Bitcoin on December 31, 2012, almost exactly the amount of the shortfall identified by WCF's accountant.”</p></blockquote><p>The case was <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/17/winklevoss-capital-charlie-shrem-settle-26-million-bitcoin-lawsuit/">settled out of court in April 2019</a> without a public disclosure of the terms. However, contrary to a filing by the twins’ attorney stating that “…WCF and Shrem will each bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs,” Shrem said in a statement to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/17/winklevoss-capital-charlie-shrem-settle-26-million-bitcoin-lawsuit/">Coindesk</a> that the Winklevosses were ordered to pay Shrem’s attorneys’ fees. </p><p>I believe that the most important lesson we can learn from these two similar stories is that the oft-repeated maxim should continue being oft-repeated by Bitcoiners: “Don’t trust, verify!” Though the Winklevoss hadn’t known Charlie for very long, they trusted him because he knew Bitcoin better than they did back in 2012. He was one of very few well known OGs around at the time. They learned the lesson the hard way, as did the elderly churchgoing lady. Though the young pastor was supposedly an upstanding member of her church, she leaned too far on his expertise, blindly trusting in his integrity, and waiting three years to verify that she still controlled the 7.742 bitcoins. </p><p>“Experts” in Bitcoin who call themselves “Bitcoiners” can equally be <em>practiced at the art of deception</em>. </p><p>Yes, the Bitcoin protocol is virtually perfect and incorruptible, but human beings — even Bitcoiners — are not (big shock gasp). As in any space where great wealth is at stake, there is a broad spectrum from naive innocents to career parasites — doves and vultures. Let us resolve to be eagles — defenders of the nest eggs — both our own and others. Let us continue in diligence to educate ourselves and our “orange-pillees” while being vigilant to seek out and expose the “Scam Bankster Frauds” and other wolves in sheeps’ clothing of the world at all levels of their <em>scamduggery</em>. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Phil Snyder.

Instead, eventually, they will aggressively compete for it and those with larger fractions of 21 million will have greater strategic and economic primacy than their geopolitical competitors. </p><p>With that being said, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Strategy_(United_States)">National Security Strategy</a> (NSS) is a periodic document designed to communicate the vision of the executive branch and serve as the roadmap for U.S. that helps Congress carry out the directions laid out by the highest office in the land. The October 2022 <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf">NSS </a>outlines how the White House “will seize this decisive decade to advance America’s vital interests, position the United States to outmaneuver geopolitical competitors, tackle shared challenges, and set our world firmly on a path toward a brighter and more hopeful tomorrow.”</p><p>These powerful words not only inspire hope and promise of a better future for the American people as the U.S. strives to continue to be the champion of freedom and democracy on the world stage, but they also recognize that if there are any missteps in the nation’s strategic interests, that might bring further darkness to a country desperately seeking light or, even worse, cost the nation to lose a grip on its global influence. It is imperative that the U.S. truly weighs all available options in order to secure the best outcomes that promote American values and protect the American way of life.</p><h2>Digital Currency Can No Longer Be Ignored</h2><p>Part of the most recent NSS, under the “Trade And Economics” section, states, “[the U.S.] will explore the merits and responsibly lead development of digital assets, including a <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/central-bank-digital-currency.htm">digital dollar,</a> with high standards and protections for stability, privacy, and security to benefit a strong and inclusive U.S. financial system and reinforce its global primacy.”</p><p>Despite being labeled “magic internet money” and “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/05/warren-buffett-says-bitcoin-is-probably-rat-poison-squared.html">rat poison</a>” over the last decade, the rise of Bitcoin secured its credibility and since then, has gradually made its way into committees and boardrooms consisting of members holding the highest positions of influence. It can no longer be ignored. The aforementioned excerpt of the NSS provides important insight into the executive branch’s current view of the growing significance of developing digital assets like Bitcoin.</p><p>One driver for this growing interest into digital assets is undoubtedly the U.S. national debt, as the nation currently runs a <a href="https://www.usdebtclock.org/">$31 trillion deficit with no sign of slowing down.</a> Senator Rand Paul recently acknowledged that <a href="https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=rand+paul+omnibus+bill&amp;docid=13930151887506&amp;mid=FC16587E08054145C578FC16587E08054145C578&amp;view=detail&amp;FORM=VIRE">“the greatest national security risk is our debt</a>” after the release of a single, <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/3785395-senate-passes-1-7-trillion-omnibus-spending-package/">$1.7 trillion</a> (or roughly 95 million bitcoin, in today’s value) spending package. The mountain of national debt is certainly a cause of concern.</p><p>There are only two ways a deficit of that magnitude can ever be paid: either by default through a monetary reset or inflation. Because of the unsurmountable level of debt, there is a growing need for innovation to help solve this dilemma. The path to a digital dollar is nearly inevitable, as the era of 0% money quickly approaches its expiration date and forces the transition into a new monetary system that will be birthed into existence — a monumental shift of which the world has not experienced since the likes of the <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1969-1976/nixon-shock">Nixon Shock in 1971</a>. In 1971, instead of defaulting on its financial obligations, the U.S. changed the economic policy entirely, ended the Bretton Woods era and removed gold from being tied to the U.S. dollar. </p><p>If history is any future indicator of what will occur at the end of the next financial cycle, the U.S. will likely explore an alternative economic policy as alluded to in the NSS, but this time will introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC), or a digital dollar, to avoid defaulting on its current debt which, ironically, is a form of default.</p><h2>The U.S. Can Adopt Bitcoin</h2><p>However, there may not be a need for the U.S. to invent a domestic digital dollar as Bitcoin fits the criteria that the NSS details. Bitcoin is the hardest form of money and provides&nbsp;the highest standards of protection to individuals. It is the most <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-confirmationtime.html#3y">stable</a> digital asset as it continues to release a new block every 10 minutes, and is the most inclusive monetary protocol as it allows not just individuals with social security numbers and two forms of government-issued IDs to access its benefits, but its open-source protocol grants protection and services to everyone including<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2022/07/21/covid-19-boosted-the-adoption-of-digital-financial-services"> the 1.4 billion unbanked people across the worl</a>d while the <a href="https://lightning.network/">Lightning Network</a> promotes efficient transactions,&nbsp;arguably the most important dimension of a globalized economy.</p><p>As more individuals, companies, banks and countries are forced by the market to pay out loans in bitcoin instead of notes, holders of the largest bitcoin stacks will naturally gain more influence. Its built-in deflationary nature and absolute scarcity features ensures that 100% of the work and value created by people is enjoyed and never diminished through monetary debasement. Lastly, Bitcoin’s enormous defense system discourages bad actors as the <a href="https://u.today/heres-how-much-it-costs-to-51-attack-bitcoin-btc">cost of attack</a> has become too great and thus forces peaceful and mutually beneficial agreements.</p><p>In every sense, the Bitcoin protocol perfectly aligns with the core values of the United States and its national security strategy. Contrary to what some senior officials claim, Bitcoin does not generate a national security risk. Instead, ignoring the Bitcoin network would significantly impede the U.S.’s ability to pay its national debt, “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf">outmaneuver [its] geopolitical competitors</a>” and weaken the country’s economic instrument of power, which aims to leverage the country’s wealth to influence the behaviors of others. Thus, further delaying Bitcoin adoption is the national security risk.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Matt Smith.

I have seen several suggestions with no obvious winner.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0OTI5NzEyMjY5NjMyNjc0/sat-symbol-design-options.png" height="588" width="620">

    </figure><p>I believe I have discovered a symbol that we might all agree on — it seems obvious in hindsight. But wait until you hear the reasoning and symbolism before deciding. Here's the symbol I am proposing:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0OTI5NzEyMjY5Njk4NTg0/sat-symbol-3.png" height="844" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>The symbol is made with a reverse "S" which is like writing a "2" (but not quite), and a vertical strikethrough, which is like a "1." The number two and the one together also make 21, referencing the 21 million bitcoin hard supply cap. </p><p>The sat symbol. It's poetically beautiful in my opinion.</p><p>What's more, it's a vertically-reversed dollar sign, which is representing the anti-dollar, or the dollar-killer. Alternatively, it’s a horizontally-reversed dollar sign (it can’t be both, otherwise it would end up flipping back to the dollar sign).</p><p>One of the most important things about the symbol is that there’s a <em>reasonable</em> chance that most people will naturally agree to use it. There has been a very quick and overwhelmingly positive response to a <a href="https://twitter.com/Parman_Public/status/1603698639947599873?s=20&amp;t=6WlY-K_JE_fj8A8lsCFfMQ">tweet announcing the symbol, posted under my public Twitter account</a>.</p><p>This was a typical response:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0OTI5NzEyMjY5NzY0MTIw/tweet-reply-on-new-sat-symbol.png" height="106" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>And others:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0OTI5NzEyMjY5Njk4MjEw/twitter-replies-on-sat-symbol.png" height="828" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>Another Twitterer commented that the reverse “S” and strikethrough can represent the first and last letters of “Satoshi,” which was interesting. Others have said that it contains elements of Knut Svanholm’s “infinity” divided by 21 million meme:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0OTI5NzEyMDAxMTk3MjE4/image5.png" height="656" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/jo4g5p/bitcoin_everything_there_is_divided_by_21_million/"><em>Source</em></a></figcaption>
    </figure><p>An actual “2” was suggested instead of an “S” but that can look a little messy when written in front of actual numbers, and is unlikely to get as much support as I’ve witnessed with the inverted dollar sign. It also doesn’t look pleasing to my eye:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0OTI5NzEyMDAxNzIxODgw/potential-sat-symbol-1.png" height="1043" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>To me, it looks better with an “S”:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0OTI5NzEyMjY5NjMzMDQ4/potential-sat-symbol-2.png" height="830" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>We've already agreed on 21 million bitcoin, or 2.1 quadrillion satoshis — anchoring this Schelling point to a new one I think has a great chance of success.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/gcomxx/status/1603756164118114305?s=20&amp;t=6WlY-K_JE_fj8A8lsCFfMQ">Someone else suggested</a> it looks like an “L2” — fitting because sats are the default unit on the primary Layer 2 protocol, the Lightning Network.</p><p>It’s also important to consider the ease and speed of writing this symbol. It only takes two pen strokes. You only need to lift the pen once. The more decorative the symbol, the more annoying it is to write it by hand, and then, it will just get abbreviated.</p><p>I love the idea of reinforcing the 21 million cap “brain virus” every time someone writes the sats symbol. At least for me, it would bring great satisfaction to write it each and every time.</p><p>No matter which symbol is your favorite, having everyone agree has been part of the problem. Because there are so many reasons that this is a good symbol, I think there’s a good chance that we might settle on this one.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Arman The Parman.

While the United States has grabbed most of the news headlines and a significant portion of investor attention, Canada has also solidified its role as a global leader in mining. From<a href="https://financialpost.com/business-trends/meet-canadas-bitcoin-mining-powerhouse-bitfarms-ltd"> industrial</a> mining farms to<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-in-the-wilderness-11553860802"> off-grid</a> guerrilla mining operations, Canada is home to miners of all stripes.</p><p>But the final months of 2022 saw several provinces target bitcoin miners and suspend any new grid connections while “environmental assessments” were initiated. This article provides an overview of the localized changes in regulatory posture toward miners.</p><h2>Mining Regulations In Canada</h2><p>In late 2022, Hydro-Quebec announced its proposal for the province to stop selling cheap power to cryptocurrency miners, as<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/quebec-shuns-bitcoin-mining-in-bid-to-conserve-power-11670514921"> reported</a> by The Wall Street Journal. The proposal called for the Canada Energy Regulator to suspend the allocation of 270 megawatts requested by cryptocurrency miners. Bitcoin miners in Quebec<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/03/canadian-energy-provider-hydro-quebec-proposes-stopping-electricity-supply-to-blockchain-industry/"> already recognize</a> that local regulations are too restrictive for easy growth, but this new proposal could make mining in the province even harder.</p><p>Right after Thanksgiving, Manitoba<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/energy-demand-manitoba-suspend-cryptocurrency-1.6667264"> announced</a> its plans to halt any new electric grid connections for cryptocurrency mining operations. The suspension will last 18 months from November 2022 to allow for a review of the externalities from the mining industry’s energy demands, according to the province’s finance minister. The 37 currently-operating mining facilities in Manitoba will not be affected for now. But recent requests for new connections from 17 different operators have been suspended, according to<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/energy-demand-manitoba-suspend-cryptocurrency-1.6667264"> CBC</a>.</p><p>Just before Christmas, British Columbia<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/british-columbia-cryptocurrency-suspended-1.6693976"> made headlines</a> for its efforts to stop mining growth to assess the environmental impacts of cryptocurrency mining operations. An 18-month moratorium has been placed on accepting any new requests for electrical grid connections exclusively from bitcoin mining companies. The province said at the time that 21 applications that were pending approval have been suspended. Assessing how bitcoin mining affects the province’s “environmental goals” is the stated reason for B.C.’s 18-month suspension.</p><p>Before these grid connection limitations, Canada had long stood as a global hub for cryptocurrency growth generally and bitcoin mining activity in particular, with a loose<a href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/mining_map"> estimate of 7%</a> of global hash rate operating within its borders. But several localities are starting to make miners feel not so welcome. Two is a coincidence, three is a trend, as the adage says.</p><p>All the way at the top of the Canadian government, the current prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has made it no secret that he frowns on the entire cryptocurrency industry. After his conservative counterpart Pierre Poilievre voiced strong support for Bitcoin, Trudeau wasted no time firing back by<a href="https://decrypt.co/109619/canada-justin-trudeau-conservative-poilievre-bitcoin"> calling</a> his rival’s views “irresponsible” and cryptocurrency “volatile.” From his personal Twitter, however, Trudeau has never tweeted about crypto, bitcoin or mining.</p><h2>The Canadian Mining Landscape</h2><p>Mining discourse generally references “North America” collectively or “the U.S.” individually. But Canada plays a significant role in bolstering the hash rate staying online across the North American region. And, for the most part, Canadian miners endure much harsher climates than their southern counterparts. For example, Upstream Data CEO Steve Barbour<a href="https://twitter.com/SGBarbour/status/1382329723494178828?t=6T7But623-6K1CAHWilYYw&amp;s=19"> shared pictures</a> on Twitter of the underappreciated, destructive effects of harsh Canadian weather on bitcoin mining operations. Frozen cables, iced hardware and large snow drifts do not make for ideal mining conditions.</p><p>But some of the most well-known public and private mining companies operate or are headquartered in Canada. For publicly-traded firms, the list includes Bitfarms, SATO Technologies, Hut 8 and more. The roster of private companies based or operating in Canada includes Compass Mining, Bitfury, Upstream Data and others. Nearly all of these brands are quasi-household names in the bitcoin economy and often play key roles in advocating for and educating about Bitcoin. Canada’s footprint in the bitcoin market is not small.</p><h2>Reacting To Regulatory Changes</h2><p>Local hostility to operational bitcoin mining expansions may be recent news in Canada, but the broader industry is no stranger to this sentiment. The entire industry<a href="https://twitter.com/KMSmithDC/status/1517640771008184323"> banded together</a> to vociferously<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/01/senate-backs-down-on-cryptocurrency-mining-moratorium-00036388"> oppose</a> a proposed two-year moratorium in New York for fossil-fuel-powered mining expansion projects. In late November 2022, the bill<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/23/new-york-imposes-2-year-moratorium-on-new-proof-of-work-mining-after-governor-hochul-signs-bill-into-law/"> passed</a>. The move was<a href="https://twitter.com/RepHuffman/status/1597321342810198017"> cheered</a> by other left-leaning politicians. And Canada seems to be copying their playbook.</p><p>Canada’s new posture toward miners also imitates another international mining hotspot: Kazakhstan. After absorbing an abundance of mining activity that left China, Kazakhstan started<a href="https://forkast.news/kazakhstan-proposes-to-limit-power-consumption-for-new-crypto-miners-as-power-deficit-bites/"> proposing</a> power consumption limitations for new mining activity in October 2021.</p><p>So, how are Canadian miners reacting?</p><p>News of Quebec’s proposal to suspend any new grid connections was widely<a href="https://twitter.com/francispouliot_/status/1588252621928034304"> shared</a> among Bitcoin social circles on Twitter. Unsurprisingly, the chatter was uniformly negative and critical.</p><p>Upstream Data’s Barbour was not altogether shocked, though. Taking to Twitter, he<a href="https://twitter.com/SGBarbour/status/1588267374440218624"> noted</a> that Quebec is “once again” censoring bitcoin miners. Why are the proposed grid connection limitations unsurprising? Because miners “compete with utilities,” according to Barbour. </p><p>“Expect increasing discrimination,” he tweeted.</p><p>Despite changing regulatory sentiment, some of Canada’s biggest miners still plan to expand. Bitfarms said it “continues to look to expand its operations in Québec and add more jobs across the region” in a<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/11/04/2548576/0/en/Bitfarms-responds-to-erroneous-article-advising-that-current-hydroelectric-energy-agreements-remain-in-place-current-and-future-production-continues.html"> press release</a> published shortly after news of Hydro-Quebec’s proposal broke. Quantifying Bitfarm’s impact on the local economy, the press release added, “Bitfarms has invested over CAD$350 million in Québec since its inception and currently employs over 100 employees.”</p><h2>Canada’s Choice</h2><p>Political favor or hostility toward Bitcoin ultimately means very little for the long-term success of the network. In the short term, however, regulatory limitations can make life very difficult for mining companies trying to process transactions and find new blocks. Any regulatory opposition from Canada is highly unlikely to rival China’s all-out ban from 2021. But multiple localities suspending all new requests for grid connections is extremely disruptive all the same.</p><p>Canadian provinces now face a choice: risk losing hash rate to other jurisdictions or embrace mining and the heavily-documented socioeconomic benefits it affords. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Zack Voell.

Whether consciously or not, that move kickstarted an entire movement; one that keeps on breathing and expanding these many years afterwards.

    </figure><p>"Chancellor on brink of the second bailout for banks." A simple but powerful message. The engraving in and of itself serves as an anchor to the physical world, an atestment to Bitcoin’s birthdate –– or, at least, that it couldn’t have possibly been created before Jan 3, 2009, the date the cover was published. But more importantly, and more philosophically, the message establishes a sort of manifesto, from the start. It makes it clear that the system being ignited by that very block takes a stand against the central bank policies enabled by a culture of easy money. Bitcoin, instead, would seek to restore accountability and antifragility through a monetary system based on sound money; one that can’t be debased or controlled, manipulated or manufactured to benefit a lucky few. Bitcoin would seek to level the playing field, ensuring property rights to millions worldwide, equally and irrespective of their status, race, religious beliefs, gender or nationality.</p><p>The fundamental properties of Bitcoin would enable such dream to come true. Powered by a distributed network of nodes, each running the protocol’s software and as such enforcing its rules, Bitcoin would be able to let individuals take up the reins of their financials –– once and for all. As the days and years went by, however, more and more Bitcoin-related activity began drifting to centralized institutions, initially for buying and selling, later for custody, and nowadays for a plethora of services unimaginable in the days of Nakamoto. While such a move enabled a greater participation by people around the world, the initial ideals of Bitcoin have started being neglected. After all, true peer-to-peer electronic cash can’t be actualized in a custodial model where the movement of funds is but an update on a centralized database. Instead, that reality more closely resembles the old, traditional financial system Nakamoto sought to fight in the first place –– one that makes it impossible for people to be sovereign as they can’t be the master of their finances.</p><p>While there are multiple requirements for Bitcoin holders to break free of the established system’s reality, this article focuses on a keystone aspect that shares the holiday with Bitcoin’s birthday. Proof of Keys Day, also celebrated on January 3, was started by infamous Trace Mayer, who rallied people to withdraw their bitcoin en masse from centralized exchanges and custodians. The reason? Only by withdrawing their BTC can people ensure companies of the burgeoning industry aren’t taking part on old and established vices like fractional reserve banking. Moreover, only with bitcoin in their possession –– held by a wallet to which they control the keys –– can people be free to do as they please with their BTC. There are many different ways to do self-custody, and while it can be daunting at first, it’s a necessary step to take the leap from the old to the new system. </p><p>The "keys" discussed here are the <em>private keys</em> for a given Bitcoin wallet. They can be thought of as the wallet’s actual key in that it "unlocks" the wallet and the bitcoin held in it for spending. Without the keys, no bitcoin can be spent. This is because when a Bitcoin transaction is being formed, the sender "locks" the bitcoin with information about the receiver. Thanks to asymmetric cryptography, this transacting dynamic ensures that only the entity that received the bitcoin can spend it next. And this spending is made possible by the receiver’s private keys. So as long as the receiver takes good care of their private keys, only they will ever be able to spend their bitcoin –– no matter what a government, institution or agency thinks or does about that. </p><p>By holding bitcoin in a wallet you create, you ensure that only you can move the bitcoin held in that wallet. When a third party custodian holds your bitcoin for you, they create a wallet for you and tell you the address so you can deposit, but ultimately they control that wallet’s private keys and more often that not that is an information you can’t access. As such, there is a need for permission to be asked to move your bitcoin. While such an ask is automated, it is still necessary so you can move your funds. Often, this takes the form of a "withdrawal request" you issue to your exchange. Proof of Keys Day aims to raise people’s awareness to this fact and entice them to take control of their finances once and for all, making the leap from the traditional financial system to the new, decentralized, Bitcoin-based one. As the saying goes, Not your keys, not your bitcoin!</p><p><em>Start your self-custody journey:</em></p><ul><li><em>Find out how to withdraw from the exchange you use <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/why-and-how-to-withdraw-your-bitcoin-from-exchanges"><em>here</em></a>.</em></li><li><em>Quick and easy step-by-step guide for small amounts of bitcoin <a href="https://twitter.com/namcios/status/1591129413139431425"><em>here</em></a>.</em></li><li><em>Twitter thread with links to tutorials of different levels of self-custody, from beginner to advanced <a href="https://twitter.com/namcios/status/1592678048385871875"><em>here</em></a>.</em></li></ul>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MjMxNzYxODMwNTUzMDkz/bitcoin-stack.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0OTEzOTYyMzU2NzEyNjEw/filc6b5xsaym1ge.jpg" height="316" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0OTEzOTYxMjgyMzgxMzM2/filc6i2x0aewcth.jpg" height="801" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Crypto Contagion Lesson For Lenders: Stay Out Of Bitcoin Mining]]></title><description><![CDATA[The collapse of two giant crypto lending businesses that also mined bitcoin yields a few interesting lessons.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/crypto-lenders-shouldnt-mine-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/crypto-lenders-shouldnt-mine-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[Celsius network]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lending]]></category><category><![CDATA[Feature]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Contagion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Blockfi]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Zack Voell]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2023 01:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NDg4MTA1ODc5ODA3NjY1/crypto-is-broke.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The collapse of two giant crypto lending businesses that also mined bitcoin yields a few interesting lessons.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>“Contagion” is the most popular word in crypto after the disastrous fallout of the past year. And dominos keep falling as investors painfully realize how closely intertwined the entire cryptocurrency industry is. Hundreds of billions of dollars were <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/three-arrows-capital-kyle-davies-su-zhu-crash.html">incinerated</a>.</p><p>And bitcoin mining companies have not completely avoided this. In fact, a unique type of mining business failed catastrophically, which could provide valuable lessons for future entrepreneurs. The combination of crypto lending and crypto mining was showcased in two high-profile companies: <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy">BlockFi</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy">Celsius</a>. Both of these companies are now bankrupt. What happened?</p><p>This article explores the histories, downfalls and lessons of both organizations.</p><h2>The Crypto Lending Businesses’ Mining Interests</h2><p>Even the most casual crypto observer would be familiar with the two industry-leading crypto lending businesses that went bust in 2022. What may be less widely known is that both of these companies also maintained significant bitcoin mining units. BlockFi and Celsius were not only the go-to names for centralized crypto lending, they also heavily invested in bitcoin mining. And when both companies sank, so did their mining teams.</p><p>BlockFi<a href="https://blockfi.com/blockfi-taps-blockstream-for-mining-colocation-services"> announced</a> its new mining operations in May 2021 in the form of a partnership with Blockstream and its long-standing mining unit. Exactly how much hash rate BlockFi is managing through Blockstream has not been disclosed, and the current status of BlockFi’s hash rate at Blockstream facilities is also not fully known. But the lending company <a href="https://blockfi.com/blockfi-taps-blockstream-for-mining-colocation-services">said</a> it viewed mining as a complement to its financial service offerings.</p><p>Celsius also invested heavily in bitcoin mining, with<a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/124968/celsius-500-million-bitcoin-mining"> $500 million</a> spent on its mining efforts as of November 2021. In an older<a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/124968/celsius-500-million-bitcoin-mining"> interview</a>, former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky said the company operated 22,000 mining machines, most of which were Antminer S19 models. Like BlockFi, Mashinsky described his company’s mining efforts as a strategic complement to its lending business.</p><p>To be clear, BlockFi and Celsius were not the only companies operating at the intersection of mining and lending. Mining companies lending their coins to other institutional market participants (e.g., trading firms) is not uncommon. And it’s not unreasonable to assume other, smaller lending firms also had exposure to the mining industry. But BlockFi and Celsius were unparalleled in the combined scale of both their lending and mining operations. Both companies were also bankrupted as a direct result of the fallout from the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">stunning collapse of FTX</a>.</p><h2>Tale Of Two Bankruptcies</h2><p>Both companies — Celsius and BlockFi — have now filed for bankruptcy.</p><p>In June 2022, Celsius announced it was <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/celsius-halts-bitcoin-withdrawals-what-went-wrong">pausing all withdrawals</a>. The next month, the company<a href="https://dfr.vermont.gov/consumer-alert/celsius-network-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy"> filed</a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Machinsky abruptly<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/27/celsius-ceo-resigns-in-the-middle-of-bankruptcy-proceedings.html"> resigned</a> in the middle of the bankruptcy proceedings but not before<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/celsius-founder-reportedly-withdrew-10m-before-bankruptcy-filing-ft"> reportedly</a> withdrawing $10 million.</p><p>The bankruptcy of Celsius Mining came just months after it<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/07/14/celsius-mining-unit-files-for-bankruptcy-just-months-after-announcing-ipo-intention/"> announced</a> its plans to go public. But the company planned to continue mining throughout its bankruptcy proceedings, and defended these plans vigorously. Celsius<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/crypto-lender-celsius-defends-bitcoin-mining-plans-bankruptcy-kicks-off-2022-07-18/"> said</a> its mining operations were key to the company’s restructuring efforts. But mining isn’t cheap. In the first two weeks of mining through bankruptcy, Celsius Mining burned $40 million,<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/celsius-spent-40-million-on-crypto-mining-in-first-two-weeks-of-bankruptcy-11660945275?mod=article_inline"> according</a> to reporting by The Wall Street Journal. At the time, Celsius Mining told the court it expected the mining operations to become profitable by January 2023.</p><p>Shortly after Thanksgiving, BlockFi also<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/28/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy-as-ftx-fallout-spreads.html"> filed</a> for bankruptcy. Its bitcoin mining operations have not played as prominent a role in the proceedings as Celsius’ has. No reports found for this article indicate that Blockstream’s agreement with BlockFi has been terminated or otherwise interrupted.</p><p>But the BlockFi-hosted mining operations were not its only mining-related concerns. In addition to hashing for itself, the company also originated loans to other mining entities. BlockFi’s corporate account<a href="https://twitter.com/blockfi/status/1587141611334443008"> addressed</a> this matter on Twitter one month before filing for bankruptcy. Some reports indicate that BlockFi could have suffered up to<a href="https://financefeeds.com/blockfi-faces-80-in-losses-over-exposure-to-crypto-miner-core-scientific/"> $80 million</a> in losses from its exposure to Core Scientific, for example.</p><h2>Why Mine And Lend?</h2><p>Why a lending company wants to mine bitcoin at all is a question worth answering. The precise answers to this vary, but here’s a simple explanation of one potential motivation: By essentially acting as “crypto savings banks” and lending bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) to various retail and institutional counterparties, institutions like BlockFi, for example, had minimal exposure at best to bitcoin’s parabolic upside. Its borrower clients, on the other hand, had full exposure to the market’s volatility. In theory, spinning up a mining operation could give lenders more material risk exposure with larger potential profits.</p><p>But the lending business — especially given how some of the crypto financial institutions manage their books — carries enough counterparty risk and operational complexity by itself, one would think. The mining business is notoriously ruthless and complicated, which places new entrants at massive disadvantages even in the best market conditions. Managing a mining unit in addition to a core lending service is beyond doubly tough compared to running only one or the other business, since business complexity scales exponentially, not linearly. Although successfully running a joint lending/mining business is not impossible, it certainly is not for an inexperienced or risk averse founder.</p><p>In short, after a decade of institutionalized mining growth, there are good reasons why most mining companies are only mining companies — not hybrid businesses with other core offerings outside of mining. Sure, some miners play the role of lender in limited cases, as previously mentioned. But their core business is mining. Doing anything else is often too much to manage.</p><h2>Don’t Rinse And Repeat</h2><p>2022 was a brutal year for all of “crypto,” but especially for miners and lenders. Both high-profile companies that combined the two businesses ended in bankruptcy. Unfortunately, the “crypto” industry has a goldfish-like memory and is more likely to repeat rather than avoid these mistakes. But, hopefully, the future includes severe adjustments in accepted practices for lenders and also strong recovery from well-managed, bear-market-hardened mining companies. If not, the pain and suffering of the 2022 bear market was for nothing. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Zack Voell.

During the event, we announced the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-to-issue-bitcoin-bond-on-the-liquid-bitcoin-sidechain">Bitcoin Volcano Bonds</a>, while President Bukele made a significant announcement of his own: the creation of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-president-nayib-bukele-released-model-of-bitcoin-city">Bitcoin City</a>. By legally recognizing bitcoin as tender and establishing Bitcoin City, President Bukele took a bold step toward nationwide adoption. This decision has helped to accelerate the timeline for bitcoin becoming a recognized currency on a national level.</p><p>Following the announcements, I received numerous requests from Bitcoiners around the world asking for my assistance with implementing Bitcoin projects in their local communities or with their governments. This interest came from both individuals actively involved in the Bitcoin community as well as from investors. The enthusiasm was largely inspired by the developments happening in El Salvador and the impact they were having on the global Bitcoin landscape.</p><h2>Driving Nation-State Adoption Of Bitcoin</h2><p>I had been considering the idea of promoting the adoption of Bitcoin by nation states for some time. After careful thought, I decided to leave Blockstream in 2022, start my own company called JAN3 and dedicate myself to advancing the adoption of Bitcoin as a global currency, known as hyperbitcoinization, and its adoption by nation states. Now, many might ask, why help nation states, why accelerate hyperbitcoinization? </p><p>The traditional fiat currency system has greatly exacerbated the credit cycle, a wave-like pattern characterized by periods of prosperity and recession. Under a gold standard, credit is issued based on assets like gold deposits or real estate. In contrast, under a fiat standard, credit is issued by governments and is backed by debt, such as government bonds. During times of economic expansion, more loans are issued and businesses grow. However, at a certain point, there may be too much credit in circulation relative to the actual output or productivity of the economy, leading to a mismatch between the financial and real economies and resulting in the formation of bubbles or market corrections. These events have been occurring more frequently and with more extreme highs and lows.</p><p>The mechanisms that central bankers have traditionally used are becoming less effective, like a diabetic needing more and more insulin. If this trend continues, we can expect a severe economic depression in the future. Without clear price discovery, a dynamic economy and the technological and market forces to alleviate competitive pressure, nation states may devolve into conflict and war. When the pie is not expanding, it is easier to take from someone else. </p><p>Under a Bitcoin standard, nation states have more incentive to better utilize their resources, as there is a real cost. This encourages peaceful, diplomatic resolution as the default game theory equilibrium. Adopting a Bitcoin standard and accelerating hyperbitcoinization may be our best hope of avoiding civilizational collapse, and ensuring a free and prosperous future for humanity. Simply put, it may help to prevent conflicts and wars driven by economic competition.</p><p>I announced the formation of JAN3 at <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/global-legislators-announce-pro-bitcoin-legislation">Bitcoin 2022 in Miami</a>. JAN3 is of course named for January 3, 2009, which is the day that Bitcoin came into existence, also known as Genesis Day.</p><p>As our director of operations, a former Royal Marine named Doogie, told me, establishing a presence in El Salvador was important for gaining a foothold for Bitcoin and allowing it to take root. We made the decision to open an office there for this reason. </p><p>For the Bitcoin network to become more robust, it is essential for more countries to adopt a Bitcoin standard. Although Bitcoin does not need anyone's help, it can be accelerated and supported by having more countries, territories and cities adopt it. For example, if a country is mining Bitcoin, it is not attacking the network. If a country has made bitcoin legal tender, it is not likely going to attempt a ban on “unhosted wallets.” Overall, having more countries adopt a Bitcoin standard is positive for the network.</p><h2>Hashing Through 2022</h2><p>2022 was an interesting year for many reasons. </p><p>Madeira, Portugal’s president, Miguel Albuquerque, announced the creation of <a href="https://www.freemadeira.com/">F.R.E.E. Madeira</a>, which gives Bitcoin a foothold in the European Union. The autonomous nature of the Madeira region gives it the ability to make bitcoin a de facto legal tender.</p><p>Próspera, Honduras has become <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/pr%C3%B3spera-bitcoin-legal-tender-explained">one of the most active Bitcoin hubs in the world</a>. President Joel Bombar <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/global-legislators-announce-pro-bitcoin-legislation">announced that bitcoin is legal tender in Próspera during Bitcoin 2022</a>. Recently, a Bitcoin space was inaugurated there, and a legal framework has been put in place to enable the issuance of Bitcoin bonds.</p><p>On April 27, the government of the Central African Republic <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/central-african-republic-adopts-bitcoin-an-official-currency-2022-04-27/">announced that it would be adopting bitcoin as a legal tender</a>. This news was welcomed by Bitcoin enthusiasts, but the government also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/central-african-republic-launches-sango-coin-cryptocurrency-amid-industry-rout-2022-07-15/">announced a project called Sango</a>, which is based on an alternative cryptocurrency. It is clear that the adoption of Bitcoin in the country has not progressed as quickly as some had hoped, but we remain hopeful that the Central African Republic will continue to embrace and support the use of Bitcoin.</p><p>The crypto market experienced a bear market due to a variety of factors, including the collapse of the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">FTX exchange</a>, the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/terra-collapse-teaches-about-crypto-and-bitcoin">Luna/Terra crash</a> and the collapse of companies like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy">Celsius</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/fears-of-further-contagion-in-the-bitcoin-market">Three Arrows Capital</a>.</p><p>At the Panama Blockchain Conference in July, Towerbank, a leading Panamanian bank, announced <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/one-of-panamas-largest-banks-just-became-bitcoin-friendly">plans to offer crypto banking services</a> throughout Latin America and beyond and has enlisted our assistance in implementing the Liquid network. Liquid, a Bitcoin sidechain, allows for the expansion of Bitcoin's capabilities through the use of smart contracts, without introducing a native token. This relationship with Towerbank is a promising development in the world of crypto banking and could help to further establish Bitcoin as a powerful and versatile financial tool.</p><p>On October 28, at Lugano’s Plan B Forum, Senator Zury Ríos of Guatemala presented a video for the Bitcoin community in which she expressed an interest in potentially incorporating Bitcoin into her future political plans. She opened up a dialogue with the community and invited them to share their thoughts and ideas on the matter. El Salvador <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/28/el-salvador-lugano-sign-agreement-to-help-spread-bitcoin-adoption-and-education/">also announced</a> it was opening an office in Lugano, intending to exchange knowledge and benefit commercially. Through the incredible efforts of Bitfinex and Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino, Lugano is making great progress onboarding merchants to Bitcoin. They have already succeeded in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/28/tethers-paolo-ardoino-discusses-luganos-plan-b-bitcoin-progress/">getting thousands of merchants</a> to adopt the cryptocurrency, and they are continuing to bring on more.</p><p>At the Adopting Bitcoin conference in El Salvador in November, it was clear that the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/reality-of-bukeles-bitcoin-el-salvador">situation with gangs in El Salvador has greatly improved</a>. Public safety has significantly increased, with a notable decrease in homicides and other crimes. This improvement is a testament to the effective measures put in place to address the issue and bring peace and security to the people of El Salvador.</p><p><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/el-salvador-submits-bitcoin-bond-bill">The minister of the economy in El Salvador announced a new digital securities bill</a>, paving the way for the country to issue bitcoin-backed bonds. The legislation will establish the National Digital Assets Commission, which will be responsible for regulating digital asset issuers, service providers and other participants involved in the public offering process of digital securities.</p><p>There’s a lot more to go over, but unfortunately I can’t discuss it just yet. Change is coming and Bitcoin is going to be a major topic across the world.</p><h2>Visions For 2023</h2><p>2023 is shaping up to be a promising year for Bitcoin. In El Salvador, the digital securities laws that will form the foundation of the Bitcoin Volcano Bonds have been sent to Congress for approval. These bonds could be available on Bitfinex Securities very soon.</p><p>El Salvador’s star will truly continue to rise. El Salvador has already attracted a lot of interest for its embrace of Bitcoin, and many other countries are watching closely to see how things progress there. As El Salvador continues to lead the way in Bitcoin adoption, we expect it to continue to rise in prominence.</p><p>We expect to see more adoption of Bitcoin in the coming year, as it continues to gain traction despite the current lows. The world needs bitcoin, at any price. For those living in affluent countries, Bitcoin is optional, but for people living in the global south, it is a necessity. Take note, the gap between “affluent county” and “global south” is closing fast. </p><p>At JAN3, we have been receiving numerous requests from people in different countries for assistance with adopting Bitcoin. In addition to our work in El Salvador and the Madeira region, we are also focusing on countries like Costa Rica, Ecuador and more. Just last week, Sitiveni Rabuka, the prime minister of Fiji, stated that <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/fiji-prime-minister-bitcoin-legal-tender">he was considering making bitcoin legal tender</a>. </p><p>Despite the current bear market, we believe that there is no better time to build a strong foundation for the future of Bitcoin adoption. The work we do now will lay the foundation for a more free and prosperous economic future through the acceleration of hyperbitcoinization and nation-state adoption.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Samson Mow.

Previously, Binance <a href="https://www.binance.com/uk-UA/event/VARUSBinancePay">worked with grocery chain</a> VARUS to enable cryptocurrency payments at their stores.

Here are some themes I’m seeing for Bitcoin in 2023.</p><h2>Regulatory Overreach</h2><p>The Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Travel Rule is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-fatf-is-loading-the-gun">forcing exchanges and bitcoin service providers to document and share ever-more information about customer transactions</a>. We are seeing politicians such as Elizabeth Warren <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/elizabeth-warren-introduces-anti-bitcoin-bill">publicly go against Bitcoin</a>, and even if her proposed digital asset AML act has no real chance of passing, it does foreshadow that there are future battles coming on this. </p><p>But, on the other hand, we should also remember that governments were <a href="https://voipstudio.com/blog/why-are-governments-threatened-by-voip/">initially against voice over internet protocol (VoIP) technologies</a> (e.g., Skype, etc.), and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/skype-accused-of-helping-government-spy-on-people-2012-7">nowadays they <em>use </em>VoIP</a>. It’ll be similar with bitcoin, where some countries adopt it as legal tender, hold bitcoin in reserves, provide Bitcoin services for citizens and encourage bitcoin investors and entrepreneurs. </p><h2>CBDCs And The War On Cash</h2><p>The war on cash proceeds, with many countries taking <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/money/where-have-the-rs-2000-notes-gone-finance-ministry-clarifies/2911041/">high-denomination cash notes out of circulation</a>, or <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/nigeria-bans-atm-cash-withdrawals-over-225-a-week-to-force-use-of-cbdc">banning physical cash transactions above a threshold</a>. There are many countries talking about central bank digital currency (CBDC) trials, but my speculation is that most will not have the technical and overall economic capability to stand up a fully-functioning CBDC in 2023. </p><p>2023 will mostly be about trials and rhetoric, in preparation for future CBDC rollouts. Governments can especially force people into CBDCs in countries with large welfare states, with the understanding being, “If you want your welfare check, you’ll take it as a CBDC.” Just like Darth Vader in “Star Wars,” it’ll be a case of, “Pray I do not alter the deal any further.”</p><p>Once upon a time, CBDCs might have been seen as a “conspiracy theory” but by now they are clearly coming as a threat to financial freedom and privacy. Sadly, most people will not see the threat until it is too late and CBDCs are upon them — but it is also the pain of CBDCs that will push more people into using Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. </p><h2>Maxis Being Minted And Resurgence In Self-Custody Interest</h2><p><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/why-bitcoin-maximalism-is-critical">Bitcoin Maximalists</a> are being minted as casual “crypto” fans get rekt on platforms such as <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy">Celsius</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy">BlockFi</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">FTX</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/voyager-digital-files-for-bankruptcy">Voyager</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-26/crypto-lender-nexo-in-talks-on-terms-of-planned-vauld-purchase">Vauld</a>, etc. So, in some ways, it’s very cyclical, the 2014 to 2015 bear cycle followed after the collapse of Mt. Gox, and during the 2018 to 2019 bear cycle, we saw the breakdown of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/latest-report-on-quadrigacx-confirms-fears-of-mass-fraud">QuadrigaCX</a> — so we’re just going through another round of people having to learn the hard way. </p><p>For 2023, we will see a stronger self-custody culture given the pain of 2022 is more recent. This is not to preclude future cycles and waves of new adoption with people coming in who are not as careful. Yield and shitcoin scams will be back in another form sooner or later, but it will be a new round of people who succumb to them. </p><p>We are seeing more rounds of content and webinars that relate to self custody. For example, with Swan Bitcoin I hosted some <a href="https://swanbitcoin.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_hh2CClPTRQqjxeBAI2ogbg">self custody 101 webinars</a> (which will be ongoing), and these webinars had some of the highest interest and registrations of <em>any</em> Swan webinars ever offered. Offering an easy auto-withdrawal feature or being 100% non-custodial will be an important feature for Bitcoin on-ramps in 2023. </p><h2>Miniscript Wallets And Features</h2><p>Per <a href="https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/">Pieter Wuille’s site</a>: </p><p>“Miniscript is a language for writing (a subset of) Bitcoin Scripts in a structured way, enabling analysis, composition, generic signing and more.”</p><p>For those who are unfamiliar, Miniscript is a way to more easily express different scripts or spending conditions for bitcoin. This could be built into different wallets in ways that enable easier cross-hardware and -software compatibility. </p><p>You might first think, “Why should I care?” and, at the start, you’d be right to ask that. But over time, this will enable more sophisticated self custody, enterprise or even inheritance planning scenarios. Want to have a three-of-three multisig setup that degrades down to a two-of-three multisig setup after 90 days? Or have different “back out” conditions that exist for a business context? Miniscript makes it <em>easier</em> to do these things, and to let people use their existing software or hardware for this purpose. To be clear, some of this is already possible with Bitcoin script today, but Miniscript makes it more technically feasible or easier to achieve in practice. </p><p>It will take time for these solutions to be built out, but the functionality does seem promising. Businesses and enterprise customers may be particularly interested in this because it could make their self-custody practices more practical for employees and key holders to execute. </p><p>Currently, there is <a href="https://github.com/revault/liana">Liana</a> (by the same team behind Revault), and <a href="https://blog.ledger.com/miniscript-is-coming/">Ledger</a>, which has announced Miniscript support in its hardware, and <a href="https://twitter.com/StepanSnigirev/status/1375113463421399043">Specter DIY had already enabled support in 2021</a>! Rob Hamilton has also spoken about Miniscript uses in the world of insurance <a href="https://twitter.com/Rob1Ham/status/1603124029212196865">here</a>. I anticipate more support coming in 2023. </p><p>This could help push the use of bitcoin into self-custodial directions, and away from the “old model” of financial services where you have to place more trust in government, banks and fiat financial institutions to honor their word or not debase your wealth. </p><h2>Lightning First</h2><p>It’s time to bring about a Lightning-first model for two types of bitcoin transactions: low-value transactions and in-person commerce. We saw the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/rbf-debate-is-incentives-and-choice">mempoolfullRBF debate</a> blow up toward the end of 2022, but the real answer for most of us is to promote and use Lightning first, where possible. </p><p>As a quick anecdote, I recall talking with Giacomo Zucco who was explaining his experience in El Salvador of paying with bitcoin at a supermarket. Unfortunately, the Chivo terminal at that time defaulted to Bitcoin on-chain, and as he paid on-chain, the people in the line behind him had to wait for confirmation, which was very awkward. Contrast this with a Lightning-first experience which could look more like this:</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/coinbeastmedia/status/1607045177499324418"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>We should show people the best of Bitcoin and for in-person, lower-value commerce, we should go for Lightning first. I believe we’ll start to see this being driven and encouraged by more Bitcoiners and local communities in 2023. </p><h2>Expansion Of Bitcoin-Only Communities And Events</h2><p>We will see more events and small-sized conferences in different countries around the world. Contrary to some who believe there are too many Bitcoin conferences, the issue is more one of assuming that you must attend them all! </p><p>You should instead attend the events and conferences that align with your interests and/or geography. Having more conferences is a good thing, so long as they are done in a low-cost, effective way. For example, the <a href="https://stephanlivera.com/episode/440/">Bitcoin bush bash</a> is a model that we may see replicated around the world — free to attend, held in a hall or other free/cheap area, no recordings, smaller-size gathering that is hosted somewhere that is cost effective. </p><p>By lowering the expectations about things that typically cost a lot more money (e.g., fancy, professionalized operations, live streaming, lots of international speakers), Bitcoiners can grow their local scenes and meetups. This is not to detract from the larger Bitcoin events and conferences, as they also play a key role — but I see a “middle ground” that can be taken up by low cost, local events. </p><h2>Overall Sentiment</h2><p>Without having a crystal ball for 2023, I believe bitcoin’s fiat price will remain in a mostly sideways trend. Forget what the bull-hopium people are posting and talking about, they are usually chasing engagement or getting too caught up in their own echo chambers. It takes time for the cycle to bottom out. </p><p>But let’s look on the bright side, it’s a great time for stacking sats and building something.

He spent four years in the infantry before transitioning to the Finance Corps.</em></p><blockquote><p>“First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win”&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/first-they-ignore-you/">Attributed to Mahatma Ghandi</a></p></blockquote><p>At the time of this writing, the U.S. Senate had just introduced the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/sen-warren-unconstitutional-crypto-bill">Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2022</a>. The bill contains many threatening aspects, such as KYC laws for self-custody wallets and money-transmitter licensing requirements. </p><p>This bill also comes on the heels of the European Central Bank’s (ECB) recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/30/ecb-says-bitcoin-is-on-road-to-irrelevance-amid-crypto-collapse">revelation</a> that Bitcoin is on an “artificially induced last gasp before the road to irrelevance.” About a week later, an official from the bank announced it was considering a <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/ecb-considers-bitcoin-ban-to-curb-environmental-damage/ar-AA154ilO">Bitcoin and crypto ban</a> in order to mitigate environmental damage. </p><p><a href="https://www.powermag.com/energy-crisis-deepens-as-nuclear-reactors-remain-offline-in-france/">But as the energy crisis in Europe deepens</a>, don’t you think European regulators have bigger fish to fry, like <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/energy-crisis-fuels-coal-comeback-114311573.html">Germany’s rising use of coal power</a>?

Stay vigilant this year. While a ban and much of the regulations would be comically impossible to actually enforce, they would serve as a significant speed bump to widespread adoption. I would keep an ear to the ground (and probably to Bitcoin Twitter) to stay abreast of situations that could be influenced by a sea of calls to your governmentally-elected representatives, just like what happened with the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-infrastructure-bill-engage">infrastructure bill in 2021</a>.</p><h2>The Debt Spiral… Spirals</h2><p>Luckily, I think more and more people will begin to wake up from the matrix and realize just how bad the situation really is. The fact is, it’s getting pretty hard to obscure at this point.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The above chart is essentially my new favorite picture. When people ask me about Bitcoin lately, all I do is show them this graph and they pretty quickly understand the magnitude of money creation during the 2020 COVID-19 era. What they don’t quite understand, just yet, is that it is going to continue, and probably at increasing rates and intervals. </p><p><br>The U.S. federal government is already <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/biden-pace-1-trillion-budget-deficit-2023-2-7-billion-new-debt-day">projected</a> to run a $1 trillion deficit in 2023 (that’s 12 zeroes, folks). Even if the U.S. government shut down the entire military and eliminated the Department of Defense’s <a href="https://veteran.com/2023-defense-budget/">projected $800 billion budget</a>, the budget would still be projected to be operating in the red for 2023. The real kicker in this is that the deficit is likely to be much higher, meaning that more debt will have to be issued, and that would be in a period of increasing interest rates due to Federal Reserve tightening.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The <a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2022/12/12/unhappy-new-year-cbo-forecasts-poor-economy-soaring-deficits-in-2023/">Congressional Budget Office</a> is projecting that negative growth in GDP is about as likely as lower-than-expected positive growth. Couple that with an expected increase in unemployment, and you get yourself a fiscal double whammy. First, unemployment and negative GDP growth imply less tax receipts to the federal government, meaning a potentially bigger deficit, i.e., more debt. You add in the fact that the debt is being issued at a significantly higher rate, and you’ve got yourself the ingredients for an accelerating <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/debt-spiral-leads-to-bitcoin-adoption">debt spiral</a>. </p><p>Even if everything goes completely to plan, a trillion-dollar deficit is certainly nothing to celebrate. I think the numbers speak for themselves. People I work with and am friends with are really starting to notice and get worried; people who have never previously given a lick of interest to economics before.</p><p>And when all of the proverbial stuff hits the spinning thing, you can bet that the Fed steps right in with more money printing. Adding a trillion or so dollars to the debt at <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/traders-trim-bets-fed-rate-hike-slowdown-after-jobs-report-2022-12-02/">5% interest</a>? I don’t think it’s gonna happen. I’m betting interest rates won’t be much higher for much longer. Quantitative easing three is dead. Long live quantitative easing infinity.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Coincidentally, as I write this article, I received the above article in an email from the <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/thebitcoinlayer/p/merry-christmas-rate-hikes-are-over?r=5b4lf&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_campaign=post">Bitcoin Layer</a>. Looks like they agree with me. Rate hikes can’t hike much more than they’ve already hiked. They’re basically off of the trail. </p><h2>Bitcoin Reignites The Pioneer Spirit</h2><p>Once upon a time, in a place called America, people used to take responsibility for their actions, traveling off to seek adventure and opportunity in the West. The <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-infrastructure-bill-engage">Oklahoma Sooners</a>’ namesake hails from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Rush_of_1889">Oklahoma Land Rush of 1889</a>, where nearly 50,000 Americans lined up on the edge of the “Unassigned Lands” to race to claim their stakes in the undeveloped wildlands that became Oklahoma. </p><p>Much like homesteading in the 19th century, Bitcoin is both a team sport and a race. It’s a race in the sense that if you do not take responsibility to claim your stake in cyberspace before someone else, you may have missed an opportunity of a lifetime. It’s a team sport in the sense that successfully adopting Bitcoin into your life will likely require a degree of help from others. </p><p>How many BTC Sessions videos did you watch before setting up your first hardware wallet? How long after that did you actually send any UTXOs to your self-custody address? How long did it take before you even knew what a UTXO is?</p><p>Bitcoin is the new frontier, the digitalization of the Unassigned Lands in the old American West. The journey is fraught with dangers and pitfalls, but the payoff is an opportunity that we will likely never see again during our lifetimes. Everyone gets bitcoin at the price that they deserve, yes, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help them accelerate the learning process. </p><p>Let’s make 2023 the year we drained the exchanges; auditing them for paper bitcoin through sheer blunt force trauma. I challenge you to try and embody the homesteading pioneer spirit to help make this happen; to help your friends and family understand this phenomenon and opportunity. To help them take self custody and preserve their wealth in a self-sovereign way. Help lead the horse to water, so to speak. You can’t save everybody, but you can at least try to help them see what’s coming, and stake their claim in the new Wild West in cyberspace. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Mickey Koss.

This was caused by the United States setting up the American Colonial Bank and declaring the U.S. dollar as legal tender (the official money) of Puerto Rico, changing it from the peso.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>However, in <a href="https://waragainstallpuertoricans.com/historical-overview/">1899, one peso was only worth 60 cents</a>, meaning the local businesses of Puerto Rico and its citizens <a href="https://waragainstallpuertoricans.com/historical-overview/">lost 40% of their net worths overnight</a> from causes totally outside of their control. This resulted in Puerto Ricans, attempting to save their net worths, <a href="http://colonial">borrowing money from the American Colonial Bank</a>. However, high interest rates made it very unlikely that locals were going to be able to pay back their loans, causing many Puerto Ricans to default on their debt. The result was that the bank seized their assets (in these days, typically their land).</p><section><figure>

    </figure><p>Puerto Rico uses the U.S. dollar as its legal tender and is vulnerable to the consequences of reckless monetary policy, including the expansion of this money supply (inflation), and has already experienced major currency devaluation (as noted above). Looking at the 2020 section of the chart above, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States central bank<a href="https://www.cityam.com/almost-a-fifth-of-all-us-dollars-were-created-this-year/"> printed about 20% of the total dollars circulating in the economy</a>, flooding the market with dollars. Money printing has devastating consequences on local economies, especially for lower- and middle-income families. Money printing results in a wider wealth gap with goods and services becoming more expensive. Home prices and food prices in Puerto Rico are rapidly increasing.</p><figure>

Incredibly well educated, Campos graduated from a top-tier school in the United States and could speak six languages. He was that guy, he led by example, showed up every day to lead, instilled values, dreamed big and provided inclusiveness regardless of class or status. He was a true man of the people, who understood the power within others, recognizing that they don’t need to be dependent on anyone else. </p><p>During his time, his focus in particular was Puerto Rico’s freedom and independence.

You don’t need permission to open a savings account.</li><li><strong>Unconfiscatable: </strong>With Bitcoin, your wealth is protected for generations to come. This is made possible by encrypted keys (passwords) that only you may know. It cannot be frozen, seized or stolen from you. If you die without a contingency plan, your bitcoin will die with you and can’t ever be spent.</li><li><strong>Transparent:</strong> Bitcoin’s transaction ledger is available to anyone at any time. Issuance of the currency is known and cannot be changed. Bitcoin’s network audits the ledger every 10 minutes to ensure all participants are operating within the rules of the network.</li><li><strong>Absolute Scarcity:</strong> Bitcoin has absolute scarcity. Only 21 million bitcoin will ever exist. Bitcoin can’t be replicated, duplicated, counterfeited or double spent. Bitcoin is the perfect unit of account.</li><li><strong>Growth In The Future: </strong>Bitcoin allows Puerto Ricans to become individually sovereign. Bitcoin separates money from the power of the State, just as critically as the separation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state">church from the government was in the 18th century</a>, which led to the great enlightenment. We can’t rely on systems of trust in individuals, institutions or governments to have control over our financial destiny. Bitcoin is trustless — verify everything.</li></ul><h2>Love For Puerto Rico</h2><p>My inspiration to write this piece came from not only being a bitcoiner but from being a local of Puerto Rico. I love the people, the communities and the values that are instilled in this island.</p><p>Puerto Rico offers an <a href="https://www.ddec.pr.gov/en/puerto-rico-incentives-code">Act 60 decree</a> for business and individuals who can move form the United States to the island and establish businesses there, which enables them not to pay any capital gains taxes and only a 4% income tax as long as they spend 51% of their time in Puerto Rico. </p><p>Now, to be clear, Act 60 provides tremendous value to Puerto Rico and should be embraced. However, on the contrary, Act 60 also provides an open invitation to bad actors and scammers who can walk away from their scams in the form of failed projects/businesses without tax implications. During the 2021 crypto bull market, I saw personally that Puerto Rico became a cesspool of individuals who launched cryptocurrency projects and marketed their questionable financial innovations to everyday investors, only to walk away from the projects with large sums of investors’ money, burning those who invested with funds earned from working real jobs that provided real benefits to the world. There are countless examples of this, which provide context and makes it understandable as to why many locals may have resentment toward cryptocurrency.</p><p>Bitcoin is not crypto, Bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme, Bitcoin is not an individual nor company, Bitcoin is not an Act 60 beneficiary, Bitcoin is not colonialism, Bitcoin is not instilled by the government. Bitcoin is money, Bitcoin is freedom, Bitcoin is independence, Bitcoin allows every Puerto Rican to have the individual prosperity that many locals have defended and died for. </p><p>Bitcoin is Puerto Rico’s chance to have an independent identity while allowing its citizens to be 100% self sovereign. Adapting a bitcoin standard would provide tremendous benefit for places like Puerto Rico. Learn what bitcoin is, educate others, become individually sovereign and start building the Puerto Rico your ancestors envisioned.</p><figure>

"However, in light of recent events involving Grayscale and its family of affiliated companies, it is time for a change. Valkyrie is the best company to manage GBTC to ensure its investors are treated fairly."</p><p>McClurg told Bitcoin Magazine that the proposal would be for current GBTC shareholders to vote on <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proxy-vote.asp">via proxy</a>. If chosen by the shareholders, Valkyrie would become the sponsor.</p><p>The process isn’t as straightforward as it seems, however. As highlighted on a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-30/valkyrie-unveils-proposal-for-grayscale-s-troubled-bitcoin-trust-gbtc">Bloomberg</a> report, "Grayscale <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001588489/000119312522053501/d289251d10k.htm">filings</a> state that shareholders take no part in the management or control of the trust, and have limited voting rights. In addition, no amendments to the trust agreement that could materially affect the interests of shareholders can be made with a vote of at least a majority — meaning 50% — of the shares."</p><p>McClurg explained to Bitcoin Magazine that Valkyrie is aware of those issues, and has planned ahead. He declined to comment on any specifics of what that plan might entail, but hinted that this wouldn’t be their first time achieving such a goal. When it comes to the plans for after an eventual takeover, McClurg has it laid out. </p><p>The first action Valkyrie would take in the event that it becomes GBTC’s sponsor and manager would be to "immediately file for Reg M exemption," the executive explained. Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein told <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/grayscale-ceo-bitcoin-etf-now-165836645.html">Yahoo Finance</a> earlier this month that the trust not allowing redemptions is a result of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shutdown in 2014, who found GBTC redemptions to be in violation of Reg M. According to <a href="https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulation-m-filings">FINRA</a>, the SEC’s Regulation M "is designed to prevent manipulation by individuals with an interest in the outcome of an offering, and prohibits activities and conduct that could artificially influence the market for an offered security."</p><p>"If approved by the SEC, [the exemption] would allow us to redeem shares at par value for shareholders who want to redeem," McClurg told Bitcoin Magazine. </p><p>The move would allegedly help alleviate what might currently be GBTC’s most pressing issue: a whopping 47% discount of its shares compared to the value of the underlying assets held.</p><p>"Redemptions typically cause a discount to narrow due to ability of market makers to arbitrage," Valkyrie’s executive added.</p><p>McClurg said the firm would also reduce the management fee to 75 basis points, down from the 200 basis points currently levied by Grayscale.</p><p>It isn’t clear whether Grayscale has sought Reg M exemption yet, and McClurg told Bitcoin Magazine that "nothing is stopping Grayscale from doing this themselves." GBTC’s current manager is seeking a conversion of the trust into a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund –– something it claims would eliminate the discount given the ability of an ETF to create and redeem shares on demand. It has gone as far as to sue the SEC under the basis that the regulator allowed the listing of futures-based products and doesn't have the grounds to deny similar spot offerings. This could seemingly help explain the firm’s reluctance to apply for Reg M exemption, as an eventual exemption from the SEC could reduce the discount to near zero and kill its leverage for the ETF move. It isn’t clear whether that is the case, however. Valkyrie would still pursue the conversion if turned GBTC's manager.</p><p>"We would still attempt a conversion, but would work with regulators for an orderly conversion on their time," McClurg said.</p><p><em>Find more details of Valkyrie's proposal <a href="https://valkyrieinvest.com/press/opportunities-around-gbtc/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</em></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5MDM2OTg5NDkwNjY5MDEy/20220424_btcfinal_decentralized-law-vs-centralized-legislation---jimmy-song.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why A Bitcoin Ban In The EU Is Likely… And Stupid]]></title><description><![CDATA[Despite holding off to date, a Bitcoin ban by the EU could be on the horizon.

But Bitcoin doesn’t ask for permission.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion article by Guglielmo Cecero, the legal manager of European bitcoin investment app Relai, and Raphael Schoen, the content lead at Relai.</em></p><p>Bitcoin is under attack. It is increasingly seen as a “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1aecb2db-8f61-427c-a413-3b929291c8ac">dirty currency</a>.” Elon Musk’s <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/elon-musk-tesla-to-resume-bitcoin-payments">Tesla</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/05/02/wikipedia-wikimedia-foundation-no-crypto-donations-environment-climate-bitcoin-ethereum/">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/05/21/greenpeace-bitcoin-carbon-footprint/">Greenpeace</a> and other organizations have stopped accepting BTC for their products or as a means to donate money. </p><p>Musk, who is not only one of the richest but also one of the most controversial people on this planet, <a href="https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musks-surprise-statement-crypto-001738245.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CCryptocurrency%20is%20a%20good%20idea,transitions%20to%20more%20sustainable%20energy.%E2%80%9D">has said</a>: “Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels, and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the environment.” Ouch.</p><p>And it’s not just Musk. Politicians have also taken aim at Bitcoin.</p><p>Before the European Commission’s <a href="https://www.klgates.com/MiCA-Overview-of-the-new-EU-crypto-asset-regulatory-framework-Part-1-11-15-2022">Markets in Crypto-Asset Regulation</a> (MiCA) regulation was passed, it caused quite a stir within the Bitcoin community, especially due to the left-wing factions of the EU Parliament that were opposed to proof of work (PoW) and the power consumption of the Bitcoin network. In the trilogue, a version of MiCA was finally passed that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-14/eu-crypto-proposal-seen-as-de-facto-bitcoin-ban-fails-in-vote">did not ban PoW or mining</a>. </p><p>As became known in April 2022, some members of the European Parliament (MEPs) tried to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/eu-officials-considered-bitcoin-trading-ban-to-enforce-proposed-mining-ban?_ga=2.28113724.1436037453.1666349186-1472835858.1607893106">push through a ban on bitcoin mining and one on BTC trading</a> in the course of the draft law. Luckily, they failed.</p><p>However, the foundations for further steps have been laid. For example, the issuers of cryptocurrencies, which we know are mostly simply tech startups, will be obliged to deliver some kind of report on the energy consumption and the associated carbon footprint of the respective asset. Brokers and exchanges, in turn, must inform their customers about these exact figures when they purchase crypto assets.</p><p>The increasing aversion to Bitcoin also gained traction through an <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/greenpeace-environment-attacks-help-bitcoin">anti-Bitcoin Greenpeace USA campaign</a> launched in March, which was financed by Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, among others. Interestingly, Greenpeace accepted bitcoin donations <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/05/21/greenpeace-bitcoin-carbon-footprint/">between 2014 and 2021</a> until they were put on hold due to environmental concerns.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/greenpeaceusa/status/1582014850548785153"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><h2>Nearly Half Of The EU Parliament Doesn’t Like Bitcoin</h2><p>As mentioned, a mining or trading ban for Bitcoin didn’t make it into the MiCA legislation. However, it is very unlikely that members of the EU parliament who tried to implement this in MiCA will give up — we can assume the contrary.</p><p>In March 2022, the economic and monetary affairs (ECON) committee in the EU parliament <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/european-parliament-votes-against-pow-ban-providing-huge-relief-to-the-crypto-industry">voted against a ban on PoW</a>. Thirty-two members voted against it, 24 in favor. The topic seems to become more and more ideologically driven, as the Social Democrats, the Greens, and the left mostly wanted a PoW ban, whereas the Conservatives, the Liberals and right-wing factions tended to vote against it.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/paddi_hansen/status/1503430753656389633"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>The final MiCA draft created by conservative MEP Stefan Berger <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbrett/2022/07/12/how-this-member-of-parliament-rescued-bitcoin-amid-new-regulatory-reforms-in-europe/?sh=1d6d8d6a12ed">included a compromise</a>: Instead of a ban on PoW, they agreed on including a rating system for cryptocurrency to assess their environmental impacts (more on that later).</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/bitcoin-in-crosshairs-as-eu-goes-after-non-green-crypto/">email conversation with Politico</a>, the Spanish Green EU parliament member Ernest Urtasun explained:</p><p>“Creating an EU labeling system for crypto will not solve the problem as long as crypto-mining can continue outside the Union, also driven by EU demand… The Commission should rather focus on developing minimum sustainability standards with a clear timeline to comply.”</p><p>And he added:</p><p>“Ethereum’s recent upgrade just showed that phasing out from environmentally harmful protocols is actually feasible, without causing any disruption to the network.”</p><h2>The ECB Doesn’t Like Bitcoin — At All</h2><p>While we see different opinions on Bitcoin in the European Parliament, the signals we’re getting from the European Central Bank (ECB) are very clear. The ECB is issuing warnings about cryptocurrencies on a regular basis, naming their <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/fsr/html/ecb.fsr202105~757f727fe4.en.html">“exorbitant carbon footprint” as “grounds for concern”</a>.</p><p>Just recently, on November 30, 2022, the ECB published a blog post titled “<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2022/html/ecb.blog221130~5301eecd19.en.html#:~:text=Amid%20the%20widespread%20fallout%20in,17%2C000%20by%20mid%2DJune%202022.">Bitcoin’s Last Stand</a>.” In it, ECB’s Market Infrastructure And Payments Director General Ulrich Bindseil and advisor Jürgen Schaff argue that, “Bitcoin's conceptual design and technological shortcomings make it questionable as a means of payment.” </p><p>According to Bindseil and Schaff, Bitcoin transactions are “cumbersome, slow and expensive,” which they say explains why the world’s largest cryptocurrency — created to overcome the existing monetary and financial system — "has never been used to any significant extent for legal real-world transactions.” Bindseil and Schaff added that since Bitcoin is neither an effective payment system nor a form of investment, “it should be treated as neither in regulatory terms and thus should not be legitimized.”</p><p>While it may seem paradoxical to very vocally attack something that is on the “road to irrelevance,” it is not the first time that the ECB has attacked Bitcoin.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1583459590653419521"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>In July 2022, the ECB singled out Bitcoin in a <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/macroprudential-bulletin/html/ecb.mpbu202207_3~d9614ea8e6.en.html">research article</a> and compared proof of work to fossil fuel cars while considering proof of stake as more akin to electric vehicles. Let’s ignore for a minute that this doesn’t make sense and look at what it wrote in detail:</p><blockquote><p>“Public authorities should not stifle innovation, as it is a driver of economic growth. Although the benefit for society of bitcoin itself is doubtful, blockchain technology in principle may provide yet unknown benefits and technological applications. Hence, authorities could choose not to intervene with a view to supporting digital innovation. At the same time, it is difficult to see how authorities could opt to ban petrol cars over a transition period but turn a blind eye to bitcoin-type assets built on PoW technology, with country-sized energy consumption footprints and yearly carbon emissions that currently negate most euro area countries’ past and target GHG saving. This holds especially given that an alternative, less energy-intensive blockchain technology exists.”</p></blockquote><p>In general, the ECB believes it’s highly unlikely that the European Union will <em>not</em> take action in terms of carbon emissions on PoW-based assets like bitcoin. The authors of the paper argue that in their view it’s likely that the EU will take similar steps on phasing out PoW as they are doing with fossil fuel cars. Especially since, according to them, an “alternative, less energy-intensive” technology like PoS exists.</p><blockquote><p>“To continue with the car analogy, public authorities have the choice of incentivising the crypto version of the electric vehicle (PoS and its various blockchain consensus mechanisms) or to restrict or ban the crypto version of the fossil fuel car (PoW blockchain consensus mechanisms). So, while a hands-off approach by public authorities is possible, it is highly unlikely, and policy action by authorities (e.g. disclosure requirements, carbon tax on crypto transactions or holdings, or outright bans on mining) is probable. The price impact on the crypto-assets targeted by policy action is likely to be commensurate with the severity of the policy action and whether it is a global or regional measure.”</p></blockquote><p>The vast majority of citizens are used to thinking of money as something other than what it really is, and the ECB is also to blame for this. Money is perceived as something that has value by itself, instead of something whose value comes from the interaction between the people who use it.</p><p>The euro is subject to both constant changes (regular inflation) and traumatic events (devaluations, forced exchange rates, etc.), but these are ignored or otherwise underestimated. People believe they own it, although they can only exchange it for other things.</p><p>For how many and for what things will 100 euros be exchanged in one year, five years or ten years? This is, in no way, up to us.</p><p>Its exchange function is constantly changing due to factors we cannot control. The interaction between those who use it is the main factor and, in turn, this interaction depends on economic and monetary policy rules that few people know about.</p><p>Bitcoin escapes these rules (and this is the reason why the ECB wants to ban it), it is just code that the ECB and the regulators are trying to make useless. Bitcoin also and above all expresses its value through features that are totally independent of a government’s power and, therefore, the ECBs.</p><h2>What Will Happen Next?</h2><p><br>In 2025, we will see a rating system for cryptocurrencies according to their environmental impact within the European Union — think energy labels for fridges or TVs. You can already expect that bitcoin will get the worst classification. <a href="https://www.business2community.com/crypto-news/eus-crypto-energy-labelling-good-for-ethereum-bad-for-bitcoin-02562875">This step will essentially be positive for Ethereum and bad for Bitcoin</a>.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>It’s quite unlikely that such a label will scare off investors from buying bitcoin, especially since the Bitcoin community is saying that the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-a-green-energy-battery">Bitcoin network is not an obstacle but a solution for more green energy</a>.</p><p>Therefore, the Bitcoin mining industry has the incentive to become greener: The fossil fuel analogy in the ECB paper makes no sense. The energy mix of a PoW network like Bitcoin can come entirely from renewable, green sources. Bitcoin can serve as a way to immediately monetize energy, as is <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/03/30/exxon-bitcoin-mining-gas-flares-crypto-electricity/">already happening with flared gas</a> that would be flared anyway. However, it’s questionable how fast and effective this effort will be to policymakers, especially since fossil energy companies like Exxon are now mining Bitcoin using flared gas.</p><p>The authors of the ECB paper are already implying that a higher bitcoin price equals more energy consumption, as more miners will participate. Destroying demand for bitcoin would hence be an effective solution to bring down the hash rate. At least in theory.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The academic and political consensus seems to point toward something like trying to retire the “old” PoW, and moving towards the “new” PoS standard. Particularly since Ethereum’s recent merge, many bystanders believe this could be a viable path for the Bitcoin network. We doubt that and plan to elaborate on that in a future post. As we’ve seen in different scenarios, banning Bitcoin is hard, if not impossible. The Nigerian government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/31/out-of-control-and-rising-why-bitcoin-has-nigerias-government-in-a-panic">tried, failed and eventually gave up</a>, for instance.</p><p>It will be quite a while until 2025, and with an energy crisis, increased focus on carbon emission as well as global uncertainty overall, the only thing we can do at this point is to expect the unexpected.</p><p>Even if the worst-case scenario happens, and we see a Bitcoin ban of some sort happen in the EU, we doubt that this will hold forever. Bitcoin does not ask for permission. Bitcoin is something that ontologically struggles to stay inside a fence. It is not an idea derived from anarchist positions, it is an argument derived from the inherent characteristics of the technology introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto. The regulators work in an authorizing logic and so it is clear that they struggle to intercept the Bitcoin phenomenon, which functions regardless of someone else’s permission.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Guglielmo Cecero and Raphael Schoen.

But other factors will continue to incentivize miners.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Dillon Healy, a member of the institutional partnerships team at Bitcoin Magazine and The Bitcoin Conference.</em></p><p>A topic that has <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanberckmans/status/1597320944846254080?s=21&amp;t=XbrTMWx_blK5GzLVnuXaxQ">received increased attention</a> lately is the concern around Bitcoin’s future “security budget.”</p><p>This mainly stems from the worry that miner revenue will not be enough to offer adequate security in the future, post <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/b/block-subsidy/">block subsidy</a>. Bitcoin miners play a crucial part in securing the network by proposing blocks of transactions which nodes then verify, accept and update to the Bitcoin ledger. Competing against other miners to propose this new block to the chain, miners use intense computing power to complete the proof-of-work consensus algorithm, and win the right to propose the new block.</p><p>For this service, the winning miner receives a block reward, which is made of two components: the block subsidy and the transaction fees. The block subsidy is the amount of new bitcoin minted in each block (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/bitcoin-halving-how-does-the-halving-cycle-work-and-why-does-it-matter">currently 6.25 bitcoin</a>), this subsidy of new bitcoin released from the total supply of 21 million is <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-halving-4843769">cut in half about every four years with the halving</a>. The block subsidy<a href="https://www.theblock.co/linked/113186/bitcoin-miners-earned-971-million-in-revenue-during-july"> currently makes up the vast majority of total miner revenue</a>. </p><p>Simplified, the concern is that the transaction fee portion of the miner rewards will not be raised enough to make up for the loss of the block subsidy, resulting in decreased security for the Bitcoin network and an increased likelihood in attacks as miners are no longer incentivized to participate. My view, though, is that most who are worried about this are misunderstanding Bitcoin’s long-term game theory, incentive mechanisms, scalability and adoption potential.</p><p>With that being said, this is a topic that should probably be discussed more publicly and not shrugged off as a non-issue. There are <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/it-time-begin-talking-seriously-about-bitcoin-tail-emissions.htm">people advocating for tail emissions to be added</a>, creating an increase to Bitcoin’s 21 million supply as a solution to the security budget (settlement finality) issue, which is concerning. </p><p>I believe the solution (if you can call it that) is already baked into the Bitcoin incentive structure and adoption curve. There are two parts: one, transaction fees scaling with Bitcoin adoption and as a security measure and two, Bitcoin mining transitioning to an auxiliary tool. </p><h2>Transaction Fee Scaling</h2><p>When this issue is raised, it usually comes from somebody with a misunderstanding of how or why transaction fees will increase or advocating for proof of stake (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryanberckmans/status/1597320944846254080?s=21&amp;t=XbrTMWx_blK5GzLVnuXaxQ">here’s an example</a>). Ironically, one of the reasons for increased transaction fees could be a natural defensive reaction to an attack from a bad actor mining empty blocks to prevent users from transacting. If empty blocks are being mined, the mempool will fill with Bitcoin transactors that are raising fees, competing with each other to get in the next block. Riot Blockchain and Blockware Solutions released an <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5de588aa3e9c044c1ad8cb59/t/6329b32325b7205aea8e14f8/1663677220899/Bitcoin+Transaction+Fees+Final+Draft.pdf">incredible report</a> outlining how this and similar attacks would be met with naturally-occuring defense mechanisms from the Bitcoin immune system, most resulting in much higher transaction fees:</p><blockquote><p>“Under an empty block attack or other attacks attempting to stop users from transacting, it is in the self-interest of Bitcoin users to raise their transactions' fees to get into the next block. The more empty blocks (the longer the attack lasts), the more pending transactions in the mempool. Transaction fees could soar from 1 sat/vbyte to 1,000+ sats/vbyte. The reward for one block could go from close to 0 BTC to 10+ BTC assuming the current maximum block size of 1,000,000 vbytes. The system is antifragile, and an empty block attack would be met by an endless market based counterattack of high transaction fees. And knowledge of this counterattack would likely deter the attacker from this attack in the first place.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Another example of fees raising as a result of the network defending itself would be a reaction to miners attempting to censor merchants. This example is covered more in depth in <a href="https://sgbarbour.medium.com/the-state-vs-bitcoin-dbc044f23ea6">this article</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“If a majority miner is not accepting transactions from merchants then the censored merchants must either increase their fees or not transact at all. If a merchant cannot move their bitcoins then they effectively have no value for the duration in which they are being censored. We can deduce that, due to personal time preference, a merchant who is being censored will be willing to pay a higher confirmation fee proportional to the duration in which they are being censored, up to the theoretical maximum in which the fee is the entirety of the transaction.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>In addition to naturally-occuring defensive incentives that would result in increased transaction fees, there are also countless arguments for transaction fees increasing as a result of Bitcoin adoption, specifically as a medium of exchange. </p><p>As adoption increases, competition to add transactions to Bitcoin’s scarce block space will increase, and this increases current fees, which then creates further demand for scaling solutions. The market will continue to present these scaling solutions as demanded — some popular solutions now include exchanges batching transactions, the Lightning Network and other Layer 2 and Layer 3 developments that can ultimately bundle thousands of Bitcoin transfers into one transaction that settles on-chain. </p><p>When you understand Bitcoin’s adoption curve, it is completely reasonable to assume that the majority of normal user transactions will occur on additional layers or sidechains. Final settlement of these more efficiently-bundled transfers will occur on-chain, along with transactions that want increased security or institutions moving large values. The final settlement would warrant a much higher transaction fee.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Bitcoin Mining As An Auxiliary Tool</h2><p>The second route that should lower concern around miners dropping offline and reducing the overall security of the network is increased efficiency and a newer realization that Bitcoin miners can act as an auxiliary tool for other business practices. A highly-overlooked development in the mainstream lately has been the Bitcoin miners’ incentive to pursue <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/how-bitcoin-shakes-the-energy-industry">stranded, wasted or excess energy</a>. </p><p>Bitcoin mining offers a unique and new proposal for society, where untapped or un-transportable energy can now be instantly sold to the Bitcoin network on-site via mining. One of the most interesting innovations in this sector is <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/hydropower/ocean-thermal-energy-conversion.php">ocean thermal energy conversion</a> (OTEC) merging with Bitcoin. </p><p>There is an incredibly in depth article on how OTEC and Bitcoin can further energy production and efficiency <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-unlocks-ocean-energy">here</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Bitcoin has the potential to help <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse6010012">unlock between 2 to 8 terawatts</a> of clean, continuous and year-round baseload power — for one billion people — by harnessing the thermal energy of the oceans. that turns Earth’s oceans into an enormous renewable solar battery.</p><p>“It does this by combining warm tropical surface water and deep cold seawater to create a conventional heat engine. This simple idea is perfectly suited to be expanded to a planetary scale by Bitcoin’s unique appetite for purchasing and consuming stranded energy from the prototypes and pilot plants that will be required to prove it works. Furthermore, by harnessing virtually unlimited quantities of cold water for cooling co-located ASIC miners, OTEC may very well be the most efficient and most ecological way to mine Bitcoin.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>This is just one example of how mining can become even more efficient over time, and with increased efficiency comes continued network security as it makes less sense for miners to go offline.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Bitcoin mining is also now becoming an auxiliary tool for other industrial processes. Bitcoin miners can pair with different industries and businesses and offer enormous benefits to seemingly-normal business practices. One mind-blowing example: ASICs used to mine Bitcoin generate heat, this heat can be used to boil water and create steam, condensing the water again is a form of purification, and ultimately this can result in water distillation that was subsidized by mining, as was discussed in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vROP40L9Bg">Troy Cross interview</a>.</p><p>These ASICs that generate heat also need to be cooled with fans. Another mind-blowing concept is combining mining with businesses or industries that naturally create cool air. An example that Cross discussed was carbon capture facilities, which integrate enormous fan banks as part of their normal business operations. Pairing these fan banks with a mining operation subsidizes the cost of ASIC cooling.<br></p><p>As these innovations get more developed, simply adding Bitcoin mining to countless unrelated industries and businesses that generate cooling or need heating will improve efficiency and reduce costs. Bitcoin mining is already <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/flower-powered-bitcoin-miner-heats-greenhouses-in-the-netherlands">heating greenhouses</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/south-florida-distillers-bitcoin/">distilling whiskey</a>, while at the same time monetizing stranded or wasted energy.</p><p>Over time, Bitcoin mining will continue to be paired with industries that make mining or normal business operations more profitable. Eventually it will be ridiculous to not use your businesses' naturally-generated heat or wasted energy on Bitcoin miners, or if your business happens to have enormous fan banks, it will become ridiculous to not point them at ASICs. All of this results in more positively-incentivized miners over time which maintains network security and has the potential to counterbalance the shrinking block subsidy.</p><p>The combination of Bitcoin’s adoption naturally leading to increased transaction fees over time and Bitcoin mining shifting into an auxiliary tool for a wide range of independent industries demonstrate how the long-term security of the network is something to be optimistic about.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Dillon Healy.

If people take the metaphors too literally, they inevitably make mistakes in their reasoning about Bitcoin. </p><p>First, let’s consider this quotation on whether all metaphors are wrong:</p><blockquote><p>“For it would be an absurd undertaking to banish from the language of economic theory every manner of speaking that is not literally correct; it would be sheer pedantry to proscribe every figure of speech, particularly since we could not say the hundredth part of what we have to say, if we refused ever to take recourse to a metaphor. <strong>One requirement is essential, that economic theory avoid the error of confusing a practical habit, indulged in for the sake of expediency, with scientific truth</strong>.”&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://mises.org/wire/objectivist-law-prof-mossoff-copyright-or-misuse-labor-value-and-creation-metaphors">Eugen von Bohm-Bawerk</a></p></blockquote><p>So, clearly, not all analogies are harmful. But when striving for accuracy, the metaphor can’t be confused with the real scientific truth. </p><h2>‘Bitcoin Is Stored Time’</h2><p>The popular notion that bitcoin can “store our time” is an overly loose and imprecise metaphor. It typically comes up when Bitcoiners are talking about the injustice of fiat currency (this part is correct), but then it goes awry when the metaphor is stretched too far into suggesting that we should “store our time” in bitcoin instead of fiat currency. </p><p>The “store of value” concept can arguably apply to Bitcoin if we consider longer time frames, but it’s really not storing <em>time</em>. As the saying goes, time waits for no man. We speak in loose terms such as economizing time or “saving time,” but really, time itself is not what we economize, it’s <em>how we spend our time</em>. The preference is in the <em>doing</em>. Or, as my podcast guest <a href="http://stephanlivera.com/443">Conza</a> recounted from a conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/KonradSGraf">Konrad Graf</a>, “Go ahead, try not to spend some time and save it for later instead.”</p><p>Even when equivocating bitcoin as purchasing power which may be the <em>spirit</em> of the analogy, it is important to remember that there are no guarantees here. Bitcoin’s purchasing power has gone down over selected time frames, which is where thinking of bitcoin as stored time can really lead a person astray if taken too literally. </p><p>Now, a shout out to my friend Gigi, who has written on the concept of <a href="https://dergigi.com/2021/01/14/bitcoin-is-time/">Bitcoin as building out an arrow of time</a>. This concept does make sense and it helps to explain why Bitcoin is designed the way it is — by keeping time using blocks instead of seconds and not relying on a centralized time keeper. This is distinct from the incorrect metaphor of “bitcoin as storing your time.” So, a more accurate framing would be that bitcoin <em>keeps</em> time (using blocks, not seconds), but it does not store your time.</p><h2>Bitcoin As Energy/Battery</h2><p>Some people speak of Bitcoin as digital energy or as though it is a battery. But remember, while Bitcoin miners use energy, Bitcoin still does not allow anyone to store or transport energy. There is not some central counter that we can go take our bitcoin to and redeem it for a set amount of energy. Yes, energy could be <a href="http://stephanlivera.com/431">priced and sold for bitcoin</a>, but that’s not the same thing. The price of energy will fluctuate and bitcoin will not even metaphorically store the same amount of energy over time.</p><p>What error can this lead to? It can mislead people on where the value is coming from. This metaphor leads people toward a kind of <em>cost</em> theory of value, effectively putting the horse before the cart. Instead, we should reason from the <a href="https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value">subjective theory of value</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“The value of a good is not determined by any inherent property of the good, nor by the amount of labor required to produce the good, but instead value is determined by the importance an acting individual places on a good for the achievement of their desired ends.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>A related cousin of this is the notion that bitcoin is “backed by” energy. Typically, this comes up when a nocoiner says, “But Bitcoin isn’t backed by anything.” So, in some cases, a well intentioned but wrong Bitcoiner may say, “No, Bitcoin is backed by energy!” But this is wrong. </p><p>Generally, when something is “backed by” something else, it implies that it somehow has the support of some other entity, like a government. Historically, people say the U.S. dollar was “backed by” gold, and people could historically redeem notes for gold, but no such thing exists with Bitcoin. So, perhaps a better question to ask is, “What’s gold backed by?” Only then are we getting to the truth of the matter: it was all subjective valuation all along. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. </p><h2>Bitcoin As Violence Or A ‘Weapon’</h2><p>Some people want to frame Bitcoin as a kind of “digital violence” or, more recently, frame it as a weapon and part of a “soft war protocol.” But this is a gross misrepresentation of what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is more like cryptographic messages being passed around and validated on a network. Surely that is closer to “speech” than a “weapon.” Or, more accurately, bitcoin can be thought of as a rivalrous digital commodity (the first of its kind), operating on an open-source monetary network. </p><p>If the pen is mightier than the sword, would it be appropriate to call a pen a weapon? Not really. Also, this whole line of argument is clearly blurring a line between what’s voluntary, and what is initiating aggression (which is the part that’s wrong). How is running a node, adopting bitcoin as a rivalrous digital commodity and participating in the network a form of “weaponry”? This is just gross mischaracterisation. Words mean things. </p><p>Some of the analogies and metaphors used in relation to “bitcoin as soft war protocol” relate to miners competing to secure the “chain of custody.” But do they? Or is it really more like Bitcoin nodes are what secure Bitcoin? Miners can’t make invalid transactions appear valid to those who are running and verifying transactions with their own Bitcoin node. So, isn’t it more relevant to think of it like <em>nodes</em> secure Bitcoin? The job of miners is important, but their job is more related to <a href="https://stephanlivera.com/episode/442/"><em>finality</em> of transactions</a>, not security. </p><h2>So, What Is The Real Truth Then? </h2><p>So, as mentioned earlier, economically speaking, bitcoin is more accurately characterized as a rivalrous digital commodity. Bitcoin <em>is</em> the commodity itself — it’s not a claim on something, it is the commodity itself. When people ask what it is backed by, this indicates they haven’t quite grasped what it is. </p><p>If an analogy helps a new person get into Bitcoin and start going down the rabbit hole, that’s great! But as that person advances their knowledge about Bitcoin, additional precision about what Bitcoin is will help us all. </p><p><em>Thanks to my friend </em><a href="https://twitter.com/Conza"><em>Conza</em></a><em> for inspiring this article and providing feedback. </em></p><p><em>This is a guest post by Stephan Livera.

I found a nation in distress about money, because of a kleptocratic ruling elite that had been defrauding and stealing from their people by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe">inflating the national currency for decades</a>. Despite this, corruption and military support allowed these leaders to stay at the top for over 40 years.</p><p>The need was there, but what about understanding of Bitcoin? I found a few true believers and HODLers from the early days, but I didn’t find a single Bitcoin-only event or community. What existed were cryptocurrency trading groups on WhatsApp and Facebook and a lot of scams. The first questions about Bitcoin always were: “How can I join Bitcoin?” (which is the language that scammers are using to lure in their victims) and “How can I trade it?” (which is the language of short time preference).</p><p>In 2021, I had the idea to bring Bitcoin knowledge to the Global South with a focus on fostering communities on the ground and connecting them infrastructure-wise and people-wise with the Bitcoin network. Elizabeth Stark of Lightning Labs encouraged me to apply for a donation at the Human Rights Foundation, <a href="https://hrf.org/bitcoin-dev-fund-q1-2022gifts">which became the first donor supporting “Bitcoin for Fairness.”</a> </p><p>With the advice of Sharon Dow and Jacob Strumwasser of Lightning Labs, I drafted a grant proposal, which resulted in sponsorships from LEDN, Okcoin, Paxful, Coinfinity, Breez and Trezor. I set up a crowdfunding campaign on Geyser which received over 500 donations from Bitcoiners all over the world. Brad Mills, Peter McCormack and f418_me all donated significant amounts. I’m sure I’m forgetting other donors — sorry about that and thank you each and everyone for your support!</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Our Impact</h2><p>Through Bitcoin For Fairness, I visited four African countries to spread Bitcoin education and connections this year. The most time I spent was in Zimbabwe and Zambia, which I visited two times each. In April after Bitcoin 2022 in Miami, I gave up my apartment in Vienna and started my nomad life. </p><p>It led me to South Africa in May, where I worked with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-ekasi-township-one-year-later">Bitcoin Ekasi</a>. In June, I was at the Oslo Freedom Forum to connect with human rights activists and freedom fighters like Meron Estefanos, Farida Nabourema and Leopoldo Lopez. COVID-19 stopped me for a few weeks and after the Baltic Honeybadger conference in Riga, I returned to Zimbabwe and Zambia. The last traveling I did in 2022 led me to the first pan-African Bitcoin conference in Ghana.</p><h4>Zambia</h4><p>In March, I was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0uSQI0B5Nw">speaking to 50 students at the University of Zambia</a> — we hosted a Lightning Network workshop, I gave radio and newspaper interviews and we started a Bitcoin education group on WhatsApp, which has grown to 65 members. All of this was organized by Ndesa, Emmanuel and Japhet, three crypto-interested individuals who hadn’t known each other before. In May, they set up the <a href="https://bffbtc.org/first-bitcoin-for-fairness-bitcoin-meetup-photos/">first Bitcoin For Fairness (BFF) meetup in Lusaka</a>.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In October, I visited for the second time. I was speaking at the <a href="https://anitaposch.com/internet-freedom-africa">Forum On Internet Freedom In Africa 2022</a> (FIFA22) and at the University of Zambia<a href="https://anitaposch.com/bitcoin-unza"> to about 30 students, and we installed wallets and sent sats</a>. We organized a BFF meetup and donated a RaspiBlitz full node to one of the local Bitcoiners. Together, with the BFF team, we conducted a <a href="https://bffbtc.org/bitcoin-workshop/">one-day Bitcoin workshop for journalists</a>.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In December, the fifth BFF meetup took place and the Bitcoin and Lightning node was up and running. The BFF goal to initiate a local group of Bitcoiners to conduct regular meetups and bring Bitcoin infrastructure to Zambia has been fully met. The local BFF group has set up their own <a href="https://zambiabitcoinmeetups.com/">ZambiaBitcoinMeetups.com</a> website, it meets at Scallywags a (restaurant accepting bitcoin) and one of the members started a <a href="https://btcpodcasting.com/@BantuBitcoinBemba/episodes">Bitcoin podcast in the local Bemba language</a> on our recently-launched BTC Podcasting platform.</p><h3>Zimbabwe</h3><p>We kicked the Zimbabwe trip off with a Bitcoin talk in early March which was attended by 60 participants in the capital of Harare. One of them was Alexandria, who took a six-hour bus ride from Bulawayo, because he didn’t know any other Bitcoiners. I encouraged Alexandria to start a Bitcoin-only WhatsApp group and ask the guests to join. Today, that group has grown to 300 members and is on <a href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinreach">Twitter</a>, too. Alexandria and his Bitcoin Reach group is fully independent from BFF now. This has also been a goal of mine: self sovereignty and self organization of the communities.</p><figure>

The meetups in Gweru and Bulawayo were sponsored by BFF. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rufaskamau/2022/03/22/an-insight-into-paco-de-la-indias-run-with-bitcoin-world-tour/?sh=7e3fe73063eb">“Run With Bitcoin” Paco</a> was our guest, too.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/prestigegroup01/status/1547274244836528128"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>We gave away Trezor devices and I conducted a workshop to help people set the devices up.

Being the trailblazer that he is, he invited me to make his podcast “Value4Value” ready for a bitcoin standard. Now, his show is the <a href="https://anitaposch.com/icwt-bitcoin-enabled">first Zimbabwean podcast receiving bitcoin payments</a> via Alby.</p><p>After my appearance on “In Conversation With Trevor,” Newsday Zimbabwe published an <a href="https://www.newsday.co.zw/business/article/200002981/bitcoin-should-be-the-currency-of-choice">article titled “Bitcoin Should Be The Currency Of Choice</a>,” writing, “Anita Posch has urged Zimbabwean businesses and individuals to use bitcoin as a medium of exchange because of its low charges when transacting as well as its being less prone to abuse.”</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>South Africa</h3><p>In May, I went to South Africa to work with Bitcoin Ekasi, the circular Bitcoin economy in Mossel Bay. First I spent some time in Cape Town and <a href="https://anita.link/155">met Bitcoin builders like Carel van Wyk</a>, who was already working on a solution to what later became <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/pick-n-pay-now-accepts-bitcoin">Pick n Pay’s acceptance of Lightning payments</a>.</p><p>Since November, you have been able to pay for your groceries at one of the biggest supermarket chains in South Africa. This is a huge step for the future success of the circular Bitcoin economy in the township. Now, people can earn and spend bitcoin without the need to exchange to the South African rand.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinEkasi/status/1602194653457141760"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>We also brought a RaspiBlitz and Trezor devices to Bitcoin Ekasi.

    </figure><p>Last but not least, I served as the matchmaker between Bitcoin Ekasi’s new teacher, named Ms. Nomsa, and a BFF volunteer, who helped her get knowledgeable about Bitcoin. I also connected Paxful with the community, which led to a Paxful and Built With Bitcoin education center being placed on site.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinEkasi/status/1579837612914720768"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><h3>Ghana</h3><p>As soon as I heard the announcement of the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/africa-bitcoin-conference-starts-december-5">first Pan-Africa Bitcoin conference</a>, I knew I wanted to be a part of it. Organized by Farida Bemba Nabourema, a Togolese human rights and Bitcoin activist, it came to be the greatest Bitcoin conference I have been to so far. The focus on Bitcoin as a tool for Africans to empower and free themselves financially from colonial and authoritarian structures resonated with the work of BFF.</p><p>Prior to the conference, I helped Marcel Lorraine, the founder of <a href="https://twitter.com/dada_bitcoin?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Bitcoin Dada</a>, a women-focused Bitcoin education group raising funds, to visit the conference and I also met Noelyne Sumba and Mary Imasuen who organized a BFF sponsored meetup in Nigeria earlier this year.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Built Educational Content And Infrastructure For Communities</h2><h3>The Bitcoin Flyer</h3><p>On top of all of the above, I published the <a href="https://bffbtc.org/flyer">BFF Bitcoin flyer</a> together with the <a href="https://cryptoconsortium.org/">C4 Cryptocurrency Certification Consortium</a>. The flyer is an easy and cheap-to-produce Bitcoin FAQ to give away at meetups or conferences. With the help of volunteers, we translated the flyer to twelve languages, including Swahili, Luganda and soon, Akan Twi and Eritrean. We encourage volunteers to translate the open-sourced folder into their local languages.</p><h3>BTC Podcasting</h3><p>Together with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07HAcQDDAmo">Michael Bumann from Alby</a>, I developed a new podcast hosting platform called BTC Podcasting, where Bitcoiners can <a href="https://btcpodcasting.com/">host their podcasts for free and, at the same time, earn bitcoin from their listeners</a> without the need to run their own Lightning nodes. BFF wants to encourage communities to start their own podcasts. Given that the cost for internet bandwidth is very high and the speed also doesn’t allow video streaming in many African regions, we learned that audio is a much better medium through which to reach people.</p><h3>Documentary: How Bitcoin Enforces Human Rights</h3><p>One of the most compelling reasons for me to start working with and for Bitcoin was the humanitarian and social aspects. The possibility to stick it to authoritarians and take the power out of their hands and put it back into the hands of the people was compelling. </p><p>During the last six years since I started in the Bitcoin space, it became clear to me that only Bitcoin delivers fair access for anyone to take economic action and that it is essential for enforcing human rights. This is the reason why I called my NPO initiative “Bitcoin For Fairness” and why I wrote an essay for <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-enforces-universal-human-rights">Bitcoin Magazine about “How Bitcoin Enforces Human Rights.”</a> </p><p>I also produced a podcast and a video documentary about it, so that people can share these thoughts easily with their peers. The importance of the Bitcoin project may not be underestimated. It’s our only shot to regain digital and financial privacy and to have an alternative system for the short-sighted, debt-based and consumption-driven fiat economy. If we mess up, there will be no similar freedom project in the near future.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AXLiwrrk3sk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><h2>Learnings</h2><p>Blockchain technology and crypto are big in African countries. But the differences between Bitcoin and altcoins are widely not understood. Altcoins and their marketing departments have done a great job of letting people believe that they are the better Bitcoin, telling them that the original is slow and not scalable. Even the people who are organizing events and sharing crypto knowledge haven’t heard of the Lightning Network or sidechains like Rootstock or Liquid yet.</p><p>In most countries, crypto and stablecoins are king. Only in Nigeria is the share of Bitcoin usage higher than that of altcoins, as I was told by Ray Youssef, the CEO of Paxful. In Zimbabwe, a <a href="https://anitaposch.com/insights-from-exchanging-bitcoin-peer-to-peer-in-zimbabwe">trader who exchanged a volume of $6 million in 2021 told me</a> that most people are using USDT, and only a handful of convinced Bitcoiners are HODLing.</p><p>There are hundreds of free guides, tutorials and videos about Bitcoin, but where to start? Five out of 50 people at my first talk in Lusaka were interested in Bitcoin only. They are isolated and far away from where the experienced users and developers are — it’s hard to catch up. They can’t afford to attend Lightning hackdays or other Bitcoin-focused conferences, which are mostly in the U.S. or Europe. Traveling to other African countries is expensive and cumbersome.</p><p>There is a need for more boots on the ground to share knowledge and tools. Nobody I had met at my talks was using a hardware wallet. The devices are very expensive for the average person and hard to get. I gifted a BitBox02 to a friend in Zimbabwe two years ago and he told me that he hadn’t set it up yet.</p><p>There is a need for more local Bitcoin infrastructure and the <a href="https://bitcoiners.africa/africa-free-routing/">Africa Free Routing project</a> is a great start, because the two nodes I was able to bring are not enough. One great example of a solution built for Africa by an African is <a href="https://twitter.com/Machankura8333?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Machankura</a>, a custodial Lightning wallet, which allows you to send and receive bitcoin on a feature phone without internet connection. It’s using the same technology that mobile money providers in Africa have been using for years called USSD. We used it in Zambia.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FCiK1AZuPRM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><h2>Going Forward</h2><p>Building in the bear market was not an easy task, but thanks to the BFF volunteers and donors, we did so. Our goal for 2023 is to focus even more on education around self custody and privacy. </p><p>One thing we learned is that after all of the crypto scammers who have been hitting the African continent, building trust by being on the ground is essential. But it’s not enough, there has to be a possibility to stay connected and offer further knowledge to the communities and especially the individuals who are driving their groups. </p><p>That’s why I’m going to build a community site with online courses and education around non-KYC bitcoin, privacy tools and, of course, self custody in 2023. At the same time, BFF’s goal is to find more volunteering translators for the Bitcoin flyer and to accompany Bitcoiners to develop their community podcasts and start earning bitcoin.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Anita Posch.

It presents an open mechanism to denial-of-service attack nodes on the network to prevent them from routing, losing them money while their liquidity is locked up and unable to forward payments that will earn them fees. An attacker can route a payment through other nodes from themselves to themselves, and refuse to finalize the payment. This makes that liquidity useless for forwarding other payments until the hashed timelock contract (HTLC) timelock expires and the payment refunds. </p><p>Last month, Lightning developer Antoine Riard proposed a formal specification for a solution to this problem. In August, Riard and Gleb Naumenko published <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/channel-jamming-bitcoin-lightning-network">research</a> looking at the general problem itself, as well as a number of different solutions that could be used to mitigate or solve it. One of those proposed solutions was a form of anonymized credentials that nodes could use to build a sort of reputation scoring system for users routing payments through them without having to dox or associate that reputation with a static identifier that would negatively impact peoples' privacy. This solution has now become the <a href="https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/80214c83190836c4f7699af9e8920769607f1a00/www-reputation-credentials-protocol.md">formal protocol proposal</a> made by Riard last month. </p><h2>Inside The Channel Jamming Mitigation Proposal</h2><p>The core of the idea is a Chaumian ecash token. These are centralized tokens issued by a mint authority in a way that prevents the issuance of a token from being correlated to the redemption of a token later. This is done by signing a token in a blinded way, allowing the receiver of the token to unblind it without invalidating the signature. The issuer can then verify it is a legitimate token without being able to connect that token to when it was issued. </p><p>The proposal suggests using these Chaumian tokens, issued by each routing node on the network, as a form of reputational proof. When routing a payment, a Chaumian ecash token issued by each node in the payment hop would be wrapped up in the onion bundle for that node along the payment. Token units would represent both the value of the HTLC allowed as well as the refund timelock period. Before forwarding the HTLC, each node would verify that the token included in their onion blob is valid and has never been redeemed before, only forwarding the HTLC if both of those conditions are true. </p><p>If the HTLC settles successfully with the preimage being revealed, then every node along the payment path signs and includes a newly-issued Chaumian token to be returned back to the sender, along with the HTLC preimage. If the HTLC does not successfully settle, then the routing nodes "burn" the token by including it in their spent token table and do not issue a new token. This forces the sender to have to acquire new tokens from those nodes in order to route payments through them again. The entire concept is that jamming attacks always fail to settle, so in this scheme, these tokens issued by each node that you route through are burned if you perform a jamming attack and create the cost of acquiring more to do it again. Right now, jamming attacks cost nothing but time, so this would add an economic cost to them. </p><p>So, it’s time to discuss the elephant in the room: how do you bootstrap the issuance and circulation of these tokens across the network? Each node that you wish to route through would require a token issued by them. The solution: pay for them. Another proposed solution to the channel jamming issue is up-front fees, i.e., charging a fee to even try to route a payment regardless of whether or not it even succeeds. So, even failed payments would incur a fee for the sender. </p><p>Riard’s proposal is to purchase these tokens directly from each node as one-off purchases. From that point forward, instead of paying upfront fees for every payment, as long as the prior payment successfully settled, you would be reissued "routing tokens" that would enable your next proposed payment to be routed without a fee. This way, successful payments only pay the actual routing fee, and failed payments only pay the up-front fee, preventing a sort of "double fee" for successful payments. At least economically, think of it as a sort of middleground compromise between the current state of affairs&nbsp;where failed payments cost nothing and only successful payments pay a fee, and a full up-front fee model where all payments pay an up-front fee and successful ones pay a routing fee as well.</p><h2>Takeaways From The Proposal</h2><p>Personally, I think this sort of direct payment for tokens ahead of time could introduce a large degree of UX friction into the process of using the Lightning Network. However, I think there is a pretty simple solution for that friction by tweaking the proposal a bit. </p><p>Instead of having to specifically pay each node directly for Chaumian tokens ahead of time, the proposal could be hybridized more directly with the up-front fee proposal. If you have tokens for a node, then include those in the onion blob, if not simply pay an up-front fee directly within the HTLC proposal and if the payment settles successfully, you will be issued Chaumian tokens back in proportion to what your up-front fee was. This way, instead of having to collect tokens from many different nodes ahead of time, you simply acquire them over the course of making initial payments until you have a good collection from the different nodes that you use frequently and very rarely have to incur the cost of up-front fees to attain them. </p><p>Another potential source of friction is for node operators, and comes down to fundamental issues of Chaumian ecash itself. In order to ensure that a token is only spent once, the issuer needs to maintain a database of all the tokens that have been spent. This grows forever, making lookups to check token validity more and more expensive and time consuming the bigger that database grows. Because of this, Riard proposes having these Chaumian tokens expire periodically, at a block height advertised in the gossip protocol per node. This means that senders need to periodically repurchase these tokens, or if the implementation were to support it, redeem them for new tokens signed by the new signing key after the prior one expires. </p><p>This would either place a regular economic cost on the senders of payments, or require them to periodically check in to ensure reissuance when old tokens expire. In practice, this can be automated for people running their own Lightning nodes, and for any wallets built around an Lightning service provider (LSP) model, the LSP itself could actually handle the acquisition and maintenance of tokens on behalf of its users, handling the token provisioning for its users' payments. On the fringes, however, without a full Lightning node or LSP, this could become a bit of an annoyance for light wallet users. </p><p>I think this proposal could actually go a long way to mitigating channel jamming as an attack vector, especially if hybridized a little more tightly with the basic up-front fee scheme, and most of the UX frictions can be handled very easily for LSP users and people who operate their own Lightning nodes. And even if the up front fees do present a high degree of friction, it's possible that simply <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-November/002884.html">proving control of a Bitcoin UTXO</a> could be used in place of actually paying fees to acquire tokens. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Shinobi.

You can find the Kiboruto and more at <a href="https://crazyk3d.com/">crazyk3d.com</a>.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>If you have taken self custody of your bitcoin, congratulations on taking the first steps toward leading a permissionless life. Now, you should make sure your bitcoin is secure and safe from environmental hazards like fire and flood. Writing down your backup information in a notebook is a good start but at some point, you may find that this no longer feels secure enough when you take environmental hazards into account.</p><p>When you take the radical responsibility of self custody over your bitcoin, you and you alone are responsible for those funds. There is no charge-back feature or 1-800 helpline with Bitcoin, so you want to be sure that you take every precaution in protecting your funds. Since the Kiboruto is tailor made for Samourai Wallet, that wallet will be the focus of this guide. With Samourai Wallet, there are three key pieces of information you want to secure:</p><h3>1. Seed Words</h3><p>When you set up Samourai Wallet, you will be given a list of 12 words known as your “seed words,” sometimes also referred to as your “seed phrase” or “mnemonic phrase.” These 12 seed words are a key piece of information that allows you to restore your Bitcoin wallet in the event that you lose your phone, or it is stolen, or it is damaged beyond repair, for example. Seed words always need to be saved in the same order that your wallet presents them to you. If you get even one word in the wrong order, it could render your bitcoin backup useless. Be prepared for the worst and secure your seed words like they were gold or jewelry.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>2. Passphrase</h3><p>You will also set a passphrase when generating your Samourai Wallet. The passphrase is something unique that you set, it is not generated by Samourai Wallet. Your Samourai Wallet has no way of knowing what passphrase you set and also, any passphrase you enter will generate a valid wallet. Whether that is the wallet which contains your bitcoin or not depends on your ability to enter the same passphrase as the one you originally set when setting up your wallet for the first time. Unlike seed words, which come from a predefined list of <a href="https://www.bitcoinsafety.com/blogs/bitcoin/seed-phrase-list">2,048 English words</a>, a passphrase on the other hand can include any combination of lower/upper case letters, numbers and special characters that you want to use.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>3. PayNym</h3><p>Last but not least is your PayNym. The PayNym is a unique name and avatar that is associated with your wallet. You can use this PayNym to verify that you have in fact restored the correct wallet. Your PayNym is capable of a lot more though: It can display a static payment code to receive funds without revealing any of your prior transaction history to anyone. Use your PayNym to connect with other Samourai Wallet users so that you can build collaborative CoinJoin transactions like Stowaway or StonewallX2.

    </figure><p>The next section will walk you through exactly how to get these three pieces of information from a new Samourai Wallet.</p><h2>Setting Up Samourai Wallet</h2><p>The Kiboruto stainless-steel backup was designed specifically for your Samourai Wallet. Stainless-steel backups like this can withstand extreme environmental conditions such as a house fire or severe flooding. Oftentimes, people will use a pen and paper to write down their seed phrases — this is a good start and if you want to use a pen and paper, then download the Samourai Wallet recovery template <a href="https://samouraiwallet.com/recovery/worksheet">here</a>. But your paper backup may not withstand a house fire or flooding, so consider using both methods to have one as a fail safe. Keep in mind, though, that anyone who gains access to this information will technically be able to gain access to your bitcoin, so keep them secure.</p><p>Here is a video on how to set up your Samourai Wallet for the first time and get the seed words that you will later stamp into your Kiboruto. Please note that the wallet version (0.99.96g) used in this video has since been updated to a newer version with a detailed explainer introduction. The new version will be showcased later in the guide when demonstrating how to recover your seed words.</p><iframe height="315" width="560" src="https://media.econoalchemist.com/videos/embed/b2433030-a704-453b-be5a-311e8c8c5e87" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><p>The next section will walk you through how to stamp your Samourai wallet backup information into your Kiboruto.&nbsp;You can download Samourai Wallet for your Android device directly from the <a href="https://samouraiwallet.com/download">Samourai Wallet website</a> or use the F-Droid repository option or Google Play Store option listed on the website as well.</p><h2>Stamping The Kiboruto</h2><p>Once you have set up your wallet and identified your PayNym, you can navigate back through the menu to display your seed words and then stamp them into the Kiboruto, as shown in the video below. </p><ol><li>From your Samourai Wallet homepage, navigate to the three-dot menu in the upper right-hand corner and select “settings,” then “wallet,” then “show mnemonic.” A dialog box will appear with your 12 seed words. These are the words you want to stamp into the Kiboruto in order. </li><li>To test your passphrase prior to stamping, from your Samourai Wallet homepage, navigate to the three-dot menu in the upper right-hand corner and select “settings,” then “troubleshoot,” then “passphrase/backup test.” From there, you can enter your passphrase and Samourai Wallet will confirm if it is correct. Once you know that you have it correct, then you can stamp it in the Kiboruto. </li><li>To view your PayNym from your Samourai Wallet homepage, navigate to the blue "+" sign in the lower right-hand corner then select the purple PayNym icon. Your PayNym short name will be displayed directly below your PayNym robot avatar. </li></ol><p>Make sure that you use a solid surface on which to stamp your Kiboruto, like a concrete floor. A heavy hammer, like a four-pound mini sledge, works well to get a crisp stamp. You will stamp the 12 seed words in order on the large Kiboruto plate and then stamp your passphrase and PayNym on the small Kiboruto plate. This way, you can store the two pieces of information separately if you want. You will need both pieces (seed words and passphrase) to recover your bitcoin in the event that you lose access to your wallet.</p><iframe height="315" width="560" src="https://media.econoalchemist.com/videos/embed/de10cf90-f185-4bbb-834e-4456949e8b29" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><p>Now you should have your seed words, unique PayNym and your passphrase secured in metal on the Kiboruto. This way, you have the information needed to restore your Samourai Wallet and recover your bitcoin in case your phone is lost, damaged or stolen or your backup is exposed to fire or flooding.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The next section will demonstrate a fire test of the Kiboruto to verify that the backup information is recoverable in the event of extreme environmental conditions.</p><h2>Kiboruto Fire Test</h2><p>Any stainless-steel backup should be able to withstand fire or flooding. But testing these backups is important to verify that the information contained within is recoverable. You may not want to or may not have the tools/skills necessary to conduct your own fire test, so here is an example of the Kiboruto being brought up to just under melting point, 1,500 degrees celsius.</p><iframe height="315" width="560" src="https://media.econoalchemist.com/videos/embed/efd0c0fd-3078-4e8a-aa7a-a59d5bb12741" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><p>The Kiboruto successfully secured the vital information needed in order to restore the Samourai Wallet and regain access to the bitcoin. The seed phrase is 100% recoverable and even most of the etching survived.</p><section><figure>

This means that you can use a variety of Bitcoin wallets to recover your funds from this kind of backup. For example, if you lost your mobile phone and bought a new one, you could <a href="https://samouraiwallet.com/download">download</a> the Samourai Wallet application again and then follow these recovery steps using your Kiboruto to regain access to your bitcoin. </p><p>Once you launch Samourai Wallet, you will have the recommended options to connect to Tor and connect to your own <a href="https://ronindojo.io/en/tanto">RoninDojo</a>. Then you will have the option to restore from backup. Simply enter your seed words in order from your Kiboruto and then add your passphrase from your Kiboruto and then you should be presented with the same PayNym as your original and have access to your bitcoin once again.</p><iframe height="315" width="560" src="https://media.econoalchemist.com/videos/embed/358f5ee3-775b-4d9c-af93-b3b83d6812b6" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>That should be everything you need to restore your Samourai Wallet after a catastrophic event in which you lose your phone and need to restore access to your bitcoin. Should you ever have questions about the wallet derivation path, <a href="https://walletsrecovery.org/">WalletsRecovery.org</a> has compiled most Bitcoin wallets in a list. </p><p>Here are the Samourai Wallet derivation paths, for example:</p><ul><li>Deposit: m/44'|49'|84'|47'/0'/0'</li><li>Bad Bank: m/84'/0'/2147483644'</li><li>Pre Mix: m/84'/0'/2147483645'</li><li>Post Mix: m/84'/0'/2147483646'</li><li>Ricochet: m/44'|49'|84'/0'/2147483647'</li></ul><p>When restoring a Samourai Wallet on another Samourai Wallet client, you will not need to worry about these derivation paths. This would only be cause for consideration if restoring across platforms to another wallet. </p><p>Some final considerations are how many copies of the Kiboruto you want, where to store them and whether you store the passphrase separately or not. Everyone's threat model, situation and circumstances are unique, so each individual will need to make these decisions on their own. Just keep in mind that an adversary could restore your wallet if they found your seed words and passphrase. </p><p>Using a <a href="https://ronindojo.io/en/tanto">RoninDojo</a> is the most private way to use Samourai Wallet. <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinQ_A">@BitcoinQ_A</a> wrote a great <a href="https://bitcoiner.guide/ronindojo/">guide</a> on getting started with it and there are full instructions maintained on the <a href="https://wiki.ronindojo.io/en/home">Ronin wiki page</a>.

And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.”</p><p>–<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/481916-every-record-has-been-destroyed-or-falsified-every-book-rewritten">George Orwell, “1984”</a></p></blockquote><p>At the outbreak of the<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-42367551"> first world war</a>, Great Britain had the world’s most sophisticated undersea telegraph cable system, which wrapped around the entire world. On August 5, 1914, a day after the British had declared war on the Germans, a British ship, the Alert, set sail from the port of Dover with a mission of cutting off all of Germany’s communications with the world by sabotaging the Germans’ undersea cables and the mission was accomplished successfully.</p><p>A day before the Alert set sail, on August 4, a man was deployed to the cable station at Porthcurno in Cornwall and the cables carrying traffic across the Atlantic came ashore on the beach. The job title of this man was “censor” and numerous other censors were deployed across the empire, from Hong Kong to Malta to Singapore. Once the censors were in position, a worldwide system of intercepting communications known as “censorship” was born. Its main aim was to prevent the communication of strategic intelligence between the enemy and their agents. In other words, the goal had evolved from just crippling the Germans’ ability to communicate, to also gathering intelligence. </p><p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-42367551">Over 50,000 messages per day were handled by the network of 180 censors at U.K. offices.</a> By leveraging their dominance over the international telegraph infrastructure, the British created the first global communications surveillance system that stretched from Cape Town to Cairo and from Gibraltar to Zanzibar. This became one of the choke points that led to the defeat of the Germans.</p><p>While the phenomenon of censorship is by no means a new one, as highlighted by the historical account above, the fact still stands that it’s a weapon that has been deployed throughout history to silence opposing views, cripple independent thought and ultimately subjugate “enemies of the state” or entire nations. </p><p>2022 was in many ways what I would personally call the year of the “censor.” As I look back and reflect on 2022, it seems to me that incidents of censorship are now the rule and not the exception thanks to the rise of<a href="https://nypost.com/article/what-is-cancel-culture-breaking-down-the-toxic-online-trend/"> cancel culture</a> on social media and various independent media voices offering diverse views on controversial topics that, in some cases, contradict the “official narrative.” Honest and open debate is stifled when these views get censored, resulting in further polarization.</p><p>Furthermore the convergence of digital platforms and banking has led to the rise of another, more dangerous and pervasive form of censorship: financial censorship. This is a more malicious<a href="https://charityandsecurity.org/issue-areas/deplatforming/"> form of censorship</a> that isn’t just about hindering or intercepting communications, but is characterized by cutting off one’s access to basic financial services, restricting who one can trade with and hindering the ability to transact freely. This includes but isn’t limited to shutting down the bank accounts of political opponents, being blacklisted and deplatformed by payment processors and economic sanctions. What started out as a tool to stop criminals and other bad actors from financing their nefarious activities has now morphed into a weapon for silencing critics, oppressing dissenters and harassing whistleblowers, as well as indirectly controlling the spending habits of people. </p><p>Given Bitcoin’s censorship resistance, it too was also subjected to numerous attacks in this past year as the censors clearly understand that it’s an alternative monetary system that they cannot stop, control or influence.</p><p>In a world where the definitions of what constitutes “acceptable speech or appropriate behavior” are constantly moving targets, who knows when you may end up having your bank accounts frozen for having a different perspective or for something you posted on social media ten years ago? Will independent thought result in financial retaliation? In this essay I will highlight a few of the key incidents of financial censorship that occurred in 2022 which were basically free Bitcoin marketing campaigns, and more importantly, discuss how Bitcoin is the perfect shield going forward.</p><h2>The Freedom Convoy</h2><blockquote><p>“The greatest danger to the State is independent intellectual criticism.”</p><p>–<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/3196240-the-greatest-danger-to-the-state-is-independent-intellectual-criticism">Murray N. Rothbard</a></p></blockquote><p>The increased levels of collusion between the State, bankers and big tech against individuals and organizations that hold legal but dissenting views is perhaps the most obfuscated and dangerous form of financial censorship. </p><p>The<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60420470"> Freedom Convoy protests</a> that kicked off on January 22 by Canadian truckers who were protesting against COVID-19 vaccine mandates clearly demonstrated how third-party payment platforms and banks can collude with the State to financially cut off individuals without due process. Through the crowdfunding site GoFundMe the truckers managed to<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60267840"> raise approximately</a> $7.9 million in donations. GoFundMe then withheld and later refunded the donations to the donors citing a violation of their terms of service against the promotion of violence. </p><p>Not long after that, Prime Minister Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act, which allowed the government to freeze the bank accounts, suspend insurance policies and withhold other financial services from the protestors and their donors.</p><p>During a<a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2022/02/14/full-text-of-chrystia-freelands-remarks-during-emergencies-act-announcement.html"> press conference</a> on the February 14, after the invocation of the Emergencies Act, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland made the following remarks:</p><blockquote><p>“The government is issuing an order with immediate effect, under the Emergencies Act, authorizing Canadian financial institutions to temporarily cease providing financial services where the institution suspects that an account is being used to further the illegal blockades and occupations. This order covers both personal and corporate accounts…As of today, a bank or other financial service provider will be able to immediately freeze or suspend an account without a court order. In doing so, they will be protected against civil liability for actions taken in good faith. Federal government institutions will have a new broad authority to share relevant information with banks and other financial service providers to ensure that we can all work together to put a stop to the funding of these illegal blockades.”</p></blockquote><p>The Canadian government chose to shut down the protests by nuking the protestors’ financial infrastructure. Financial services providers were given the green light to do so without due process and were given legal cover by the state for any blowback that could result from enforcing this decree. Furthermore, the government intends to<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/trudeau-government-moves-to-make-expanded-surveillance-powers-over-financial-transactions-permanent/"> extend these measures</a> and make them permanent. </p><p>Whether one agrees with the truckers or not, it is very obvious that using financial censorship to resolve domestic dissent is a terrible precedent to set.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NTY1MTAwMTQ3ODQ0NzE4/the-matrix.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>On the flip side the weaknesses of State-controlled money were exposed in full view for all to see. This incident was the best Bitcoin commercial ever made, as it simultaneously showed the weaknesses of centralized financial platforms while proving the utility of a decentralized currency like bitcoin. </p><p>At the stroke of a pen, thousands of people were denied access to their own money and it was all “perfectly legal.” The message was clear; reliance on a centralized financial system that is biased is very risky. By applying pressure on this one choke point, the expression of other freedoms is also curtailed, whether it’s freedom of expression or freedom of movement as they all contingent on one’s ability to transact. One of the truckers<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUYNDBRHvwE"> described how</a> his personal and business accounts were shut down. The business in question wasn’t connected in any way with trucking, politics, protests or the Freedom Convoy, but its bank account was still shut down by the Canadian government and this has completely crippled the owner’s ability to make a living.</p><p>Following the action taken by GoFundMe, a Bitcoin fundraising campaign dubbed “Honk Honk Hodl” was started on Twitter<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/freedom-convoy-cryptocurrency-asset-seizure-1.6389601"> with the intention</a> of raising 21 bitcoin (worth approximately $1,100,000 at the time) for the truckers and they successfully raised <a href="https://financialpost.com/fp-finance/cryptocurrency/behind-honkhonk-hodl-the-story-of-the-trucker-convoys-bitcoin-team-lead">more than 14 bitcoin</a>. In response to this, the government<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/16/canada-sanctions-34-crypto-wallets-tied-to-trucker-freedom-convoy/"> extended the ban</a> to include bitcoin and other cryptocurrency donations and pressured cryptocurrency exchanges to freeze the accounts of anyone involved in funding the truckers as well as to share their personal information with the State. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice<a href="https://ottawaconvoyclassaction.ca/order-mareva.pdf"> ordered</a> self-custody wallet provider Nunchuk<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/18/private-lawsuit-freezes-canadian-freedom-convoy-crypto-fundraising/"> to disclose user information</a> and freeze Bitcoin wallets of its users in accordance with the government decree. The<a href="https://twitter.com/nunchuk_io/status/1494885897577271299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1494885897577271299%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ffinbold.com%2Fbitcoin-wallet-rejects-canadas-court-demand-to-freeze-funds-citin"> official response</a> from Nunchuk was as follows:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Once again, Bitcoin’s censorship resistance passed the test, and Nunchuk’s response not only highlights the importance of owning money that cannot be seized or censored, but of self custody as well.</p><p>Not to be outdone, the Iranian regime took a page out of the Canadian government’s playbook of using financial censorship as a weapon to crush dissent amongst its citizens when they issued a<a href="https://www.kitco.com/news/2022-12-07/No-hijab-no-banking-Iran-ups-the-ante-on-anti-hijab-protestors.html"> decree</a> that will enable the state to freeze the bank accounts of women that will not wear a hijab. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/17/iran-protests-death-kurdish-woman-mahsaa-amini-morality-police">Protests have been going on in Iran since September 17</a>, when Mahsa Amini, an Iranian woman, was arrested by the morality police for not wearing a hijab and later died under dubious circumstances at a Tehran hospital. The case for Bitcoin, a censorship resistant form of money, has never been stronger.</p><p>It’s against this background that I am convinced that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are a threat to individual liberty and financial sovereignty as they endow the state with the ability to financially censor anyone, for any reason at the push of a button, without due process. In a CBDC world, a protest such as the Freedom Convoy would probably not have happened. This is why it’s a matter of great concern that <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap125.pdf">nine out of 10</a> of the world’s central banks are currently actively working on launching their own CBDCs. Furthermore, according to<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap125.pdf"> a report</a> released by the Bank for International Settlements in May this year, “the growth of cryptoassets and stablecoins'<em> </em>is the main reason that the majority of these central banks are actively pursuing CBDCs. </p><p>In other words, the censors’ top priority is to neuter Bitcoin and stablecoins since they neither want to lose their power to print money ad infinitum nor to loosen their grip on the scepter of financial censorship.</p><p>This explains why the Nigerian central bank<a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2022/CCD/RevisedCashWithdrawal.pdf"> issued an edict</a> on December 6, that capped ATM withdrawals at a maximum of $45 a day and $225 a week in a bid to coerce more people to use the eNaira, the country’s CBDC. After experiencing<a href="https://qz.com/africa/1922466/how-bitcoin-powered-nigerias-endsars-protests"> similar financial censorship</a> to the truckers in 2020 during the anti-police brutality<a href="https://www.africanews.com/2022/10/21/nigeria-police-use-tear-gas-on-anniversary-of-fatal-protest//"> “End Sars” protests</a>, Nigerians are definitely not keen on signing up for CBDC induced digital serfdom. As a result adoption of the eNaira has been dismal to say the least, with<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-25/shunned-digital-currency-looks-for-street-credibility-in-nigeria?sref=323RPL5z"> only 0.5%</a> of the country’s 217 million citizens having used it since its launch in October 2021. The Nigerian central bank’s draconian measures to promote the eNaira by declaring war on cash will just serve to strengthen Bitcoin’s appeal and adoption is likely going to keep rising. Having said that, I wouldn’t be surprised to see in the coming year more measures of this sort being implemented by central banks as they “promote” their CBDCs.</p><h2>Censorship-Resistant Design</h2><blockquote><p>“When we can secure the most important functionality of a financial network by computer science rather than by the traditional accountants, regulators, investigators, police, and lawyers, we go from a system that is manual, local, and of inconsistent security to one that is automated, global, and much more secure.”</p><p>–<a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability/">Nick Szabo</a></p></blockquote><p>Bitcoin is a global, fully-decentralized, trustless, permissionless, non-sovereign and censorship-resistant form of money. It exists beyond the control of the State or any corporation and functions perfectly without the need for coordination by any centralized third parties. Of the many attributes of Bitcoin, censorship resistance remains one of the most unappreciated yet very important in this age of pervasive surveillance and financial censorship.</p><p>Censorship resistance is the ability of a currency to be stored and transacted, unhindered and unencumbered. Censorship-resistant money is immune to confiscation, freezing or interception by any third party. Anyone can access Bitcoin because it’s permissionless and, as it scales, it becomes more decentralized and therefore harder to censor. </p><p>Valid transactions that are processed on the Bitcoin network are uncensorable and no third party can block them or blacklist a wallet address. Users are protected from asset seizures by the state or freezing by private corporations — in short, it is neutral money that is governed by rules and not rulers. If WikiLeaks had been receiving donations via Bitcoin from day one, the financial blockade it experienced would have meant nothing.</p><p>The Bitcoin architecture is by design built to be censorship resistant as this ensures that no arbitrary changes to its monetary policy or to the protocol itself can be made unilaterally, thus guaranteeing the stability and integrity of the network. Without this attribute in place, what would be the guarantee that the maximum supply cap of 21 million bitcoin will not be increased unilaterally in future? </p><p>As Parker Lewis aptly<a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-is-not-for-criminals/"> puts it</a>, “Censorship resistance reinforces scarcity and scarcity reinforces censorship resistance.”<em> </em>Bitcoin’s absolute scarcity is the foundation for every financial incentive that makes the Bitcoin network functional and valuable; thus, without censorship resistance built in, the entire system is compromised.</p><p>Contrast this with the current fiat system and its various payment rails that have terms of service that can be changed at the drop of a hat by a committee or due to pressure from social justice warriors as well as the State. An example that comes to mind would be PayPal’s <a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/p/paypals-indymedia-wipeout?s=r">deplatforming</a> of alternative media sites, Consortium News and Mint Publishing, for publishing stories that were critical of the “official narrative” with regards to Western support of Ukraine. PayPal didn’t stop there, in September of this year, it also simultaneously <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/09/21/paypal-shuts-account-parents-group-campaigned-keep-schools-open/">shut down</a> the accounts of the Free Speech Union and “UsforThemUK” (a parents group opposed to locking down schools during the pandemic) due to the “nature of its activities.” This was done with no prior warning, or clear explanation and it was unable to withdraw the thousands of pounds’ worth of donations that were still in its account. </p><p>Other organizations that were added to PayPal’s blacklist this year include: <a href="https://dailysceptic.org/">The Daily Sceptic</a>; the<a href="https://www.ukmedfreedom.org/"> U.K. Medical Freedom Alliance</a>; <a href="https://laworfiction.com/"> Law Or Fiction</a>, a website that educates citizens on their rights and how they have been affected by the British government’s response to COVID-19; and <a href="https://www.momsforliberty.org/">Moms For Liberty</a>, to name just a few. These organizations will soon realize that the solution to the predicament of financial censorship is the adoption of a Bitcoin standard, where no entity, no matter how powerful, can censor their transactions.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>The Rise Of Financial Restrictions</h2><blockquote><p>“Liberty once lost, is lost forever.”</p><p>–<a href="https://www.masshist.org/digitaladams/archive/doc?id=L17750707ja#:~:text=Liberty%20once%20lost%20is%20lost,they%20can%20never%20regain%20it.">John Adams</a></p></blockquote><p>On August 8, the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916">sanctioned</a> Tornado Cash (TC), an Ethereum <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/cryptocurrency-mixers/">smart contract mixer</a>, and <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916">added it to the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List</a>. According to OFAC, TC was allegedly used to launder cryptocurrency worth $455 million that was hacked by the North Korean government-backed hacker organization the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_Group"> Lazarus group</a>. According to the<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7b6b7513-8b57-4582-9c98-82c48f756f94"> Financial Times,</a> a senior, unnamed Treasury official commenting on the sanction of TC said:</p><blockquote><p>“‘We do believe that this action will send a really critical message to the private sector about the risks associated with mixers writ large,’ adding that it was ‘designed to inhibit Tornado Cash or any sort of reconstituted versions of it to continue to operate. Today’s action is the second action by Treasury against a mixer, but it will not be our last.’”</p></blockquote><p>This is clearly a warning that the State intends to continue tightening the screws on financial privacy tools and will not hesitate to blacklist any insufficiently-decentralized protocols. This action by OFAC of sanctioning an open-source protocol sets a precedent that indirectly outlaws financial privacy. This further breeds uncertainty within the open-source community, as developers may be prosecuted for writing code, should it be deployed by criminals later on. </p><p>As if on cue, four days after TC was sanctioned, one of TC’s contributing developers, Alex Pertsev, <a href="https://www.fiod.nl/arrest-of-suspected-developer-of-tornado-cash/">was arrested</a> by Dutch authorities on allegations of money laundering. Apart from being a contributor to TC’s code, no concrete evidence has been disclosed yet that ties Pertsev to the laundered funds, nor have any official charges against him been made, yet he remains in pre-trial detention.</p><p>Following a recent hearing, he was<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/22/tornado-cash-developer-alexey-pertsev-to-remain-in-jail-until-at-least-late-februrary/"> remanded </a>in custody until February 20, 2023, pending investigation as the court deemed him to be a flight risk. It remains to be seen how this case will turn out, but as one of the biggest crypto-related cases to reach a court of law, the outcome of it will set a precedent within the EU that could negatively affect the Bitcoin ecosystem in the region, particularly where financial privacy is concerned. This is the slippery slope that we find ourselves on, where the slow creep against financial privacy is another tactic that censors are using to protect their powers.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>OFAC’s tentacles have also extended to Ethereum, which is gradually getting<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/flashbots-build-over-82-relay-blocks-adding-to-ethereum-centralization"> more centralized</a> and less censorship resistant due to OFAC compliance as<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/flashbots-build-over-82-relay-blocks-adding-to-ethereum-centralization"> MEV-boost relays </a>become more and more dominant. Following the long awaited merge upgrade in September that transitioned Ethereum to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism,<a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1570339602346684416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1570339602346684416%7Ctwgr%5E259c919ab035e9fbd1511f4607a6eaf0636146dd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fflashbots-build-over-82-relay-blocks-adding-to-ethereum-centralization"> data by Santiment</a> indicates that 46.15% of Ethereum’s PoS nodes are controlled by just two addresses that belong to Coinbase and Lido. MEV-boost relays are also centralized entities that function as a bridge between block producers and block builders, giving all Ethereum PoS validators the option to outsource block production to third parties. As a result of this centralization, OFAC-compliant blocks came into existence, where it’s possible to censor certain transactions; like those from blacklisted TC addresses and any other sanctioned wallet addresses as designated by OFAC.</p><p>To put things in perspective, as of December 19, 2022, the production of OFAC-compliant blocks on a daily basis stands <a href="https://www.mevwatch.info/">at 72%, </a>up from 51% in October. While the possibility exists for sanctioned transactions to make it onto the Ethereum blockchain as things currently stand, this will become a rarity as more validators (and relays) will likely opt to exclude those transactions. </p><p>In case you weren’t paying attention, this is one of the biggest reasons why calls for Bitcoin to<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-29/greenpeace-crypto-billionaire-lobby-to-change-bitcoin-s-code"> “change the code”</a> and transition to PoS keep getting louder. The censors know that Bitcoin as it exists today is censorship resistant, largely due to proof of work, and in a bid to seize control of it at a protocol level, the attacks to force such a change are going to intensify in the years to come.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In an op-ed piece titled,<a href="https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/get-ready-for-the-no-buy-list?s=r"> “Get Ready For The 'No-Buy' List,”</a><em> </em>David Sacks, the founding COO of PayPal, wrote:</p><blockquote><p>“Kicking people off social media deprives them of the right to speak in our increasingly online world. Locking them out of the financial economy is worse: It deprives them of the right to make a living. We have seen how cancel culture can obliterate one’s ability to earn an income, but now the canceled may find themselves without a way to pay for goods and services. Previously, canceled employees who would never again have the opportunity to work for a Fortune 500 company at least had the option to go into business for themselves. But if they cannot purchase equipment, pay employees, or receive payment from clients and customers, that door closes on them, too.”</p></blockquote><p>This observation is 100% accurate and mirrors the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/china-social-credit-system-punishments-and-rewards-explained-2018-4">Chinese social credit system</a>, which is a harbinger of a soon-to-be-global trend, especially as the wave of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/stakeholder-capitalism-4774323">stakeholder capitalism</a> sweeping the private sector intensifies. </p><p>The term “stakeholder capitalism” is a euphemism for fascism and is used to control private companies through “woke'' economic metrics like environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores. Adherence to woke capitalism is then indirectly forced upon the customers of the companies in question, with dissent being punished by denial of services or even financial penalties. PayPal once again surfaces as a textbook example of this. In September, it announced a policy through which it intended <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/10/10/paypal-users-fine-misinformation-aup-error-confusion/">to fine users $2,500 </a>for sharing “misinformation” online. Last time I checked, PayPal was neither a content moderation platform nor a social media company. </p><p>Following a social media backlash against this proposed policy, PayPal then<a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/paypal-reverses-course-says-company-will-not-seize-money-for-promoting-misinformation_4783827.html"> issued a statement</a> citing that the policy was put out erroneously and as a result would not be implemented. Well, three weeks after backtracking on this policy, PayPal<a href="https://techstartups.com/2022/10/27/paypal-reinstates-policy-take-2500-account-spread-misinformation/"> re-introduced the $2,500 fine</a> in its newly-updated policy. The $2,500 fine was quietly added to its terms of service after the social media driven furor against it had disappeared. As if that’s not enough, PayPal <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full?locale.x=en_US#restricted-activities">added a clause</a> that allows it to “freeze” <em>all</em> the money in your accounts for up to six months, “if reasonably needed to protect against the risk of liability or if you have violated our Acceptable Use Policy.”</p><p>What we are witnessing is the gradual roll out of a Chinese Communist Party style social credit system. Take this as an early warning, especially in this era where<a href="https://future.a16z.com/software-is-eating-the-world/"> “software is eating the world”</a> and everything from banking to shopping has migrated to digital platforms.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Escaping Sanctions</h2><blockquote><p>“Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce.”</p><p>–<a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/james_a_garfield_136333#:~:text=Garfield%20Quotes&amp;text=Whoever%20controls%20the%20volume%20of%20money%20in%20any%20country%20is,of%20all%20industry%20and%20commerce.">James A. Garfield</a></p></blockquote><p>Financial censorship is not exclusive to individuals and organizations but it is also extended to countries in the form of sanctions. They are also preferred as an acceptable alternative to military conflict since they are an avenue for non-kinetic power projection and are thus weapons of economic warfare. </p><p>The goal of economic sanctions is to impoverish and sicken the civilians of the sanctioned nation with the intention of pressuring the government of the sanctioned country into compliance in its hopes of avoiding civil unrest. Unfortunately, this hardly happens and as a result it’s the ordinary citizens that bear the brunt of sanctions and not the targeted politicians.</p><p>Economic sanctions are enabled by the centralized nature of the financial infrastructure of the fiat monetary system which is mainly controlled by the U.S. and the EU. One of the economic warfare tools in their arsenal is the SWIFT network. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWIFT">SWIFT is an international bank messaging system</a> which has been operational since the 1970s that enables the transmission of almost<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/Appendix_D.pdf"> $5 trillion globally</a> every day. This system enables financial institutions to send and receive information about financial transactions in a secure, standardized environment.</p><p>Since the dollar is the global reserve currency, SWIFT facilitates the international dollar system. Although SWIFT is headquartered in Belgium, dollar dominance gives the U.S. a great deal of leverage over other countries. As a result of this dominance, the U.S. is able to use SWIFT as a financial weapon against nation states like Russia and Iran that violate<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_international_order"> “the rules based order.”</a> Deplatforming or removing a country from SWIFT is basically cutting it off economically from trading with the rest of the world.</p><p>In stark contrast to this, Bitcoin is a fully-decentralized digital currency and peer-to-peer payments system that is not under the control of any nation state. According to a report titled, “<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Treasury-2021-sanctions-review.pdf">The Treasury 2021 Sanctions Review</a>” by the U.S. Treasury Department, between 2001 and 2021 the number of sanctions that were imposed by the U.S. Treasury had increased by a whopping<a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/no-surprises-but-fascinating-statistics-7929959/"> 933%!</a> In a world of increasing weaponization of the dollar and centralized financial infrastructure, nation state adoption of Bitcoin is a matter of national security. </p><p>In his article titled,<a href="https://balajis.com/why-india-should-buy-bitcoin/"> “Why India Should Buy Bitcoin,”</a> Balaji Srinivasan made the following remark:</p><blockquote><p>“It is this property (referring to Bitcoin’s decentralization) that makes Bitcoin so precious for safeguarding Indian national security. A network that cannot be shut down by any state is a network that India and its diaspora can rely upon in times of conflict. For the same reason that Germany recently repatriated<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-repatriates-gold-reserves-ahead-of-schedule/a-40208045"> 3,378 tons of gold</a> from the United States, India should prioritize national support for digital gold as a financial rail of last resort in a situation like the 2008 financial crisis or the 2020 COVID crash…Remember also that India has had a multi-millennia long<a href="https://mises.org/library/gold-indias-capital-asset-through-history"> love</a><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-29720925"> affair</a><a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/-1830717.html"> with</a><a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2013/11/20/why-do-indians-love-gold"> gold</a>, and is the world's largest<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/gold-imports-dip-14-23-to-28-2-billion-during-2019-20/articleshow/75167104.cms?from=mdr"> importer of gold</a>. Gold was never a threat to India; gold has always been an asset for India. And Bitcoin is valuable for all the same reasons<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/millennials-twice-likely-buy-bitcoin-221520470.html"> gold is valuable</a>. It’s an internationally accepted store of value, it's highly scarce, and it's a so-called<a href="https://hackernoon.com/cryptocurrencies-future-bearer-instruments-of-choice-31494e34257e"> bearer instrument</a> that can't be seized with a keypress.”</p></blockquote><p>I would also add that Bitcoin adoption at the nation state level is a shield against being deplatformed from financial payment rails like SWIFT. Sanctions have downstream ripple effects that negatively affect everyone tied to a particular country, industry or company that would have been sanctioned. Bitcoin’s censorship resistance shields the citizens of a sanctioned country from the crippling effects of sanctions, and insulates an entire nation’s economy from being unjustifiably attacked. By leveraging off of Bitcoin’s decentralization and censorship resistance people living in sanctioned countries are able to use it in lieu of the dollar for trade and an alternative payments rail to SWIFT.</p><p>In late February, the EU along with the U.S., Australia, Canada and Japan<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-26/u-s-weighs-sanctions-on-russia-s-central-bank-over-ukraine?srnd=premium&amp;sref=PqmVp1JY"> agreed to disconnect</a> some Russian banks from the SWIFT network as part of restrictive measures meant to prevent the Russian central bank from circumventing sanctions that had been imposed on Russia as a result of its “military operation” in Ukraine. In a bid to pile more pressure on Russia to cease its “military operation,” Western powers seized Russia’s $640 billion worth of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/02/26/russia-central-bank-white-house/">foreign currency reserves</a>.</p><p>The implications of this unprecedented move are much bigger than the deplatforming from SWIFT but in my opinion this was the death knell for the risk-free status of U.S. treasuries, which central banks around the world hold. Not only is the entire premise of holding reserves nullified but this action has also proven that a sovereign country’s reserves can be confiscated at the drop of a hat. What had previously been regarded as safe and risk-free assets became risk free no more as non-existent credit risk was replaced by very real confiscation risk. What good are reserves that you can’t access when you need them?</p><p>To quote a remark from an article in the<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/if-currency-reserves-arent-really-money-the-world-is-in-for-a-shock-11646311306"> Wall Street Journal</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Barring gold, these assets (i.e. forex reserves) are someone else’s liability—someone who can just decide they are worth nothing…If currency balances were to become worthless computer entries and didn’t guarantee buying essential stuff, Moscow would be rational to stop accumulating them and stockpile physical wealth in oil barrels, rather than sell them to the West.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The financial censorship of Russia may seem justified today, but is there any guarantee that the weaponization of the financial system will not be abused in future? Every country that doesn’t want to become vulnerable to “denial-of-service attacks” will need to hold bitcoin in its treasury as a matter of national security. This also includes countries that aren’t sanctioned as they still need to diversify and limit their geopolitical risk in a vastly-polarized world. The same also holds true for individual citizens as they are the collateral damage when economic warfare is unleashed on their countries.</p><p> A nation cannot be truly sovereign if its financial destiny is controlled by another nation. The risk of being deplatformed from the current dollar-based fiat monetary system either via SWIFT, the IMF or private companies like PayPal continues to grow each day, both for nation states and individuals alike. While the IMF or SWIFT aren’t institutions that deal directly with the public, they do have great influence on the financial well being of a country. Great consideration needs to be made when deciding which assets to acquire in order to maintain individual sovereignty and defend your freedom to transact in the face of an attack. Bitcoin is currently the only financial asset that can be used as a defense against financial censorship at an individual level as well as at a nation state level.</p><p>Had the Russian central bank's reserves been in bitcoin, no nation would have had the ability to arbitrarily freeze or seize them. On the flip side, this event may be the dollar system’s Waterloo and could lead to rapid de-dollarization by countries seeking to reduce their vulnerability to the U.S.’s control. </p><h2>Attacks On Bitcoin Will Increase In 2023</h2><blockquote><p>“A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990’s. I hope it’s obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we’re trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system.”</p><p>–<a href="https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/quotes/cryptocurrency/">Satoshi Nakamoto</a></p></blockquote><p>In conclusion, as the curtain comes down on 2022, it’s clear from the few examples that we explored in this essay that financial censorship is a huge problem of great concern given its increased usage with no signs of slowing down. </p><p>Financial censorship will continue to be one of the most-preferred levers that the state, big tech and bankers will use to silence critics as well as to force compliance with authoritarian policies. As the relationship between the state and “private sector” players gets cozier with regards to financial censorship, our society will continue its slow creep toward a dystopian digital feudalistic future. </p><p>The censors are not ignoring Bitcoin anymore and are taking active steps to capture it and/or restrict its usage as much as possible. Senator Warren’s<a href="https://decrypt.co/117221/senator-warren-crypto-bill-kyc-self-custody-wallets"> Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering bill</a> along with the EU’s<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/02/analyzing-whats-next-for-europes-markets-in-crypto-assets-law/"> Markets In Crypto Assets law (MiCA)</a> are two examples of ongoing attempts at regulatory capture, where the low-hanging fruit of fiat on/off ramps are the initial targets. Given everything that transpired this year, it would be naive to expect the state and its private sector allies to abandon their plans to destroy Bitcoin in the coming year.</p><p>That said, there is plenty of light at the end of the tunnel. With each attack that the State throws at Bitcoin, the network gets more resilient and stronger. Every attempt at banning Bitcoin, or destroying it, or financially censoring dissenters will have the opposite effect of further substantiating the reason for Bitcoin’s existence. These “free marketing campaigns'' will drive home the importance of decentralization and censorship resistance in a more effective way. </p><p>The centralized nature of the fiat monetary system and its dependency on trusted third parties is both its strength (as this is how financial censorship is enforced) and its Achilles heel (as this is what Bitcoin dematerialized). In the coming year, as more people get canceled financially, it’s incumbent upon us to build more user-friendly tools that enhance financial privacy, develop Bitcoin circular economies and more Bitcoin-focused educational content. Reducing the Bitcoin learning curve, coupled with enhanced financial privacy and thriving Bitcoin circular economies, will be a great bulwark against attacks from the censors.</p><p>In a February 1995<a href="https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1995/02/msg00508.html"> email,</a> Wei Dai, the cryptographer who invented<a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/b-money/"> B-Money,</a> which was referenced in the<a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"> Bitcoin white paper</a>, perfectly captured the spirit of the above solution when he wrote the following:</p><blockquote><p>“There has never been a government that didn't sooner or later try to reduce the freedom of its subjects and gain more control over them, and there probably never will be one. Therefore, instead of trying to convince our current government not to try, we'll develop the technology that will make it impossible for the government to succeed. Efforts to influence the government (e.g., lobbying and propaganda) are important only in so far as to delay its attempted crackdown long enough for the technology to mature and come into wide use. But even if you do not believe the above is true, think about it this way: If you have a certain amount of time to spend on advancing the cause of greater personal privacy, can you do it better by using the time to learn about cryptography and develop the tools to protect privacy, or by convincing your government not to invade your privacy?”</p></blockquote><p>Bitcoin’s censorship resistance presents a viable option to both individuals and countries alike to withstand financial deplatforming and maintain sovereignty as well as neutrality in a highly-polarized and cancel-culture driven world. Despite the prevailing bear market, Bitcoin’s censorship resistance remains unchanged. Having a Bitcoin “insurance fund” is the most prudent thing one can do. </p><p>As Satoshi Nakamoto <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-writings-of-satoshi-f4d86e94694f#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%20might%20make%20sense%20just,a%20self%2Dfulfilling%20prophecy.%E2%80%9D">wrote</a>, “It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on.”</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Kudzai Kutukwa.

Although I am not a prophet, it was clear to me that this would be a critical time for Bitcoin. When the bear market hit this year, we saw a "cleansing" of the Bitcoin ecosystem and an opportunity to refocus on its main mission of monetary freedom.</p><p>The snowball started in the heat of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/celsius-bankruptcy-judge-orders-return-some-crypto-assets-customers-2022-12-07/">July with the Celsius bankruptcy</a>, which was the first sign that the ecosystem we were building was not healthy. The fact that we were using a decentralized currency to mirror the centralized financial system did not match the vision for Bitcoin.</p><p>This once again highlighted the existence of two alternate and diverging realities for Bitcoin: "real" Bitcoin, which is rising from the bottom up and focuses on the value Bitcoin can bring to the world, and "regulated" Bitcoin, which is focused on price and committed to regulatory systems and adoption through speculation.</p><p>I <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-exchange-coincorner-acquires-coinfloor-customer-base-domain">sold Coinfloor in 2021</a> because I realized that exchanges like ours were too often dedicated to keeping their users trapped in regulated Bitcoin land. As we near the end of 2022, the negative effects of this have been painfully demonstrated by the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">collapse of FTX</a>, the regulatory fallout and the losses incurred by so many innocent people.</p><p>On the other hand, real Bitcoin is flourishing in the Global South and post-Soviet regions, where innovation is addressing the narrative that Bitcoin has no good use cases. For instance, a new version of <a href="https://twitter.com/obi/status/1602719065394626561?s=20&amp;t=Q3N3roPSGa5IRrFRNrmC2g">frontier towns</a> is emerging, combining renewable energy, Bitcoin mining, internet connectivity and community custody. As I have long suspected, real Bitcoin adoption can only come from the people, and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/fediment-evolution-of-bitcoin-custody">Fedimint</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/fedi-global-bitcoin-adoption-tech">Fedi</a> seek to be key in achieving hyperbitcoinization. The world will experience the most primitive form of protection — humans united — translated and turbocharged through the highest technology.</p><p>In the coming years, communities will play a crucial role in defining the path for Bitcoin. Bitcoiners are already empowering communities around the globe, but it is vital that our global community also stays united to win this battle. As I predicted in my 2020 post, we will certainly succeed in this endeavor and so <a href="https://twitter.com/obi/status/1603395290198904843?s=20&amp;t=70xvNHh_VdPiZBIvaxhh-g">I am more convinced than ever that Bitcoin will win in 2023</a>.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Obi Nwosu.

We’re at a turning point. It is clear that Bitcoin is starting to cut the dead weight of speculation. All eyes are on us and it’s our responsibility to educate people and governments about why Bitcoin has real-life use cases that will allow money to flow freely and include billions more into the global economy. I’m ready to onboard the next billion Bitcoiners.</p><p>Here are my 2022 takeaways and predictions for 2023:</p><h2>The Global South Will Continue To Lead Bitcoin Adoption</h2><p>I just came back from the<a href="https://www.afrobitcoin.org/"> Africa Bitcoin Conference</a> in Ghana — an inspirational event bringing together pan-Africa and international leaders to talk about Bitcoin’s purpose over its price (thank you <a href="https://www.afrobitcoin.org/about-us">Farida Nabourema</a>!). As a legacy for the event, our team at<a href="https://www.builtwithbitcoin.org/"> the Built With Bitcoin Foundation</a> opened the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/built-with-bitcoin-opens-bitcoin-technology-center-in-ghana">Bitcoin Technology Center (BTC), a learning and training center in Kumasi, Ghana</a> — which is set to educate 400 people in its first year. </p><p>This trip reenergized my hope for the future. Even in a bear market, trade volume in Africa continues to press forward. Looking at our volume on Paxful, we predict further increases in both Ghana and Nigeria for 2023. Why? We’re still seeing growth in Africa because of the necessity for Bitcoin on the continent — it offers a cheaper and more efficient solution for people to send money back home, make payments and preserve their wealth. And that does not go away because of market conditions. I expect Africa to continue to lead the way heading into the next year. </p><h2>The Divide Between Bitcoin And The Rest Will Grow</h2><p>Bitcoin is backed by human work and has proven its utility beyond the West’s obsession with speculation. It has the ability to bank the unbanked and finally shift the tides of economic apartheid — Bitcoin’s impact cannot be overstated. The bulk of “cryptos” are for wild speculation and investing, relying on the morals of these shady authorities. </p><p>As we’ve seen with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">FTX</a>, people’s life savings can be demolished when there is only a single point of failure. This narrative is the same game the banks have been running for centuries. I’m not buying it. Next year, we will see more Bitcoin-only companies and conferences as the Bitcoin community works to clean up the mess of misinformation caused by these bad actors.</p><h2>Governments Need A Rethink</h2><p>Smart regulation fosters safety, but poor- or overregulation stifles innovation and growth. We need to strike a balance and that comes with education. My hope for next year is that more Bitcoin companies come together to share why Bitcoin cannot and should not be regulated as you would, for example, stocks or wheat futures. </p><p>It’s our responsibility to also advocate for transparency — like requiring companies to share their proof of reserves. Without this, we’re going to see more far-reaching regulation like the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/sen-warren-unconstitutional-crypto-bill">Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act</a>, which pegs more consumer surveillance as the savior and touts Western Union as an example to lead the industry. We know how that narrative will play out... </p><h2>‘Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins’ Will Get Louder </h2><p>The trust of the people was tested this year and I don’t blame them for shying away. Life savings were destroyed because of despicable morals and we need to earn back that trust. This is why I<a href="https://paxful.com/university/why-you-should-hold-own-bitcoin/"> advocate</a> for decentralization and for users to self custody their savings. </p><p>Using a non-custodial wallet means that users are their own banks, managing their own money and controlling the future of their own finances. In 2023, we’ll see more of a narrative and product push around self custody. I am already doing my part to amplify this message, including sharing a<a href="https://paxful.com/university/bitcoin-self-custody/"> step-by-step process</a> on how to self custody your bitcoin.</p><h2>Bear Markets Will Build A Stronger Industry</h2><p>I am a natural builder and I have gone back to my roots this year. I’ve come to realize that we are not building products for how people live their daily lives in the Global South. There is too much focus on the unrealistic dream of minting millionaires and not enough around the pain points that keeps billions of people enclosed in economic apartheid. Next year, you will see more products that cater to the true needs of everyday people and offer them solutions for remittance, payments, e-commerce, wealth preservation and basic communication. </p><p>Bitcoiners, 2023 is looking brighter than ever.

Every year millions of Americans save between <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/travel/medical-tourism-coronavirus-pandemic.html">40-80% in medical fees</a> by crossing the border or taking a short plane ride to receive the care they need. Even after the pandemic slowed international travel, more people looked abroad for shorter wait times, better service, and lower fees. </p><p>Bitcoin can boost the medical tourism sector and help patients get the treatment they need at a price that is affordable. Bitcoin can make transactions abroad easier and ensure that everyone gets a fair deal. </p><h2>Medical Tourism</h2><p>Medical tourism has a bad reputation. It’s commonly associated with experimental treatments, suspicious surgeons, and concerning cosmetic procedures. However, these issues are largely overplayed and overstated. For millions, medical tourism is a lifeline that helps folks get the treatment they need at a price they can afford. </p><p>The <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism">CDC defines medical tourism</a> as the practice of traveling to another country for medical care. Common medical tourism destinations include Canada, as well as countries in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. </p><p>The CDC does warn that medical tourism carries risks. Flying shortly after surgery increases the patient’s risk of deep vein thrombosis. Medical tourists may be exposed to bacterial infection due to a lack of immunity and should research any care providers thoroughly before going through with treatment. </p><p>People elect to travel abroad for many different treatments. However, medical treatments are particularly popular for treatments that have <a href="https://sanantonio-lasik.com/cataracts/how-soon-after-cataract-surgery-can-you-drive/">shorter recovery times like cataract surgery</a>. People who have cataract surgery can usually drive the day after treatment, so negotiating an airport shouldn’t be an issue. </p><p>Patients who are considering medical tourism should consult with their primary care provider before moving forward. The primary provider has a complete medical history and will know whether or not a procedure is viable. They’ll also be able to arrange follow-up care when patients arrive home. </p><h2>Transactions Abroad</h2><p>Bitcoin transactions may be particularly important in the future, as the U.S. medical economy appears to be set for a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/us-economy-medical-debt-black-swan-event">black swan event</a> following the pandemic. Trillions of dollars of medical debt have accumulated in the U.S., which may push folks to seek better service and lower costs abroad. </p><p>Medical debt is a serious issue in the U.S., though most people can <a href="https://www.nationaldebtrelief.com/proactive-ways-to-avoid-medical-debt/">avoid medical debt</a> by researching billing codes and negotiating a payment plan that works for them. This may involve negotiations with partial payments in bitcoin, too. </p><p>Bitcoin has the potential to make medical tourism more affordable for all. This can close the care gap, and ensures that everyone has access to high-quality, reliable medical care. </p><p>This sentiment is echoed by Renée-Marie Stephano, CEO of Global Healthcare Resources and the Medical Tourism Association. Stephano <a href="https://www.magazine.medicaltourism.com/article/cryptocurrency-medical-tourism">notes</a> that there has been a “sharp uptick in the utilization of cryptocurrency” to pay for medical treatment abroad.</p><p>Decentralized currencies like bitcoin return power to the patient and make it easier for patients to pay for their treatment. Bitcoin can help patients avoid issues with currency conversions and international payments. Bitcoin payments to clinics are fast and come with minimal charges compared with traditional transactions. </p><p>Providers who accept bitcoin find that the process is easy and can be quickly converted to national currencies. Ken Fryer, a spokesperson for Vinci Hair Clinic in the United Kingdom, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/hair_clinics_in_london_spain_dubai_and_brazil_accepting_bitcoins">admitted</a> that their clinic had to cancel previous treatments for international patients due to issues with fund transfers and banking restrictions. </p><p>Fryer says that Bitcoin solved these issues and gave patients the ability to pay quickly in large sums if needed. </p><h2>Countries Accepting Bitcoin For Medical Tourism</h2><p>Medical tourism often occurs in less economically developed countries (LEDC). Bitcoin can help these nations close the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-opening-to-financial-inclusion">wealth inequality gap</a> by encouraging a fair, free-flowing exchange of funds in return for legitimate healthcare services. </p><p>Despite the recent downturn in cryptocurrency markets, Bitcoin utilization remains high in many countries where medical tourism is popular. </p><p>Currently, the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/china-back-among-top-10-crypto-using-countries">top 10 countries for Bitcoin adoption</a> include Brazil, India and Pakistan. Many of these countries are popular <a href="https://shifainternationalpatients.com/blog/medical-tourism-in-2021/">destinations for medical tourism</a>.</p><p>India is a particularly popular destination for medical tourism in Asia. India has a favorable medical visa policy, which allows family members to stay with patients. India also scores highly in Bitcoin adoption and is ranked first in centralized service value received and retail centralized service value received. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Bitcoin has the potential to improve medical tourism and help everyone get the treatment they need. Bitcoin is particularly important in today’s post-pandemic world, where medical bills are spiraling and the U.S. medical sector holds trillions of dollars of debt. </p><p>Bitcoin can be particularly useful when traveling to countries with tricky transfer laws. Treatment can be delayed or even canceled if patients aren’t able to pay on time. Bitcoin can negate this issue, and help everyone get a fair deal. </p><p>Before paying for medical treatment in Bitcoin, patients should consult with their primary care provider to ensure that they get the treatment they need when they return home. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Frankie Wallace.

Around the same time, U.S. President Biden announced the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/biden-imposes-sanctions-on-russia-bitcoin-jumps-to-39k">first tranche of Russian sanctions</a>, blocking five of the biggest Russian banks and freezing all the assets they held in America.
