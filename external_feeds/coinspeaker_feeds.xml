<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/brian-armstrong-old-tweets-twitter/">Brian Armstrong Deletes Tons of Old Tweets but Crypto Twitter Recovers Them</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/brian-armstrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Armstrong</a> recently went on a deletion spree, taking down many of his old tweets on social media app Twitter. Simultaneously, the trusted internet archive The WayBack Machine has also removed all evidence of Armstrong&#8217;s tweets from its archive as well.</p>
<p>These moves have now raised concerns within the crypto community on Twitter even as many continue to read various meanings to the decision.</p>
<p>To this end, the community, led by pro-Bitcoin tweeter @Pledditor, has now launched a hunt to recover the deleted tweets.</p>
<p>According to @Pledditor, the hunt will find links to Brian&#8217;s old tweets via alternative archival services. And while these tweets will be between 2015 and 2018, the new archive will focus only on “tweets with verifiable archive links”, he says.</p>
<h2>Why Did Brian Armstrong Delete Old Tweets?</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the reason behind Armstrong&#8217;s decision to delete his old tweets remains unclear. However, some believe that the decision may be a result of the ongoing regulatory scrutiny that Coinbase is currently facing. That is with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>). And of which, Armstrong&#8217;s intentions may now be questionable.</p>
<p>More so, the tweets recovered so far border around several topics. These topics range from ordinary daily updates about Coinbase to more controversial views on its future and crypto at large.</p>
<p>For example, in one of the recovered tweets, Armstrong suggested a for-profit Bitcoin fork. At another time, he mentioned a 4% ETH pump after Coinbase listed it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it should be noted that Armstrong is not alone when it comes to crypto CEOs becoming unsure about some of their old takes on social media.</p>
<p>Back in November 2022, digital asset information platform, The Tie, put together a <a href="https://twitter.com/TheTieIO/status/1592366871386681344" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">list</a> of all tweets that former FTX chief <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/sam-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> (SBF) deleted.</p>
<p>More recently, Justin Sun’s exchange Poloniex was also found to have taken down several tweets relating to an ‘SEC-focused token’ giveaway. That was after crypto Twitter kicked and raised concerns.</p>
<p>As of publication, the tech mogul is yet to publicly comment on his reasons for the deleting rampage. However, the recovery of his old tweets remains an ongoing project.</p>

<p>The Bank of England’s governor reiterated that fiat currencies will not be replaced by crypto like Bitcoin since they are extremely speculative assets.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-global-currency-boe/">Bitcoin Remains Largely Speculative Asset than Global Currency, Says BoE’s Andrew Bailey</a></p>
<p>The current impasse between the fiat market and the crypto assets industry has undeniably put most central banks, including the Bank of England (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/bank-of-england/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BoE</a>), in an alert mode. Over the years, experts have argued how internet money will prove problematic to tax collection. Furthermore, most <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> holders are long-term, and there are few mechanisms to tax unrealized profits in the industry. Additionally, the ability to self-custody in the cryptocurrency market has significantly reduced the need for traditional banks, especially with the emergence of the neo-banking sector.</p>
<p>As a result, the antagonism between the traditional banking sector and the cryptocurrency industry is evidently ongoing, particularly during the cryptocurrency winter. Nonetheless, traditional investment fund managers, led by the largest hedge fund with nearly $10 trillion in AUM, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock Inc</a> (NYSE: BLK) have increased their interest in the cryptocurrency market amid rising global inflation.</p>
<h2>BoE Governor Speaks on Bitcoin and Economic Outlook</h2>
<p>According to BoE Governor Andrew Bailey, the high increase in borrowing cost has undeniably widened the use of Bitcoin as a speculative asset as more investors navigate the high cost of living. The high inflation and a possible economic recession incoming, which has been predicted to happen during the second half of 2023, have seen most investors flee the fiat market to the crypto industry. Currently, the United Kingdom’s inflation stands at about 8.7 percent, more than four times higher than the desired 2 percent.</p>
<p>“Some of that tightening is still to come through the policy pipeline, and we expect underlying inflationary pressures to recede as headline inflation falls,” Bailey <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-10/boe-governor-says-uk-inflation-likely-to-drop-markedly-in-2023" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> in the text on Monday.</p>
<p>Bailey further noted that the energy crisis, which was mostly exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine war, is expected to ease in the coming months. A drop in energy prices is a direct ease in food prices.</p>
<p>“Looking ahead, headline inflation is set to fall markedly over the remainder of the year. This largely owes to lower energy prices as last year’s substantial increases drop out of the annual calculation. Food prices should fall too as lower commodity prices feed through to prices in the shops,” he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bailey criticized the cryptocurrency industry including the stablecoins market for failing to meet the standards of safe money. Worth noting that the Bank of England is actively working on rolling out a Central Bank Digital Currency that operates in a similar manner to the stablecoins. However, some central banks have been criticized for using the digital currency industry to suppress financial freedom.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/arkham-hashing-referral-links/">Arkham Slammed for Using Weak Hashing Method on Referral Links</a></p>
<p>Arkham (ARKM) network, a blockchain data provider that <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-arkham-arkm-launchpad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> its token sale to raise $2.5M on Binance Launchpad, has been <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/238764/arkham-referral-links-appear-to-reveal-user-email-addresses" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">slammed</a> for using weak methods to store users’ private data. After launching its token sale on Binance, Arkham unveiled a program to allow users to invite others for base rewards in ARKM. However, some Twitter Inc. users were quick to spot the weakness in the referral hashing method. Notably, by using a simple decoding tool, like base64decode, anyone can decipher the email of Arkham users sharing their referral links through social media platforms.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Arkham protocol previously responded to the allegations of sharing users’ private information by deeming it a feature of its network. As a result, most crypto users who prefer to have their private information anonymous for their safety were angered by the move to have their private info publicly available.</p>
<p>Notably, all Arkham referral program users who shared their links through the internet have their emails already publicly available. The blockchain data provided puts most users at risk of being attacked through phishing links among other internet-related challenges.</p>

<p>The security weakness in the Arkham protocol raises a lot of questions in the entire network that has taken several months to launch and also get a chance to scale via Binance Launchpad. Although the company claims it is an internal feature, the thought of having private information readily available on the internet is scary to most users in their days and age.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Closer Look at Arkham (ARKM) Protocol</h2>
<p>The Arkham protocol uses artificial intelligence (AI) to deanonymize the blockchain, thus showing users the people and companies behind definite cryptocurrency transactions. Notably, the Arkham network has its own proprietary artificial intelligence engine dubbed ULTRA, to algorithmically match addresses with real-world entities. Through its intel-to-earn program, Arkham introduces an economy that matches buyers and sellers of blockchain data at scale.</p>
<p>The ARKM token is the governance crypto unit used in the Arkham rewards program, particularly on the intel exchange. Moreover, token holders are entitled to governance rights and earn programs through staking.</p>
<p>The Arkham project has attracted significant crypto investors’ attention having raised more than $10 million in two rounds as of July 10. Reportedly, the latest funding round saw the Arkham project valued at approximately $150 million, with strategic backing from Tim Draper, Bedrock Capital, Wintermute Trading, GSR Markets, and the co-founders of Palantir and OpenAI.</p>
<p>However, the company could lose its retail customers due to its poor methods of storing users’ data. Nonetheless, the Arkham protocol has minimal competition in the cryptocurrency industry, thus being able to navigate easily.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/astra-share-price-stock-split/">Astra Space to Boost Share Price via Reverse Stock Split and Raise $65M</a></p>
<p>American spacecraft engine manufacturer <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/astra-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astra Space Inc</a> (NASDAQ: ASTR) intends to do a stock split at a 1-to-15 ratio and raise up to $65 million, according to a Monday <a href="https://investor.astra.com/node/9426/html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">filing</a> with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>).</p>
<p>Per the filing, Astra plans to conduct the reverse stock split latest by October 2. A reverse stock split consolidates existing shares of a company’s stock, resulting in a smaller number of shares. Astra’s 1 for 15 reverse stock split means that every 15 shares a shareholder has will be converted to one. This typically increases the price of the company’s shares.</p>
<p>Like many other companies, Astra is conducting a reverse stock split to improve share prices. In this case, Astra’s decision comes as the company fell below the $1 minimum required to remain in active trading on the Nasdaq exchange.</p>
<p>In March, the Nasdaq gave Astra a deadline to get its share price past $1 or face delisting. At the time, Astra shares had fallen below $1 and remained that way for 30 consecutive business days, contravening the Nasdaq’s trading rules. As the deadline approached, Astra <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/astra-deadline-nasdaq-delisting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requested an extension</a>. The company’s chief financial officer Axel Martinez stated that Astra plans to continue trading on the Nasdaq and was already considering a reverse stock split. Nasdaq eventually <a href="https://parabolicarc.com/2023/04/11/space-spac-index-nasdaq-grants-astra-space-6month-extension-moves-delist-virgin-orbit-stock/#:~:text=Nasdaq%20granted%20Astra%20Space%20a,to%20delist%20Virgin%20Orbit's%20stock." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">granted</a> an extension until October 2, 2023.</p>
<p>MarketWatch data puts ASTR’s 5-day performance at a 4.25% increase. The stock has also climbed 4.42% in 1 month and 5.4% in three months. However, the space company’s stock has lost 7.33% year-to-date (YTD) and over 68% in one year. ASTR is currently at $0.3935 in after-hours trading after losing over 2% of its previous $0.4020 close.</p>
<h2>Astra Stock Split Efforts to Be Supported by Subsidiary</h2>
<p>Astra recently underwent a corporate restructuring that birthed a subsidiary spacecraft engine company. According to a TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/astra-establishes-subsidiary-for-spacecraft-engine-business/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> referencing someone familiar with the matter, Astra Spacecraft Engines, Inc was created for two reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, the subsidiary helps Astra make better operations and financing decisions. According to law, US launch companies must strictly follow the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), which significantly restricts several operations, including hiring. For instance, ITAR requires companies to get a license to hire any non-US person.</p>
<p>On the other hand, spacecraft component businesses operate under Export Administration Regulations (EAR), a set of rules similar to ITAR but more lenient with restrictions for hiring. Astra possibly created the subsidiary to circumvent ITAR restrictions, making it easy for the company to easily hire non-US talent.</p>
<p>Astra may also be making a play at expanding its finance options. For instance, Astra may access a loan against Astra Spacecraft Engines for more funds channeled toward research and development. This financing option is important for Astra, especially since its cash balance is waning. Astra’s cash reserve hit $62.7 million at the end of Q1 and may likely halve by the end of Q2.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-30k-price-investors/">Bitcoin Maintains $30K Price as Investors Await Data on Inflation and Jobless Claims</a></p>
<p>The price of Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) has maintained its level above $30K for a while now, even as it has been swinging. However, market forces heavily threaten the king coin as inflation and unemployment in the US seem unfavorable.</p>
<p>Several conditions may affect the price of Bitcoin in the near future. For instance, the US Federal Reserve recently published hawkish minutes that point to potential rate hikes. As it struggles to fight inflation. The release caused BTC to fall below $31,000 on Thursday, along with a declining global stock market.</p>
<p>According to Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev, not much may happen to Bitcoin, especially in relation to the Federal Reserve’s decision. Trenchev said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“With headline inflation continuing to drift lower while core inflation remains sticky, don’t expect the narrative to change too much when it comes to this month’s Fed meeting.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Currently, these macroeconomic factors may not augur well for Bitcoin. However, a general anticipation of the inflation and unemployment data may keep BTC hovering around $30,000 until Thursday when these data become available.</p>
<p>According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin is trading at $30,163, after falling 1.57% in the past 7 days.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s $30K Is Mild Considering Other Predictions</h2>
<p>Although Bitcoin has lost nearly 3% in the last few days, its 2023 has been commendable. In the last month, BTC has climbed almost 17%, and more than 48% in the last year. Since January, investors have seen an 82.15% increase in the value of their portfolios. Considering its steady rise, there is still a general bullishness in the Bitcoin sentiment.</p>
<p>Multinational banking and treasury services giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/standard-chartered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Standard Chartered</a> released a report on July 10 with a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. According to the report, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/standard-chartered-bitcoin-btc-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC could hit $50,000</a> this year and $120,000 in 2024.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for Standard Chartered’s bullishness, especially for next year, is the upcoming Bitcoin halving. The halving event sees Bitcoin block rewards cut in half &#8211; 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC for next year’s event. The reduction in supply creates scarcity which usually drives Bitcoin’s price.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Standard Chartered initially had a $100,000 prediction for Bitcoin for 2024 December. The bank believed that the crypto winter was over and that Bitcoin would continue its increase and eventually hit $100,000 next month. However, Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick has increased this projection. Kendrick believes that each miner’s “profitability per BTC mined” suggests that a miner can maintain cash inflows and sell less. This reduces Bitcoin’s net supply and increases its price.</p>
<p>Another enthusiastic Bitcoin <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitmex-arthur-hayes-bitcoin-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prediction</a> has come from BitMex co-founder Arthur Hayes who believes the AI boom would benefit Bitcoin. In a recent <a href="https://cryptohayes.substack.com/p/massa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publication</a>, Hayes said Bitcoin could become an artificial intelligence (AI) currency.</p>
<p>Hayes argues that future AI tools may require blockchain-based payment as it would need more than the “analogue banking system [that is] balkanised between geographies and banks themselves”. He then argues that Bitcoin would be the best bet as it is available on a blockchain, censorship-resistant, provably scarce, and has provable longevity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-arkham-arkm-launchpad/">Binance Announces Arkham (ARKM) Token Sale on Its Launchpad</a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> cryptocurrency exchange has announced the 32nd token sale on its Launchpad involving the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ieo/arkham/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arkham</a> (ARKM) project. According to the <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/introducing-the-arkham-arkm-token-sale-on-binance-launchpad-6ad1921b56fb4b369f9cf3e4449e62e2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announcement</a>, 5 percent of the total ARKM supply, amounting to about 50 million units, has been allocated to Binance Launchpad. As a result, each user on the Binance Launchpad is capped at 300k ARKM units or about $15k at a price of around $0.05, as the project aims at raising about $2.5 million from the crypto traders.</p>
<h2>Further Notes on Arkham Binance Token Sale</h2>
<p>Notably, the Arkham (ARKM) token sale on Binance Launchpad is expected to be subscription-based to minimize the chances of insider trading. Additionally, the ARKM token sale on Binance Launchpad will only be in BNB coins. However, the leading centralized exchange has restricted users from several jurisdictions from participating in the ARKM token sale on its Launchpad.</p>
<p>Among the countries mentioned by Binance include: Belarus, Cuba, the Crimea Region, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iran, New Zealand, North Korea, South Sudan, Syria, the United States of America and its territories, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Anyone else from the remaining countries can begin the quest to invest in an early project from July 11 to July 17, when the preparation period will begin. During the ARKM token sale preparation period on Binance Launchpad, the user’s BNB balances will be calculated in hourly snapshots for each day over the past six days. The final average daily BNB balance over the past six days will determine the maximum amount of BNB that a single user can commit in the ARKM token sale.</p>
<p>After the preparation period, users will be required to enter the subscription phase which will be open for 24 hours to eligible users. The ARKM early adopters via Binance Launchpad will have their BNB assets locked until the final distribution period.</p>
<h2>Project Activities</h2>
<p>The Arkham project is focused on deanonymizing blockchain technology through a decentralized token financial system to enable a safe adoption of the crypto market among other reasons. The Binance Launchpad ARKM token sale coincided with the launch of its on-chain intelligence exchange to allow users to trade information regarding blockchain Wallet addresses anonymously, via a smart contract.</p>
<p>Notably, traders on the Arkham Intel Exchange request blockchain intelligence information from the community by placing bounties.</p>
<p>The Arkham bounty hunters can then claim rewards by submitting the requested intel. In a bid to prevent spamming accounts, Arkham has set that all bounty hunters must stake a small amount of ARKM tokens, which will be slashed in the event their submissions are not approved.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-stock-soars-50-sec/">Coinbase (COIN) Stock Soars over 50% amidst SEC Lawsuit Turmoil</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase Global Inc</a> (NASDAQ: COIN), the publicly listed American crypto exchange has witnessed an astounding surge in its stock price despite facing a lawsuit from the US <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) for allegedly offering unregistered securities.</p>
<p>Over the past month, Coinbase shares have soared by a remarkable 51%, highlighting the resilience and investor confidence in the company amidst a challenging legal battle. In early June, Coinbase was <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-sec-coinbase-unregistered-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">served with a lawsuit</a> by the SEC. The lawsuit accuses Coinbase of operating as an unregistered national securities exchange and broker, conducting business in violation of regulatory requirements since at least 2019.</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims that Coinbase failed to comply with regulatory obligations and obtain necessary operations licenses, as Federal Securities Laws mandated. Despite this bad legal outlook, Coinbase has defied expectations, demonstrating resilience and attracting investor confidence.</p>
<p>According to TradingView statistics, Coinbase shares have increased by 51% in a little more than a month. From approximately $52 per share on June 6, the stock climbed to $78.7 on July 7. This significant stock increase underscores the market&#8217;s optimism regarding Coinbase&#8217;s ability to navigate the SEC lawsuit and maintain its position as a leading player in the crypto industry.</p>
<p>Amidst this surge, notable Coinbase stakeholders, including senior Coinbase executives, have been selling a portion of their stock holdings. On July 6, a combined total of 88,058 COIN stocks, valued at approximately $6.9 million, were sold by the executives, including CEO Brian Armstrong.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://investor.coinbase.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent</a> SEC filing, Gokul Rajaram, a board member, sold 4,580 COIN shares, while Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal sold 1,818 COIN shares. Chief Accounting Officer Jennifer Jones also participated in the stock sales, selling 7,335 COIN shares.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Jennifer Jones had previously sold 74,375 Coinbase shares on June 29, which resulted in a net gain of $5.2 million.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Stock: Other Major Holders Continue to HODL</h2>
<p>While Coinbase executives have engaged in pre-planned and periodic stock sales, other major COIN holders have chosen a different approach. These “HODLers,” a term derived from a popular crypto meme encouraging long-term holding, have maintained their positions in COIN despite market fluctuations and executive sales.</p>
<p>For example, ARK Invest, known for its active involvement in innovative and disruptive technologies, including cryptocurrencies, made a substantial investment in Coinbase by <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ark-invest-coinbase-shares-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">purchasing</a> an additional 400,000 shares in early June.</p>
<p>This investment signaled ARK Invest’s confidence in the future prospects of Coinbase and its potential as a leading player in the crypto industry.</p>
<p>Cathie Wood, the founder and CEO of Ark Invest has confirmed her unshakeable optimism in Bitcoin&#8217;s future potential, predicting that the digital currency will eventually reach an astounding price of $1 million per coin. Wood&#8217;s upbeat forecast reflects her long-term view of Bitcoin and its transformational power.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/japans-nikkei-225-plunge/">Japan’s Nikkei 225 Enters Fifth Straight Losing Plunge as Global Economy Fluctuates</a></p>
<p>Japan’s Nikkei stock average fell on Monday, cementing a fifth consecutive losing plunge. The fall is the longest straight session this year and points to a general economic fluctuation as Wall Street was frail last week despite a strong Yen.</p>
<p>The Nikkei had climbed 0.53% in the morning and fell 1% in the afternoon in an unstable trading session. Comprising 225 components, the Nikkei eventually closed at 32,189.73 after falling 0.61%.73 of these components climbed while 150 plunged. Only 2 of these remained flat.</p>
<p>Since March, the Nikkei has climbed 27% and hit a high last week. However, the Average fell below the 25-day moving average for the first time in three months last Thursday. According to Nomura Securities Strategist Maki Sawada, “Whether or not the Nikkei can recover above the 25-day moving average in a short time is a focal point for the market.”</p>
<p>Performance was low among car makers as Nissan fell 2.55%, while Honda lost 1.72%. The biggest loss was Yaskawa Electric Corporation, which fell 3.44%. The company had released lower-than-expected financial results.</p>
<h2>Earlier Projections for the Japanese Stock Market Before Nikkei Plunge</h2>
<p>In May, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/goldman-sachs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goldman Sachs</a> (NYSE: GE) analysts were <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/japanese-stock-market-projections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relatively bullish</a> about the stock market in Japan. Talks of corporate restructuring is a factor the analysts hope will make Japan a desired spot for investors. According to them, a large inflow into the country’s equity market is likely, if structural reforms restore or at least strengthen the desire for investments among long-term players. At the time, the analysts’ bullish outlook may have also come from anticipating the possible ripple effects of the then-proposed increase in the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/senate-bill-31t-us-debt-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US debt ceiling</a>.</p>
<p>Goldman analysts had predicted that the Topix index would rise 3% to 2,200 points. Interestingly, strategists at the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/bank-of-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bank of America</a> were more bullish, putting the rise at 7% to 2,300 points. The strategists hoped there would be a considerable amount of share buybacks this year, which would generally spur the stock market. As of press time, Goldman Sachs’ analysts seem more spot-on as the Topix is at 2,243.33 after falling 0.51%.</p>
<h2>Similar Plunges Across Global Markets</h2>
<p>Generally, markets around the world are having a hard time as the global economy is struggling. On Wednesday, the European markets opened lower, with the Stoxx 600, CAC 40 Index, and the FTSE 100 recording similar plunges. The DAX fell the most at 0.53%.</p>
<p>On the same day, there were also recorded plunges in the Asia-Pacific region, with the Shanghai Composite, Hang Seng index, and Hang Seng Tech indexes plunging between 0.69% and 1.6%. In the US, the Nasdaq 100, S&amp;P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures all plunged as well.</p>
<p>According to MarketWatch <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/comp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">data</a> as of press time, the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.13% to 13,660.72 from its previous close of 13,679.72. The S&amp;P 500 index also fell, losing 0.29% from its previous close at 4,411.59 to 4,398.95.</p>

<p>Banking giant Standard Chartered expects the Bitcoin bull run to continue further with the BTC price to rally to $50,000 by the end of the year. </p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/standard-chartered-bitcoin-btc-2024/">Standard Chartered Expects Bitcoin (BTC) Price to Surge to $120,000 by End of 2024</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/standard-chartered-bitcoin-btc-2024/">Standard Chartered Expects Bitcoin (BTC) Price to Surge to $120,000 by End of 2024</a></p>
<p>After hitting its 2023 high at $31,000 last week, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) has been facing some selling pressure over the last week and is currently trading close to $30,000 levels. However, going ahead, market players continue to remain bullish on Bitcoin. Banking giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/standard-chartered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Standard Chartered</a> published a report on Monday, July 10, that notes that the BTC price could touch $50,000 by the end of the year and $120,000 by the end of 2024.</p>
<h2>Standard Chartered&#8217;s Predictions on Bitcoin</h2>
<p>The report also notes that the predicted jump in the Bitcoin price could also encourage miners to hoard more cash. Bitcoin miners have been on a strong footing this year after a brutal crypto winter of 2022. As the Bitcoin hash rate continues to climb, the Bitcoin miner revenue has also grown accordingly. Also, with the launch of Bitcoin ordinals, the miners filled their kitty in 2023.</p>
<p>Also, the Bitcoin blockchain shall be undergoing the most-awaited halving event in mid-2024 which will cut the miner rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This creates supply shock thereby driving prices higher. On the other hand, Bitcoin miners will also continue to accumulate more and more BTC going ahead.</p>
<p>In April, Standard Chartered predicted a $100,000 forecast for Bitcoin by the end of 2024, indicating the end of the &#8220;crypto winter&#8221;, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/standard-chartered-bumps-up-bitcoin-forecast-120000-2023-07-10/?rpc=401&amp;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">wrote</a> Reuters. However, Geoff Kendrick, one of the bank&#8217;s leading FX analysts, now believes there is a potential 20% upside to that prediction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Increased miner profitability per BTC (Bitcoin) mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher,&#8221; Kendrick said in a report.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Whales Are Buying</h2>
<p>On-chain data shows that Bitcoin whales along with the sharks have been accumulating at every stage. Over the last three weeks, Bitcoin shark and whale addresses have accumulated a total of 71,000 Bitcoins. Santiment <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1677805758216556544" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Bitcoin&#8217;s sharks and whales aren&#8217;t showing any signs of slowing down, even with prices beginning to get &#8220;boring&#8221; in this $30k to $31k range. Since June 17th, 10 to 10k $BTC addresses have accumulated 71k more coins, equating to $2.15 billion.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>On the downside, Bitcoin has strong support. If the price continues to decline, it is expected to find strong support levels around $29,300 and $28,800. A significant support level is also anticipated at $25,000, which aligns with the 200 MA and the upward trendline that began earlier this year.</p>
<p>Also, macro factors will play a key role in going ahead. The economic outlook remains highly uncertain. In the US, there are signs that the period of lower inflation may come to an end, while inflation remains persistent globally, especially in European countries and particularly in the UK.</p>

<p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap136.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> its 2022 survey on central bank digital currencies, revealing that approximately 24 central banks from developed and underdeveloped economies plan to introduce their own Central Bank Digital Currencies (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDCs</a>) in the coming years. The survey gathered responses from 86 central banks from around the world, highlighting the growing interest in digital currencies and their potential impact on global financial systems.</p>
<p>The BIS has been conducting the CBDC survey for six years to understand the motivation and intentions behind central banks&#8217; involvement in CBDCs, focusing on enhancing cross-border payments.</p>
<p>So far, only four central banks worldwide have officially launched their own digital currencies. However, the latest BIS survey shows a significant increase in interest among central banks, with 93% of respondents actively engaged in CBDC-related work.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the survey reveals that 60% of central banks stated that the emergence of stablecoins and other crypto assets had accelerated their efforts in developing CBDCs.</p>
<h2>Central Banks Could Introduce Nine Wholesale CBDCs</h2>
<p>While interest in retail CBDCs was higher than in the wholesale version, the survey indicates that two dozen central banks plan to have their digital currencies in circulation by the end of the decade. Within the retail space, 11 central banks are planning to join countries like the Bahamas, the Eastern Caribbean, Jamaica, and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/nigerians-adopt-cbdc-physical-cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nigeria</a>, which already have live digital retail currencies. On the wholesale side, nine central banks intend to introduce wholesale CBDCs, which could provide financial institutions with access to new functionalities through tokenization.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on the number of central banks that indicated that they would be very likely to issue a CBDC over the next few years, it may be that there will be 15 retail and nine wholesale CBDCs publicly circulating towards the end of this decade,&#8221; the survey states.</p>
<h2>Central Bank Progress in the Development and Testing of CBDC</h2>
<p>According to the survey, progress in the global development of CBDCs has continued since last year, with a particular emphasis on emerging economies where CBDCs are viewed as a means of providing financial access to unbanked individuals. The BIS also suggests that if retail CBDCs are introduced, they will likely complement and coexist alongside existing domestic payment methods.</p>
<p>For instance, the Swiss National Bank <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/swiss-national-bank-wholesale-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans</a> to issue a wholesale CBDC on Switzerland&#8217;s digital exchange as part of a pilot program, while the European Central Bank is moving forward with its digital euro-pilot, aiming for a potential launch in 2028. Other countries such as China, India, and Brazil have also announced plans to introduce their separate digital currencies soon.</p>
<p>However, the survey raises concerns regarding stablecoins and crypto assets, noting that if widely used for payments, they could threaten financial stability. Recent events in the crypto market, including the fall of TerraUSD and FTX and the bankruptcy of banks servicing crypto providers, have heightened these concerns and triggered sell-offs among investors.</p>
<p>Approximately 40% of the central banks surveyed have conducted studies on the usage of stablecoins and other crypto assets among consumers or businesses, indicating a growing recognition of the need to understand the implications of these digital assets on the stability of financial systems.</p>
<p>The BIS survey underscores the increasing momentum behind CBDCs, with many central banks actively exploring their potential implementation. As these digital currencies continue to evolve, they have the potential to reshape the future of global economies, enhancing financial stability and revolutionizing cross-border payments.</p>
