										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/india-sign-documents-crypto/">India Launches Open Competition to Build Web Browser Using Crypto to Digitally Sign Documents</a></p>
<p>India is looking to launch a new web browser that allows people to digitally sign documents using crypto tokens. According to an official <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1947243" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a>, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) launched the Indian Web Browser Development Challenge (IWBDC) to build the app.</p>
<p>The press release explains that the IWBDC is an open competition to inspire tech enthusiasts, developers, and innovators looking to build the browser. The announcement also expects that the browser would come equipped with tight security and data privacy protection.</p>
<p>“Proposed browser would also focus on accessibility and user-friendliness, ensuring built-in support for individuals with diverse abilities. Moreover, the browser envisions the ability to digitally sign documents using a crypto token, bolstering secure transactions and digital interactions,” reads the announcement.</p>
<p>The browser is expected to fully support Web3 and similar functionalities. The MeitY has also announced a $400,000 prize for the winner and has set the submission deadline for July 1, 2024.</p>
<h2>Crypto in India</h2>
<p>India has tried repeatedly to ban cryptocurrency in the country but has not had much success. While there is no direct ban on cryptocurrencies in India, the unregulated nature suggests that authorities oppose the widespread adoption of digital assets in the Southeast Asian country. There are also no official guidelines for using crypto and no government-backed recourse for problems arising from crypto investment and related issues.</p>
<p>Last year, India launched the Digital Rupee, a crypto version of its national currency, after initially proposing the asset in 2017. Now, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is hoping that the Digital Rupee would help significantly with cross-border transactions.</p>
<p>The RBI has <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/india-rbi-central-banks-digital-rupee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engaged nearly 20 central banks</a> all over the world, seeking ways through which the central bank digital currency (CBDC) will support cross-border payments. According to RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, India is a vibrant market for trade and receives a large number of cross-border payments from citizens working in other countries. However, there have been setbacks.</p>
<p>Das explains that access to the United States dollar is an increasingly difficult problem for traders in most countries looking to import goods. He states that while India has no shortage of dollars, many other countries have these problems and are affected by the scarcity.</p>
<p>The RBI Governor explains there is a market for the Digital Rupee as a tool for cross-border payments since many popular options have seen reduced patronage because of the increased adoption of Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies. Using the Digital Rupee, the RBI Governor assures that cross-border transactions and payments will be cheaper, easier, and much faster. India hopes to counter the dependence on USD and make the Digital Rupee the preferred cross-border payment option instead of Bitcoin and other digital assets.</p>
<h2>India’s Economy</h2>
<p>Last month, Goldman Sachs <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/goldman-sachs-india-2075/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> India would become the world’s second-largest economy by 2075. The firm states India will overtake large economies like Germany, China, and Japan.</p>
<p>Goldman’s India economist Santanu Sengupta also added that India’s dependency ratio would become one of the lowest sometime in the next 20 years. A dependency ratio compares the number of a country’s working population with its dependent sector.</p>

<p>The "enhanced" registration requirements will be effective from January 1, 2024.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/france-crypto-firms-mica-regulation/">France Modifies Regulatory Requirements for Crypto Firms to Align with MiCA Regulation</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/france-crypto-firms-mica-regulation/">France Modifies Regulatory Requirements for Crypto Firms to Align with MiCA Regulation</a></p>
<p>In a bid to conform to the recently finalized Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, France has just revised its requirements for crypto firms. The country&#8217;s financial regulator AMF <a href="https://www.amf-france.org/en/news-publications/news/digital-assets-amf-amends-it-general-regulation-and-its-policy-dasp-light-enhanced-registration-and#xts=607212&amp;xtor=RSS-3&amp;type=RSS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> this on Thursday, as countries in the European Union (EU) stand in line to implement the new rule which will take effect in about one and a half years.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, France already has a seemingly robust licensing regime for crypto firms. Therefore, it has been a place of high interest to many firms looking to register ahead of implementing MiCA. That is considering that firms that have duly registered under the current licensing regime may not have any need to be MiCA-compliant when the rule takes effect.</p>
<h2>MiCA Regulation: How&#8217;s the AMF Preparing?</h2>
<p>According to AMF, the &#8220;enhanced&#8221; registration requirements will be effective from Jan. 1, 2024. And, it will be mandatory for &#8220;new players&#8221; that may want to offer any digital assets services. About the old players, however, the regulator said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As a reminder, DASPs that obtained a simple registration before Jan. 1, 2024 benefit from a &#8220;grandfather&#8221; clause and continue to be subject to the framework applicable before this date.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Per the AMF, the amendment to its rule covers diverse areas that seek to ensure that digital asset service providers conduct their businesses in good faith. Its revised rule, for instance,  bans crypto firms from using client assets without their express permission. Also, it requires that digital asset service providers issue clear and non-misleading information about their operations. That is as it pertains to their pricing policies, custody provisions ( proper differentiation between client assets and own assets), and security and control systems. And, lastly, the amended rule also seeks for these firms to establish systems for managing conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>Although <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-approval-france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> and Hex Trust are registered with the AMF, they were recently joined by Societe Generale&#8217;s crypto division which recently bagged the license as well.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/alibaba-q1-2024-revenue-growth/">Alibaba Records Impressive Fiscal Q1 2024 Revenue Growth of 14%</a></p>
<p>Chinese e-commerce giant, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/alibaba-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alibaba Group Holding Ltd</a> (HKG: 9988) has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/10/alibaba-baba-earnings-report-q1-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> remarkable revenue and financial results for its fiscal Q1 2024 ending June 30.</p>
<p>With a 14% year-on-year increase in revenue and a surge of more than 2.5% in pre-market trading for its US-traded shares, Alibaba continues to demonstrate its resilience and strength in the ever-evolving online marketplace.</p>
<h2>Alibaba Revenue Outperforms Expectations in Q1 2024</h2>
<p>Alibaba’s strong second-quarter performance was highlighted by its healthy revenue results of 234.16 billion Chinese Yuan ($32.29 billion). This is significantly above Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of 224.92 billion Yuan, representing a 14% year-on-year increase.</p>
<p>Not only did Alibaba outperform in terms of revenue growth, but its net income also increased significantly. The net income attributable to common shareholders was 34.33 billion Chinese Yuan, exceeding the expected 28.66 billion Yuan. This translates to an impressive 51% year-on-year increase in net income.</p>
<p>Such remarkable growth in net income reflects the effectiveness of Alibaba’s strategic decisions, operational excellence, and ability to capitalize on emerging trends in the e-commerce sector.</p>
<p>Alibaba&#8217;s impressive Q2 performance is not merely a stroke of luck but a result of the company&#8217;s unwavering commitment to innovation, strategic expansion, and relentless pursuit of excellence.</p>
<p>One of the pivotal factors behind Alibaba’s remarkable Q1 2024 performance lies in its strategic integration of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artificial Intelligence</a> (AI). The <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/alibaba-ai-image-generation-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduction</a> of a new AI image generation model dubbed Tongyi Wanxiang has not only elevated productivity but also fostered an environment of creativity for businesses across the spectrum.</p>
<p>Additionally, the company’s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/freshippo-presence-china-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expansion</a> into new business verticals has played a significant role in bolstering its Q1 2024 results. Alibaba&#8217;s dedication to long-term growth and its emphasis on innovation-driven solutions have instilled confidence in investors, propelling the company to unprecedented heights.</p>
<h2>Alibaba Navigates through Stormy Waters</h2>
<p>Alibaba has long been a prominent player in the world of online commerce, but recent times have presented the corporation with unusual problems.</p>
<p>Since December, when China relaxed its rigorous pandemic controls, the country&#8217;s economic trajectory has been a mixed bag, leaving Alibaba to navigate through an environment that has both surprised and confounded investors. The anticipation of a robust economic rebound clashed with the reality of sluggish domestic consumer demand, presenting Alibaba with a complex set of circumstances to navigate.</p>
<p>To address the shifting landscape, Alibaba announced significant organizational changes in March. The company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/alibaba-split-6-groups-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it would split into six distinct business groups as a strategic move to enhance flexibility and potentially raise outside funding.</p>
<p>This restructuring also grants select business groups the opportunity to go public, a move that could inject fresh capital into specific segments of the conglomerate. Notably, Alibaba has already disclosed its intention to publicly list its cloud computing division, a pivotal step in capitalizing on the growing demand for cloud services.</p>
<p>In the midst of these changes, Alibaba is also undergoing a shift in leadership. The impending <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/alibaba-co-founder-eddie-wu-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">departure</a> of current CEO and Chairman Daniel Zhang in September marks the end of an era.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/fireblocks-bitforge-security-vulnerabilities/">Fireblocks Uncovers BitForge: Series of Security Vulnerabilities Affecting Crypto Wallets</a></p>
<p>It was discovered through a recent study carried out by Fireblocks that many crypto wallets are at risk of being drained due to a security flaw that exchanges do not know about. Fireblocks dubbed the security flaw BitForge. It is a series of vulnerabilities affecting wallets using multi-party computation (MPC) technology that allows multiple parties to control and manage cryptocurrency holdings. These security threats have never been identified, and have impacted several major <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-a-crypto-wallet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto wallet</a> providers, including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a>, WaaS, Zengo, and Binance.</p>
<p>BitForge can enable attackers to drain wallets without the knowledge of users or vendors. The potential draining of numerous retail and institutional investors&#8217; wallets, with no immediate solution available, could lead to increased apprehension within the crypto industry. Thus, it becomes imperative for crypto exchanges to swiftly address the issue.</p>
<p>Addressing the problem proactively is essential, as attempting to resolve it once it starts happening might prove challenging because the whole draining process could be completed within seconds.</p>
<p>Pavel Berengoltz, co-founder of Fireblocks, emphasized the significance of web3 technologies collaborating with security experts with extensive knowledge to stay ahead of vulnerabilities. He <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fireblocks-researchers-uncover-vulnerabilities-impacting-dozens-of-major-wallet-providers-301897357.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As decentralized finance and Web3 continue to gain popularity, the need for secure wallet and key management providers is evident. While we are encouraged to see that MPC is now ubiquitous within the digital asset industry, it is evident from our findings &#8211; and our subsequent disclosure process &#8211; that not all MPC developers and teams are created equal. Companies leveraging Web3 technology should work closely with security experts with the know-how and resources to stay ahead of and mitigate vulnerabilities.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Numerous other crypto wallet providers have also been affected by this series of vulnerabilities. As a result, Fireblocks has introduced a BitForge checker to help exchanges and other wallet providers know if they are exposed.</p>
<h2>Coinbase, Zengo, and Binance Have Addressed the BitForge Security Issue</h2>
<p>Coinbase, Zengo, and Binance expressed gratitude to Fireblocks for identifying and responsibly disclosing the security issues before any losses occurred. Jeff Lunglhofer, Chief Information Security Officer for Coinbase, shared his thoughts on the matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We would like to thank Fireblocks for identifying and responsibly disclosing this issue. While Coinbase customers and funds were never at risk, maintaining a fully trustless cryptographic model is an important aspect of any MPC implementation. Setting a high industry bar for safety protects the ecosystem and is critical to the broader adoption of this technology.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The three exchanges mentioned that they have fixed the issues, assuring their customers about the safety of their services. They also emphasized the importance of partnering with security experts so as to stay ahead of potential security issues.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/google-beta-signature-docs-drive/">Google Announces Open Beta for eSignature Feature in Google Docs and Drive</a></p>
<p>Google has unveiled an open beta of its eSignature feature for the Google Workspace. The feature is available for Google Docs and Google Drive users.</p>
<p>According to an official <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/08/esignature-google-docs-google-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a>, Google has been alpha testing eSignatures in Google Docs since June last year. The testing involved dragging and dropping signatures and dates, as well as requesting signatures after resolving all comments and suggestions. Google was also experimenting with monitoring contract progress and also tracking the status of pending signatures and contracts. All of these features are now available to users.</p>
<p>The blog post also announces a few more features that would be available a little later this year. Users would see an automatic audit trail report for all completed contracts, and a multi-signer feature that allows people to request signatures from multiple users. Furthermore, requesting an eSignature from a non-Gmail user will also be possible, in addition to initiating an eSignature on a PDF file in Google Drive. According to the blog post, some Google Workspace editions will be able to test the eSignature sometime in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>The new Google eSignature feature comes long after other platforms have introduced similar options for users. For instance, Dropbox <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/28/dropbox-snares-hellosign-for-230m-gets-workflow-and-esignature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> workflow and eSignature company HelloSign for $230 million in 2019 and integrated the feature. Now called Dropbox Sign, the feature allows users to exchange and sign documents within Dropbox. Adobe Acrobat also has a similar feature.</p>
<p>There’s also DocuSign, the California-based eSignature company that offers basic integrations with several platforms, including Google Drive, Evernote, Microsoft 365, and Dropbox. On specific plans, integrating Microsoft Dynamics, NetSuite, Salesforce, Sugar CRM, and Microsoft SharePoint is also possible. In June, DocuSign <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/docu-shares-docusign-q1-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> strong earnings of $661 million for fiscal Q1 2024, beating the expected $642 million.</p>
<h2>Google eSignature Follows Other Product Announcements</h2>
<p>Last week, Coinspeaker <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/google-upgrade-assistant-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Google plans to upgrade its Google Assistant feature using artificial intelligence. According to reports, the company is working on a “supercharged” assistant powered by large language model (LLM) technology.</p>
<p>The new Google Assistant would support enhanced conversations and make user interactions a lot more engaging. By using LLM similar to generative AI chatbots like Bard and ChatGPT, users will experience a more advanced assistant with more solutions and tools to solve problems and perform the assistant’s role.</p>
<p>Google is also <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/google-ai-tool-journalists/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developing</a> an AI-powered tool for journalists. Also using LLM technology, Google is creating a tool to help journalists and media personnel write news articles. Reportedly, Google has already pitched the tool to a few news organizations, including the New York Times, Washington Post, and News Corp.</p>
<p>Called Genesis, the new tool can create a news copy using details provided by the journalists. The tool is also expected to create these articles by relying on current affairs. However, reactions to Genesis have been broadly polar. While some believe it should be applauded, others say that Google is treating news writing with levity. Some journalists also believe employers will begin to cut journalist roles in favor of Genesis.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bnb-chain-evm-chains/">BNB Chain&#8217;s August Upgrades Expected to Improve Security and Sync with EVM Chains</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a>’s BNB Chain is scheduled for two upgrades this month to improve the chain’s finality and its compatibility with other Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains. The hard forks are expected to reduce the likelihood of malicious blockchain reorganization and are scheduled for August 10 and 30.</p>
<p>The first upgrade, called the Plato upgrade has already occurred and introduces BEP-126. <a href="https://forum.bnbchain.org/t/bep-126-draft-introduce-fast-finality-mechanism/123" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">BEP-126</a> is an improvement proposal that introduces a fast finality mechanism to the BNB Smart Chain. Arno Bauer, a senior solution architect at BNB Chain <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bnb-chain-hard-forks-improve-finality-security" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">explained</a> that the fast finality mechanism is expected to reduce the possibility of chain reorganization and stabilize block production, allowing users immediate access to accurate data from the latest finalized block in the chain.</p>
<p>“Overall, BEP-126 aims to enhance blockchain security and efficiency on the BNB Smart Chain by introducing a fast finality mechanism,” Bauer stated.</p>
<p>Finality refers to a point at which a blockchain transaction or block can no longer be changed or reversed. It is one of the most important features of blockchain technology as it is key to maintaining trust and preventing double-spending. A fast finality mechanism on the BNB Chain would mean a safer environment for decentralized applications (dApps). Improved transaction finality speed is also expected to improve the responsiveness and efficiency of dApps run on the network.</p>
<p>The fast finality introduced by BEP-126 occurs via a series of steps. First, a validator proposes a block, which is propagated to other validators. The validators use their private key to sign for the block as a vote message. Validator votes are then gathered into a pool and aggregated if the direct parent block has enough votes.</p>
<p>Validators are expected to strictly adhere to guidelines when voting for blocks. For example, validators can not publish contrasting votes for the same height. The guidelines also state that a block is “justified” if its child block header contains an attestation and it is “finalized” if it and its direct child are justified.</p>
<p>The second upgrade is the Hertz hard fork which is expected to catch the BNB Chain up to the latest developments of EVM blockchains. According to Bauer, the chain’s block and transaction structures and its base EVM need to stay updated to match Ethereum’s latest Berlin and London forks.</p>
<p>“Therefore, for compatibility reasons it is important that those EIPs are also enabled on BSC to ensure a smooth development and ecosystem growth,” explained Bauer.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/virgin-galactic-tourists-space-travel/">Virgin Galactic to Launch First Private Tourists Space Travel</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/virgin-galactic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virgin Galactic Holdings</a> (NYSE: SPCE) is on the verge of making history once again with the launch of its second commercial spaceflight that will carry its first cohort of private tourists into space.</p>
<p>Recent <a href="https://gulfnews.com/business/tourism/virgin-galactic-is-set-to-fly-first-private-tourists-to-space-1.97454160" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a> reveal that this momentous journey is scheduled to unfold later today. To share this remarkable experience with the world, Virgin Galactic plans to broadcast the flight through a live webcast. Starting at 11am New York time (Thursday, 8:30 pm IST), enthusiasts and curious onlookers alike will be able to witness this historic event unfold in real-time on the company’s official website.</p>
<p>The upcoming flight marks a pivotal transition for Virgin Galactic as it embarks on its maiden voyage into the realm of hosting paying customers. Preceding this groundbreaking event was the notable Galactic 01 research mission, which paved the way for the company’s innovative approach to private space travel.</p>
<p>However, this imminent launch is set to be the company’s inaugural foray into commercial space tourism, solidifying its position as a key player in the rapidly expanding field. The launch will take place from a cutting-edge spaceport in New Mexico, a testimony to the relentless efforts that have spanned over two decades of development.</p>
<p>This project underscores the profound commitment of Virgin Galactic’s founder, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/richard-branson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sir Richard Branson</a>, to create a platform that offers citizens the awe-inspiring experience of space travel, competing directly with <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/jeff-bezos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeff Bezos</a>’ Blue Origin.</p>
<p>This event is not merely a singular achievement but also symbolizes the beginning of addressing the backlog of approximately 800 eager ticket holders. Virgin Galactic&#8217;s dedication to fulfilling these dreams aligns with its mission to democratize access to space and make the cosmos a tangible reality for the masses.</p>
<h2>Genesis of Virgin Galactic’s Historic Space Flight</h2>
<p>The genesis of Virgin Galactic dates back to its establishment in 2004, with the company originally promising to commence passenger flights as early as 2007. Tickets were initially available at a price of $200,000 but were later increased to $250,000 trailing unforeseen delays in the development process.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the firm experienced a big setback in 2014 when a Virgin Galactic spaceplane crashed during a test flight, killing one test pilot and severely injuring another. This terrible occurrence led Virgin Galactic to temporarily suspend ticket sales while the firm undertook extensive introspection and restructuring.</p>
<p>In 2018, a significant breakthrough was achieved as the company successfully reached space for the first time. Another notable milestone arrived in 2021 when Branson himself <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/branson-space-virgin-galactic-flight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embarked</a> on a voyage to space aboard a Virgin Galactic spacecraft.</p>
<p>Currently, Virgin Galactic anticipates a span of time before seeing substantial revenue streams. According to the company&#8217;s predictions, revenue will be about $1 million in each of the last two quarters of the year. However, if research flights are included in the calculation, these figures may rise slightly.</p>
<p>Virgin Galactic has highlighted that its narrative doesn&#8217;t end with the launch of the VSS Unity, but extends to the development of an even more sophisticated fleet, aptly named the Delta class. Expected to be operational around 2026, these advanced spacecraft represent a quantum leap in technology and capability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/circle-ceo-threat-usd/">Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire Cites Major Threat to USD in Global Economy</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Circle</a> CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/jeremy-allaire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeremy Allaire</a> recently shared a video on his Twitter handle while enjoying a cup of coffee and an American dinner. The Circle chief touched upon the changing dynamics of the global economy and the role of the US Dollar (USD).</p>
<p>“What does a cup of coffee have to do with the future of the global economy,” he asks. Later, he moves towards explaining crypto&#8217;s ability to “fundamentally change the way we pay for things,” with a wide scope from buying coffee to making large cross-border payments, and everything in between.</p>
<p>Allaire revisits the well-known analogy of the transition from dial-up internet in the late 1990s to today&#8217;s interconnected world of smartphones and artificial intelligence. However, according to Allaire, there&#8217;s one aspect that hasn&#8217;t kept pace with this technological progress: money, especially the US dollar. The Circle CEO adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In today’s global economy, the dollar’s position of strength is under threat,” asking if the United States wants “dollars to be the foundation of currency on the internet or digital euros or yuans?”</p></blockquote>
<p>This means that the Circle CEO has been questioning the slower progress by the United States in digitizing its Dollar while other major economies are already working on it actively.</p>
<h2>Circle CEO: Let&#8217;s Bring USD On-Chain with Regulatory Rules</h2>
<p>The CEO of Circle has been actively working to establish regulations for stablecoins such as Circle&#8217;s USDC and its main competitor USDT, as well as <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayPal</a>&#8216;s recently introduced PYUSD, within the United States. Allaire <a href="https://twitter.com/jerallaire/status/1689471525320097792?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s build on-chain dollars that are a powerful developer primitive (money lego bricks), that embrace the multichain, dynamic world of DeFi, and span from micro-payments to large-scale capital markets. Let&#8217;s build this ON SHORE, and have the world know that the regulators of the biggest markets in the world (US, Japan, EU, Singapore, HK, UK, UAE) are ensuring that these are safe, transparent and supervised to bank-grade risk management standards&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, US lawmakers have been in strict opposition to stablecoins and have shared several concerns about it. In recent times, US Senator Elizabeth Warren has been at the forefront of the push against cryptocurrencies. Just two days ago, she reintroduced a bill containing various regulations, including a requirement for crypto users to report transactions exceeding $10,000.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Federal Reserve made a statement on Tuesday, outlining potential fresh guidelines for banks involved with stablecoins tied to the US dollar, such as Allaire&#8217;s USDC.</p>
<p>The central bank of the United States is aiming to enhance transaction monitoring, introduce reversible transactions, and strengthen regulations for cryptocurrency companies.</p>

<p>The SEC's handling of the Green United case offers insights into its potential approach to Coinbase's motion to dismiss, emphasizing the significance of the "major questions doctrine" in cryptocurrency lawsuits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/terraform-us-sec-coinbase-motion/">US SEC Could Dismiss Coinbase Motion Similar to Terraform Labs</a></p>
<p>The recent actions by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) in its lawsuit against crypto miner Green United highlight how the securities regulator could approach the case against <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a>.  Last month on July 31st, the SEC recorded a win after District Judge Jed Rakoff denied the motion by Terraform Labs to dismiss the case, thereby rejecting all the arguments relying on the “major questions doctrine”.</p>
<p>Crypto miner Green United used the same arguments in its motion to dismiss. The argument relies on the &#8220;major questions doctrine&#8221; which has been the centerpiece for crypto defendants, including crypto exchange Coinbase, in their cases against the SEC.</p>
<p>However, during the August 4 filing last week, the SEC <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-terraform-ruling-use-coinbase-dismissal-motion" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a> that Terraform Labs&#8217; ruling provides them additional authority to reject Green United’s major questions doctrine along with fair notice defenses. The SEC&#8217;s letter notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The court rejected defendants’ arguments that the “Major Questions Doctrine” and the Due Process Clause “prevent the SEC from alleging the company’s digital assets to be ‘investment contracts&#8217;. Accordingly, Terraform Labs is relevant to this matter because it provides additional authority for rejecting Defendants’ “Major Questions Doctrine” and fair notice defenses.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Will the SEC Reject Coinbase&#8217;s Motion?</h2>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s recent arguments might offer insights into its potential approach to Coinbase&#8217;s motion to dismiss, which was also submitted on August 4th. In Coinbase&#8217;s motion to dismiss the SEC lawsuit, the cryptocurrency exchange also contended that the major questions doctrine should apply, as the SEC sought to regulate the secondary market for cryptocurrency trading.</p>
<p>The major questions doctrine was introduced through a Supreme Court decision in 2022, where it was outlined that Congress intends to formulate policy decisions and does not delegate authority to agencies without clear authorization from legislators, which is required for their regulatory jurisdiction.</p>
<p>In the SEC vs Terraform case, the judge also found that Terraform “cannot wield a doctrine intended to be applied in exceptional circumstances as a tool to disrupt the routine work that Congress expected the SEC and other administrative agencies to perform”.</p>
<p>Previously, the SEC has used other rulings to bolster its arguments in similar cases. In April, it wrote a letter to the judge overseeing the SEC vs. Ripple Labs case, emphasizing a judge&#8217;s choice in a lawsuit it had won. This lawsuit established that an established court precedent offers adequate fair notice.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-court-tax-apple-app-store/">US Supreme Court Rules in Favor of 30% Developer Tax on Apple App Store</a></p>
<p>US Supreme Court has granted <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/apple-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Inc</a> (NASDAQ: AAPL) permission to keep its App Store payment rules. It means that a 30% tax imposed on application developers tapping on the App Store will stay, despite <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/epic-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games</a>&#8216; request to allow developers to direct users to different purchasing options.</p>
<h2>Apple App Store&#8217;s Policy</h2>
<p>As per Apple&#8217;s policy, the company charges a 30% fee for apps and in-app purchases on the iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and macOS App Store. Specifically, Apple takes a 30% cut from app developers who make over $1 million through the ‌App Store‌ on an annual basis. With a boom in the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-are-non-fungible-tokens-nfts/#:~:text=NFTs%20are%20created%20using%20blockchain,a%20token%20on%20the%20blockchain." target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-fungible tokens</a> (NFTs) industry, creators called for lifting the tax and exempting NFTs from the policy. In response, Apple provided specific rules for NFTs in its App Store guidelines and banned apps from offering exclusive access to NFT owners, or from linking their users to third-party sites where they might buy, sell, and mint outside the Apple ecosystem, thus evading the Apple tax.</p>
<p>The tax has been the primary driver of growth in recent years for a company. The fees collectively contributed to Apple&#8217;s $78.1 billion in services revenue in the fiscal year 2022. However, the revenue came along with protests from companies against the tax.</p>
<h2>Apple&#8217;s Victory Against Epic Games</h2>
<p>Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, has been one of those accusing the company of breaking antitrust laws by forcing app makers to pay their 30% fees. In 2020, Epic Games sued Apple in federal court over its policy for the first time, and the legal process has been lasting for 3 years, with mixed success for both parties.</p>
<p>After an antitrust probe by the US Justice Department into the App Store&#8217;s fees and policies, it was ruled that Apple was not violating antitrust law and was not a monopolist. ‌In response, Epic Games‌ appealed the ruling and claimed that the original court &#8220;reached the wrong answer&#8221; and &#8220;made multiple legal errors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next, Apple removed Fortnite from Apple&#8217;s App Store for violating its policies by launching its own in-app payment system.</p>
<p>In 2021, a US court ruled that Apple could not stop app developers from directing users to third-party payment options. But it also concluded that Epic failed to demonstrate Apple was operating an illegal monopoly.</p>
<p>In April this year, Epic Games was on top of the battle, as the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in California defended the game developer and ruled that Apple&#8217;s policy was violating state competition laws. The court&#8217;s decision gave hope for cryptocurrency and NFT projects willing to add more functionality to their iOS apps.</p>
<p>But now, with the latest update, Apple is legally allowed to keep its taxation policy. As Justice Elena Kagan has <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/23a78.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ruled</a>, the latest petition filed by Epic Games against Apple is declined.</p>
