					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin has been on the lips of many crypto investors and news outlets for the past few months as major investment companies like BlackRock look to bring on Spot Bitcoin ETFs. The world&#8217;s largest digital currency has also seen an increase in price in the past few months as a result of this, ranging around $30,000 for almost a month.  Now, Fundstrat, an equity research firm based in New York City, has made a daring bullish prediction on the price of BTC. According to the investment research firm, the price of the cryptocurrency could reach $180,000 before its April 2024 halving. Fundstrat Makes Bullish Bitcoin Prediction In a Monday note to its clients, the firm put forward that BTC&#8217;s price could be on the verge of skyrocketing in the next year. A big part of their prediction revolves around the possibility of the trading of Spot Bitcoin ETFs by investment firms spearheaded by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with over $9 trillion in assets. If approved, Spot Bitcoin ETFs could open the gates for mainstream investors and institutions to pour billions of dollars into Bitcoin. Related Reading: Elon Musk Incorporates Dogecoin Symbol In Twitter Bio, Triggering 5% Increase In Price The investment research firm said that the current daily demand for BTC currently at $25 million could skyrocket to $100 million with Spot Bitcoin ETFs. This would put bitcoin ETFs in direct rivalry with the market for precious metals ETFs, which currently has a total market capitalization of approximately $230 billion. &#8220;This [bitcoin ETF launch] would bring daily demand to $125 million, while daily supply is only $25 million. The implied equilibrium price would need to rise so daily supply matches daily demand,” Fundstrat said in the research note. Fundstrat&#8217;s head of digital asset strategy, Sean Farrell, also added: &#8220;We anticipate [a bitcoin ETF] would attract new investors and generate increased demand for bitcoin.&#8221; BTC price recovers slightly to $29,227 &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com  Upcoming BTC Halving Another thing the research note mentions is the influence of the upcoming Bitcoin halving. Done once approximately every four years, the Bitcoin halving cuts in half the reward given to miners for mining a block on the blockchain. Past halvings have been known to reduce inflationary pressure on BTC, thereby steadily increasing its price.  According to Fundstrat, the impending reduction of the daily mining incentive to $6 million from its current $12 million would result in a sizeable increase in the price of Bitcoin in order to achieve a state of equilibrium between buyers and sellers. The effect of the halving is then expected to compound with the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, leading to a greater price increase.

Coincidentally, Fundstrat is not the only firm anticipating BTC reaching the $100,000 mark in the near future.

					<description><![CDATA[UK data regulator, the Information Commissioner Office (ICO), has laid out intentions to probe the newly launched crypto project Worldcoin.  According to a report by Reuters on July 25, the ICO has taken notice of WorldCoin’s launch in the UK and will now proceed to “making further inquiries.” Launched on Monday, Worldcoin is an Ethereum-based project founded by the CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman. On the protocol’s official website, it states that Worldcoin aims to be “the world&#8217;s largest identity and financial public network.” To achieve its aim, the network utilizes a digital identification system known as “World ID,” designed to differentiate humans from artificial intelligence online.  Interested Worldcoin users are required to undergo a physical iris scan process at one of the project’s “Orb” locations before being granted a WorldID, prompting much concern over the user’s privacy. Currently, there are three Worldcoin Orb locations in the UK, all of which are based in London. Globally, the crypto project has already managed to establish 125 orbs locations in 20 countries across 5 continents.  Related Reading: Binance Announces Listing Of Sam Altman’s Worldcoin, Opens Deposits Worldcoin Under Criticism Over Privacy Concerns. Although the launch of Worldcoin was greeted with much anticipation and goodwill, the project has also received heavy criticism, especially in relation to its World ID system, which requires users to undergo an in-person iris scan procedure.  Popular crypto lawyer John Deaton, along with many others, believes the process is a threat to users&#8217; freedom and privacy, terming it as “Orwellian.”  In addition, Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin also highlighted concerns about the World ID system. In a recent blog post, he stated that an iris scan is likely to reveal more information about users than originally designed.  WLD Declines By 17% A Day After Launch  Following the launch of Worldcoin on Monday, its native token, WLD, had an impressive debut in the market, rising by 88% and hitting a peak price of $3.31. However, the WLD token has since then recorded an overall negative price movement. Based on data from CoinMarketCap, WLD is currently down by 16.76% in the last 24 hours, trading as low as $1.92 within this period.  According to Worldcoin’s whitepaper, WLD is primarily designed as a utility token for network governance. However, the token also serves as a payment medium for specific services in the World App or other crypto wallets.  Related Reading: Countdown To FOMC: What Bitcoin And Crypto Traders Must Brace For At the time of writing, WLD is exchanging hands at $2.13, with a 0.57% gain in the last hour. The token’s 24-hour trading volume is also up by 34.56% and is valued at $403.35 million. With a market cap of $231.09 million, WLD ranks as the 124th largest cryptocurrency in the market.  WLD Trading At $2.2432 On The Hourly Chart &#124; Source: WLDUSDT Chart On Tradingview.com Featured Image From Worldcoin, Chart From Tradingview]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Data shows the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has turned negative recently, a sign that large US-based investors may be selling currently. Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Has Remained Near Neutral For A While Now As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the interest from US investors in the asset has declined during the last couple of months. The indicator of interest here is the &#8220;Coinbase Premium Gap,&#8221; which keeps track of the difference between the Bitcoin price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). The Coinbase exchange is popularly known to be used by US-based investors (especially large institutions), while the Binance platform has a more global audience. Thus, the Coinbase Premium Gap can provide us with hints about the buying or selling pressure differences between these two user bases. When the value of this indicator is positive, it means that the price listed on Coinbase is more than that on Binance. This suggests that American users are potentially participating in a higher amount of buying than global investors currently. On the other hand, negative values of the metric suggest the US-based holders may be doing a higher amount of selling than the worldwide users (or alternatively, they are just buying less of the asset). Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Rebound? This Metric May Be The One To Watch Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the last few months: The value of the metric seems to have been around the neutral line in recent days &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has turned slightly red recently, implying that the price on Coinbase has become lesser than on Binance. This discount implies that the US-based institutional investors have been participating in a heavier amount of selling than the global users during the latest downward move in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. Even before this shift towards the small negative values, the indicator&#8217;s value had been mostly around the neutral mark during the last few months, meaning that American investors didn&#8217;t have any interest in accumulating the asset any more than the rest of the world. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharks Continue Accumulation, But Whales Stagnate Back during the selloff in June, the US-based holders had even been applying notable selling pressure, as the metric&#8217;s value had been negative. This selloff was due to US-focused FUD from the SEC cases against Binance and Coinbase, so it makes sense that this side of the market was selling to a higher degree. Earlier during the year, though, the US institutional investors had seemed very much interested in the asset, as they had been participating in a high amount of accumulation, which had resulted in the metric turning highly positive. At present, however, it would appear that large American investors continue to be disinterested in Bitcoin, considering that the Premium Gap is still floating near the neutral line. This low level of interest could translate to further downward movement for the digital asset as it struggles to hold above $29,000. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $29,200, down 3% in the last week.

					<description><![CDATA[Worldcoin co-founder Alex Blania&#8217;s recent refusal to disclose the token’s distribution model has raised some eyebrows, including that of John Deaton, who has expressed his dismay at his action. Something Fishy With Worldcoin? A video surfaced on Twitter in which Alex Blania, during a recent Bankless interview alongside fellow co-founder Sam Altman, refused to respond to the host’s question on Worldcoin’s token distribution, citing the regulatory uncertainty in the US as why he couldn’t answer the question.  Related Reading: Binance Announces Listing Of Sam Altman’s Worldcoin, Opens Deposits The Twitter user (@Pledditor) posted the video with the caption: “When a crypto founder refuses to answer questions about token distribution🚩🚩🚩” In the video, the host asks Blania to explain the distribution of the WLD token and Blania is quoted as saying: “Look, many of the details we can’t talk about here for the regulatory uncertainty in the United States.”  The video quickly went viral and sparked controversy as to whether Worldcoin was just another ‘ponzinomics’ or, indeed, Alex Blania was honest about why he couldn’t answer the question.  However, renowned crypto lawyer John Deaton, who represents some XRP holders, quickly reacted to the video in a tweet. Deaton’s tweet read: Wtf did this dude just say?  Did he literally say that he can’t talk about how WorldCoin is distributed “because of the regulatory uncertainty” in the United States? 🤦‍♂️  If there was ever a signal to RUN AWAY as fast as you can from a project, HERE IT IS. Is he saying he can’t tell you how to acquire it or what you’re acquiring because he might get sued? 🤷‍♂️  Now that I think of it, is he being smart and just following legal advice or is he a moron. 🤷‍♂️  Deaton stated that Blania’s action was enough reason for investors to run away from the project. However, the SEC and its Chair Gary Gensler weren’t spared from Deaton’s wrath as he also slammed them for their role in creating a state of turmoil regarding the regulatory environment in the crypto space.  “But this is an example of the chaos caused when you have bad faith regulators like @GaryGensler intentionally keeping the regulatory environment as unknowable,” Deaton said. A Bad Start For WLD? This development comes less than 48 hours after the launch of Worldcoin’s highly-anticipated WLD token. There were, however, some positives for the token as leading crypto exchanges like Binance, Gate.io, and KuCoin were quick to list it upon launch.  WLD price recovers above $2.2 &#124; Source: WLDUSD on Tradingview.com Founded by OpenAI’s CEO Altman, Worldcoin aims to solve the problem of differentiating between humans and bot-related projects. This problem has stemmed from the growing use of artificial intelligence in almost all spheres of life. The team plans to resolve this by giving humans unique digital identities to differentiate them from artificial intelligence algorithms.  Related Reading: Elon Musk Incorporates Dogecoin Symbol In Twitter Bio, Triggering 5% Increase In Price The WLD token spiked to as high as $3.30 upon launch. However, it seems the token’s price has negatively reacted to the issue of its token distribution and other privacy concerns as it dumped to as low as $1.66 on Monday, according to data from CoinGeko. WLD is currently trading at around $2.12 at the time of writing, with a 16% decrease in the last 24 hours. Featured image from Altcoin Buzz, chart from Tradingview.com]]></description>

<p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/Pledditor/status/1683388758933098496?s=20" rel="nofollow">video</a> surfaced on Twitter in which Alex Blania, during a recent Bankless interview alongside fellow co-founder Sam Altman, refused to respond to the host’s question on Worldcoin’s token distribution, citing the regulatory uncertainty in the US as why he couldn’t answer the question. </p>

<p>The Twitter user (@Pledditor) posted the video with the <a href="https://twitter.com/Pledditor/status/1683388758933098496?s=20" rel="nofollow">caption</a>:</p>
<p><i>“When a crypto founder refuses to answer questions about token distribution<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6a9.png" alt="🚩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6a9.png" alt="🚩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6a9.png" alt="🚩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />”</i></p>
<p>In the video, the host asks Blania to explain the distribution of the WLD token and Blania is quoted as saying: “Look, many of the details we can’t talk about here for the regulatory uncertainty in the United States.” </p>
<p>The video quickly went viral and sparked controversy as to whether Worldcoin was just another ‘ponzinomics’ or, indeed, Alex Blania was honest about why he couldn’t answer the question. </p>
<p>However, renowned crypto lawyer John Deaton, who represents some XRP holders, quickly reacted to the video in a tweet.</p>
<p>Deaton’s <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1683550906615316480?s=20" rel="nofollow">tweet</a> read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Wtf did this dude just say?  Did he literally say that he can’t talk about how WorldCoin is distributed “because of the regulatory uncertainty” in the United States? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f926-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="🤦‍♂️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>
<p>If there was ever a signal to RUN AWAY as fast as you can from a project, HERE IT IS. Is he saying he can’t tell you how to acquire it or what you’re acquiring because he might get sued? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="🤷‍♂️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>
<p>Now that I think of it, is he being smart and just following legal advice or is he a moron. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="🤷‍♂️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p></blockquote>
<p>Deaton stated that Blania’s action was enough reason for investors to run away from the project. However, the SEC and its Chair Gary Gensler weren’t spared from Deaton’s wrath as he also slammed them for their role in creating a state of turmoil regarding the regulatory environment in the crypto space. </p>
<p>“But this is an example of the chaos caused when you have bad faith regulators like @GaryGensler intentionally keeping the regulatory environment as unknowable,” Deaton said.</p>
<h2>A Bad Start For WLD?</h2>
<p>This development comes less than 48 hours after the launch of Worldcoin’s highly-anticipated WLD token. There were, however, some positives for the token as leading crypto exchanges like Binance, Gate.io, and KuCoin were quick to list it upon launch. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/EnKCY55C/" alt="Worldcoin (WLD) price chart from Tradingview.com" width="2884" height="1758"/></p>

<p>Founded by OpenAI’s CEO Altman, Worldcoin aims to solve the problem of differentiating between humans and bot-related projects. This problem has stemmed from the growing use of artificial intelligence in almost all spheres of life. The team plans to resolve this by giving humans unique digital identities to differentiate them from artificial intelligence algorithms. </p>

<p>The WLD token spiked to as high as $3.30 upon launch. However, it seems the token’s price has negatively reacted to the issue of its token distribution and other privacy concerns as it dumped to as low as $1.66 on Monday, according to data from <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/worldcoin" rel="nofollow">CoinGeko</a>. WLD is currently trading at around $2.12 at the time of writing, with a 16% decrease in the last 24 hours.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Latin American region faces high costs and challenges of traditional settlements, as people sending money to their close ones have to deal with high rates of transfer, and a portion of the population still remains unbanked. However, in a recent development, the Bahamas payment company, Island Pay, is now incorporating cryptocurrency for remittance transactions to make it a smoother and cheaper process. Island Pay is set to introduce crypto wallets that utilize the stablecoin USDC as the medium of exchange. The payment firm plans to roll out the CiNKO wallet in more than 30 countries. The wallet which caters to users in the Caribbean and LATAM regions will enable individuals to conduct transactions with vendors, make payments to others (including those without bank accounts), and fund pre-paid cards. Island Pay CEO Richard Douglas stated: Our goal is to continuously look for ways to advance financial inclusion in the region and enhance financial experiences for both the unbanked and banked populations. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Rebound? This Metric May Be The One To Watch Crypto Revolutionizes Remittance Landscape, Advancing Financial Inclusion By integrating crypto for remittance, Island Pay demonstrates its commitment to fostering financial inclusion and enriching monetary experiences for both banked and unbanked individuals in the region. The incorporation of this technology will lead to significant reductions in international money transfer fees. When receiving USDC stablecoins on CiNKO, users will not be charged. They may, however, encounter gas fees, depending on the blockchain network used for the transaction. The demand for crypto transactions has surged due to the existing challenges in conventional remittance methods. According to the World Bank, the average cost of sending $200 can be as high as 6.2%. Additionally, these transactions often take several days to process through traditional financial intermediaries. As pointed out in Circle&#8217;s recent report, the technology has the potential to slash the cost of sending money abroad by a substantial 80%. This report predicts that Blockchain&#8217;s capacity to enhance cost savings for financial institutions engaged in cross-border transactions will reach a market cap of $10 billion by the year 2030. Even before this, the Bahamas boasted a well-established presence in the fintech sector, with various global payment platforms and crypto wallets operating in the region. Rifos disclosed that the remittance and payments sectors are currently the fastest-growing fintech segments in LATAM. The surge in smartphone adoption and connectivity has also played a crucial role in fostering innovation and advancements in these areas.

					<description><![CDATA[Ripple’s sales in 2023 have caused mixed feelings for members of the Ripple community, with many considering it bullish for the network while others see it as detrimental to XRP’s price action.  What Has Happened With Ripple’s Sales? Compared to 2022, Ripple sold 37% more XRP per month in 2023, and a recent tweet by Mr. Huber, an influencer in the XRP community, drew many’s attention to this development.  Related Reading: Elon Musk Incorporates Dogecoin Symbol In Twitter Bio, Triggering 5% Increase In Price &#8220;Ripple sold 2.22 billion XRP since 2023 started. That&#8217;s about 315 million per month. About 50% more than the usual 200 million in 2022. Now the crying is about to start. But I can reassure you. It is not XRP Tards who have bought these 2.2 billion XRP and XRP has outperformed anyway. No matter what you feel,&#8221; Huber said. It is important to mention that Mr. Huber initially made a mistake regarding the percentage increase in monthly sales from last year, which stands at 37% against the 50% he initially tweeted. He, however, quickly corrected it in a follow-up tweet. Despite this, 37% remains a lot, and these figures will undoubtedly raise eyebrows about what is going on with Ripple and how XRP’s price will react to these sales, whether it will bring about a massive rise in XRP’s price or a steady decline.  XRP’s circulation does justice to these claims, as the number of XRPs in circulation has grown exponentially. XRP’s circulating supply was 50.334 billion at the beginning of the year but now stands at 52.554 billion after Ripple&#8217;s sales and monthly escrow releases. That is an additional 2.2 billion XRPs put in circulation since January and a 4.4% increase, and the year is far from over.  In 2021, Ripple sold 2 billion XRPs, amounting to 166 million XRPs being sold on an average monthly basis. In 2022, it sold 2.75 billion XRPs, an average of 230 million tokens sold monthly.  XRP holding steady above $0.7 &#124; Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com In 2023, Ripple has sold 2.22 billion XRPs since the start of the year, amounting to an average of 315 million tokens sold monthly since January. That proves that Ripple has increased XRP sales massively since 2021. What Does This Mean For Ripple And Its Community? These figures could be both good and bad news for XRP and its community. On the positive side, it shows that there has been a greater demand for the token over the years, which signifies growth and wider adoption of the token.  This demand may mainly be coming from institutional investors, which could undoubtedly expand the use cases of XRP beyond the cryptocurrency space. While on the negative side, having so much XRP in circulation without a deflationary mechanism could reduce the token’s value.

					<description><![CDATA[The on-chain analytics firm Santiment suggests that this indicator may be the one to watch to get hints about when Bitcoin might rebound. Large Stablecoin Holders Have Seen Stagnant Supply Recently According to Santiment, the movements of the dolphins and sharks of the top stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) may be relevant for the price of Bitcoin. Generally, investors make use of these fiat-tied tokens whenever they want to escape the volatility associated with other assets in the market, like BTC. Such investors, however, are likely to buy back into the volatile cryptocurrencies, as holders who are truly exiting the space do so through fiat. When these investors feel that the prices are right to jump back into the other coins, they simply exchange their stablecoins for them. Naturally, this shift can act as buying pressure for the market they are moving into, and thus, provide a bullish boost to the asset&#8217;s price. To check whether there is any significant conversion of stables happening into Bitcoin and others right now, Santiment has looked at the data for the supply of the relatively large stablecoin investor groups. More specifically, the combined holdings of the dolphins and sharks are of interest here. These holders generally hold between 10,000 and 100,000 BTC on their balances. Now, here is a chart that shows how the supply of these investor cohorts has changed for USDT and USDC over the last few months: Looks like the two metrics haven't shown much movement in recent days &#124; Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the dolphins and sharks of the two largest stablecoins in the sector have seen their combined supply move mostly sideways during the last few weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharks Continue Accumulation, But Whales Stagnate This means that these decently-sized investors haven&#8217;t been taking part in any sort of net conversions recently, whether it be swapping Bitcoin into stables, or exchanging their stables for other assets. Interestingly, this sideways trend has continued during the last few days, despite the plunge to the low $29,000 levels that the cryptocurrency has observed in this period. &#8220;Currently, one of our key considerations revolves around whether this behavioral pattern will continue in the incoming 24 hours, especially in the wake of today’s fallen prices,&#8221; explains the analytics firm. &#8220;Will these users perceive this change as an opportunity to &#8216;buy the dip&#8217;? Or will they opt to &#8216;abandon ship&#8217; amidst growing market uncertainty?&#8221; Naturally, if the supply of these large stablecoin holders starts to slip down in the near future, it can be a sign that these investors are buying Bitcoin while its price is at a discount. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunge To $29,200 Sends 5.9% Of Supply Into Loss Though, on the other hand, an increase instead would obviously be a worrying signal, as it may mean that the dolphins and sharks are starting to give up on BTC for now and exiting from it.

<p>Interestingly, this sideways trend has continued during the last few days, despite the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-retreat-below-30000-a-threat-to-cryptos-2023-dominance-over-stocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">plunge</a> to the low $29,000 levels that the cryptocurrency has observed in this period.</p>
<p>&#8220;Currently, one of our key considerations revolves around whether this behavioral pattern will continue in the incoming 24 hours, especially in the wake of today’s fallen prices,&#8221; explains the analytics firm. &#8220;Will these users perceive this change as an opportunity to &#8216;buy the dip&#8217;? Or will they opt to &#8216;abandon ship&#8217; amidst growing market uncertainty?&#8221;</p>
<p>Naturally, if the supply of these large stablecoin holders starts to slip down in the near future, it can be a sign that these investors are buying Bitcoin while its price is at a discount.</p>

<p>Though, on the other hand, an increase instead would obviously be a worrying signal, as it may mean that the dolphins and sharks are starting to give up on BTC for now and exiting from it.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $29,200, down 3% in the last week.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[As the eagerly anticipated Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting approaches, the financial world is abuzz with speculation about the potential implications for Bitcoin and crypto. Tomorrow, on Wednesday, July 26th, at 2 pm EST, the FOMC will announce its interest rate decision. As usual, Federal Reserve (Fed) chair Jerome Powell will face the media at 2:30 pm EST. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the majority of the market is expecting a 25 basis point increase (99.8%). However, the real intrigue lies in what comes after this move and whether it marks the end of the rate hike cycle. After tomorrow’s decision, the market expects the Fed to keep the key interest rate high for a longer period of time. A first rate cut could come in March 2024 at the earliest, if not in May.

But all signs point to a possible end of the tightening cycle. The market is firmly expecting the 0.25 bps hike to a range of 5.25 to 5.5% will be the last. Meanwhile, Bitcoin and crypto have experienced a period of relative immunity to macroeconomic events and rate hike speculations in the first seven months of the year. However, investors must be aware that such conditions might not last indefinitely.

Seemingly, market participants have been cautious in the lead-up to the FOMC&#8217;s July meeting, aware that the FOMC meeting can have a profound impact. In June, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at the possibility of further rate hikes this year, with some committee members advocating for two more increases. The market now anxiously awaits the outcome of this meeting to ascertain the central bank&#8217;s future policy stance. However, factors such as declining inflation in the United States and a weaker labor market strengthen the market expectations. The previously skyrocketing inflation, which led to the tightening cycle, has shown signs of abating. June&#8217;s Consumer Price Index (YoY) data revealed a decline in inflation to 3.0% from 4.0%. The core rate fell from 5.3% in May to 4.8% in June. Both declines were stronger than previously anticipated. Remarkably, the core rate is now trading below the level of the US federal funds rate, which was pretty rare in the last 20 years. Related Reading: Over $41 Million in Bitcoin Long Positions Liquidated as BTC Crashes Toward $29K The prolonged strength of the US labour market has long been the biggest headache for the Federal Reserve because of the imbalance between supply and demand. At the peak of this imbalance, there were two job openings for every available worker, which drove up wages accordingly. As demand and supply approach equilibrium, job creation numbers have declined. Also, there are even early indications of declining consumer spending. So, what does all of this mean for Bitcoin and crypto investors? As always, it&#8217;s essential to approach the market with a balanced perspective. While BTC and cryptocurrencies have shown resilience in the face of traditional economic events, they are not entirely insulated from larger macroeconomic trends. Investors should closely monitor the FOMC&#8217;s interest rate decision and Jerome Powell’s subsequent statements. Any signals about the future rate hike cycle could have repercussions for both the traditional as well as Bitcoin and crypto markets, triggering a further sell-off. At press time, the market continued to show indecision. BTC was trading at $29,200. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cardano has leaped considerably in the realm of DeFi activities, particularly in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL), despite the somewhat lackluster performance of ADA itself.  TVL refers to the total value of assets locked within various decentralized finance protocols and applications on the Cardano blockchain. An increasing TVL can have several positive implications for the Cardano ecosystem. The significance of TVL lies in its reflection of the overall engagement and adoption of DeFi projects built on Cardano. A higher TVL indicates greater trust and confidence in these decentralized financial services. It demonstrates that users are willing to lock their assets within the ecosystem, utilizing various DeFi protocols for lending, borrowing, staking, and other financial activities. Cardano TVL Surges Amid Price Decline ADA has experienced a recent decline in its price, with the latest data from Coingecko showing it currently stands at $0.305. Over the past 24 hours, the price has faced a modest 0.4% decline, and over the last seven days, it has decreased by a mere 0.3%. Despite these losses, there is a notable silver lining in the form of Cardano&#8217;s TVL on the network. Source: Coingecko The surge in Cardano&#8217;s TVL by 28% in the last three months indicates a growing interest in the DeFi activities offered by the network. It reflects growing confidence among users willing to lock their assets in decentralized applications, such as lending platforms, decentralized exchanges, and liquidity pools.

On the other hand, Cardano has emerged as a strong contender, outperforming Ethereum regarding individual token lockup within its DeFi ecosystem. While Cardano excels in terms of token lockup, it still needs to catch up in other critical areas compared to Ethereum.

					<description><![CDATA[As the year 2023 continues to unfold, Bitcoin&#8217;s retreat below the pivotal $30,000 mark raises questions about the overall strength and stability of the cryptocurrency market. Once, the crypto market held a significant lead over traditional stocks, according to Bloomberg. However, this advantage seems to be dwindling as Bitcoin &#8211; a leading market indicator &#8211; exhibits signs of struggle. The year-to-date rise of the top 100 digital tokens now stands at 46%, narrowing the gap with the 41% increase of the tech-driven Nasdaq 100 Index. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Realized Cap Nears $400 Billion Despite Price Struggle At $30,000 Technology stocks, particularly those influenced by artificial intelligence hype, have been rapidly gaining ground. This surge resulted in the Nasdaq 100 Index briefly surpassing the MVIS CryptoCompare Digital Assets 100 Index in June. Impact of Regulatory Changes And Fed Decisions Previously, the crypto market received a positive push from both regulatory efforts on digital assets that face a stumbling block in US court on digital assets and the hope that spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) would be authorized in the US.  However, these boosting factors have waned. Investors are now cautiously considering how the anticipated interest-rate hike by the Federal Reserve could impact both traditional and digital markets. According to Caroline Mauron, co-founder of digital-asset derivatives liquidity provider OrBit Markets, the rally has lost momentum since the initial excitement sparked by the ETF news. &#8220;There are no other visible catalysts on the horizon,&#8221; she noted. She also hinted at a potential silver lining, pointing out that the &#8220;downside risk should be limited as the Fed is near the end of the current rate hiking cycle, which should support risk assets including crypto.&#8221; Bitcoin Chart Patterns Signal Warning Signs Further cause for concern is seen in the various chart patterns that track Bitcoin&#8217;s performance. A key indicator, Bitcoin’s 20-week Bollinger bandwidth, has contracted to its narrowest in seven years. This tightening suggests that moves in the value of Bitcoin could intensify, according to Bloomberg. If crucial thresholds aren&#8217;t maintained, it&#8217;s likely we could see a downward trend. The Bollinger study also provides an invaluable method for analyzing the volatility of this digital asset. Market analyst at IG Australia Pty, Tony Sycamore, noted the potential for Bitcoin&#8217;s drop to continue, &#8220;Bitcoin should extend toward $26,000/$25,000 before finding support,&#8221; he predicted.

Particularly, in the past 24 hours, the asset has traded slightly above $29,000 down by 1.3%. This price action has resulted in more than 45,000 traders caught in the crypto market total liquidation of over $130 million in the past day. Furthermore, Bitcoin currently has a 24-hour high of $29,762 and a 24-hour low of $29,983, at the time of writing. The asset’s market cap has plunged from a high of $583 billion seen last Tuesday to $567 billion, as of today.

<p>Once, the crypto market <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/bitcoin-retreat-puts-crypto-s-2023-lead-over-stocks-in-jeopardy-1.1950145" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">held</a> a significant lead over traditional stocks, according to Bloomberg. However, this advantage seems to be dwindling as <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/standard-chartered-raises-bitcoin-forecast/?swcfpc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">Bitcoin</a> &#8211; a leading market indicator &#8211; exhibits signs of struggle. The year-to-date rise of the top 100 digital tokens now stands at 46%, narrowing the gap with the 41% increase of the tech-driven Nasdaq 100 Index.</p>

<p>Technology stocks, particularly those influenced by artificial intelligence hype, have been rapidly gaining ground. This surge resulted in the Nasdaq 100 Index briefly surpassing the MVIS CryptoCompare Digital Assets 100 Index in June.</p>

<h2>Impact of Regulatory Changes And Fed Decisions</h2>
<p>Previously, the crypto market received a positive push from both regulatory efforts on digital assets that face a stumbling block in US court on digital assets and the hope that <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/btc-uptrend-fidelity-to-submit-bitcoin-spot-etf-filing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a> would be authorized in the US.  However, these boosting factors have waned. </p>
<p>Investors are now cautiously considering how the anticipated interest-rate hike by the Federal Reserve could impact both traditional and digital markets.</p>
<p>According to Caroline Mauron, co-founder of digital-asset derivatives liquidity provider OrBit Markets, the rally has lost momentum since the initial excitement sparked by the ETF news. &#8220;There are no other visible catalysts on the horizon,&#8221; she noted. </p>
<p>She also hinted at a potential silver lining, pointing out that the &#8220;downside risk should be limited as the Fed is near the end of the current rate hiking cycle, which should support risk assets including crypto.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Chart Patterns Signal Warning Signs</h2>
<p>Further cause for concern is seen in the various chart patterns that track Bitcoin&#8217;s performance. A key indicator, Bitcoin’s 20-week Bollinger bandwidth, has contracted to its narrowest in seven years. This tightening suggests that moves in the value of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/crypto-analyst-predicts-bitcoin-to-reach-above-in-2023/?swcfpc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">Bitcoin</a> could intensify, according to Bloomberg.</p>
<p>If crucial thresholds aren&#8217;t maintained, it&#8217;s likely we could see a downward trend. The Bollinger study also provides an invaluable method for analyzing the volatility of this digital asset.</p>
<p>Market analyst at IG Australia Pty, Tony Sycamore, noted the potential for Bitcoin&#8217;s drop to continue, &#8220;Bitcoin should extend toward $26,000/$25,000 before finding support,&#8221; he predicted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/founder-anticipates-btc-price-surge-forecasts-bitcoin-etfs/?swcfpc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">Bitcoin price</a> has continued to swim in red over the past week following its fall below the $30,000 mark. Particularly, in the past 24 hours, the asset has <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-realized-cap-nears-400b-price-reclaims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">traded slightly above $29,000</a> down by 1.3%. This price action has resulted in more than 45,000 traders caught in the crypto market <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">total liquidation of over $130 million</a> in the past day.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Bitcoin currently has a 24-hour high of $29,762 and a 24-hour low of $29,983, at the time of writing. The asset’s market cap has plunged from a high of $583 billion seen last Tuesday to $567 billion, as of today. Additionally, BTC trading volume has also declined in the past week indicating less trading activity.</p>
