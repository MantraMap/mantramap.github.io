<p>Fasttoken (FTN) is the main utility token on the Fastex ecosystem, a comprehensive Web 3.0 platform offering payment OPTIONS, trading services and a community-centric and integrated NFT marketplace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lithuanian-licensed web 3 ecosystem, Fastex secures a $23.2&nbsp; million capital raise from a successful token generation event (TGE) through an offering of its official utility token, Fasttoken (FTN), to both private and public investors. A statement released Friday confirmed that the public sale, which launched on January 18 and sold out on January 20, targeted a hard cap investment of ~$3.5 million from the sale of 10 million FTN tokens. The capital injection will be used to advance the features and products offered in the Fastex ecosystem, accelerate the development of their exchange, and grow their global community base.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fasttoken is part of the Fastex Web 3 ecosystem, incubated by SelfConstruct, a leading tech giant providing IT solutions in various fields including gaming, AR, VR, and Web 3.0. The FTN token ushers in a new era of Fastex&rsquo;s ecosystem providing utility across the platform and powering everything under Fatex&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fastex features a web of applications and features including Fastex exchange, which allows users to trade several cryptocurrencies with low fees; FatexVerse, a gaming metaverse showcasing branded virtual rooms, art, NFTgalleries, and much more;&nbsp; ftNFT, an NFT marketplace to create, buy and sell digital art; and FastexPay, a crypto payment provider that offers online and offline solutions for various businesses.
