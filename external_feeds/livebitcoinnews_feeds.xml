</ul>
<p><em>Ripple price is struggling below $0.490 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-faces-uphill-task-near-29250/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. XRP price could decline heavily if it breaks the $0.440 support in the near term.</em></p>
<h2>Ripple Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, Ripple price attempted an upside break above the $0.500 zone against the US Dollar. The XRP/USD pair failed to gain bullish momentum and formed a high near $0.4868.</p>
<p>The price started a fresh bearish wave and declined below the $0.4750 support. It even traded below the $0.470 level and spiked below the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). It is now testing the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4322 swing low to the $0.4868 high.</p>
<p>XRP is now trading below $0.480 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ripple-price-analysis-xrp-turns-red-below-0-50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. Besides, there is a key rising channel forming with support near $0.4550 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair.</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is facing resistance near $0.470. The next major resistance is near the $0.485 level. A clear move above the $0.4850 and $0.4900 resistance zones might start a fresh increase. In the stated case, the price could even surpass the $0.5000 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.520 resistance.</p>
<p>Initial support on the downside is near $0.460. The next major support is near the $0.455 level and the channel trend line. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4322 swing low to the $0.4868 high. Any more losses could lead the price toward the $0.440 level, below which the price might even test $0.4000.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jim Cramer – the famed host of “Mad Money” on CNBC – <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/etf/jim-cramer-predicts-bitcoin-s-imminent-demise-%E2%80%94-will-his-record-for-getting-it-wrong-continue-1032189284" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">has commented</a> that bitcoin has no real use case, and he thinks the biggest digital currency by market cap will dry up faster than a riverbed.</p>
<h2>Jim Cramer Thinks BTC Won&#8217;t Last Long</h2>
<p>Is he right? His words come during a time when bitcoin appears to be picking up steam. The currency was depleted of all its resources and energy during 2022, which is arguably the most bearish year on record for bitcoin. During that time, the asset – which had risen to a new all-time high of about $68,000 per unit in November of 2021 – fell to the mid-$16K range roughly 12 months later, meaning the currency lost well over 70 percent of its value.</p>
<p>As a leader of the crypto space, the asset caused many other cryptocurrencies to shrivel up and nearly die along with it. As a result, these assets lost much of their value as well, and the crypto space – which began 2022 at over $3 trillion in value – dropped by more than $2 trillion just one year later. It was a sad and (very) ugly sight to see.</p>
<p>At the same time, it’s not like things like this haven’t happened before. Bitcoin has always been prone to volatility; that’s been its biggest problem. Despite its vulnerability to price swings, however, the currency has always managed to stay in the game. The asset has swung back and forth like a pendulum, always to wind up in a winning circle a few years (or sometimes just a few months) later, and 2023 is no exception.</p>
<p>What we’re seeing right now is probably not something to get hugely excited about. After all, bitcoin is still about 60 percent less than where it was 16 months ago when it first achieved its $60K+ high. However, 2023 is proving to everyone that the currency knows what to do to heal itself.</p>
<p>The asset – which took a major beating, probably more major than anyone could have anticipated – is once again rising through the ranks and is, at press time, trading for just shy of $28,000. This means the currency has nearly doubled where it was at the end of December last year… All within four months.</p>
<h2>This Guy Promoted Silicon Valley Bank, After All</h2>
<p>Cramer has predicted the <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/03/31359732/jim-cramer-predicts-bitcoins-imminent-demise-will-his-record-for-getting-it-wrong-continue" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">death of bitcoin before</a>, but the asset – 15 years after it was initially discussed online – is still alive and trying to do its best for investors and traders around the world. Cramer is also questionable considering he was one of the main advocates for <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-spikes-following-silicon-valley-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">Silicon Valley Bank</a> stock, an institution that recently lost its life during America’s present banking crisis.</p>
<p>So clearly, Cramer isn’t always right, and his words – along with everyone else’s – need to be taken with a strong grain of salt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/first-mover-asia-bitcoin-regains-momentum-as-investors-shrug-off-banking-fed-concerns/ar-AA190seJ" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">gained traction not</a> too long ago even though the Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-shows-great-resilience-in-face-of-interest-rate-hikes/" data-wpel-link="internal">announced it was hiking rates</a> another 0.25 basis points.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Remains Strong</h2>
<p>This is proof that many people have restored their faith in the world’s number one digital currency by market cap and are shirking both Federal Reserve and banking concerns to the side.</p>
<p>The American economy and the banking crisis the country is enduring at the time of writing would likely cause many standard traders and investors to start shivering in their boots, but with bitcoin suddenly regaining its “digital gold” status, there are many people out there willing to let crypto drive them towards the future.</p>
<p>There are problems rearing their ugly heads, however, a big one being that agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seem to be trying to destroy crypto and bring down all it stands for. Earlier today, we published an article <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">talking about how Coinbase</a> – the western world’s most popular and active digital currency trading platform – had been served a Wells notice saying it was on the verge of facing charges.</p>
<p>Benoit Bosc – global head of product at crypto trading firm GSR Markets – commented on the situation and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The crypto ecosystem is under attack. You&#8217;re seeing all those regulation-by-enforcement attempts, but also the banking crisis that has spread to banks (that) serve the crypto community. As a result, you have this flight to quality to the majors. Bitcoin has benefited the most, and it&#8217;s rallied significantly ever since those events have started. This [has] been the case with the action of the Fed yesterday in their refusal to really consider any cuts, but even refusal to pause in the cycle of hikes.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also took issue with Janet Yellen, the current Treasury Secretary. He said that her unwillingness to expand FDIC insurance coverage to deposits and amounts greater than $250K is a huge mistake, especially when the banking world has become so unpredictable. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The first reaction is one that&#8217;s correlated to all risk assets. It&#8217;s a little leg down, but then after that, you do become, you know, you have that store of value, digital gold feature of bitcoin, which is that you still have inflation. They&#8217;re fighting it, but it still exists. Bitcoin has a limited supply, and so that&#8217;s a better alternative. You also have issues with stable coins. So, bitcoin suddenly seems more stable and safer than those at the moment.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Future&#8217;s Bright</h2>
<p>Still, he’s confident about where bitcoin and crypto will go. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>A couple of months ago, it was no one thought we would be there. Those events a couple of years ago would have decimated the market. It&#8217;s very interesting to see how strong the market is… I don&#8217;t see it as a risk on rally.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase just can’t seem to catch a break. Not long ago, the company <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/suit-against-coinbase-is-headed-for-the-supreme-court/" data-wpel-link="internal">was the subject of</a> a lawsuit that’s now being examined by the U.S. Supreme Court, and the trading platform is also the receiver of a <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/is-coinbase-part-of-unhealthy-regulatory-climate-3-analysts-react-to-sec-notice-see-upside-downside-risks-increasing-substantially-1032188433" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">Wells notice sent by</a> the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), proving once again that the agency has just become a complete bully to all digital currency firms.</p>
<h2>Will the SEC Go After Coinbase?</h2>
<p>To be clear, Coinbase has not been charged with anything at the time of writing, though a Wells notice usually implies that charges are coming at some point in the not-so-distant future. The SEC has made it clear how it feels about staking and securities in the past, and now, the agency is alleging that Coinbase may have broken securities laws.</p>
<p>Analysts at Key Banc have mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>No charges/enforcement action were presented against Coinbase connected to the Wells notice as of March 22, 2023, though such notices generally precede future charges/enforcement action per our understanding. We can’t assess the model impact with high confidence at this juncture given the apparent lack of detail from the SEC and obvious lack of explicit charges/enforcement action, though [we] do recognize the materiality of certain products/services mentioned in the company’s announcement as it relates to revenue/adjusted EBITDA contribution.</p></blockquote>
<p>They also commented that should regulatory action in the United States against the crypto space continue (and it likely will), Coinbase won’t be the only company that suffers. They stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Following the Wells notice from the SEC and the recent economic report of the President criticizing the digital asset industry, we are downgrading COIN from outperform to perform. We raised concerns about blockchain development in the U.S. after the demise of three banks… Under this unhealthy regulatory climate, we are increasingly worried about the fairness of the enforcement actions, and the ability for the ecosystem to grow with seemingly limited and shrinking support from the banking system in the U.S.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shares in Coinbase fell by more than 16 percent following news of the notice. The analysts finished with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Recent strength in bitcoin indicates that people have called for alternative financial systems, but it could also become the victim of its success. While we downgrade Coinbase shares, we believe both upside opportunities and downside risk have increased substantially, and we may find an attractive risk/reward entry point in the future.</p></blockquote>
<h2>There Have Been Other Victims</h2>
<p>It seems the SEC has been on a role to persecute any crypto firms that go against its narrative. One of the most recent victims of the SEC’s digital <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-sec-trying-to-kill-crypto-for-good/" data-wpel-link="internal">wrath was trading</a> firm Kraken, which per a settlement, was forced to part with about $30 million in penalty fees.</p>
<p>In addition, the company was made to end all its staking activities and services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Federal agents have arrested Charles Riley Constant, an owner of digital currency ATMs under the Coindawg name. At the time of writing, he <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/mar/23/bitcoin-atms-were-used-launder-covid-fraud-money-f/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">has been charged with</a> money laundering, and he’s been accused of stealing COVID pandemic-based loans and converting them to BTC and other forms of crypto to hide them from prying eyes.</p>
<h2>Charles Constant Is Facing Money Laundering Charges</h2>
<p>Money laundering has long been a serious problem in the crypto space. As of late, we have received several reports and witnessed several headlines talking about <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/north-korea-crypto-mixer-tornado-cash-sanctioned-by-u-s/" data-wpel-link="internal">foreign crypto mixers</a> being shut down by agencies such as the Department of Justice (DOJ). Many of these mixers have allegedly been utilized by terrorist states such as North Korea to hide stolen digital funds which are then used to fund ongoing nuclear programs.</p>
<p>In the latest case, Constant is alleged to have been part of a scheme that claimed more than $1 million in COVID loans. Prosecutors claim he laundered as much as $700,000 of that money and sent it back to his co-conspirators through bitcoin purchases, while the remaining $300K he was quick to pocket himself. The money was “washed clean” through his Coindawg ATMs, and he was arrested for his purported crimes in late March.</p>
<p>Damian Williams – the U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York and no stranger to criminal cases in the digital currency arena – commented in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>He converted the bulk of the crime proceeds into bitcoin for his co-conspirators and used a portion of the rest to start his own lucrative cryptocurrency ATM business.</p></blockquote>
<p>During the COVID era, many businesses could file for what were called PPP loans to ensure they had the money to stay afloat and pay their remaining employees while enduring a harsh economy brought on by the virus. While this certainly came from noble intent, the ploy led to heavy loads of crime amongst executives and entrepreneurs who used the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/a-texas-crypto-firm-is-in-trouble-for-committing-covid-program-fraud/" data-wpel-link="internal">money for illicit purposes</a>, especially given loan forgiveness was in place for companies that met certain terms.</p>
<p>Authorities claim the Small Business Administration (SBA) loans used by Constant were filed under false companies and identities. With the money he kept, he purchased the crypto ATM machines in question and had them stationed in both Texas and Oklahoma. Through these machines, he garnered as much as $3 million in crypto withdrawals and was able to collect on 15 percent transaction fees for every action.</p>
<h2>So Much Crime Through BTC ATMs</h2>
<p>As part of their investigation, federal agents have seized as many as 18 of these machines at press time.</p>
<p>Crypto crime has long occurred via bitcoin ATMs. Not long ago, we published a story about an elderly man living in Connecticut that was conned into sending $60K in BTC <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/east-lyme-resident-loses-60k-to-crypto-scammers/" data-wpel-link="internal">to scammers through</a> a crypto ATM.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A crypto-centered lawsuit with popular digital currency exchange Coinbase as the defendant <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/coinbases-landmark-supreme-court-hearing-124236072.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">is heading to the</a> Supreme Court. This marks the first time such a high-ranking court in the U.S. has ever considered such a case.</p>
<h2>The Supreme Court Is Examining a Coinbase Suit</h2>
<p>The plaintiff is a man who was, at one point, a customer of Coinbase. It’s alleged the man gave a scammer (who was pretending to be a representative of PayPal) remote access to his Coinbase account. This cost him more than $30K. He has now filed suit against the digital trading platform, claiming the company’s security measures were not what they could have been.</p>
<p>Coinbase is asking the Supreme Court to butt out. It says such issues should only be handled through arbitration. Right now, it appears the Supreme Court is heavily divided on the issue, and no answer as to whether the Justices will go forward has been provided at the time of writing. However, the case certainly marks a precedent for the digital currency arena in many ways, and it’s become clear that the U.S. has never taken digital assets as seriously as it is doing now.</p>
<p>Ever since the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">collapse of FTX</a>, the once famed digital currency trading enterprise based in the Bahamas, many politicians and regulators throughout the country have called for heightened crypto supervision as they supposedly don’t want similar problems occurring in the future. This would all be fine and dandy except for one thing… Many of the politicians that are calling for said regulation <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-gave-a-lot-of-money-to-democrats-what-will-they-do-with-it/" data-wpel-link="internal">have benefited</a> greatly from FTX.</p>
<p>People like Joe Biden and several democrat office holders received heavy donations from the likes of Sam Bankman-Fried, the man behind FTX. These donations likely came in the form of stolen customer funds, which were also used to pay off loans for another company (Alameda Research) and invest in luxury Bahamian real estate. This has gotten SBF into loads of trouble, and he’s now on the verge of <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-to-await-trial-at-his-parents-house/" data-wpel-link="internal">going to trial</a> for fraud charges.</p>
<p>All this and more puts something of a dark cloud over crypto regulation in the U.S., so while it’s certainly a positive thing that the Supreme Court would be willing to look at a case like this, it <em>does</em> cast a bit of a pall over the industry in that those in charge as of late haven’t taken on the forms of the “cleanest” or most honest people, so how much do traders really want members of the U.S. government interfering in the crypto arena, especially when it was designed to be autonomous?</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Let the Data Out!</h2>
<p>Regarding the case, Coinbase lawyer Neal Katyal explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>If [the plaintiffs] try and force discovery in the district court, and then they get access to discovery, which may have embarrassing details, it could spill out into the newspapers.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin has shown the world just how resilient it can be. Not long ago, the Federal Reserve decided to raise <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/federal-reserve-hikes-rates-again-what-will-happen-to-btc/" data-wpel-link="internal">interest rates by another</a> 0.25 basis points. Under normal circumstances, the price of bitcoin would fall, and this time around was no exception as the world’s number one digital currency by market cap dropped from $28K to $26K.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Is Still Alive and Kicking</h2>
<p>However, things didn’t stay there long, and <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/cryptocurrencies-fall-as-investors-weigh-the-feds-latest-rate-decision-bitcoin-slides-toward-25000/ar-AA18X2EX" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">just a day or so later</a>, BTC was back at $28,000 per unit, an increase of about 70 percent from where it was during the final two months of 2022, arguably the most bearish year on record for the asset.</p>
<p>This was the ninth consecutive interest rate hike enforced by the Fed, and it was believed that the current banking crisis being witnessed in America would be enough to convince the Fed’s top members that interest rate hikes needed to end altogether or should at least be curbed. Alas, this is not the case, and Jerome Powell – the man in charge of the agency – has stated 2023 is still prone to further hikes given inflation remains a problem.</p>
<p>Michael Safai of crypto trading company Dexterity Capital took issue with the Fed’s attitude and stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The hope was that the long-awaited dovish tone from the Fed would finally arrive in the midst of this banking crisis. Those hopes were dashed by Powell&#8217;s comments that rate hikes could continue so long as things continued to stabilize, weakening some of the momentum that has been leading crypto&#8217;s rise in recent days. A lot of what has driven the latest bitcoin rally – the ongoing weakness in the banking system and the potential for increases in central bank balance sheets – hasn&#8217;t disappeared completely. This could provide a floor for cryptocurrencies once the broader institutional reaction to the Fed settles down.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also mentioned that while bitcoin is again up, some people are likely to experience fear from the recent (and temporary) dip bitcoin incurred, and that this could be enough to limit trading prospects for a little while. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think a lot of traders will be deflated by bitcoin&#8217;s retreat towards $25,000, since the markets were really hoping to break past the symbolic $30,000 mark. This will probably sap some of the momentum behind crypto prices in the short term, but that could easily change if the banking sector continues to show weakness. For now, volatility is spiking again, bringing some much-needed volume and energy to the markets.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Leave It to Yellen to Say Something Stupid</h2>
<p>Investors are getting a few other backhanded slaps at the time of writing in the form of comments made by present Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Yellen explained she is not considering expanding FDIC coverage for deposits greater than $250K.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>SocialFi platform Lynk set to launch its exclusive Node NFT Program to foster the growth of a decentralized Web3 community</em></strong></p>
<p>Lynk is setting the stage for a new era in decentralized community governance with the introduction of its <a href="https://app.lynk.im/#/mint/node-nft" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Node NFT Program</a>. Aimed at empowering early adopters, this groundbreaking initiative is expected to facilitate the growth of a vibrant community in Web3, while showcasing the company&#8217;s commitment to innovation and inclusivity.</p>
<p>The SocialFi platform has made great strides in the first quarter of 2023, most notably with the launch of its much anticipated Finder and Keeper NFT collections. In March, Lynk introduced its NFT staking function, allowing users to stake their NFTs to earn attractive rewards. Lynk’s decision to launch on the Arbitrum network, has also enabled faster transactions and lower fees for its users.</p>
<h4>Node NFT Program</h4>
<p>The Node NFT Program is a strategic move designed to provide advanced level Keeper NFTs to community members who are actively contributing and looking to get ahead faster. By offering unique rewards and opportunities, Lynk aims to utilize the program to drive stronger participation within its growing ecosystem. The goal is to ensure that the platform remains dynamic, competitive, and appealing to new users, while also providing existing members with fresh avenues for growth.</p>
<p>There are 3 tiers of Node NFTs that can be minted in Gen I of the program; Common, Special, and Rare tiers. Each of them comes with a different amount of Charisma (CA) points and Attribute Points (AP), offering holders different advantages in levelling up their NFTs for greater rewards and benefits. These Keeper NFTs will advance straight to Legendary rank and members will receive additional rewards as they help to expand and grow the Lynk community.</p>
<h4>Something Different, Something New</h4>
<p>In today&#8217;s fast-paced world of technology, the Lynk Node NFT Program stands as a prime example of how Web3 values can be seamlessly integrated into daily interactions. By focusing on decentralization, ownership, and privacy, Lynk allows users to take control of their digital lives, leading the way for a more equitable and transparent decentralised ecosystem.</p>
<p>The potential for expansion is immense, with plans to introduce additional generations of Node NFTs that may feature even more attractive rewards and benefits. The company believes that a fair and transparent assessment process is crucial for the platform&#8217;s continued success; to guarantee the long-term success and sustainability of the program, Lynk is committed to ongoing evaluation and refinement of its offerings based on user feedback and engagement metrics.</p>
<p>Lynk&#8217;s Node NFT Program is poised to play a significant role in promoting the adoption of Web3 values and help shape a decentralised future. By nurturing a passionate and skilled community of early adopters, the company hopes to collectively work towards the creation of a fairer and more equitable digital world.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Lynk&#8217;s vision extends beyond its own platform, aspiring to be a catalyst for change in the broader Web3 space. The company aims to inspire other platforms and communities to embrace values such as decentralization, transparency, and user ownership that can help drive the industry forward. The Node NFT Program is just the beginning of Lynk&#8217;s journey toward realizing this vision, and the company invites interested parties; partners, developers and users, to join them as they embark on this mission.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk is pushing bitcoin and other digital currencies in the midst of the U.S. banking crisis and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/03/23/banks-are-melting-elon-musk-sends-warning-to-joe-biden-and-the-fed-amid-wild-bitcoin-ethereum-and-crypto-price-swings/?sh=48200f1c7198" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">recently posted a tweet</a> in which he makes fun of criminal-in-chief Joe Biden.</p>
<h2>Elon Musk Takes Issue with Biden</h2>
<p>Not long ago, the phony president of the United States issued comments on social media talking about his administration’s climate change achievements. This is the first sign that something is wrong. The banks are failing, the economy is in shambles, people are still left behind in Afghanistan, and you want to be talking about how you’ve lowered carbon emissions by half a point or something? This is downright ridiculous, and Tesla’s Elon Musk was one of the first to notice.</p>
<p>In a response to Biden, Musk wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>The banks are melting.</p></blockquote>
<p>For all that Biden has allegedly done to prevent glaciers from dying, he hasn’t implemented the same tactics for financial institutions, it seems. At the time of writing, several U.S. and European financial firms – like Silvergate, Signature, and Silicon Valley – <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/as-more-banks-fell-bitcoin-rose-beyond-28k/" data-wpel-link="internal">have crashed and burned</a>, and others were on the brink of collapsing (such as Credit Suisse) <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/19/ubs-agrees-to-buy-credit-suisse-as-regulators-look-to-shore-up-global-banking-system.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">before being saved</a> by other institutions at the last minute.</p>
<p>The situation is also not being helped by the Federal Reserve. Not long ago, Jerome Powell – aka the “Fed head” – announced <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/federal-reserve-hikes-rates-again-what-will-happen-to-btc/" data-wpel-link="internal">that interest rate hikes</a> were again in order. Another 0.25 basis points were added to America’s already expanding interest rates. Any economist – or general member of the public – could tell these morons that THIS WAS NOT THE TIME for another rate hike. When banks are crashing left and right, at the very least, you leave things the way they are.</p>
<p>Jerome Powell has commented that the U.S. is not out of the woods yet when it comes to inflation, and thus interest rate hikes are still probable throughout 2023. Still, Ilya Volkov – chief executive of Swiss-based international fintech platform You Hodler – commented that the situation could be worse, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>After the collapse of Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, the Fed reduced its aggressive rhetoric, which was a positive signal for financial markets despite the sharp drops in bank stocks. The positive impact is also clearly seen in the bond market. The yield spread between two-year and ten-year U.S. treasuries, the main indicators for financial professionals, significantly decreased lately. So, a future 25 basis point increase by the Fed is already in the price.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Bitcoin Is Staying Strong</h2>
<p>The good news is that bitcoin and other forms of crypto appear to be weathering the storm. BTC is still trading for over $28,000, meaning it has shot up 70 percent from where it was at the end of 2022.</p>
<p>This is a good sign that the currency has managed to mature somewhat and push beyond the issues of the previous year.</p>
