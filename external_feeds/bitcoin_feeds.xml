However, intriguingly, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> sales on secondary markets, specifically crypto exchanges, do not. A verdict that has sparked a ripple, pun intended, in the crypto space, potentially creating waves of disarray for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</strong></p>
<p><em>The following opinion editorial was written by Joseph Collement, General Counsel at Bitcoin.com.</em></p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/what-does-the-xrp-not-a-security-ruling-mean-for-other-cryptocurrencies-7561320">legal ruling</a> re-echoes the content of the now-infamous 2018 Hinman speech, a speech that the SEC passionately endeavored to keep out of the Ripple case&#x2019;s evidentiary repertoire. This is the same speech whose author, Hinman, was meticulously<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-quietly-removes-director-william-201214915.html"> wiped off</a> the SEC&#x2019;s official website in June 2023, much to the bemusement and consternation of the crypto community. The echo from Hinman&#x2019;s 2018 address rings louder in the SEC&#x2019;s now empty corridors.</p>
<h2>Who Is William Hinman, and Why Does His Speech Matter?</h2>
<p>William Hinman served as the Director of the Division of Corporation Finance at the SEC from 2017 to 2020. On June 14, 2018, Hinman, in a thought-provoking proposition,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418"> suggested</a> that cryptocurrency startups could initially sell tokens as securities to raise funds before transitioning to non-security utility tokens once their networks are operational and the tokens have a functional use.</p>
<p>This perspective recognizes the dynamic nature of digital assets and how their classification can evolve over time, aligning with the economic reality of cryptocurrency projects. This adaptive approach to crypto token regulation, endorsed by SEC Chairman Jay Clayton in 2019, showcased an understanding of the &#x201C;economic reality&#x201D; that while some projects may satisfy the Howey test for securities at their inception, this status can evolve over time.</p>
<h2>The SEC&#x2019;s U-Turn and the Ensuing Saga</h2>
<p>The SEC&#x2019;s initial challenge to Hinman&#x2019;s speech being admissible as evidence in the Ripple case was premised on two assertions. First, the speech was not a reflection of the SEC&#x2019;s official stance. Second, the speech was privileged, owing to Hinman&#x2019;s role as the Director of Corporation Finance. However, the court was unimpressed by SEC&#x2019;s arguments and ruled the speech admissible on a limited basis.</p>
<p>In an eyebrow-raising move, the SEC decided to erase Hinman&#x2019;s digital footprint from its official website on June 6, 2023, a decision that did not go unnoticed by the ever-vigilant crypto community. This deliberate purge underscored the lengths to which the SEC was willing to go to prevent Ripple from using Hinman&#x2019;s insight as part of their defense.</p>

<h2>What Are the Implications for the SEC?</h2>
<p>The Ripple ruling, if used as a legal precedent in ongoing and future cases, could deal a devastating blow to the SEC. The court&#x2019;s verdict implies that digital assets traded on secondary markets do not fall under the umbrella of securities, relieving crypto exchanges from the necessity to register with the SEC.</p>
<p>This means that the SEC&#x2019;s hard-fought crusade for jurisdiction over crypto exchanges and digital assets could be rendered futile. Such an outcome is a hard pill to swallow for the regulatory body. However, it could open the door to a new era of thoughtful regulation. Regulation that seeks to safeguard consumers while simultaneously encouraging innovation, without burdening it with unwieldy and costly regulatory prerequisites.</p>
<p>The Ripple case not only highlights the ongoing struggle to define and regulate cryptocurrencies but also illustrates the potential for significant shifts in the regulatory landscape based on a single court decision. The SEC, on its part, needs to adapt to these ever-evolving realities of the crypto world rather than resort to prejudgment, erasure, and denial. After all, the crypto tide is not going to recede anytime soon.</p>

He conveyed that this significant alignment with the five major emerging economies could potentially unlock unprecedented economic prospects for all the nations. </strong></p>
<h2>Algeria Sets Sights on BRICS</h2>
<p>In anticipation of the forthcoming BRICS Summit, there might be <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currency-not-on-agenda-for-leaders-summit-nations-to-focus-on-de-dollarization/">less emphasis</a> on the oft-debated BRICS reserve currency, yet <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-interest-soars-40-countries-seek-membership-as-de-dollarization-efforts-grow/">over 40 nations</a> exhibit a keen interest in becoming part of this influential bloc.</p>
<p>Ambassador Anil Sooklal, South Africa&#8217;s envoy to BRICS, <a href="https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2023/05/24/more-than-30-countries-want-to-join-the-brics/">subtly hinted</a> at an imminent expansion of the group this year. According to a Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/algeria-applies-join-brics-would-contribute-15-bln-group-bank-2023-07-21/#:~:text=TUNIS%2C%20July%2021%20(Reuters),President%20Abdelmadjid%20Tebboune%20as%20saying.">report</a> via Ennahar TV, Algerian president Abdelmadjid Tebboune has announced that Algeria has officially sought to join the BRICS group, currently made up of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;We officially applied to join the BRICS group, we sent a letter asking to be shareholder members in the bank &#8230; Algeria&#8217;s first contribution in the bank will be $1.5 billion,&#8221; Tebboune told Ennahar in a statement.</p>
<p>Algeria boasts a wealth of resources, ready to enrich the BRICS collective with <a href="https://oec.world/en/profile/country/dza">petroleum gas</a>, crude petroleum, nitrogenous fertilizers, and ammonia. Additionally, the country is a trove of mineral wealth, much of it still ripe for exploration and development. This includes bountiful reserves of iron ore, phosphate, and precious metals like gold.</p>

<p>Eager to steer its economy towards diversification, Algeria is now setting its sights on maximizing its <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2022/10/17/how-algeria-is-to-turning-to-its-mineral-resources-to-diversify-its-economy">untapped gold resources</a>. At present, Algeria&#8217;s economy largely depends on the ever-fluctuating global hydrocarbon prices. However, a potential surge is in sight as the World Bank <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2023/01/04/algerian-economy-staying-the-course-for-transition">projects</a> a 2.3% growth in Algeria&#8217;s GDP this year.</p>
<p>The much-awaited 15th BRICS Summit is scheduled to be held in Johannesburg, South Africa, from August 22-24, 2023. This summit will signify the first in-person meeting since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Notably, Russian president <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/putin-warns-of-increased-financial-crisis-risk-says-russia-is-being-subjected-to-hybrid-war/">Vladimir Putin</a> has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/historic-brics-summit-to-be-held-without-putin-in-person/">reportedly</a> opted not to attend this year. While it remains uncertain if new countries will be welcomed into the BRICS alliance, speculation surrounding this topic has reached unprecedented levels.</p>

These crypto assets, used within Telegram&#8217;s ecosystem, are leveraged to facilitate automated trades for users on decentralized exchange (dex) platforms. These distinctive crypto assets have turned into a growing economy worth $138 million.</strong></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram Bot Coins Enter the Crypto Marketplace</span></h2>
<p>The evolution of the cryptocurrency landscape is a spectacle, consistently enriched by an array of inventive projects. Notably, <a href="https://archive.ph/Pt2uK">Telegram bot coins</a> have created <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%201-d&amp;q=Telegram%20bot%20coins&amp;hl=en">interest</a> among crypto investors. They are a type of cryptocurrency used within the Telegram ecosystem, serving as automated programs that facilitate trades for users on decentralized exchanges (dexs) and can implement yield farming strategies.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, these coins empower users by facilitating token trades through Telegram, all in an uncomplicated, chat-like environment. The leading Telegram bot coin in terms of market valuation today is <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/unibot">unibot (UNIBOT)</a>, boasting a market cap of $117 million. Unibot&#8217;s market cap represents more than 84% of the total Telegram bot coin economy. Below unibot, seven additional Telegram bot coins each hold a market cap of $1 million or more.</p>
<p>The second largest, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/mevfree">mevfree (MEVFREE)</a>, has a valuation of around $5.7 million. Of the 36 Telegram bot tokens <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/telegram-bots#:~:text=The%20Telegram%20Bots%20market%20cap,in%20the%20last%2024%20hours.">listed</a> on coingecko.com, the crypto assets have tallied $32.40 million in global trade volume in the past 24 hours. On coingecko.com, the unibot (UNIBOT) listing carries two warnings. One indicates the project&#8217;s migration to a new contract while the second cautions about a variable tax function on the smart contract. “Do your own research and be careful if you are trading this token,” the warning on coingecko.com advises.</p>

<p>With a circulating supply of 1 million unibot tokens, <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xf819d9cb1c2a819fd991781a822de3ca8607c3c9">etherscan.io</a> shows a count of 4,122 token holders. The top ten unibot wallet holders <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/unibot/richlist/">control 16.40%</a> of the total supply. The top 50 holders possess 42.58% of the 1 million unibot coins, and the top 100 addresses control 56.55% of the supply. In comparison, the second-largest Telegram bot coin, mevfree, has <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/mevfree/richlist/">fewer holders</a> with 961 wallets as of July 24.</p>

<p>The top ten mevfree holders govern 43.58% of the total supply, amounting to 52,689,548 mevfree. The coin&#8217;s top 100 wallets encompass 80.52% of the supply. Alongside the inherent volatility of Telegram bot tokens, they feature a pronounced concentration among sizable holders.</p>

Yet, it has since experienced a downturn of $1.42 billion. Over the last week, eight of the top 10 AI-based crypto tokens saw declines against the U.S. dollar.</strong></p>
<h2>Downturn Hits AI Crypto Market</h2>
<p>Once a thriving market, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/cryptos/ai/">AI-focused cryptocurrency assets</a> have undergone considerable value reductions in the past four months. On February 27, 2023, the AI crypto economy was worth around $4.03 billion, but by May 28, 2023, it had lost $1 billion in value. Since that time, an additional 420 million has been shed from the AI-focused crypto coin market.</p>

<p>Cumulatively, since its peak at the end of February, roughly $1.42 billion has been stripped from the AI-crypto economy&#8217;s worth. The previous week wasn&#8217;t particularly favorable for the top ten coins in this sector either, with most of the leading AI-focused crypto assets recording losses over the last seven days. The top AI crypto asset by market capitalization &#8211; graph (GRT) &#8211; dropped by 4.97% during this period as singularitynet (AGIX) fell by 7.99%.</p>
<p>Ocean protocol (OCEAN) registered the largest loss among the top ten AI tokens this past week with a decline of 13.7% against the U.S. dollar. Fetch.ai (FET) saw a negative impact of 9.94%, while dkargo (DKA) experienced a 4.38% increase. Iexec rlc (RLC) plunged by 8.18%, numeraire (NMR) dipped by 2.56%, and covalent (CQT) experienced a moderate rise of 2.26%. Alethea liquid intelligence (ALI) fell by 7.84%, and phala network (PHA) decreased by 5.62% in value against the greenback.</p>

<p>In total, the combined value of all 89 AI-centric crypto tokens declined by 2.85% over the past day and 5.73% within the previous week. Figures from the last 24 hours suggest that the AI-based coin sector has witnessed $309 million in global trade volume. Weekly data indicates that the top three AI-driven crypto tokens by gains were blockbank (BBANK), idena (IDNA), and ai meta club (AMC), soaring between 46% and 218% during this week.</p>

While the clothes dryer serves to dry clean laundry, the machine also compensates the owner in satoshis.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Mining&#x2019;s Novel Approach to Reusing Heat</h2>
<p>The use of bitcoin miners for purposes beyond mining the leading cryptocurrency, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, such as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gas-to-bitcoin-mining-firm-crusoe-energy-systems-raises-505-million/">removing flare</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/landfill-gas-mitigation-firm-vespene-energy-gas-to-bitcoin-solutions/">landfill gases</a> from the environment, has steadily gained traction in recent years. Additionally, bitcoin mining rigs have been repurposed to utilize excess heat for a variety of applications, including using it to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cryptomatoes-using-excess-mining-heat-to-grow-produce/">grow tomatoes</a>.</p>
<p>A bathhouse in New York City <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtuESmhoicI/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D">uses</a> bitcoin miners to heat its pools, and many others have <a href="https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1399472395954626565?s=20">heated hot tubs</a> with bitcoin ASICs. &#x200B;&#x200B;On July 19, 2023, a Twitter user named &#x201C;Rev.Hodl&#x201D; shared a video and images of a clothes dryer that doubles as a bitcoin miner.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Bitcoin Mining Clothes Dryer,&#x201D; Rev.Hodl <a href="https://twitter.com/HodlRev/status/1681835542109888512?s=20">tweeted</a>. &#x201C;Using a bitcoin miner instead of the heating element to dry laundry. Less than $100 in materials this dryer pays back sats for the power it uses to dry.&#x201D; Rev.Hodl also shared details on his Nostr account, noting his penchant for replacing any electric heat source with an ASIC miner.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/HodlRev/status/1659021401578172417?s=20">tweet</a> from May, Rev.Hodl provided examples of a portable space heater, lamb incubator, food dehydrator, and excess solar power hashing. Large-scale miners are also cognizant of the potential benefits bitcoin mining can offer in terms of reusing heat.</p>
<p>Recently, researchers from Hashrate Index and members of the Luxor team visited a bitcoin mine operated by Microbt in Texas. The <a href="https://hashrateindex.com/blog/a-look-inside-an-immersion-and-hydro-bitcoin-mine/">report</a> also addressed the topic of immersion and hydro-cooled machines, specifically highlighting the HS20 hydro container.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://heatcore.tech/2022/10/20/microbt-and-heat-core-inaugurate-first-hydro-cooling-and-heat-recovery-pilot-in-usa/">device</a>, constructed by <a href="https://heatcore.tech">Heat Core</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/samsungs-3nm-gaa-chip-discovered-in-microbts-next-gen-bitcoin-mining-rig/">Microbt</a>, accommodates two hydro-powered Microbt Whatsminer units and can also warm water in a home of up to 200 square meters. The HS20 hydro container is capable of heating a small swimming pool, up to 40 square meters, with a heating capacity of 17,200 kcal/h, according to the Hashrate Index report.</p>

<p>The authors of the report indicate the noise level is relatively low and comparable to the noise on &#x201C;a residential street or a normal conversation between two people.&#x201D; As ASIC miners generate significant heat, this byproduct can be harnessed to power a range of both small and large-scale heating processes.</p>

<p>These include heating buildings, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/genesis-mining-is-converting-excess-bitcoin-datacenter-heat-into-greenhouse-power-in-sweden/">warming greenhouses</a> for agriculture, or providing heat for industrial procedures. Repurposing heat from bitcoin mining can transform an operational expense into a dual-purpose investment or entirely offset heating costs.</p>
<p>The considerable heat output of mining operations, especially when paired with efficient heat capture and distribution systems, could revolutionize heating economics, particularly in colder climates. For instance, in 2018, a woman in Irkutsk, a province of Siberia in Russia, used bitcoin miners for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-bitcoin-mining-granny-is-bullish-on-industrys-future/">heating purposes</a> and to accumulate bitcoin.</p>

<p>The <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> Ecosystem Fund, renowned for its commitment to pioneering advancements in the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> space, seeks to foster cutting-edge innovations. Projects demonstrating clear Web3 innovation rationale and value capture potential, as well as assets enhancing <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>&#x2019;s diversity with native, secure, and transparent attributes, are of particular interest. Additionally, the Fund is keen on applications, infrastructure, and gateways that elevate <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>&#x2019;s reputation and usability, along with user-friendly solutions that drive business growth. The Fund is also intrigued by globally-consensus-building DAOs and applications leveraging the &#x201C;mirror world&#x201D; concept for technological and financial innovation.</p>
<p>Director Peng Wang disclosed the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> Ecosystem Fund&#x2019;s bold $20 million investment in the Cashtokens ecosystem. Since 2018, the Fund has gained extensive experience investing in various BCH-related ventures, spanning wallets, exchanges, media, and gaming.</p>
<p>The recent approval of the Cashtokens protocol in the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> mainnet upgrade marks a strategic shift for the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> Ecosystem Fund, which is now focusing on supporting Cashtokens-based initiatives. Peng emphasized Cashtokens&#x2019;s role in enabling near Turing-complete smart contracts on the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> Network, a milestone once considered infeasible for UTXO networks. Compared to existing solutions for token standardization on UTXO networks, Cashtokens offer superior user experience and smart contract capabilities, resolving prior issues faced by platforms like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>.</p>
<p>Peng envisions creating an &#x201C;Image world&#x201D; on the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> Network, featuring an array of financial and decentralized applications supported by <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> as the foundational currency. Though in its early stages, the Cashtokens ecosystem has already shown promise with platforms like CRC20 and fex.cash. The market value of Cashtokens assets surpassing $200 million further fuels optimism for future development.</p>

Speculators believe the new platform will allow users to make crypto payments. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, on the other hand, fell to a ten-day low.</strong></p>
<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Dogecoin surged by as much as 5% to start the week, as traders reacted to the news Twitter was rebranding to X.</p>
<p>Following the announcement, Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino tweeted that &#x201C;X is the future state of unlimited interactivity &#x2013; centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking &#x2013; creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities. Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we&#x2019;re just beginning to imagine.&#x201D;</p>
<p>DOGE/USD hit an intraday high of $0.07718 earlier in the day, following Sunday&#x2019;s low at $0.07056.</p>

<p>From the chart, the move came after a breakout occurred at the $0.0760 level, pushing the meme coin to its highest point since May 6.</p>
<p>This resulted in the relative strength index (RSI) escaping its own ceiling at 63.00, and it is currently at 65.46.</p>
<p>Traders will likely continue targeting the $0.08000 level.</p>

<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> plunged to a ten-day low on Monday, as market sentiment seems to have shifted bearish in recent days.</p>
<p>After surging to a high of $0.7506 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD has started the week at a low of $0.6901.</p>
<p>This is the lowest level the token has traded at since June 13, when price was trading below $0.5000.</p>

<p>As a result of the decline, the RSI edged below a floor of 57.00, and is currently at a reading of 56.72.</p>
<p>Should the index extend its drop under this point, bears will likely look to take <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> back towards $0.5600.</p>

Block generation periods have been lagging behind their typical ten-minute average of late, registering at an elongated 12 minutes per block on July 21, and almost 11 minutes per block on the subsequent day.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s High Difficulty Level on the Verge of Reduction</h2>
<p>The forthcoming recalibration of Bitcoin&#8217;s difficulty is slated to happen on or about July 26. Following a notable rise of 6.45% on July 11, it&#8217;s projected that there could be a downward adjustment ranging from <a href="https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/">3.9%</a> to <a href="https://btc.com/stats/diff">4.04%</a>. Bitcoin&#8217;s block generation occurs roughly every ten minutes and every 2,016 blocks, a drop in the difficulty of mining takes place if the process of discovering those blocks extends beyond two weeks. Conversely, the level of difficulty increases if the mining of 2,016 blocks is completed in less than two weeks.</p>

<p>Block intervals on July 21 and 22 <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-confirmationtime.html#3m">were longer</a> than the usual ten minutes, lasting from 11 to more than 12 minutes. While the hashrate reached a high on July 8, the hashrate has been lower with an average of 371.1 exahash per second (EH/s) over the last 2,016 blocks. Over the past three days, Foundry USA commands 30.08% of the global hashrate with 111.75 EH/s which is followed by Antpool’s 86.92 EH/s or 23.39% of the total hashrate. F2pool, Binance Pool, and Viabtc follow the two mining pool leaders.</p>

<p>Currently, as of July 24, block times have shown signs of improvement, <a href="https://www.bitcoinsensus.com/bitcoin-halving-countdown/">marginally dipping below</a> the ten-minute average and at times, leveling off slightly above it at ten minutes and 24 seconds. On Monday, 8:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST), the backlog is teeming with between <a href="https://mempool.space">265,000 to 280,000 transactions</a> in a holding pattern, waiting for their turn to be confirmed.</p>

<p>Miners are still wrestling with the protracted issue of clearing the backlog that&#8217;s been bottlenecking the blockchain for months. In order to untangle the pile-up of unconfirmed transactions, it&#8217;s essential to clear 95 blocks. An impending difficulty reduction in a couple of days stands to ease the path for mining participants in their quest to discover these blocks.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) was on the brink of falling outside of the $29,000 mark on Monday, as traders began to prepare for a big week of economic data.</p>
<p>Following Sunday&#x2019;s high of $30,330.64, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD slipped to an intraday low of $29,068.48 earlier in the session.</p>
<p>This drop has resulted in bitcoin falling to its weakest point since June 21, which is the last time price was below $29,000.</p>

<p>Overall, bitcoin is over 3% lower than at the same time last week, with today&#x2019;s sell-off coming when the relative strength index (RSI) fell below a floor of 45.00.</p>
<p>Currently, price strength is tracking at 42.93, with the next visible resistance point at the 41.00 mark.</p>
<p>Should the index reach this level, it is highly likely that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will be trading around the $28,800 level.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Additionally, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also edged lower to start the week, once again dropping below $1,900.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD slipped to a bottom at $1,837.98 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after peaking at $1,904.48.</p>
<p>Similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, ethereum has moved to a multi-week low as a result, with the price trading at its weakest point since June 8.</p>

<p>A downward crossover of the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages has also occurred, which is a sign of potential bearish sentiment.</p>
<p>Further, the RSI is now at a reading of 44.67, which is its lowest point since June 19, when price was last under $1,800.</p>
<p>Bears may make another attempt to leave the $1,800 mark in the coming days.</p>

The U.S.-based blockchain firm also plans an expansion in the U.K. and Europe, according to media reports quoting Ripple executives. </strong></p>
<h2>Ripple Favors Regulated Markets as U.S. Continues to Deal With Crypto Platforms Individually</h2>
<p>Ripple, the company behind the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> cryptocurrency, plans to remain focused on markets governed by clear regulatory frameworks, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Saturday. The payment operator revealed its intentions after a court win against U.S. regulators who maintain a case-by-case approach in dealing with industry players, including separate <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/">legal actions</a> against token issuers.</p>
<p>Last week, a U.S. judge <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-judge-rules-xrp-not-necessarily-a-security-on-its-face-sending-xrp-supporters-into-celebration/">ruled</a> that Ripple&#x2019;s <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> token does not constitute a security when sold on third-party exchanges, opening the way for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> to be traded by retail investors. However, the court said that when sold by the company directly to institutional investors, it qualifies as a security which will be the subject of another trial.</p>
<p>The ruling is largely viewed as a setback for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which sued Ripple in 2020. This week, in a new filing for its lawsuit against Terraform Labs and its co-founder Do Kwon, the regulator <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-says-xrp-ruling-in-ripple-case-wrongly-decided-signals-appeal/">told</a> a U.S. federal court that some court decisions in the case against Ripple were wrong, signaling it&#x2019;s going to appeal.</p>
<p>&#x201C;While this is a huge win for Ripple, a huge win for the industry, we have to see if this moves the needle in terms of getting regulatory clarity, or if the SEC [is] going to continue with a &#x2018;regulation by enforcement&#x2019; approach, which picks at individual tokens,&#x201D; Ripple&#x2019;s Asia-Pacific (APAC) Policy Director, Rahul Advani, told the SCMP on Tuesday. The following day, Ripple published a <a href="https://ripple.com/insights/xrp-is-not-a-security-ripples-landmark-victory-in-sec-lawsuit/?utm_campaign=&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> in which its team stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ripple&#x2019;s pursuit of sound crypto regulation in the U.S. is far from concluded; in fact, this is just the beginning.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Lack of Regulatory Clarity Pushes Crypto Firms Away From the U.S.</h2>
<p>Regulatory ambiguity regarding the status of crypto assets in the United States has turned many in the sector towards Asia, the newspaper noted. In May, APAC Managing Director for San Francisco-headquartered Ripple, Brooks Entwistle, told the publication that due to the SEC lawsuit, much of the company&#x2019;s development has been happening outside the U.S., and in Asia in particular.</p>
<p>On the latter continent, Ripple has been involved in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority&#x2019;s pilot program for central bank digital currency (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDC</a>). China&#x2019;s special administrative region has been concentrating efforts on becoming a hub for crypto assets. Also in the region, Ripple obtained an in-principle approval for a payment license in Singapore through which go most of the remittances processed by the platform. Besides these two destinations, Japan has introduced crypto-specific regulations as well.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-council-adopts-new-rules-for-europes-crypto-markets/">adoption</a> of its Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) rules, the European Union became arguably the world&#x2019;s first jurisdiction with a comprehensive crypto-regulatory framework. Ripple has applied for a payment institution license in Ireland, its Managing Director for Europe, Sendi Young, told DL news earlier this week. She also revealed that the blockchain firm had recently applied for registration with the U.K.&#x2019;s Financial Conduct Authority, too, as part of its plan to &#x201C;continue growing exponentially in this region.&#x201D;</p>
