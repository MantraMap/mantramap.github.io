According to data released last week, US inflation has been trending downward over the past few months. From its all-time high of 9.1% in 2022 down to 6.5% in December of that year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports a dramatic decline in the consumer price index (CPI) for the United States. The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) has been hiking interest rates to bring down inflation. This data suggest their efforts are working, and the market is feeling more optimistic as the chances of a monetary policy pivot are increasing, according to their expectations. According to additional data, MANA is one of the most popular &#8220;metaverse&#8221; platforms, with roughly 8,000 unique daily users. Improvements to avatars, profiles, and friend requests have recently been released for Decentraland users. It works toward making the platform more user-friendly. However, it was a time-consuming process before the platform started to recover. These essential factors have led to the price increase and burst in investor interest.
