			            <description><![CDATA[SBF, however, denied having access to any of the said wallets.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although the disgraced founder of both FTX and Alameda Research is currently on bail under strict rules, there were multiple suspicious transfers of crypto assets from wallets linked to him or his former empire.</p>
<p>Despite refuting any connections, Bloomberg reported that the US authorities plan to investigate the matter.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>CryptoPotato</em> <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/addresses-linked-to-alameda-research-swapping-erc20-tokens-for-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> at the end of last week when several Alameda wallets (marked as such on Etherscan) started moving ERC-20 tokens and bridging them to BTC. Some of the assets included YFI, AAVE, and WETH.</li>
<li>Bankman-Fried, currently released on a $250 million bond and living in his parents&#8217; house, broke his three-week Twitter silence, claiming he had nothing to do with these transfers.</li>
<li>He said he doesn&#8217;t have access to these accounts before <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1608937536487059458" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">adding</a>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I believe it is likely the case that various legit legs of FTX have the ability to access these funds; hopefully that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening here. If not, hopefully one steps in soon to do so. I would be happy to help advise regulators on this if any wanted.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/us-is-said-to-examine-crypto-wallets-linked-to-sam-bankman-fried-1.1864530" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">According</a> to Bloomberg, these suspicious price movements have attracted the attention of US federal prosecutors, and they are planning to open an investigation.</li>
<li>Just a few days after the aforementioned transfers, more allegations <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/did-sbf-just-cash-out-684k/" data-wpel-link="internal">emerged</a> claiming that SBF made new ones, in which he ultimately cashed out almost $700,000 worth of crypto. Recall that he said he only had left $100,000 in his bank account following the bankruptcy filing, and the court order strictly forbids him to operate with such substantial amounts.</li>
<li>However, the Bloomberg report seems to be focusing just on the Alameda-linked transfers, and SBF has not commented on the other ones yet.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[The US SEC will go after most altcoins since they are actually securities, said Kiyosaki.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert Kiyosaki believes the US regulators will go hard against most alternative coins once they are classified as securities.</p>
<p>As such, the author of several best-seller books continues to invest only in bitcoin, which the CFTC and even the SEC have said is a commodity.</p>
<h2>Kiyosaki on BTC and Altcoins</h2>
<p>The 75-years old US entrepreneur, author, and investor changed his tune on the primary cryptocurrency during the COVID-19-induced crisis, saying the asset had proven itself in times of extreme uncertainty. He has used every opportunity since then to praise BTC and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/rich-dad-poor-dad-author-believes-buying-bitcoin-now-will-make-you-smile-later/" data-wpel-link="internal">advise</a> people to start buying.</p>
<p>He has also compared bitcoin to gold and silver in the past, and he did the same in his most recent Twitter post, which carried a question about whether he is investing in the digital asset. Kiyosaki sees a grim future for most altcoins since he believes they fall under the &#8220;securities&#8221; category.</p>
<p>At the same time, BTC has been <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-new-gold-cftc-defines-bitcoin-as-a-commodity/" data-wpel-link="internal">classified as a commodity</a> for years by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. This is why Kiyosaki asserted that he continues to accumulate bitcoin.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Q: Are you investing in Bitcoin?<br />
A: Yes I am. I am very excited about Bitcoin. Why? Because Bitcoin is classified as a commodity much like gold, silver, and oil. Most crypto tokens are classifed as a security and SEC regulations will crush most of them. I am buying more BC</p>
<p>— therealkiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) <a href="https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1608996591851180039?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">December 31, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Commodities Vs. Securities</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency industry has been torn by US regulators trying to determine the nature of the largest assets. While the situation with bitcoin seems to be <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-chairman-is-only-willing-to-call-bitcoin-a-commodity/" data-wpel-link="internal">undeniable</a>, the ongoing legal battle between the SEC and Ripple Labs over XRP continues to cast a dark shadow and bring uncertainty.</p>
<p>The case with Ethereum&#8217;s native cryptocurrency is rather similar, and it got even more complicated following the blockchain&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-the-merge-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-transition-to-ethereum-2-0/" data-wpel-link="internal">Merge</a>. Ever since the completion of the long-anticipated transition from proof of work to proof of stake, several US officials have <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/senator-lummis-now-believes-ether-is-a-security/" data-wpel-link="internal">claimed</a> that ETH could become a security now.</p>
<p>Even the SEC Chair Gary Gensler <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-chairman-warns-ethereum-update-could-classify-eth-as-a-security/" data-wpel-link="internal">warned</a> that staking could be officially considered as an investment, which would turn ETH into a security and put it under his agency&#8217;s scope.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[How cryptocurrency traders are using NFTs to harvest tax losses. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto traders are converting worthless NFTs into tax breaks. They&#8217;re using a service started just for that purpose. Others are taking advantage of IRS tax loopholes for tax breaks on their losses from BTC, ETH, and others this year.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how bad the crypto winter is getting as the frost sets into planet earth&#8217;s northern hemisphere. But in a sign of persistence and entrepreneurial spirit, crypto markets are reacting. NFT buyers are now helping people with their underwater smart contracts. They&#8217;re helping sellers unload their junk NFT and get an official receipt for their tax breaks.</p>
<h2>Investors Are Taking Losses on NFTs for the Tax Breaks</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s not unlike what happened after the 2008 financial crisis. Back then, billions of dollars in mortgage-backed, fixed-income securities (MBS) had become toxic. They were offloaded for the big tax breaks. The banks and financial institutions that got tangled up in those then-innovative derivatives markets bailed out.</p>
<p>Yet it is also totally unlike what happened after the 2008 crisis. Because it was the government and central bank that bought most of those toxic assets. It was like a big institutional bailout for the banks that took losses in the housing and lending bubble of that decade.</p>
<h2>Cryptocurrency Creativity Keeps the Wheels Turning</h2>
<p>Instead, with loss-laden NFTs, the free market and entrepreneurship are prevailing again. NFT buyers have emerged to solve a problem created by the free market and entrepreneurship. It comports with the ethos of the cryptocurrency sector and the liberty of the free and open Web3 Internet. Plus, there are tax breaks, so it&#8217;s federally friendly too.</p>
<p>The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/29/unsellable-worthless-nfts-tax-write-off" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reported Thursday</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now – alongside the broader crypto market – the appetite for NFTs is so diminished that a specialized market has sprung up for collectors looking to sell off their once-valuable “digital collectibles” as tax losses to offset their income tax bills.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Offloading their unsellable NFTs isn&#8217;t the only way crypto investors are hauling tax breaks off of this crypto winter&#8217;s brutal losses. They&#8217;re also selling their unrealized losses and rebuying to realize a loss for tax purposes while holding their long positions for a future rally.</p>
<h2>How Crypto Traders Are Getting Other Tax Breaks</h2>
<p>The tax loophole is that cryptocurrencies are considered property, not a security, so the 30-day stock <a href="https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/primer-on-wash-sales#:~:text=Q%3A%20How%20does%20the%20wash,your%20current-year%20tax%20return" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">wash rules</a> do not apply to them. That means if you hold a position at a loss, you can sell your position and repurchase to hold the losses against any gains to decrease your tax obligations from crypto investments.</p>
<p>Microstrategy took advantage of tax breaks from this loophole in Q4 2022, according to a recent filing. The Michael Saylor-led company <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/microstrategy-adds-2500-btc-total-stack-now-132251-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">accumulated $42.8 million</a> more BTC from the beginning of Nov through near the end of Dec. But <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/12/29/bitcoin-evangelist-michael-saylor-microstrategy-sells-btc-for-first-time-after-spotting-tax-loophole-hodl/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">also sold some</a> $12 million during that period for tax purposes.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Despite the bear market and declining venture capital investments, here are the top 10 biggest crypto fundraisers this year.  ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">The crypto sector experienced significant challenges in the first half of 2022, with the prices of major assets like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) experiencing a 50%+ drop in value. The situation was further exacerbated by the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in the second quarter, which had a ripple effect on the industry. As a result, major industry players such as Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network, and Voyager Digital filed for bankruptcy later in the year.</p>
<p class="p2">The bear market caused venture capitalists (VCs) to become more cautious in their investments in the crypto industry. According to data from DeFiLlama, VC funding in the sector has declined steadily, falling from $8.7 billion in Q1 to $6 billion in Q2, then to $3.5 billion in Q3. With less than 24 hours to the end of 2022, VCs have invested approximately $2 billion in crypto projects in Q4.</p>
<p class="p2">Despite declining VC investments, some crypto projects received large funding in 2022. Here are the top 10 biggest crypto fundraisers, according to <a href="https://defillama.com/raises" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">DeFiLlama</a>.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Luna Foundation Guard: $1 Billion</h2>
<p class="p2">The Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), a nonprofit organization behind the collapsed Terra ecosystem, received the most significant single amount this year. In February, the entity <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/luna-foundation-guard-raises-1b-for-bitcoin-ust-stablecoin-reserve/" data-wpel-link="internal">raised</a> $1 billion in a private token sale to safeguard the peg of TerraUSD (UST). However, the efforts of the LFG failed, with UST <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/luna-foundation-guard-tfl-spent-3-4-billion-to-defend-ust-peg-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">losing</a> its $1 parity and crashing to zero a few months later.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Cross River: $620 Million</h2>
<p class="p2">On March 30, Cross River announced it had raised $620 million from Andreessen Horowitz, Eldridge, and other investors. At the time, the firm said the capital would go to its payments and crypto solutions.</p>
<p class="p2">Cross River is a New Jersey-based financial services company that offers clients a wide range of services, including embedded payments, cards, lending, and crypto solutions. The firm powers lending and payments services for many of the largest crypto companies, including Coinbase.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Fireblocks: $550 Million</h2>
<p class="p2">In January, digital asset infrastructure provider Fireblocks <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/fireblocks-valued-at-8-billion-following-a-550-million-fundraiser/" data-wpel-link="internal">raised</a> $550 million at an $8 billion valuation from institutional investors, including D1 Capital Partners and Spark Capital.</p>
<p class="p2">The company has grown from serving around 800 financial institutions since the fundraiser to working with over 1,300 today. It has also secured the transfer of over $3 trillion in digital assets at the time of writing from $2 trillion in January.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fireblocks.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-190561" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fireblocks.jpg" alt="Fireblocks" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fireblocks.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fireblocks-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fireblocks-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fireblocks-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fireblocks-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h2 class="p3">Polygon: $450 Million</h2>
<p class="p2">Ethereum scaling solution Polygon <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/matic-pumps-16-as-sequoia-capital-leads-450-million-fundraise-for-polygon/" data-wpel-link="internal">raised</a> approximately $450 million through a private sale of its native MATIC token in a funding round led by Sequoia Capital India in February.</p>
<p class="p2">The funding was Polygon&#8217;s first major financing round since its inception in 2017.</p>
<h2 class="p3">ConsenSys: $450 Million</h2>
<p class="p2">Ethereum software developer ConsenSys <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/consensys-raises-450-million-while-metamask-reaches-30-million-maus/" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> in March the closing of a $450 million financing round at a $7 billion valuation, doubling its valuation since November 2021.</p>
<p class="p2">The round was led by ParaFi Capital, with participation from Temasek, SoftBank, and Microsoft.</p>

<h2 class="p3">Yuga Labs: $450 Million</h2>
<p class="p2">Yuga Labs, the creator of the Bored Ape Yacht Club non-fungible token (NFT) collection, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/yuga-labs-valued-at-4-billion-after-450-million-raise/" data-wpel-link="internal">raised</a> $450 million in seed funding in March, led by Andreessen Horowitz. The fundraiser happened a week after Yuga launched ApeCoin (APE), a governance token used within the APE ecosystem.</p>
<p class="p2">Per reports, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently investigating the distribution of APE to holders of Bored Ape Yacht Club and related NFTs.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Secret Network: $400 Million</h2>
<p class="p2">In January, privacy-focused blockchain Secret Network <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/secret-network-reveals-400-million-funding-wave-from-new-investors/" data-wpel-link="internal">raised</a> $400 million, divided into two parts. The first was a $225 million ecosystem fund to support developers building on the network.</p>
<p class="p2">The second was a $175 million accelerator pool filled with the platform&#8217;s SCRT token to provide grants, capital, and incentives to expand user adoption. Stakeholders that obtained SCRT include the now-bankrupt Alameda Research, KuCoin Labs, Huobi Ventures, and others.</p>
<h2 class="p3">FTX US: $400 Million</h2>
<p class="p2">FTX US, the American unit of embattled crypto exchange FTX, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-us-valuation-taps-8-billion-after-raising-400-million-from-softbank-and-temasek/" data-wpel-link="internal">raised</a> $400 million at an $8 billion valuation in January.</p>
<p class="p2">Investors in the fundraiser included Ontario Teachers&#8217; Pension Plan Board, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Softbank Vision Fund 2, Temasek Holdings, Multicoin Capital, and Paradigm. Sadly, these entities have lost their investment in the crypto exchange following its recent bankruptcy filing.</p>
<h2 class="p3">FTX: $400 Million</h2>
<p class="p2">Shortly after FTX US raised $400 million, its parent company <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-valuation-hits-32-billion-following-a-400-million-funding-round-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">secured</a> the same amount from almost the same investors but at a larger $32 billion valuation.</p>
<p class="p2">FTX filed for bankruptcy in November after facing a liquidity crunch connected to its token. After the bankruptcy filing, some investors in the round wrote off their investments in the exchange.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Near Protocol: $350 Million</h2>
<p class="p2">Last on the list of the top 10 biggest crypto fundraisers of 2022 is blockchain developer Near Protocol.

			            <description><![CDATA[Nexo's native cryptocurrency is today's best performer, with a massive double-digit surge amid a calm market.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The end of 2022 brought almost zero volatility for bitcoin, which remained flat at around $16,500.</p>
<p>Most altcoins also failed to produce any significant volatility, aside from the two recent high-flyers &#8211; OKB and Toncoin.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Stalls at $16.5K</h2>
<p>In yesterday&#8217;s Market Watch, <em>CryptoPotato</em> <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-to-end-2022-with-a-65-yearly-drop-weekend-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">summarized</a> bitcoin&#8217;s overall price movements in 2022, which started on a high note at almost $50,000 but ended 65% lower following a violent year that saw multiple collapses.</p>
<p>While zooming in to review BTC&#8217;s performance for the past few weeks, one can easily notice a lack of any substantial price movements. The cryptocurrency has been stuck in a range between $16,000 and $17,000 since the failed attempt to overcome $18,000 on December 14.</p>
<p>2022&#8217;s final hours didn&#8217;t deliver any price fluctuations either, and bitcoin remained stuck at around $16,500. The start of the new year is yet to make its mark, although there&#8217;re some <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-to-consolidate-or-retrace-even-further-in-2023-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">worrying predictions</a> from analysts claiming that the asset could drop even further based on the whales&#8217; behavior.</p>
<p>Currently, though, bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization has stayed under $320 billion, while its dominance over the altcoins sits calmly at 40.1% on CoinMarketCap.</p>

<h2>NEXO Pumps by Double Digits</h2>
<p>Although the alts are significantly more volatile than bitcoin by nature, this has not been the case lately. Most larger caps have produced small moves, including Ethereum. It dipped below $1,200 a few days ago and have failed to reclaim that level ever since. ETH stands quiet on a daily scale once again now, too.</p>
<p>Binance Coin, Cardano, Dogecoin, Polygon, Polkadot, Tron, and Shiba Inu have all slipped by under 1% in a day.</p>
<p>OKB and Toncoin are among the best performers today, as they were yesterday. OKB is up by 4% and sits at $27, while the latter has jumped by 5% and trades above $2.2.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, NEXO has gained the most from the top 100 crypto assets by market cap, with a massive 15% daily surge. As such, the lender&#8217;s native token has neared $0.7.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[2022 turned out to be a great year for malicious actors.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Cryptocurrency firms struggled greatly in 2022, with multiple companies facing financial issues and bankruptcy. In addition to these challenges, over $3 billion was stolen from crypto projects this year, according to Forbes. These setbacks have caused turmoil in the industry and raised concerns about its stability.</p>
<p class="p2">According to the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2022/12/28/over-3-billion-stolen-in-crypto-heists-here-are-the-eight-biggest/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a>, crypto projects witnessed more than 125 hacks, and the top five heists (all involving decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols) accounted for $1.48 billion of the total amount stolen.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>DeFi Protocols Suffered the Most Losses in 2022</b></h2>
<p class="p2">Forbes highlighted that these top five biggest crypto heists range from cross-chain hacks, code exploits, and flash loan attacks.</p>
<p class="p2">The top five hacks are <span class="s1">Ronin Network’s <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/largest-crypto-hack-ever-ronin-bridge-exploited-for-600m-in-eth-and-usdc/" data-wpel-link="internal">$625 million exploit</a></span>, Wormhole’s $325 million theft, Nomad Bridge’s $190 million hack, Beanstalk Farms’ $182 million flash loan attack, and <span class="s1">Wintermute’s <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-market-maker-wintermute-hackers-drain-160m-profanity-bug-suspected/" data-wpel-link="internal">$160 million exploit</a></span>.</p>
<p class="p2">According to the report, DeFi hacks represent around 49% of the total amount stolen by hackers this year. This has led to reduced investment in the sector, as data from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic shows that DeFi protocols lost 75% of their total value locked (TVL) in 2022. However, that also accounts for the declining asset prices.</p>
<p class="p2">Data from DeFi Llama also shows that TVL from DeFi protocols dropped from 166.58 billion at the start of 2022 to $39 billion in December.</p>
<p class="p2">The Forbes report stated that cross-chain bridges, which enable the swap of tokens between blockchains, were the top target for hackers this year. Hackers stole nearly $2 billion from blockchain bridges, accounting for 70% of all crypto theft in 2022.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>Hackers Love DeFi</b></h2>
<p class="p2">The reports also show that DeFi has become a favorite playground for hackers despite its uniqueness. But how is this happening?</p>
<p class="p2">Blockchain analytics platform Chainalysis reported that most thefts in the DeFi space are due to flawed codes, where smart contract errors have been used to steal money from protocols.</p>
<p class="p2">The report explained that because the DeFi ecosystem is open source, anyone, including hackers, can search for vulnerabilities or errors and plan exploits well in advance.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[With the latest arrests, there are now seven V Global execs serving their sentences behind bars.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean authorities appear to have tightened their control over the digital asset space. As such, two high-ranking execs, named Mr.Yang and Mr. Oh of the fraudulent crypto exchange, V Global, were sentenced to eight years and three years, respectively, for their role in defrauding investors.</p>
<p>V Global reportedly lured investors by promising 300% returns. The exchange, which operated between July 2020 and April 2021, required new users to create accounts and deposit approximately 6 million Korean won initially with a supposedly guaranteed return of 18 million won.</p>
<h2>V Global&#8217;s Shenanigans</h2>
<p>During its one year of operation, V Global managed to rake in nearly 50,000 investors by promising users 12 million won in a commission similar to a pyramid scheme. Some executives were nabbed while most employees were under investigation for violating the Act on the Regulation of Similar Reception Act, fraud, and violation of the Door-to-Door Sales Act.</p>
<p>According to a local <a href="https://economist-co-kr.translate.goog/2022/12/26/stock/virtualCurrency/20221226173443373.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">report</a>, the judge from the 12th Criminal Division of the Suwon District Court was quoted saying.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The defendants only trusted the V Global management team, evaded responsibility, and once the investigation began, they destroyed evidence and interfered with the investigation. The defendants acknowledged and reflected on the facts themselves, and many of the victims reinvested the proceeds from their existing investments, so the actual amount of damage was less than the legally defrauded amount&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Victims</h2>
<p>The estimated victim count stands somewhere near 52,000. Daegun law firm, which represents the V Global invest, rs earlier revealed that most of the victims were middle-aged or senior citizens who sought a &#8220;stable life after retirement.&#8221; At least one victim has died by suicide after being scammed.</p>
<p>The prosecutors had <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20220112095900061?input=1195m" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">said</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Most of the victims were middle-aged or senior citizens who dreamed of a stable life after retirement.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Seniors over 60 lost over $1.7 billion to fraud last year, according to the FBI&#8217;s 2021 Elder Fraud <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2021_IC3ElderFraudReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Report</a>. This marked a 74% increase from 2020. Meanwhile, this cohort of individuals lost $239 million in 2021 to investment schemes alone, comprising get-rich-quick scams involving digital assets or cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Seniors are also targeted by crypto scammers because of their less knowledge of the matter.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Here's why MicroStrategy sold some of its bitcoins for the first time since it started accumulating the crypto asset in 2020. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Publicly-traded business intelligence company MicroStrategy revealed that it sold part of its bitcoin stash on December 22 for tax purposes.</p>
<p class="p2">Although the firm later purchased more bitcoins, the sale defied its promise of never selling any portions of its BTC stash.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><b>MicroStrategy Sold BTC for Tax Benefits</b></h2>
<p class="p2">As reported earlier, MicroStrategy <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/microstrategy-adds-2500-btc-total-stack-now-132251-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">purchased</a> 2,395 bitcoins worth about $42.8 million between November 1, 2022, and December 21, 2022. The company then sold 704 BTC for about $11.8 million on December 22 before purchasing another 810 BTC two days later.</p>
<p class="p2">The firm&#8217;s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shows that the bitcoins were sold to generate tax benefits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p2">&#8220;MicroStrategy plans to carry back the capital losses resulting from this transaction against previous capital gains, to the extent such carrybacks are available under the federal income tax laws currently in effect, which may generate a tax benefit,&#8221; <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/content/dam/website-assets/collateral/financial-documents/financial-document-archive/form-8-k-12-28-2022.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span class="s1">the company said</span></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="p3"><b>A Broken Promise</b></h2>
<p class="p2">In the summer of 2020, MicroStrategy began its culture of accumulating Bitcoin through its former CEO, Michael Saylor. Since then, the company has accumulated 132,251 BTC, valued at $2.2 billion at current market prices. This positions MicroStrategy as the largest holder of BTC among public companies, even though it sits on a massive unrealized loss of almost $2 billion.</p>
<p class="p2">After the 2021 bull run, the price of bitcoin and other crypto assets plummeted. The downtrend became more pronounced in 2022, but the bear market did not dampen MicroStrategy&#8217;s BTC buying spirit.</p>
<p class="p2">In <span class="s1">a January <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-20/studio-1-0-microstrategy-chairman-ceo-michael-saylor-video" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">interview</a></span> with Bloomberg, Saylor vowed that his company would not sell its bitcoin holdings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p2">&#8220;Never. No. We&#8217;re not sellers. [. . .] We&#8217;re only acquiring and holding bitcoin, right? That&#8217;s our strategy,&#8221; he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p2">That same month, Phong Le, who was MicroStrategy&#8217;s Chief Financial Officer at the time, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/microstrategy-cfo-confirms-buy-and-hold-bitcoin-strategy-amid-market-turbulence/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span class="s1">declared</span></a> that the company would keep to a &#8220;buy and hold&#8221; policy.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin whales have become net sellers recently, which Santiment believes is an indicator of more price drops. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The price of bitcoin took a massive hit in 2022, dropping by more than 50% in 12 months. However, the crypto analytics platform Santiment believes there&#8217;s more bad news incoming in the new year.</p>
<p>The company based its rather bearish prediction on the BTC whales&#8217; activity.</p>
<h2>BTC Whales Are Net Sellers</h2>
<p>Santiment began its <a href="https://insights.santiment.net/read/examining-the-impact-of-btc-whale-behavior-on-price-trends-7156" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">2023 prediction analysis</a> by highlighting the significance of BTC whales&#8217; behavior for the asset&#8217;s price movements. This is somewhat expected since these types of investors &#8211; who own between 1,000 and 100,000 BTC in a single wallet &#8211; could have a bigger impact if they decide to sell or buy in bulk.</p>
<p>They were quite active on the buying front during the bull market in 2021, but most have changed their strategy in the totally different environment of 2022. The analytics resource confirmed this, asserting that bitcoin whales have become &#8220;net sellers&#8221; recently, &#8220;and the price has been following suit.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It is with confidence that we can predict sideways or even lower prices for BTC in the next 6-12 months.&#8221; &#8211; Santiment said.</p></blockquote>

<p>The analysis added that BTC bottoms are typically found once the whales&#8217; activity has declined substantially. However, this is not the case now as there&#8217;re over 10,000 transactions from such investors daily at the moment, while the count was down to 1,200-2,500 during previous bottoms.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This may mean that we need to wait for the average to drop further before we can conclude that even the big players are giving up.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Santiment predicted that a price drop to as low as $12,200 is not out of the question since there&#8217;re two notable volume gaps between that level and $14,600 that whales might be paying attention to.</p>
<h2>Retail Investors Differ</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a big difference between what retail and whales were doing during previous bear cycles and this one. Historically, the former used to get scared more easily and sell their bags, while the latter went on an accumulation spree.</p>
<p>However, the 2022 bear market has seen a wildly different landscape. Whales have been disposing of their assets, as mentioned above, while retail investors (holding between 0.1 and 10 BTC) refused to sell and actually kept buying.</p>
<p>As such, their cumulative holdings reached an all-time high of 15.9% of bitcoin&#8217;s total available supply in mid-October, as <em>CryptoPotato</em> <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-whales-at-3-year-low-retail-investors-at-ath/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> at the time.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The plaintiffs are seeking at least $5 million in damages.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase customers, who had previously sued the crypto exchange over unauthorized crypto transfers, have continued to hold back their account information in a bid to block efforts to move their case to arbitration.</p>
<p>A renewed emergency motion filed in federal court revealed that the plaintiffs agreed to provide the necessary information encompassing emails, usernames, and Ethereum addresses, in exchange for a protective order.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.gand.306368/gov.uscourts.gand.306368.1.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">filing</a> with the US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, the plaintiff alleged that $6,000 worth of cryptocurrency was drained from his wallet to an address he had never interacted with before with Coinbase facilitating the breach of his account. The filing also showed that the hackers managed to withdraw $1,000 from his bank account.</li>
<li>The San Francisco-based crypto exchange, however, maintained that the users did not agree on whether to include a provision in the protective order that says Coinbase hasn’t relinquished its right to arbitrate the dispute.</li>
<li>With the lack of users&#8217; account information, Coinbase claimed that it is not able to match plaintiffs to their respective arbitration agreements.</li>
<li>In its emergency motion last month, the company stated,</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Refusal to provide this basic information is an improper attempt to undermine Coinbase’s right to compel arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In August, a group of crypto investors brought a lawsuit against Coinbase, alleging it for having lax security systems that exposed user accounts to hackers.</li>
<li>Led by Georgia resident George Kattula, over 100 Coinbase users sued the trading platform for arbitrarily locking them out from accessing their accounts and funds, thereby blocking them from offloading underperforming tokens. This allegedly led to financial losses, read to the filing.</li>
