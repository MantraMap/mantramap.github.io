<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Gnosis introduced Gnosis Card, a Visa-certified debit card connected to on-chain self-custodial wallets.</em></li>



<li><em>Gnosis Card allows users to spend their crypto funds from self-custodial wallets anywhere Visa is accepted.</em></li>



<li><em>Gnosis aims to bridge the gap between crypto and the real world, enabling seamless integration of real-world money into the crypto ecosystem.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gnosis, a blockchain project, is aiming to bridge the gap between self-custodial crypto wallets and traditional payment methods by introducing its latest product, Gnosis Card.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1120.png"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="418" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1120.png" alt="Gnosis Card Now Available, Helping Crypto Wallet Users To Make Real-World Purchases" class="wp-image-203384" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1120.png 800w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1120-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1120-768x401.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1120-750x392.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="Gnosis Card Now Available, Helping Crypto Wallet Users To Make Real-World Purchases 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>The card, which operates on the Visa payment system, allows users to spend funds from their self-custodial wallets anywhere Visa is accepted. The goal of Gnosis is to make crypto assets more accessible to a wider audience beyond the crypto community.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/gnosispay/status/1680874992509272065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduction</a> of Gnosis Pay and Gnosis Card marks a significant milestone for Gnosis as it becomes the first decentralized payment network integrating with a traditional payment processor and the first Visa-certified consumer debit card directly connected to an on-chain self-custodial wallet. Gnosis Pay operates as a layer 2 solution on the Gnosis chain, enabling faster and cheaper transactions.</p>



<p>Initially available in EU and EEA countries, along with the UK, Gnosis has plans for expansion in Q4 to include the United States, Brazil, Mexico, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The Gnosis Card differentiates itself from other Web3 payment cards by not being prepaid, offering users more flexibility in their transactions.</p>



<p>Gnosis Pay will support stablecoin payments, starting with EURe, a stablecoin pegged to the Euro. The team is also actively working on integrating MakerDAO&#8217;s decentralized stablecoin, DAI, for further payment options. The service will initially provide a physical card and web app, with a mobile app in development.</p>

<p>The collaboration between Gnosis and payment processor SaltPay has facilitated the creation of Gnosis Pay and Gnosis Card, combining the benefits of decentralized payment networks with traditional processors. This integration allows users to utilize their crypto assets for online purchases with greater ease and convenience.</p>



<p>The introduction of the Gnosis Card was inspired by a conversation between George, a member of the Gnosis team, and an executive at payment processor SaltPay during a ski trip in the French Alps. This discussion sparked ideas on how blockchain technology could be applied in everyday life.</p>



<p>By introducing Gnosis Pay and Gnosis Card, <a href="https://coincu.com/130579-three-arrows-capital-moving-over-300-nft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gnosis</a> aims to break down the barriers between the crypto world and the real world, enabling users to utilize their digital assets in everyday transactions and facilitating the adoption of cryptocurrencies in mainstream commerce.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The National Australia Bank <a href="https://news.nab.com.au/news/scam-strategy-update/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.nab.com.au/news/scam-strategy-update/" rel="noreferrer noopener">blocked </a>over A$270m in payments to high-risk crypto exchanges to prevent scams and frauds, introducing measures to protect customers.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1119.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="678" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1119-1024x678.png" alt="NAB Blocks Crypto Payments Worth Over A$270 Million Due To Scam Concerns" class="wp-image-203378" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1119-1024x678.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1119-300x199.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1119-768x509.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1119-750x497.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1119-1140x755.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1119.png 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="NAB Blocks Crypto Payments Worth Over A$270 Million Due To Scam Concerns 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The National Australia Bank (NAB) has blocked payments worth over A$270 million to high-risk cryptocurrency exchanges in the past four months, citing the risk of scams and frauds. Similar steps have been taken by other Australian banks like Westpac, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and ANZ in recent weeks. </p>



<p>According to NAB Executive for Group Investigations and Fraud, Chris Sheehan, several measures have been introduced in the last six months to protect customers from scams, including introducing payment prompts, stopping the use of links in unexpected text messages, and taking action on spoofing. </p>



<p>The payment prompts feature a checklist based on uncharacteristic activity designed to get the customer to pause and review the payment before hitting send. Additionally, NAB is taking action to block payments to high-risk cryptocurrency exchanges to prevent scammers further. Mr. Sheehan believes that Australia needs to balance speed and safety in a digital economy and that conversations need to be had on the same.</p>



<p>NAB&#8217;s intervention in over $270 million worth of customer payments in the four months between March and July, which raised scam concerns, led to the abandonment of 12% of payments when customers received a real-time payment promptly in the app. While many customers ultimately complete their payment after receiving a prompt, around $290,000 worth of payments are abandoned daily. Mr. Sheehan&#8217;s research shows that four in ten Australians are &#8216;extremely willing&#8217; for payments to be slower if they were better protected from scammers.</p>



<p>NAB&#8217;s announcement comes as almost 50% of scam funds reported to the Australian Financial Crimes Exchange were linked to cryptocurrency in a recent 30-day period. Cryptocurrency scams are one of the fastest-growing security threats, with Australians losing more than $221 million to them last year. </p>



<p>These scammers are part of organized transnational crime groups, and they are increasingly using cryptocurrency platforms to send stolen funds quickly and overseas. In response, NAB and other Australian banks are taking measures to protect their customers from such scams and frauds.</p>

<li><em>The integration expands Unstoppable Domains&#8217; offerings as a one-stop shop for Web3 domains, including .eth, .nft, .crypto, .polygon, and more.</em></li>



<li><em>New features such as domain vaults, auto-renewal options, and easy checkout experiences enhance the user experience and support the growth of the Web3 ecosystem.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Unstoppable Domains, a digital identity platform, has <a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/blog/categories/announcements/article/eth-on-unstoppable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the addition of Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domain endings to its offerings, expanding its support for Web3 domains. With the inclusion of .eth domain endings, users can establish their digital identity on the Ethereum blockchain by registering simpler names that correspond to their long wallet addresses.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1117-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1117-1024x576.png" alt="Unstoppable Domains Now Supports For ENS Domains" class="wp-image-203376" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1117-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1117-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1117-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1117-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1117-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1117-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1117.png 1801w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Unstoppable Domains Now Supports For ENS Domains 4"></a></figure></div>


<p>The integration of ENS-based .eth domains into the Unstoppable Domains website marks a significant milestone in creating a one-stop shop for Web3 domains. Unstoppable Domains aims to be the go-to platform for purchasing .eth, .nft, .crypto, <a href="https://coincu.com/177604-unstoppable-domains-releases-ai-avatars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">.polygon </a>domains, and more, providing users with a comprehensive range of options.</p>



<p>When purchasing .eth domains through Unstoppable, users can expect the same full functionality and registration process as with other .eth domains, ensuring no naming collisions occur. The platform&#8217;s objective is to support the most important naming systems and blockchains in Web3, starting with .eth, as part of its broader mission to expand the Web3 community.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/160229-ready-player-me-partner-unstoppable-domains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unstoppable Domains</a> is not only offering a seamless experience for Web3 domain purchases but also introducing new features to enhance the process. Users now have the option to secure their .eth domains in a vault managed by Unstoppable, providing additional security and the freedom to separate Web3 domains from other crypto assets. The domains held in the vault are fully owned by the users and can be transferred to a self-custodial wallet at any time.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1115.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1115-1024x538.png" alt="Unstoppable Domains Now Supports For ENS Domains" class="wp-image-203374" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1115-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1115-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1115-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1115-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1115-1140x599.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1115.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Unstoppable Domains Now Supports For ENS Domains 5"></a></figure></div>


<p>To address the challenge of annual renewal fees for ENS-based Web3 domains, Unstoppable is offering an optional auto-renewal feature for .eth domains. This feature ensures that users won&#8217;t lose their domains accidentally and allows them to have peace of mind knowing their domains will be renewed as long as desired.</p>



<p>Unstoppable aims to make the buying experience for Web3 domains as easy as traditional e-commerce websites. Users can purchase .eth domains using various payment methods, including credit cards through Stripe, PayPal, Google Pay, Apple Pay, and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Unstoppable enables users to manage records, transfer domains, use ENS integrations, and pay renewal fees directly through ENS if preferred. The pricing for .eth domains on Unstoppable aligns with the ENS website, including Ethereum network fees for gas, and additional services like Unstoppable Parking and auto-renewal are available as options.</p>



<p>While .eth domains purchased through Unstoppable will not initially function with the platform&#8217;s more than 860 integrations, users will be able to leverage all ENS integrations. Unstoppable is committed to continuously enhancing the functionality and integration capabilities of .eth domains within its ecosystem.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1118.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="966" height="640" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1118.png" alt="Unstoppable Domains Now Supports For ENS Domains" class="wp-image-203377" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1118.png 966w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1118-300x199.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1118-768x509.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1118-750x497.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 966px) 100vw, 966px" title="Unstoppable Domains Now Supports For ENS Domains 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>All .eth domains purchased through Unstoppable will be minted on the Ethereum blockchain, incurring associated blockchain fees. This expansion of Unstoppable&#8217;s offerings provides customers with more flexibility and options for their <a href="https://coincu.com/131949-unstoppable-domains-integrated-fantom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Web3 domains</a>. Additionally, the platform plans to introduce new features allowing users to manage .eth domains, including setting crypto addresses, managing on-chain profile data, and facilitating domain transfers.</p>



<p>Unstoppable Domains and ENS are recognized as leading platforms for Web3 domains, with 3.6 million registered Unstoppable domains and 2.7 million registered ENS domains. By integrating .eth domains into the Unstoppable website, the platform aims to contribute to the growth and development of the broader Web3 ecosystem, offering users the combined benefits of both platforms in a user-friendly registrar experience.</p>



<p>In April, Unstoppable Domains <a href="https://coincu.com/184303-binance-us-partners-unstoppable-domains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its collaboration with Binance US, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States. The exchange&#8217;s users can send and withdraw crypto to any domain of Unstoppable.</p>

<p>Binance has <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-support-the-terra-luna-network-upgrade-1e65aa0e555d4d67b7134dd230b61188" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-support-the-terra-luna-network-upgrade-1e65aa0e555d4d67b7134dd230b61188" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced </a>its support for the Terra (LUNA) network upgrade. The upgrade will take place at the Terra block height of 5,994,365, which is approximately on July 18, 2023, at 13:00 (UTC). During this time, deposits and withdrawals of LUNA will be suspended starting from approximately 12:00 (UTC). It’s important to note that the trading of LUNA will not be affected during the network upgrade.</p>



<p>Binance will handle all technical requirements involved for all users holding LUNA in their Binance accounts. The upgrade is estimated to take place at the Terra block height of 5,994,365, but the estimated time is for users’ reference only. Once the exchange deems the upgraded network to be stable, deposits and withdrawals for LUNA will be reopened, and users will not be notified of further announcements.</p>



<p>Binance had announced the resumption of the “Market Order – Total” feature for impacted Spot and Margin trading pairs. Starting from July 19, 2023, at 02:00 (UTC), users will once again have access to this important functionality. The feature had been temporarily suspended since May 7, 2023, at 09:00 (UTC).</p>



<p>The update brings good news to BNB users as they will now be able to utilize both the “Total” and “Slider for Amount Customization” features while placing market orders on any Spot or Margin trading pair. These features provide enhanced flexibility and customization options, enabling users to optimize their trading strategies.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in a recent update on <a href="https://coincu.com/203299-binance-withdrawal-system-restored-efficiency/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/203299-binance-withdrawal-system-restored-efficiency/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the representative of Binance, revealed that the exchange experienced a brief technical glitch with its withdrawal system. The issue persisted for approximately 10 minutes before being completely resolved.</p>

<p>Backed by BitDAO, Mantle now benefits from one of the largest treasuries in the crypto space, with assets valued at over $2.4 billion. The merger with BitDAO in May integrated BitDAO&#8217;s governance framework and treasury with the network, providing substantial support for Mantle&#8217;s future endeavors.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional monolithic blockchains, <a href="https://coincu.com/201860-mantle-plans-to-invest-200000-eth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mantle Network</a> takes a modular chain approach, separating execution, data availability, consensus, and settlement into distinct layers. This design, coupled with its modular architecture and <a href="https://coincu.com/169833-optimism-ecosystem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Optimistic Rollup</a> approach, aims to combine high performance with low costs while maintaining Ethereum&#8217;s decentralization and security. Mantle collaborates with the ether restaking protocol <a href="https://coincu.com/195299-eigenlayer-restaking-deployed-ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EigenLayer</a> to ensure efficient data availability.</p>

<p>The modular architecture of Mantle Network enables swift upgrades by swapping in and out modular components. This flexibility allows for the adoption of the latest Ethereum improvements, including account abstraction, which enhances wallet functionality and enables more complex tasks to be handled automatically. With its Layer 2 scalability, Mantle Network opens up opportunities for advanced use cases such as blockchain gaming, DeFi, and social protocols without incurring exorbitant fees.</p>



<p>In addition to the mainnet launch, Mantle Network is undergoing a rebranding effort in line with its commitment to innovation and establishing a strong brand presence. Users interested in obtaining the new MNT tokens can participate in the upcoming Mantle ByStarter.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Arbitrum&#8217;s price holds above the $1.3 support level amid market excitement and Rodeo Finance exploit.</em></li>



<li><em>The network attracts new users and achieves robust utility with over $4 billion TVL, surpassing Polygon and Optimism.</em></li>



<li><em>ARB is trading at $1.31 with resistance at $1.34, a bullish bounce could lead to the conquering of Fib levels at $1.36 and $1.48.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Arbitrum (ARB) price is showing resilience as it holds above the $1.3 support level after a week of market excitement. The question now arises: can this upward trend be sustained?</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1109.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1109-1024x576.png" alt="Arbitrum Price Holds Strong At $1.3: Can The Uptrend Sustain?" class="wp-image-203349" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1109-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1109-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1109-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1109-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1109-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1109-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1109.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Arbitrum Price Holds Strong At $1.3: Can The Uptrend Sustain? 11"></a></figure></div>


<p>The recent exploit of <a href="https://coincu.com/201687-rodeo-finance-by-1-5-million-defi-attack-latest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rodeo Finance</a>, a DeFi Yield-Farming protocol built on the network, where $1.5 million was lost, raised concerns about the security and stability of the ecosystem. However, despite the hack, ARB price has managed to hold the $1.1 support level since it was confirmed by blockchain intelligence platform Peckshield on July 11. This indicates a degree of confidence among investors in the network&#8217;s ability to withstand such incidents.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/203207-arbitrum-will-support-account-abstraction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arbitrum</a> is among the Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solutions competing for dominance, with Optimism being its main rival. In a recent analysis, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon&#8217;s ZK rollup, and Binance Smart Chain&#8217;s opBNB were evaluated. Among these developments, Arbitrum&#8217;s developers have introduced the toolkit for Layer 3 chains, which opens up new opportunities for competition, cheaper transactions, and faster processing. </p>



<p>The Layer 2 solution provided by Arbitrum enhances the speed, flexibility, and scalability of the Ethereum blockchain, making it an attractive option for a wide range of DeFi protocols. Through its Layer 3 chains, Arbitrum is actively working on increasing the customizability of projects, addressing a key challenge faced by Layer 2 protocols.</p>



<p>Despite the negative sentiment surrounding the recent exploit, Arbitrum has seen an influx of new users. The weekly Arbitrum report revealed that the network recently surpassed the significant milestone of 300 million transactions. </p>



<p>This achievement underscores the robust utility and growth experienced by the network, despite its inception during a bear market. Additionally, Arbitrum&#8217;s Total Value Locked (TVL) currently <a href="https://defillama.com/chains" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stands</a> at $2.177 billion, surpassing both Polygon and rival Optimism in terms of TVL. Furthermore, Arbitrum leads the pack in terms of trading volume, with $373,275,710 recorded in the latest period.</p>

<p>Analyzing the <a href="https://coincu.com/198165-arbitrum-rises-thanks-to-whale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARB</a> price, it is currently trading at $1.31, above the $1.6 resistance level and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. The recent upward movement of three candles suggests that the $1.34 price zone represents the nearest resistance level that ARB must overcome. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>However, if the price retraces to $1.26, it could indicate a clearer downside movement as the bears solidify their position. Traders and investors are advised to closely monitor the price action, as a strong bullish bounce could signal a potential breakthrough of the next Fibonacci levels at $1.36 and $1.48.</p>



<p>In summary, while the recent exploit posed a challenge for Arbitrum, the network has shown resilience and continued growth. With its Layer 2 solutions and ongoing developments, Arbitrum aims to offer improved scalability, customization, and performance. As the network attracts more users and achieves significant milestones, it remains to be seen whether the current positive trend can be sustained in the long term.</p>

<p>For instance, many companies such as FTX and Celsius have been accused of poor record-keeping and misusing customer funds.</p>



<p>As a result, the Financial Stability Board (<a href="https://www.fsb.org/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.fsb.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">FSB</a>), which groups regulators from some two dozen jurisdictions, including the U.S., EU, China and the U.K., published recommendations to ensure “consistent and comprehensive” regulation of the sector. The recommendations build on proposals originally floated in October and are focused on preventing the kind of behavior that has been alleged to have been carried out by companies such as FTX and Celsius.</p>



<p>“The events of the past year have highlighted the intrinsic volatility and structural vulnerabilities of crypto-assets and related players,” said the document. It unveiled new norms that could see major conglomerates forced to separate some of their activities and functions. This is aimed at ensuring that clients’ assets are better protected.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Financial-Stability-Board-Urges-Stronger-Global-Crypto-Governance-2.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="869" height="580" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Financial-Stability-Board-Urges-Stronger-Global-Crypto-Governance-2.jpeg" alt="Financial Stability Board Urges Stronger Global Crypto Governance 2" class="wp-image-203342" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Financial-Stability-Board-Urges-Stronger-Global-Crypto-Governance-2.jpeg 869w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Financial-Stability-Board-Urges-Stronger-Global-Crypto-Governance-2-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Financial-Stability-Board-Urges-Stronger-Global-Crypto-Governance-2-768x513.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Financial-Stability-Board-Urges-Stronger-Global-Crypto-Governance-2-750x501.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" title="Financial Stability Board Urges Stronger Global Crypto Governance 15"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>FTX is one of the companies that have been hit by a wave of allegations of poor record-keeping and misuse of customer funds. Meanwhile, Celsius co-founder and ex-CEO Alex Mashinsky has been arrested in New York on multiple charges that he misled investors and manipulated token prices for personal gain.</p>



<p>In setting out the rationale for tougher global rules, the FSB also referred to the recent collapse of crypto-focused banks, the brief de-pegging of Circle’s USDC stablecoin two months ago, and the sudden downfall of the terraUSD stablecoin in May 2022 that heralded a new crypto winter.</p>



<p>Global players are taking different approaches to how to regulate crypto. While the European Union has crafted a new tailored law known as the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seeking to argue it can apply existing hundred-year-old rules originally designed for traditional financial instruments.</p>

<p>The principles from the FSB should be flexible enough to allow both approaches, but officials are keen to stress continuity. “This global framework does not rewrite or create a completely new regulatory rulebook for crypto assets,” FSB Secretary General John Schindler told reporters. “Crypto asset activities are not as different from traditional financial activities as some would have us believe, and similar rules should apply.”</p>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1106-1024x514.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="514" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1106-1024x514.png" alt="zkSync Era Introduced Boojum: A New Proof System To Enhance Decentralization" class="wp-image-203335" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1106-1024x514.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1106-300x151.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1106-768x386.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1106-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1106-750x377.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1106-1140x573.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1106.png 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="zkSync Era Introduced Boojum: A New Proof System To Enhance Decentralization 17"></a></figure></div>


<p>Boojum, a Rust-based cryptographic library, will enable the implementation of upgraded versions of ZK circuits for zkSync Era and the ZK Stack. The upgrade represents a significant step towards user-driven decentralization, as the prover runs on consumer-grade GPUs and requires only 16 GB of GPU RAM.</p>



<p>The Boojum upgrade brings several benefits to <a href="https://coincu.com/184583-top-25-whales-on-zksync-era/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zkSync Era</a>. It offers world-class performance, significantly improving scalability to accommodate the envisioned volume for hyperchains. With the ability to process over 100 transactions per second, Boojum provides substantial performance enhancements.</p>



<p>Moreover, Boojum reduces hardware requirements for decentralization, aligning with zkSync&#8217;s long-term goal of enabling user-powered proof generation. The prover&#8217;s compatibility with consumer-grade GPUs and lower GPU RAM requirements makes decentralization more accessible.</p>

<p>For API users, Binance has provided a convenient way to check the status of the &#8220;Market Order &#8211; Total&#8221; feature for a specific trading pair. By querying the api/v3/exchangeInfo, API users can retrieve information regarding the availability of the feature.

<p>In a statement released on Monday, <a href="https://news.nab.com.au/news/scam-strategy-update/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.nab.com.au/news/scam-strategy-update/" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Australia Bank</a> stated that it has intervened in over A$270 million ($183.8 million) worth of payments that raised scam concerns between March and July. Despite not disclosing how many of these alerts were triggered by crypto-related scams, NAB has blocked some payments to high-risk cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>

<p>To ensure its customer&#8217;s safety, National Australia Bank has employed a variety of measures, including introducing payment prompts, taking action on spoofing, and stopping the use of links in unexpected text messages. In addition, the bank has taken action to block some payments to high-risk cryptocurrency exchanges. While NAB did not detail the specific exchanges involved, the bank noted that Australians lost over A$221 million ($150.5 million) last year due to crypto-related scams.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1100.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="464" height="309" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1100.png" alt="image 1100" class="wp-image-203317" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1100.png 464w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1100-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" title="National Australia Bank Blocks Transactions with &#039;High-Risk&#039; Crypto Exchanges 25"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>NAB&#8217;s decision to block payments to high-risk cryptocurrency exchanges follows similar moves by other Australian banks. Last month, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia also took measures to limit its customers&#8217; ability to send money to crypto exchanges due to crypto-related scams.</p>



<p>According to NAB, nearly 50% of scam funds reported to the Australian Financial Crimes Exchange were linked to cryptocurrency in a recent 30-day period. Chris Sheehan, NAB Executive for Group Investigations and Fraud, stated that &#8220;these scammers are part of organized, transnational crime groups. Increasingly, we&#8217;re seeing them use cryptocurrency platforms to send stolen funds quickly and often overseas.&#8221;</p>
