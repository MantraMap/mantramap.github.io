			  <description><![CDATA[<p>For cryptocurrency traders, having constant access to account balances, open positions, and global market prices is absolutely essential. But being chained to a trading desk or computer simply isn't always desirable in today's fast-paced, mobile world. Thankfully, the award-winning PrimeXBT mobile app provides traders with everything they could possibly need to stay tightly connected to crypto markets, no matter where they are in the world.</p>
<p>Whether lounging by the seaside on a tropical beach vacation, traversing new exotic lands as a digital nomad, or simply walking your dog around the neighborhood, you can react in real-time to sudden volatility spikes and efficiently manage existing trades in just a few taps. The PrimeXBT app puts a full suite of professional trading tools right to the palm of your hand.</p>
<p></p>
Stay informed with real-time market data and pricing
<p>The intuitive PrimeXBT interface grants easy access to over 100 diverse trading instruments across forex, commodities, stock indices, and of course, cryptocurrencies. The mobile app's customisable watchlist feature lets you easily track real-time pricing data across all major global markets.</p>
<p>Scroll through and view up-to-the-second price action on popular forex pairs like EUR/USD and GBP/JPY. Check current gold and crude oil prices, alongside stock indices such as the S&amp;P 500, FTSE 100, and Nikkei 225. The app also provides live updated prices for all top cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and many more.</p>
<p>With constant access to global market prices right at your fingertips, you can capitalise on emerging short-term opportunities or adjust current open positions to mitigate your risk. The app ensures you have the latest market data, no matter where you are located in the world, at any given moment.</p>
<p></p>
Execute trades and complex strategies in a few taps
<p>Acting decisively on a compelling potential trade is just as quick and seamless in the PrimeXBT mobile app. You can easily long or short Bitcoin and other popular digital assets with just a few taps. And use advanced mobile charting capabilities and technical indicators to help identify and confirm ideal entry and exit points.</p>
<p>The app's robust trading features allow executing complex strategies like building long/short portfolios across diverse asset classes, to properly diversify and reduce risk. Or utilise leverage up to 200x on crypto trades, for significantly greater profit potential.</p>
<p>Managing open positions across markets is equally simple and intuitive. The app clearly displays all current positions, their unrealised profit/loss in real-time, and allows you to quickly modify stop losses and take profit levels. You thus have full mobile control and can close positions to take profits or add margin to current trades when necessary.</p>
<p></p>
Access unique features like Covesting Copy Trading
<p>In addition to core trading capabilities, the PrimeXBT app also conveniently grants you access to unique proprietary features unavailable anywhere else. This includes the Covesting Copy Trading module, which lets you automatically mimic the trades of vetted professionals.</p>
<p>You can browse detailed strategy manager profiles, showcasing transparent historical performance data. And pick a consistently profitable trader to copy based on metrics like all-time ROI percentage, win rate percentage, and five star rating. Any and all trades the manager executes will replicate in your account, allowing you to piggyback off their proven expertise.</p>
<p>Copying the best crypto traders on the platform is an excellent way to diversify and grow your income streams. The mobile app makes it easy to find top trading talent and capitalise on their signals from anywhere around the globe.</p>
<p></p>
Deposit, withdraw, and manage your account on the go
<p>The ability to securely deposit funds, withdraw profits, or access 24/7 multilingual customer support via live chat is an additional convenience. The app even recently added the ability to purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, USD Coin, and Tether stablecoins directly on your mobile device, making topping up your trading account easier than ever.</p>
<p>Managing your fiat (USD and EUR), cryptocurrency, and stablecoin balances, and initiating transactions is simple and intuitive through the well-designed wallet interface. And should any issues arise, PrimeXBT&rsquo;s responsive global customer support team is available through the app day and night.</p>
Built for today's active, on-the-go crypto traders
<p>In today's busy world, serious traders need flexible access to react to markets whether they are relaxing at home, working in the office, or anywhere else in between. With the full-featured PrimeXBT mobile app, cryptocurrency traders finally have sophisticated trading tools right at their fingertips, no matter where life takes them.</p>
<p>The platform's steady enhancements and intuitive user interface clearly showcase why PrimeXBT rightfully earned the prestigious Forex Award for Best Crypto Trading App. If you want reliable, worldwide access to global markets, from anywhere at any time, download the free PrimeXBT mobile app for iOS and Android devices today.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized finance platform Zunami Protocol has become the latest protocol to be hacked after confirming on Sunday that bad actors hacked its liquidity pool on Curve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exploit led to the protocol losing over $2.1 million, according to estimates from blockchain security firm PeckShield and Ironblocks.&nbsp;</p>
Details Of The Hack&nbsp;
<p>The protocol confirmed the hack on Sunday, with security firm PeckShield confirming it as well. The protocol advised users to refrain from purchasing any of its Zunami Ether (zETH) or Zunami USD (UZD) stablecoins following the attack. The protocol further added that collateral remained secure and it was investigating the cause of the exploit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It appears that zStables have encountered an attack. The collateral remain secure, we delve into the ongoing investigation. Please do not buy zETH and UZD at the moment; their emission has been attacked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blockchain security firm PeckShield, in an analysis of the attack, estimated that around $2.1 million was stolen from the decentralized finance protocol&rsquo;s Curve pool and put the exploit down to a price manipulation issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi @ZunamiProtocol Today&rsquo;s hack leads to &gt;$2.1m loss, and there are two hack txs involved: - tx1:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2aec4fdb2a09ad4269a410f2c770737626fb62c54e0fa8ac25e8582d4b690cca - tx2:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0788ba222970c7c68a738b0e08fb197e669e61f9b226ceec4cab9b85abe8cceb It is a price manipulation issue, which can be exploited by donation to incorrectly calculate the price as shown in the following figures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fellow security firm Ironblocks also conducted an analysis of the hack, coming to the same conclusion as PeckShield regarding the cause of the hack. In its analysis, Ironblocks explained,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The attacker took [a] flash loan from [the] balancer, then he added liquidity so he [would] be able to change the price significantly and started to trade in Zunami&rsquo;s exchange. Then he removed the liquidity and changed the price, then he traded back and [returned] the flash loan and got 1,152 ETH to himself. Classic price manipulation.&rdquo;</p>

Price Of Zunami USD And Zunami ETH Collapses&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>The price of both the Zunami USD stablecoin and Zunami ETH (zETH) fell off a cliff following the exploit. The stablecoin lost its entire value, dropping 99%, while zETH dropped over 88%, dropping to $206. PeckShield also confirmed that the stolen funds had already been put through the controversial coin mixer Tornado Cash.&nbsp;</p>
Curve&rsquo;s Recent Troubles&nbsp;
<p>The Zunami protocol is a yield farming aggregator for stablecoins and maintains its primary zStable pools on Curve. The protocol is managed as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and promises users the &ldquo;highest API on the market.&rdquo; It has also stated that it has over $5 million in total value locked (TVL) on its website. According to Zunami, users can use the protocol to diversify their stablecoin portfolio and avoid the risk of crashing one of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Curve Finance has faced multiple attacks over the past few weeks, impacting multiple decentralized finance protocols. Attackers managed to steal over $24 million worth of crypto by leveraging a vulnerability in the liquidity pools on Curve. The vulnerability was eventually traced back to Vyper, a third-party programming language being used to program Ethereum smart contracts on the protocol. At the time, Curve stated that liquidity pools not using Vyper were not impacted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A number of stablepools (alETH/msETH/pETH) using Vyper 0.2.15 have been exploited as a result of a malfunctioning reentrancy lock. We are assessing the situation and will update the community as things develop. Other pools are safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exploit put major protocols at risk, especially due to Curve founder Michael Egorov&rsquo;s $168 million lending position, which was at risk of liquidation.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Visa recently completed a test that allows users to pay Ethereum (ETH) gas fees through credit and debit cards. </p>
<p>Global payment giant Visa has successfully completed a test for an innovative solution on the Ethereum blockchain, which will allow its users to pay on-chain gas fees using a Visa debit or credit card.</p>
<p>The test was revealed by Mustafa Bedawala, a Visa product manager, to address the ongoing challenge of ensuring Ether balances for covering gas fees.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We're excited to share our experimental solution on Paying Onchain Gas Fees with a Visa Card At @Visa, we've been exploring ways to simplify blockchain transactionsImagine paying for gas fees as easily as buying coffee with your card! But how did we get here?🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/uGhAde60xe</p>
&mdash; Mustafa (@digitalmustafa) August 10, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>The possible solution aims to improve the interaction process with dApps on the Ethereum blockchain. Visa said the trial &ldquo;helps set the stage for a more accessible and user-friendly approach to digital transactions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Visa said:</p>

<p>"To transact using a blockchain like Ethereum, consumers must maintain a balance of the blockchain&rsquo;s native token (e.g., ETH) to pay fees for using the network, known as &ldquo;gas.&rdquo; What if sending blockchain transactions using self-custodial wallets was as straightforward for the user as using your card to pay for a cup of coffee?"</p>

Visa Aims to Eliminate Overspending ETH
<p>The standard Ethereum transaction requires users acquiring ETH from an exchange wanting to transfer it to their wallets to pay variable gas fees. The variable gas fees often result in users spending more ETH than necessary or having insufficient ETH.</p>
<p>To address these concerns, Visa&rsquo;s solution uses Ethereum&rsquo;s ERC-4337 standards and the &ldquo;Paymaster&rdquo; smart contract allowing off-chain gas fee payments. Users trigger an Ethereum transaction through their wallets which is then sent to the paymaster. Paymaster calculates the gas fee and charges Visa through a service called Cybersource.</p>
<p>A digital signature is produced and validated for a limited time, then attached by the wallet before sending it to the blockchain. The signature is verified, and Paymaster settles the gas fees. Visa&rsquo;s innovative solution thereby allows users to pay gas fees off-chain with their Visa card and eliminates the need for users to hold ETH to pay for gas fees.</p>
<p>Visa explained that:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The intricacies and complexities of blockchain-based transactions have been a significant stumbling block for many users, creating a challenging learning curve and increasing user friction.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Visa&rsquo;s research team added that the solution offers a &ldquo;promising approach to substantially addressing these challenges.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Beyond traditional financial assets, the cryptocurrency world has now branched out to include the gaming industry. Gaming tokens, referred to as "play-to-earn" tokens, have drawn a lot of attention since they combine investment and enjoyment. This article examines three gaming tokens that have the potential to add value to your cryptocurrency portfolio: Axie Infinity (AXS), Gala Games (GALA), and Pomerdoge (POMD).</p>
<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
Axie Infinity (AXS): Pioneering NFT Gaming Revolution
<p>Starting off, Axie Infinity (AXS) has gained notoriety for its brilliant fusion of blockchain and NFT technologies. At its foundation, the game gives players the ability to gather, raise, and fight against fantastical beings known as "Axies."</p>
<p>Additionally, these Axies have been painstakingly tokenized as NFTs, giving them inherent valuethat players may trade and sell with ease. This idea is supported by the ground-breaking play-to-earn paradigm. This enables users to make money by actively engaging in battles and quests. As a result, it leads to a ground-breaking fusion of gaming and investment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Axie Infinity's value has dramatically increased, drawing in both investors and gamers. As a result, Axie Infinity offers an enticing opportunity for diversifying your cryptocurrency portfolio due to its strong potential for future expansion and integration.</p>
Gala Games (GALA)- Empowering Game Development Democracy
<p>By introducing player and creator empowerment, the creative force known as Gala Games (GALA) is unwaveringly committed to reshaping the game business landscape.</p>
<p>Gala Games expands a platform where users can intricately participate in creating and owning games thanks to blockchain technology. Consequently, the GALA token is the key to this dynamic since it allows for easy transactions and interactions between players and creators.</p>
<p>Moreover, Gala Games stands out for its unwavering dedication to decentralization and community involvement. Thereby, giving developers the power to maintain creative liberty and ownership of their video game creations.</p>
<p>Because of Gala Games' unusual commitment to user-centricity, it stands out in a sea of gaming tokens. As a result, it is enticing to both gamers and astute investors.</p>
Pomerdoge (POMD) To Surpass Axie Infinity and Gala Games
<p class="s10">As Axie Infinity and Gala Games are stagnating, Pomerdoge is expected to increase 10x in the next month, according to analysts. The complex environment that Pomerdoge is creating will house NFTs, POMD tokens, a marketplace and an exciting play-to-earn (P2E) gaming platform.</p>
<p class="s10">Therefore, these components combine to provide an engaging and satisfying experience that draws crypto aficionados from all over the world. Players from all over the world will be able to compete and converse on the P2E game's platform.</p>
<p class="s10">As a result, the Pomerdoge P2E game merges enjoyment and earning potential by giving players the chance to earn prizes while having fun.</p>
<p class="s10">Pomerdoge is creating Pomerplace, an in-game marketplace that lets players earn incentives by purchasing, reselling, and exchanging items. This thriving ecosystem revolves around the Pomerdoge meme coin, or POMD.</p>
<p class="s10">This utility token makes all platform transactions possible. Subsequently it also gives owners real utility and the chance to earn rewards through staking. Meanwhile, POMD tokens are selling for just $0.008 during the first stage of the presale. You now have the chance to integrate into this thriving ecosystem.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>There are gems of tokens that have been overshadowed by bigger, well-established tokens. However, we'll be highlighting some of these lesser-known tokens that have shown significant growth potential. They include Nexo (NEXO), Pomerdoge (POMD), and 1inch (1INCH) tokens.</p>
<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
Key Cryptocurrencies To Watch Closely &ndash; 1inch (1INCH), Nexo(NEXO), and Pomerdoge (POMD)
<p>The once bearish trend experienced by the 1inch (1NCH) token has flattened and it is looking set to go on a bullish rally. This is evident in the stats that show that it has seen a slight move towards a positive price action after suffering a 2.45% loss in price value in the last 7 days. 1INCH currently trades at $0.30 with a 24-hour trading volume of $14 million.</p>
<p>After falling to an all-time low of $0.25 on June 15, 2023, 1inch is bouncing back at the moment, with the coin gaining 3% in the last 30 days. Crypto price prediction platforms have projected that 1inch could exceed the $0.5 benchmark very soon.</p>
<p>Right now, analysts reckon that 1 inch is on the right track to surge in the coming days and weeks.</p>
Investors Confident in the Resurgence of Nexo (NEXO) Despite Current Dip in Price
<p>Notwithstanding the ongoing declining price action of the Nexo (NEXO) token, investors and analysts are confident that the token will rally anytime soon. For context, It has lost 1.93% in price value in the last 24 hours and trades at $0.63 as of the time of writing.</p>
<p>However, the trading volume of Nexo in the last 24 hours shows that the market activity of the token gained 8.88% to see a market return of over $1.90M.</p>
<p>A further look at the price chart shows that Nexo is 3.69% better off in price value than it was in the last 30 days and has only lost 0.58% of its price value in the last 7 days. As such, Nexo may well be a shrewd investment option.</p>
<p>Most crypto price prediction platforms already predicted that Nexo will hit the $1 benchmark in the year. If the coin breaks the current resistance level, we could witness a rally very soon.</p>
Pomerdoge (POMD) Surges As More Investors Buy Into the Presale
<p>Pomerdoge (POMD) has been consistently on an upward trajectory since its presale phase started. Pomerdoge is a P2E gaming platform where individuals from around the globe can connect and network with each other while engaging in healthy digital gaming competitions.</p>
<p>Currently, Pomerdoge is rewarding presale investors with the chance to exclusively own part of the 7,777 NFTs that'll be minted on the platform. Moreso, presale investors will earn a percentage of the revenue generated from the Pomergame platform - a platform under the Pomerdoge ecosystem.</p>
<p>The revenue will be distributed based on the number of POMD tokens users have in their accounts. Anyone can become a presale investor and enjoy these benefits. All you have to do is buy the Pomerdoge tokens now at the price of only $0.008.</p>
<p>The Pomerdoge project has been vetted by SolidProof and Cyberscope. The token's liquidity will be locked for life as a security measure for investors' assets. There are concrete reasons to believe in the promising investment opportunity presented by Pomerdoge.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In spite of the IMF obliging the Argentine central bank to say it wouldn&rsquo;t entertain Bitcoin, the next potential president is very much pro the king of the cryptocurrencies.</p>
IMF should be concerned
<p>When the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forced the Argentine central bank to guarantee that it wouldn&rsquo;t dabble in bitcoin, on pain of having its last crucial loan denied, the global financial agency must have thought that it had stopped bitcoin from being used in at least one Latin American country.</p>
<p>A short time later, and the IMF must be feeling more than a trifle worried as a libertarian pro-Bitcoin candidate looks to be about to win the country&rsquo;s presidential primary elections with more than 90% of the vote already counted.</p>
Central bank is a scam
<p>Javier Milei, young leader of La Libertad Avanza party, is not a meek and mild libertarian either. He is openly campaigning to abolish the Argentine central bank, calling it a &ldquo;scam&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Such a statement is inflammatory in the extreme and will probably be taken by many from the Argentine elites and the banking sector as the rantings of a revolutionary hot head.</p>
<p>However, the presidential hopeful has shown in interviews that he understands how money works, and he is calling out politicians and the central bank for cheating people with an &ldquo;inflationary tax&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Milei had the following to say in an interview:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The problem is that governments are not going to want to give up compulsory use of fiat currency. Bitcoin is the natural reaction to central bank fraud, but allowing money to become private once more isn&rsquo;t something the thieving politicians will allow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In past times, such language used by an aspiring politician, let alone one that would be president of his country, would have been denounced by the ruling class and would have been enough to see that this person got nowhere near any position of power.</p>
Argentina running out of options
<p>However, this is Argentina, a country that has played the IMF game for many decades, with presidents and top bank officials doing exactly as they were told, only for Argentina to lurch from one default crisis to another, over and over again, with citizens' purchasing power in the Argentine peso practically going to zero, and with an annual inflation rate of well over 100%.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In spite of the IMF obliging the Argentine central bank to say it wouldn&rsquo;t entertain Bitcoin, the next potential president is very much pro the king of the cryptocurrencies.</p>
IMF should be concerned
<p>When the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forced the Argentine central bank to guarantee that it wouldn&rsquo;t dabble in bitcoin, on pain of having its last crucial loan denied, the global financial agency must have thought that it had stopped bitcoin from being used in at least one Latin American country.</p>
<p>A short time later, and the IMF must be feeling more than a trifle worried as a libertarian pro-Bitcoin candidate looks to be about to win the country&rsquo;s presidential primary elections with more than 90% of the vote already counted.</p>
Central bank is a scam
<p>Javier Milei, young leader of La Libertad Avanza party, is not a meek and mild libertarian either. He is openly campaigning to abolish the Argentine central bank, calling it a &ldquo;scam&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Such a statement is inflammatory in the extreme and will probably be taken by many from the Argentine elites and the banking sector as the rantings of a revolutionary hot head.</p>
<p>However, the presidential hopeful has shown in interviews that he understands how money works, and he is calling out politicians and the central bank for cheating people with an &ldquo;inflationary tax&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Milei had the following to say in an interview:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The problem is that governments are not going to want to give up compulsory use of fiat currency. Bitcoin is the natural reaction to central bank fraud, but allowing money to become private once more isn&rsquo;t something the thieving politicians will allow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In past times, such language used by an aspiring politician, let alone one that would be president of his country, would have been denounced by the ruling class and would have been enough to see that this person got nowhere near any position of power.</p>
Argentina running out of options
<p>However, this is Argentina, a country that has played the IMF game for many decades, with presidents and top bank officials doing exactly as they were told, only for Argentina to lurch from one default crisis to another, over and over again, with citizens' purchasing power in the Argentine peso practically going to zero, and with an annual inflation rate of well over 100%.</p>
<p>For Argentina to move onto the sound money base that is Bitcoin, could be a very interesting move for the country. That the elites in Argentina, plus the powers that be across the globe, might allow such a decision is something else.</p>
<p>Argentina is in an extremely precarious financial position, and has only just managed to avoid default just recently with the help of China and the Latin American Development Bank. It will take a very brave and resolute leader to oversee such an incredible transition. For Argentina, there may be no other option.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Bitcoin Hash Ribbons has just signalled again. Is this yet another infallible buy signal for this indicator?</p>
Price action about to change?
<p>All quiet on the Bitcoin front as the apex cryptocurrency continues to follow a meandering, slightly boring and predictable sideways trajectory between the $29,000 to $30,000 range.</p>
<p>However, momentum is perhaps just starting to bubble up underneath Bitcoin&rsquo;s wanderings as one of the most successful and trusted indicators has suddenly sprung into life - flashing a buy signal that was last seen at the beginning of the year, after which Bitcoin started to thrust its way out of the last bear market.</p>
The Bitcoin hash rate
<p>The Bitcoin hash rate is the amount of computing power that Bitcoin miners contribute to the network. The hash rate goes up when more miners are competing for blocks. On the flip side, when the price drops, or does not go up for a long period of time, miner capitulation happens, meaning that mining is no longer profitable, and miners take their machines offline.</p>
<p>Even though the Hash Ribbons are a lagging indicator, on the higher time frame they are a very reliable sign that a bottom or a dip in the Bitcoin price has been reached.</p>
<p>Given that Bitcoin is at a rather crucial point in what is seen by some as just a bear market rally, and by others as the initial phase of the new bull market, this signal will perhaps tip the argument more in the favour of the latter exponents.</p>
A perilous financial time
<p>A backdrop of dire economic warnings make for an incredibly interesting time for Bitcoin. The traditional monetary and banking system is on the edge of a cliff of financial oblivion, and should it go over this cliff, most financial assets might be expected to go with it.</p>
<p>There are analysts who say that Bitcoin is a risk asset, and so would be expected to be one of the first to feel the pain of a financial meltdown. However, others would say that Bitcoin was created precisely for such an extreme scenario, and given that it is outside of the traditional financial system, many investors would see it as a liferaft to which they could transfer their wealth.</p>
<p>It is certainly hoped that financial armageddon can be avoided, but given the way that governments and central banks have handled world economies, things are looking extremely perilous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It can be argued that the fiat currency experiment has reached the bitter end. All those still hoarding currency in the bank are doing so naively, probably unaware that their purchasing power is diminishing rapidly, and that they run the risk of being &lsquo;bailed in&rsquo; should the bank fail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bitcoin is a sovereign store of wealth that is scarce, predictable, and the most secure computing system on the planet. Those looking to save themselves in the perilous time to come would do well to investigate Bitcoin&rsquo;s properties.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Orbiting 29372 Objective: &nbsp;Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 14 August 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained confined to a very tight rangeearly in the Asian session as the pair continued to orbit the 29372.20 area, a previous upside price objective associated with historical buying pressure around the 24750 and 26044.70areas. &nbsp; Selling pressure has recently intensifed around the 29709 and 29534 areas while buying pressure emerged around the 29213 area, underscoring the recent tight range. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical trading was recently evident when buying pressure strengthened around the 28754 area, a previous downside price objective associated with selling pressure around the 29526 and 29344 areas. &nbsp;Large Stops are cited below the 27991.29 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 15460 to 31862.21. &nbsp; Additional areas of technical support and potential buying pressure in these appreciating ranges include the 27466, 27166, 26428, 26272, and 25715 areas.</p>
<p>Above the market, upside price objectives include the 30526, 30611, 30762, and 31145 areas. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Upside price objectives related to other levels of buying pressure include the 32125 and 33569areas, and Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 32043, 34531, 34658, and 35912 areas. &nbsp; Additional downside price objectives linked to recent selling pressure include the 28432, 28213, 28137, 27979, 27757, 27430, 27409, 27338, 27312, 27246, 26501, 26348, and 26199levels. &nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">Beyond its ground-breaking features, Uwerx's developers' agile methodology approach has significantly contributed to the project's success. They have been so committed to promoting Uwerx&rsquo;s vision and purpose that investors and users could completely trust them and buy into the project.</p>
<p class="s6">This was part of why the Uwerx launch was overwhelmingly successful, surpassing expectations and initial forecasts. The developers are back to work and ready to take Uwerx to the next level.</p>
<p class="s6">However, they witnessed a setback as Uwerx was attacked. The team has yet again shown commitment by quickly and efficiently developing recovery strategies and plans. This article will detail the launch, updates, the hack, and Uwerx&rsquo;s road to recovery.</p>
Uwerx&rsquo;s Successful Launch: Developers Set To Renounce Smart Contract Ownership
<p class="s6">After so much anticipation, Uwerx finally launched on August 1, 2023. The launch was successful, as everyone wanted to become a WERX holder. Also, investors and users made tons of profits with all the bonuses that were up.</p>
<p class="s6">The developers released updates on what to expect next from Uwerx as soon as the launch ended. Uwerx has finally deployed liquidity on Uniswap. The Uwerx Vault, which received positive feedback from 84% of the community, will soon be available as the smart contracts await a thorough audit. </p>
<p class="s6">To show their commitment to Uwerx&rsquo;s community, the developers immediately began the 25-year liquidity locking they promised to do once Uwerx launched. They are also ready to denounce smart contract ownership when Uwerx goes live on centralized exchanges. The team has submitted their applications to CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko to facilitate this. </p>
<p class="s6">The team is working to ensure the Uwerx platform is completed immediately. They are working on the core functionality design, focusing on Freelancer, Client, and Agency Dashboards, Project Management, and Additional Settings Pages. </p>
<p class="s6">Once this is finished, a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with functions will be released to the community for testing. Based on the feedback obtained, they will proceed with the premium design. </p>
<p class="s6">There will be a buyback campaign that will scale accordingly to provide support for Uwerx. It will happen weekly, although the dates and times will not be released to avoid anyone taking unfair advantage of the system.</p>
Uwerx Gets Exploited
<p class="s6">On August 2, Uwerx reported it got hacked, with the hacker stealing around $327,000. The attacker flash-loaned 20,000 ETH, which he swapped for 5,053,637 WERX. He then sent 4,429,817 WERX to the Uniswap pool. This amount was ten times the prior balance.</p>
<p class="s6">Afterward, he used the skim() function of Uniswap with the address 0x00...1 as the &ldquo;to&rdquo; address. He also used the transfer function of the Uwerx contract, which first modifies a sender&rsquo;s balance. </p>
<p class="s6">Since the &ldquo;to&rdquo; address was a UniswapPoolAddress (0x00...1), an extra 1% of the initial amount was burned. As a result, there was an imbalance that the attacker took advantage of to gain 176 ETH ($327,000).</p>
Uwerx Maintains Momentum As It Sets To Relaunch
<p class="s6">Despite the hack, Uwerx continues to shine as it devises ways to tackle the hack and maintain its momentum. Once they noticed the hack, they immediately alerted SolidProof and InterFiNetwork, their auditors. Also, the team contacted PeckShieldAlert and SlowMist_Team directly on Twitter. </p>
<p class="s6">The team began by putting out a white-hat bounty, stating the attacker should return 80% of the exploited funds and keep 20%. </p>
<p class="s6">A new WERX will be relaunched, and its platform will have more robust security measures. As to the relaunch, there will be a new contract address, which will be released to the community soon. </p>
<p class="s6">However, the contract address will be audited twice by reputable companies and once by an independent contractor. Due to a change in the contract address, the Uwerx Vault smart contracts are being altered, after which they will be audited before being released to the public.</p>
<p class="s6">The new WERX will be deployed on the Polygon network instead of Uniswap, on which it is currently deployed. This will enable token holders to easily use WERX on the Uwerxplatform without having to bridge, and it will also lower gas fees. </p>
<p class="s6">However, those who bought WERX on Uniswap will not be abandoned. The team has decided to airdrop the tokens at the end of the vesting period to ensure they still benefit. They also assure those who bought WERX during the presale that they are safe and will be unaffected by the relaunch.</p>
<p class="s6">The new WERX will be deployed with more liquidity. To do this, the funds reserved for the buyback campaign will be directed to liquidity. Also, the team is proposing a no-burn tax and a sliding sell tax, of which 100% will be directed to liquidity. </p>
<p class="s6">A poll is already up on Uwerx&rsquo;s Twitter page and Telegram channel, asking the community if they support a sliding sell tax wholly directed to liquidity. Another poll also asks the community how long the vesting period should be. </p>
<p class="s6">These polls will end on August 13, after which the development of the new WERX will commence on August 14. The team also welcomes feedback or opinions, which can be sent to feedback@uwerx.network.</p>
<p class="s6">Also, there will be press releases this week and another major announcement on August 21 to update the community on the new WERX development and plans for the relaunch. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="s6">The Uwerx platform development is ongoing, and the team has completed certain sections like Settings, Security, Help Center, Login, Privacy Policy, Create Account, and Finished Payments.</p>
<p class="s6">The WERX allocations will also be changed, and the new allocation is:</p>
● Presale: 57% (427,500,000)
● User Performance Incentives: 6% (45,000,000) 
● Liquidity Reserve: 14% (105,500,000)
● Marketing: 9% (67,500,000) 
● Team Tokens: 6% (45,000,000) 
● Partnership Incentives: 2% (15,000,000)
● Joining Incentives: 6% ( 45,000,000) 
<p class="s6">At the end of the presale, 25,499,071 WERX will be burned. The airdrop and vesting schedules were shifted, and the new schedules have been released. Uwerx&rsquo;s whitepaper will also be modified to reflect the ongoing changes. </p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx is on to big things, and once the polls are concluded on August 13, the team will announce the specific details of the new WERX, as they are committed to launching it as soon as possible. </p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx&rsquo;s dedication throughout this period has been incredible. Their efforts in tackling this challenge have removed all forms of doubt and fear the community initially had. No wonder its community has continued to gather momentum, growing to over 2,500 Telegram members and 2,000 Twitter followers.</p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx remains focused on its vision, which is to be a change in freelancing, and no matter what, it is resolved to achieve this purpose. So why not throw in your support? Be a part of this value-driven community by following the links below:</p>

<p class="s6">Also, there will be press releases this week and another major announcement on August 21 to update the community on the new WERX development and plans for the relaunch. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="s6">The Uwerx platform development is ongoing, and the team has completed certain sections like Settings, Security, Help Center, Login, Privacy Policy, Create Account, and Finished Payments.</p>
<p class="s6">The WERX allocations will also be changed, and the new allocation is:</p>
● Presale: 57% (427,500,000)

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bank of America reacts to the launch of PayPal&rsquo;s U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin PYUSD and argues that the asset is not likely to be used widely, at least not in the short term.</p>
<p>PayPal&rsquo;s recent groundbreaking announcement about the launch of its U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin PYUSD has provoked its share of criticism around the world. While it does seem a significant step towards crypto adoption, some say that PayPal won&rsquo;t see much success any time soon.</p>
<p>One of the U.S. largest banks, Bank of America, described the main reasons why PayPal USD is not likely to witness immediate adoption in its recent research report.&nbsp;</p>
Competing Against CDBCs
<p>First of all, Bank of America&rsquo;s analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss explained that the PayPal&rsquo;s stablecoin might face intense competition on the market:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over the longer term, we expect PYUSD to experience additional adoption headwinds as competition from central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and yield-bearing stablecoins increases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is true that numerous countries are actively exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) that could potentially compete with stablecoins as both are based on similar technologies and pegged to fiat currencies. Only this year, countries such as Brazil, South Korea, Russia, Japan, the UK, among others have reported new developments on the rollout of their CBDCs. There are speculations that the U.S. might also be working on its CBDC, even though some of the country&rsquo;s presidential candidates have claimed to be against it.</p>
Competing Against Other Stablecoins
<p>Besides, there are many other stablecoins PYUSD will have to compete with. Yield-bearing stablecoins are now especially attractive to investors, according to Bank of America:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Investors may have been fine holding non-yield bearing stablecoins, such as USDT and USDC, when rates were close to zero, but yield-bearing stablecoins will likely become increasingly available and attractive with short-term rates above 5%.&rdquo;</p>

Dealing with Regulatory Scrutiny&nbsp;
<p>Finally, the analysts also suggested that PayPal could face regulatory troubles if traditional banks are banned from issuing stablecoins:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Investors are likely indifferent to which stablecoins they hold as long as the stablecoins are perceived as safe and accessible on the largest trading platforms. We do not expect PYUSD&rsquo;s launch to lead to accelerated regulatory clarity, given the stablecoin&rsquo;s issuance does not alter systemic risk for traditional markets, but the stablecoin may face regulatory headwinds if non-banks are ultimately barred from stablecoin issuance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only a day after PayPal had unveiled its stablecoin project, the U.S. Federal Reserve published new guidelines regarding the use of &ldquo;dollar tokens&rdquo; by American banks. According to the statement, in order to engage in any sort of activity linked to stablecoins, the U.S. banks will now have to receive a written supervisory non-objection from the Fed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, crypto scammers didn&rsquo;t wait long to try and profit from the big news and flooded decentralized exchanges with fake PayPal tokens.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As cybercrimes rise in the country, Canada challenges local developers to create a secure repository for seized cryptocurrencies and NFTs.&nbsp;</p>
Challenge for Creating a Digital Asset Repository
<p>Due to a reported rise in crypto-related illegal activities across the country, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and Shared Services Canada (SSC) are pursuing a solution that can facilitate the seizure and storage of digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on various blockchains, according to the statement of August 10, 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The RCMP requires the ability to safely and securely store digital assets that have been seized and retained, until their eventual disposition at the conclusion of any legal proceedings. The development of a centralized repository solution would allow police officers to seize these assets in a user friendly manner, while also offering significant security to prevent the theft of said assets during their storage,&rdquo; reads the statement.</p>

<p>The authorities dare the Canadian innovative developers to come up with a safe digital asset repository that would help the police seize and safeguard stolen assets, in an effort to decrease cryptocurrency frauds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RCMP outlines fourteen mandatory and three desirable features a proposed solution should have. The primary considerations require the repository to be able to accept and process transactions on the top 20 cryptocurrency networks by market capitalization, as well as onboard and support new blockchains in the future.</p>
<p>Other demands on the list include a native Android application; secure processes to protect assets and dispose of them if needed; daily automated verification and notifications on asset transfers; clear instructions on seizing assets for officers; and more. The RCMP also listed three NFT blockchains that must be supported by the system at this stage &ndash; Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants of the challenge can submit their idea until September 21, 2023. Up to four contracts for Phase 1 could result from the challenge. Then, only two eligible businesses will be invited to submit a proposal for Phase 2.&nbsp;</p>
Combatting Cryptocurrency-Related Crimes
<p>The main reason behind the development of the digital asset repository is the surge of crypto-related activities in Canada:</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the rise of new and innovative methods to store and transfer assets, Canadian Law enforcement needs a safe and secure method to identify and seize said assets. As cryptocurrency continues to gain popularity as a transaction method and store of value in the general population, it continues to be used as a payment method for criminal activities. With ransomware/malware attacks and online scams making up the majority of these transactions. This challenge aims to leverage the private sectors innovation to develop a system used by the police to seize and store the ill-gotten gains from these criminal activities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that Canada is not the only country that experiences a rise in crimes linked to digital assets. For example, the FBI in the US has also recently reported numerous scams related to cryptocurrencies and NFTs, with one of the recent cases resulting in the loss of staggering $9million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, other countries are also looking for effective ways to deal with crypto crimes. One of the latest examples is a multi-agency investigation unit established by South Korea.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">TVL or the total value of digital assets locked in a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform is often used as a metric to judge the growth of a network. A recent report shows that Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) TVL have seen an upsurge. A new project, Pomerdoge (POMD), has shown potential, but can it keep up in the highly competitive cryptocurrency world?</p>
<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
Ethereum and Cardano TVL Explodes
<p class="s5">The TVL metric is often used to judge the growth of a DeFi network. Recent reports from Messari have shown that the TVL of Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) has been on the rise despite the bearish crypto market.</p>
<p class="s5">According to Messari, the TVL of Cardano has increased by 198.6% year-to-date (YTD). Cardano now has more than $175 million locked in its DeFi ecosystem. The increase in TVL has helped Cardano move from the 34th position to the 21st in overall TVL across all blockchains.</p>
<p class="s5">Messari links the growth of Cardano&rsquo;s DeFi ecosystem to the launch of stablecoins, improved programming languages, and new wallets. On the other hand, Ethereum still dominates the DeFispace as the leading network. At the time of this writing, Ethereum has more than $23.5 billion in TVL.</p>
<p class="s5">The explosive growth of Cardano and Ethereum is considered impressive due to the recent price drop in crypto prices. With the prices of Ethereum and Cardano forecasted to recover by the end of 2023, the TVL locked in their respective chains could increase further.</p>
Can Pomerdoge (POMD) Catch Up in the DeFi Space?
<p class="s5">In the already competitive DeFi space, a new project, Pomerdoge (POMD), is launching to public acclaim from market experts. There are bullish predictions for Pomerdoge because it is creating a unique niche for itself. Pomerdoge would be the first project to combine the fanfare of crypto meme coins with the fast-growing play-to-earn sector.</p>
<p class="s5">Pomerdoge is building an enthralling game where players can earn rewards and alsocommunicate via a social infrastructure. With unique, eccentric avatars called Pomerdoge, players will enter competitions in the eye-catching world of Pomerdoges. In-game products and NFTs can be sold for real money in the Pomerplace, the ecosystem's marketplace.</p>
<p class="s5">The platform is growing at an impressive rate as players have great opportunities to earn. Players can enter weekly contests and giveaways for a chance to win up to $100,000 in weekly giveaways. Experts have predicted that Pomerdoge will compete with the biggest names in DeFias it perfectly fuses entertainment and financial opportunity.</p>
<p class="s5">As a result, many analysts have predicted that Pomerdoge will become one of the P2E games and stage one of the largest rallies before the end of the year. Early forecasts estimate a 4,000% price gain for the Pomerdoge utility coin by December. Investors have a wonderful opportunity to join the Pomerdoge ecosystem before its massive rally, which is now trading at $0.007.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">A top crypto trader's bold prediction of a "glorious" Ethereum breakout has set the stage for an even more remarkable rally for $ROE, the native crypto of Borroe, an innovative AI-powered Web3 blockchain project. $ROE has emerged as a prime contender to outshine ETH in the crypto market.</p>
Borroe Finance's Unique Marketplace Takes Center Stage as $ROE Presale Gains Momentum
<p class="s11">As innovation is the driving force in the Web3 space, one project is capturing the attention of investors and blockchain analysts alike &ndash; Borroe Finance. This groundbreaking platform has introduced a unique marketplace that utilizes blockchain, tokenization, smart contracts, NFTs, and AI-powered risk assessment to revolutionize how Web3 businesses access funding. </p>
<p class="s11">As Borroe Finance continues its presale, the crypto community is excited over the potential of its native token, $ROE, to outperform even the mighty Ethereum.</p>
<p class="s11">At the heart of Borroe Finance lies its innovative marketplace, where businesses can mint Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) representing future revenue streams and outstanding invoices. </p>
<p class="s11">These NFTs are then sold at a discount, enabling Web3 startups to access upfront cash quickly and efficiently. The platform's AI-driven risk assessment and automated process ensure transparency, security, and timely funding, building confidence among investors and paving the way for the $ROE token to shine.</p>
What further sets Borroe Finance apart is its commitment to regulation and best practices. 
<p class="s11">The project proactively seeks regulatory compliance, ensuring that it operates within legal frameworks and safeguards consumer welfare. This strategic approach provides a solid foundation for investors, offering peace of mind and reducing potential risks associated with regulatory uncertainty.</p>
<p class="s11">One of the standout features of Borroe Finance is its recent smart audit by BlockAudit, a top auditing firm renowned for its thorough analysis of blockchain projects. This audit underscores the project's commitment to security and trustworthiness, a vital factor in today's crypto landscape. </p>
<p class="s11">With the assurance of a reputable audit, $ROE's appeal as a safe investment option is further amplified.</p>
<p class="s11">As the crypto community looks ahead to an exciting future, $ROE presents an enticing entry point for investors seeking exposure to the Web3 revolution. Borroe Finance's experienced team, innovative solutions, and commitment to regulation make it an attractive choice for those looking to capitalize on the next big wave in the cryptocurrency market. </p>
<p class="s11">As analysts predict a "glorious" Ethereum breakout, the potential for $ROE to rally even harder and outperform ETH becomes a compelling narrative that investors can't ignore.</p>
The Successful $ROE Presale 
<p class="s13">$ROE tokenomics is a cornerstone of Borroe Finance's ecosystem, designed to empower both investors and businesses within the Web3 space. </p>
<p class="s13">With a total supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens residing on the Polygon (Ethereum sidechain) chain, $ROE offers a unique value proposition differentiating it from traditional investments. </p>

$ROE to Dwarf ETH
<p class="s3">The crypto world is excited as Bluntz, a prominent trader known for accurately predicting Bitcoin's 2018 market bottom, unveils his latest analysis that's turning heads in the Ethereum (ETH) market. </p>
<p class="s3">In a recent tweet, Bluntz highlighted a nearly year-long wedge formation in the ETH/BTC trading pair, which he believes sets the stage for a "glorious" breakout. </p>
<p class="s3">The trader expressed optimism and signaled that the breakout might already be underway, suggesting a bullish target price of over 0.07 BTC (approximately $2,101). His prediction challenges the status quo, as he believes that many market participants are underprepared for Ethereum's potential upswing, making them vulnerable to a significant price movement.</p>
<p class="s11">Notably, Bluntz believes that Ethereum's bullish momentum has the potential to drive the price to an impressive high of 0.112 BTC (approximately $3,362). </p>
<p class="s11">This projection represents a substantial leap from Ethereum's current level of $1839. Investors and enthusiasts alike are eagerly watching Ethereum's price action, anticipating a "glorious" breakout and the potential for outsized gains continue to drive excitement within the crypto market. </p>
<p class="s11">As Ethereum's breakout scenario unfolds, $ROE's journey to outperforming ETH becomes an exciting narrative investors can't overlook. This is because, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum's price movements often serve as a barometer for the broader market sentiment. </p>
<p class="s11">Ethereum's significant moves can trigger other altcoins to surge even harder and outperform the leader.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance Labs, the venture capital and incubation division of Binance, has plunged $5 million into the Curve DAO Token (CRV), cementing its stance in the DeFi realm.&nbsp;</p>
Support From Industry Bigwigs
<p>The $5 million investment from Binance Labs in the CRV token is part of a strategic deal under which Curve will explore deployment to the BNB Chain. With $2.4 billion in total value locked (TVL) and a daily volume of $215 million, Curve is the second-largest decentralized exchange (DEX).&nbsp;</p>
<p>CRV, the Ethereum-based utility token of the Curve DeFi protocol, serves as a linchpin for exchanging stablecoins and other ERC-20 tokens, alongside staking, boosting, and governance voting.</p>
<p>The DeFi platform was recently hit by a severe re-entrancy exploit that robbed it of over $60 million worth of funds from its liquidity pools. It affected Curve even further as several exchanges withdrew their support for the CRV token from their platforms. Binance Labs&rsquo; investment in the CRV token has somewhat reversed that effect, acting as a vote of confidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform has also received support from other crypto bigwigs, like Justin Sun and DCF God.&nbsp;</p>
Binance Labs' Forward-Thinking Approach
<p>Yi He, Co-Founder of Binance and Head of Binance Labs, underscored the partnership's significance, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Curve is the largest stableswap, and as a key protocol in DeFi, it has contributed to the steady growth of the space in 2023. Binance Labs has offered our full support to Curve through our investment and strategic collaboration. We view this cooperation as a starting point and look forward to working together to further propel the growth of the DeFi ecosystem."</p>

Strategic Amalgamation for BNB Chain Boost
<p>Curve's multi-chain presence, capitalizing on speed and cost efficiency, is set to expand with its planned deployment to BNB Chain. This strategic move aims to bolster the growth of the BNB Chain DeFi ecosystem, amplifying its influence in the DeFi landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Curve founder Michael Egorov noted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"BNB Chain has earned a significant presence in DeFi, and is well positioned to deploy Curve's current and future products on its chain. We look forward to collaboratively fostering innovation and growth across the DeFi ecosystem."</p>

<p>The integration of Curve onto the BNB Chain will enhance scalability paving the way for handling more transactions and catering to the escalating user demand. Additionally, the alluring prospect of reduced transaction fees on BNB Chain serves as a magnet for cost-conscious users, solidifying the appeal of Curve.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>South Korean authorities have arrested the CEO of the Bitsonic crypto exchange, Jinwook Shin, for allegedly stealing $7.5 million dollars of user funds.&nbsp;</p>
Embezzlement Allegations
<p>Jinwook Shin was taken into custody by South Korean authorities on August 7th after an investigation uncovered that the CEO had been allegedly embezzling investments and deposits belonging to the exchange's users during the time period between January 2019 and May 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the initial report, Shin allegedly engaged in fraudulent activities that manipulated cryptocurrency prices and trading volume on Bitsonic, which led to the misappropriation of approximately $7.5 million (10 billion won) from user funds.&nbsp;</p>
Liquidity Issues Leads To Shutdown
<p>Despite facing liquidity problems and suspension of withdrawals on the crypto platform, Shin continued to provide cryptocurrencies to new customers. This persistence drew the attention of the Seoul cyber crime department, which alleged that Shin failed to purchase cryptocurrencies during this period, raising suspicions about the legitimacy of the exchange's operations.</p>
<p>In August 2021, the platform finally announced the closure of its operations, attributing the decision to "internal and external issues."&nbsp;</p>
<p>This announcement was followed by the shutdown of 11 domestic cryptocurrency platforms by South Korean authorities, who were investigating alleged fraudulent activities.</p>
Vice President Also Complicit
<p>The investigation further implicated the vice president of Bitsonic, who is believed to have played a role in devising a scheme to acquire the cryptocurrencies held by the CEO within the exchange system. The VP, who is referred to as Mr. A, was allegedly working hand-in-hand with Shin to buy the cryptocurrency held by the latter on the exchange platform. A shell company established in Singapore was allegedly used in the process of manipulation.</p>
Government's Stance Against Fraud And Cybercrime
<p>South Korean authorities have recently taken a tough stance against fraudulent activities within the digital asset industry. Last month, the Korea Securities Depository partnered with Code, a firm specializing in Travel Rules, to address the rise in unlawful activities within the virtual asset market. This partnership aims to promote the issuance and utilization of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEI) to enhance investor protection.</p>
<p>Additionally, the government has also been working on a crypto-tracking system, including an interagency investigation team, to counter cybercrime as a part of its commitment to ensuring the security and legitimacy of the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>As the investigation into the alleged embezzlement unfolds, South Korea's proactive approach against fraudulent activities in the cryptocurrency sector continues to underscore the nation's commitment to fostering a secure and trustworthy digital asset environment.</p>
