After lying in slumber for an exacting 12.9 years, it awoke to spend a staggering 1,005 bitcoin, a sum swelling to an impressive value of more than $29 million.</strong></p>
<h2>Waking Giant: Bitcoin Address Stirs From 12.9-Year Slumber to Transfer $29.7 Million</h2>
<p>In these modern times, bitcoin transactions from the era of 2010 have become a rarity. The <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rare-2010-bitcoin-block-reward-stirs-after-13-years-of-dormancy/">last known spending</a> of a dormant 2010 bitcoin occurred on July 24, 2023. On that particular day, a user unlocked a 50 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> block reward, equivalent to $1.4 million. However, the movement on August 14, 2023, was tinged with a more extraordinary flair, as an astonishing 1,005 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, worth $29.7 million, was transferred.</p>
<p>The keen eyes of Btcparser.com <a href="https://btcparser.com/?a=12vZGymxSfbXmYB6tHYS4oM8kMYYBxDZHx">first caught</a> this monumental movement, while Whale Alert further <a href="https://whale-alert.io/transaction/bitcoin/4c97e0c9475fd8ef1b14d2e8b79201d2b8fa423e164212c14580da5256d64d81">corroborated</a> the spend. Meanwhile, Blockchair&#x2019;s privacy meter unmasked the transaction&#x2019;s frailty, revealing that privacy was rather low when the 1,005 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was expended, and highlighting two critical flaws that undermined the transaction&#x2019;s anonymity.</p>
<p>According to the privacy tool, the 1,005 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was gracefully swept into another address, accompanied by multiple appearances of the same address in the inputs. Blockchair reported that the funds found their new home at the address &#x201C;<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1q6r4t630f6hgek20lyj0phy8k43s8nl0zcrxsy7">bc1q6</a>,&#x201D; which, at the time of penning this account, comfortably nestles 1,004.99 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the original address harboring the 1,005 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> remained unmoved with respect to the <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/address/12vZGymxSfbXmYB6tHYS4oM8kMYYBxDZHx">corresponding bitcoin cash (BCH)</a> that the owner possesses. Bitcoin.com recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/idle-no-more-11-4-million-in-sleeping-bitcoins-wake-up-after-years-of-dormancy/">chronicled</a> the stirring of $11.4 million worth of slumbering bitcoins from 2016 and 2014, as they awakened this past weekend after years of inertia.</p>

<p>These slumbering bitcoin transactions, particularly the enigmatic ones from 2010, inject a sense of intrigue and speculation. Enthusiasts find themselves captivated by the mystery, endeavoring to unravel the identity of the owner and the narrative intertwined with the coins.</p>
<p>Beyond the allure, this movement stands as a testament to the durability and longevity of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> private keys when safeguarded with diligence.</p>

Addressing the widespread issue of tainted change, also known as leftover unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) remaining from Whirlpool Coinjoins, this could represent a monumental advancement in the cryptocurrency landscape.</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Tackling the Tainted Change Problem</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://samouraiwallet.com/">Samourai Wallet</a> has <a href="https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1687896997615882241?s=20">unveiled</a> a new capability allowing <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> to <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR/">monero (XMR)</a> atomic swaps, offering a more discreet means of transacting. Atomic swaps enable two parties to exchange different cryptocurrencies without requiring a trustworthy intermediary. Samourai&#x2019;s <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a> atomic swaps enhance this by integrating a privacy-oriented approach.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once in place, the system will grant users a more efficient way to handle tainted change, essentially UTXOs leftover from Whirlpool Coinjoins. This change or residual fragments of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> can result in diminished privacy and be detected by blockchain surveillance programs. Samourai has collaborated with the Mysu wallet developer, <a href="https://twitter.com/pokkst">Pokkst</a>, on the atomic swap functionality.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tainted or leftover change from Coinjoins has been an acknowledged issue for some time, and major brands supporting the Coinjoin scheme often overlook discussing the problem. Besides Samourai addressing tainted change concerns, the bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-cash-users-have-mixed-millions-of-dollars-since-cashshuffles-launch/">Cashshuffle</a> system was transitioned into <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cashfusion-practical-says-data-analyst/">Cashfusion</a> for this specific reason. Some wallets also employ a method called &#x201C;change output inclusion&#x201D; to tackle tainted change.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Monero (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a>), a cryptocurrency with a focus on privacy, made its debut on April 18, 2014. Employing the Cryptonote protocol, Monero&#x2019;s use of ring signatures, stealth addresses, and bulletproofs conceals the particulars of both the sender and recipient, ensuring transaction confidentiality. This makes <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a> appealing to those seeking financial privacy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The potential to facilitate <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a> through atomic swaps offers the prospect of immediate, trust-free exchanges between the two digital currencies, eliminating the necessity for a middleman.</p>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Although Samourai&#x2019;s feature has received praise from the privacy community, several <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> maximalists have critiqued it for utilizing <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR/">monero (XMR)</a>. An X user going by the name &#x201C;Platelicker&#x201D; <a href="https://twitter.com/PlateLicker_21m/status/1687916641391181824?s=20">asked</a> followers if Samourai should be &#x201C;canceled.&#x201D; Unfazed by the criticism, Samourai continues to develop the feature.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#x201C;No one influences our roadmap but us,&#x201D; Samourai <a href="https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1687897001877258241?s=20">posted</a> to X. &#x201C;No one will bully us into submission. You&#x2019;re either along for the ride or you aren&#x2019;t. If you want off the ride, you better jump because we&#x2019;re not slowing down for you. It&#x2019;s as simple as that.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The introduction of Samourai&#x2019;s feature coincides with a period where enthusiasm for privacy features among cryptocurrency advocates has waned in recent years. Increasingly, influencers have compromised privacy to seek state approval or recognition and regulation of digital currencies like bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>). Anonymity-enhancing crypto tools have been relegated, privacy coins delisted from prominent exchanges, and a significant number of today&#x2019;s crypto influencers and businesses <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinMarketCap/status/1690801896448016384?s=20">embrace regulations and KYC</a> as positive aspects.</p>

The move comes despite the global market cap mostly trading lower to start the week, falling 0.23% as of writing. Dogecoin fell for a second straight session.</strong></p>
<h2>Chainlink (LINK)</h2>
<p>Chainlink snapped a four-day losing streak on Monday, despite the global market cap mostly tracking lower to start the week.</p>
<p>Following a low of $7.32 on Sunday, LINK/USD jumped to a peak of $7.54 earlier in today’s session.</p>
<p>Monday’s move sees chainlink edge closer to a key resistance level of $7.65, which was last truly broken on July 30.</p>

<p>In addition to this, an upward crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages looks imminent.</p>
<p>Should this occur, there is a strong possibility that chainlink may not only move past the aforementioned ceiling, but closer to the $8.00 level.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, LINK is tracking at $7.49.</p>

<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>On the other side of the spectrum, dogecoin moved lower for a second straight session, following last week’s bull run.</p>
<p>DOGE/USD fell to a low of $0.07409 to start the week, following an earlier high of $0.07615 the day prior.</p>
<p>Since peaking at a multi-week high of $0.0776 on Saturday, dogecoin has mostly traded in the red, which appears to be largely due to profit taking.</p>

<p>This spell of bearish pressure looks to be pushing price towards a key support level around the $0.0730 region.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) hovered close to its own floor, at the 50.00 mark.</p>
<p>Currently, price strength is tracking at 50.35, with the meme coin now trading at $0.07458.</p>

The month of August, however, has experienced two notable dips, each registering fewer than 100,000 inscriptions per day. These low points in August occurred specifically on August 4 and August 8, 2023.</strong></p>
<h2>From Records to Recursive Ordinals</h2>
<p>On August 11, 2023, the Bitcoin blockchain observed the number of Ordinal inscriptions exceeded 23 million. That particular day documented an impressive 252,653 inscriptions, representing more than half of the highest figure in August.</p>
<p>This apex transpired on August 6 as a remarkable 408,810 inscription records were engraved into the chain. This record-breaking feat on August 6 stands as the second-highest daily tally since the introduction of the Ordinal inscription trend.</p>

<p>Since Ordinals&#x2019; inception in December 2022, bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) miners <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis">accumulated</a> a total of 1,902.58 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> from inscriptions, equating to over $55 million in value. Miners experienced fluctuating daily returns in August, ranging from 1.3 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> to just above 4 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> due to inscriptions.</p>
<p>A noteworthy 72.3% of all Ordinal inscriptions utilize the &#x201C;text/plain;charset=utf-8&#x201D; format, whereas 20.9% conform to &#x201C;text/plain&#x201D; encoding. The remaining inscriptions &#x2014; 6.8% &#x2014; consist of various files such as PNG, JSON, webp, SVG, JPEG, HTML, GIF, mp4, mpeg, avif, javascript, pdf, PGP signature, midi, and wav.</p>

<p>For example, August 12 witnessed a total of 279,231 inscriptions added to the Bitcoin blockchain; among these were text-formatted files (277,180), images (546), applications (1,500), and five classified as &#x201C;other,&#x201D; according to Dune Analytics metrics. Furthermore, data dashboard creators @dgtl_assets also emphasize the presence of recursive Ordinals.</p>
<p>Introducing composability and the capacity to invoke other inscriptions&#x2019; content using a unique syntax, recursive Ordinals have significantly impacted the technology. A total of 138,365 recursive Ordinals have been engraved onto the Bitcoin blockchain thus far. With many in text format and a smaller number inscribed in image format.</p>

<p>Non-fungible token (NFT) sales statistics demonstrate 170,165 distinct addresses have traded <a href="https://dune.com/domo/ordinals-marketplaces">$300,066,361</a> in value over 682,047 Ordinal transactions. These transactions took place on marketplaces including Okx, Unisat, Magic Eden, Gamma, Open Ordex, Ordinals Wallet, Ordswap, Ordinals Market and Ordinals Market bt.</p>
<p>However, Bitcoin&#x2019;s standing in the <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io">NFT sales market</a> has significantly declined; out of 21 unique blockchain networks, Bitcoin now ranks seventh in sales over the past week. This trend is consistent with the 30-day sales ranking, where Bitcoin also holds the seventh position.</p>
<p>Once a formidable contender, claiming the second-place spot, Bitcoin has since been overshadowed. In the past month, chains such as Solana, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a>, Polygon, Mythos, and Immutable X have managed to outshine Bitcoin, reflecting a shift in the marketplace.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) started yet another week in consolidation, as price uncertainty in the market remained high.</p>
<p>After peaking at $29,441.00 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD dropped to a bottom at $29,124.11 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>

<p><!-- TradingView Widget END --></p>
<p>In order for bullish momentum to truly intensify this week, a ceiling of 49.00 will first need to be broken on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at a reading of 47.90, with the 10-day (red) moving average on the cusp of an upward cross.</p>
<p>A breakout above the 49.00 zone will also likely lead to a crossover of moving averages, which could be what is needed to recapture the $30,000 mark this week.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was also largely unchanged on Monday, as the cryptocurrency continued to trend sideways.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD fell to an intraday low of $1,834.80 to start the week, which comes following Sunday&#x2019;s high at $1,859.92.</p>
<p>The decline resulted in ethereum once again moving towards a key support point at $1,830, which is a level it has been tied to for the past few weeks.</p>

<p>Despite this downward sentiment, the 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages have moved closer to an upwards crossover.</p>
<p>Like with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> above, for this to occur the RSI would first need to breach a resistance zone, in this instance at the 48.00 point.</p>
<p>Should this take place, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> could hit $1,900 in the coming days.</p>

Through a historical examination of the development of securities laws, the brief concludes that an investment contract &#8220;requires contractual undertakings to deliver future value.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Law Professors Explain Investment Contracts in Amicus Brief</h2>
<p>Six professors from different U.S. universities have filed an amicus brief <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908.59.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backing</a> Coinbase&#8217;s position in its <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-urges-court-to-dismiss-sec-case-claiming-regulator-overstepped-its-statutory-authority/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">battle</a> against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>Stephen M. Bainbridge from UCLA, Tamar Frankel from the Boston University School of Law, Sean J. Griffith of the Fordham Law School, Lawrence Hamermesh of the Widener University Delaware Law School, M. Todd Henderson from the University of Chicago Law School, and Jonathan R. Macey from Yale Law School argue that for the tokens listed on Coinbase to be considered investment contracts, their issuers need to have some contractual undertaking for investors.</p>
<p>In their brief, the law professors undertake a historical look at the origins of securities laws, explaining that the current security law framework was inspired by &#8220;blue sky laws&#8221; (laws seeking to establish safeguards for investors against securities fraud), with these routinely relying on contractual arrangements between issuers and investors to determine what constituted an investment contract.</p>

<h2>Case Law Examined</h2>
<p>According to several cases examined by the legal scholars, in every case where investment contracts were recognized by the Supreme Court and the second circuit, there was some contractual binding between issuers and investors, even in post-<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Howey test</a> trials.</p>
<p>This view is also shared by Coinbase, which <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-alleges-sec-lacks-any-powers-to-regulate-digital-asset-exchanges-in-recent-filing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> a filing on June 28 declaring that &#8220;an economic arrangement can qualify as an investment contract only if it involves<br />an ongoing business enterprise whose management owes enforceable obligations to investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>The brief states the court should &#8220;adhere to the settled meaning of the term—consistently applied by the state courts interpreting state blue-sky laws, as well as by the federal appellate courts before and since Howey,&#8221; concluding that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under that settled meaning, an investment contract requires contractual undertakings to<br />deliver future value reflecting the income, profits, or assets of a business.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this view runs counter to SEC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-states-coinbase-misinteprets-howey-test-misuses-major-questions-doctrine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filings</a>, which stated that Coinbase &#8220;attempts to construct its own test for what constitutes an investment contract.&#8221; For the regulator, even in the absence of a contractual obligation, an arrangement might be considered an investment contract, detailing that &#8220;Howey did not require a common law contract, and no court has held otherwise.&#8221;</p>

First, with the introduction of the gold standard, then with advancements in banking communications, digitized international trade and investment, and remittances. All of these inventions have made the world economy more efficient. In recent years, this trend hasn’t stopped. World-leading entrepreneurs still continue to release exciting financial products that improve our lives and make the market more efficient.</p>
<p>The next iteration of financial technologies are already here: cryptocurrency, cryptography, distributed ledgers, and blockchain technology. These four technologies are already changing the nature of P2P payments and global value exchanges.</p>
<p>World Pay (WPAY) is the newest creation that seeks to build on the P2P and blockchain revolution to make finance more direct and transparent.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing WPAY: A Decentralized Payment System For Everyone</strong></p>
<p>WPAY is a decentralized payment system that is based on cryptographic proof rather than trust. WPAY’s payment system allows for direct transactions to take place between people without the need for a third-party.</p>
<p>This is a positive key feature that WPAY is introducing as it will help many people worldwide avoid the entry barriers, the high-fees, the slowness, and the risks of censorship of using traditional payment platforms such as Paypal. In addition, WPAY’s application of advanced cryptography protects users against fraud, while also supporting small transactions.</p>
<p>The world today is digital in every way. Social media interactions are digitized, communications are digitized, business is digitized, and finance is digitized. Resulting from this are realistic banking and app risks that happen every day such as fraud, hacks, and theft. A solution to these problems is WPAY.</p>
<p>In particular, WPAY is solving these problems with its platform that implements blockchain and cryptographic technology.</p>
<p>WPAY’s solution is based on cryptographic proof that facilitates direct transactions between parties without the need for a middleman. WPAY’s secure and innovative payment system ensures that transactions are irreversible, which protects sellers from fraud and protects buyers from payment uncertainties. This is the meaning of a win-win application.</p>
<p>WPAY is trailblazing on a new path towards improved fintech experiences.</p>
<p><strong>The WPAY Train Has Arrived: Use-Cases For The WPAY Token</strong></p>
<p>First, WPAY has released a token called the World Pay Token ($WPAY), which is a decentralized cryptocurrency built on the Binance Smart Chain. The WPAY token is a pure peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that allows for online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.</p>
<p>The World Pay Token provides a powerful connection between the real and virtual worlds, integrating the two universes where payments can be made more simply and the P2P industry can thrive.</p>
<p>The advantages of WPAY are that the token has no intermediaries, which means lower transaction costs, transfer speeds are fast, which means less waiting periods, and there are no borders, which means you can transact with anyone around the globe. These three primary features provide WPAY with the potential to streamline decentralized cross-border payments and transactions.</p>
<p><strong>The Future of WPAY: Experimenting With Its Ecosystem</strong></p>
<p>WPAY has announced an exciting roadmap which includes token listings on crypto exchanges. WPAY will list on MEXC on August 14th.</p>
<p>Additionally, WPAY will be launching utilities, introducing a WPAY P2P Exchange, and developing a WPAY Wallet that has two-factor authentication. WPAY’s next phase involves a WPAY P2P launchpad, a WPAY blockchain, QR scan functionality, a WPAY card, which connects to Visa or Mastercard, and an NFT marketplace.</p>
<p>These initiatives showcase that WPAY is planning to develop an ecosystem that will strive to attract more users to its platform.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency and P2P systems are a bright partnership that can yield positive benefits for the world. WPAY has the ability to play a major role in the industry.</p>
<p><strong>About WPAY</strong></p>
<p>WPAY is a decentralized payment system that is based on cryptographic proof rather than trust. WPAY’s payment system allows for direct transactions to take place between people without the need for a third-party.</p>

Now that the bloc, which unites leading emerging markets, accounts for over a quarter of the global gross domestic product (GDP), it could become a counterpart of the G7 group of developed economies, they say. </strong></p>
<h2>BRICS Push for Global Economic and Financial Reform Deemed Hard to Ignore</h2>
<p>With more countries willing to join <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BRICS</a>, which currently consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, the bloc’s push to reform the global economic and financial system should be taken seriously, according to Anthony Rowley, a veteran journalist specializing in Asian economic and financial affairs.</p>
<p>Given the weight of the economies of the BRICS members, which already account for more than a quarter of the world GDP, “no one can dismiss lightheartedly now their challenge to the established economic order,” Rowley wrote in an article published Saturday by the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.</p>
<p>BRICS leaders are preparing to discuss the organization’s expansion during their summit on August 22 – 24 in Johannesburg and the piece quotes South Africa’s top diplomat responsible for relations with the bloc who revealed that over 40 countries have either formally applied or expressed interest in joining the union.</p>
<p>“But it is not so much size that matters as the diverse areas into which BRICS members are projecting their influence,” Rowley remarked. He believes that this diversity is what seems to have guided BRICS towards a more global perspective than that demonstrated by other regional formats.</p>
<p>The journalist also pointed out that BRICS differs from regional trade and investment agreements in seeking to provide members with alternative financing sources, including through its New Development Bank (<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-to-offer-more-loans-in-local-currencies-president-calls-for-diversified-global-currency-system/">NDB</a>), launching mechanisms for settlements in local fiat and developing central bank digital currencies (<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-to-test-digital-ruble-in-11-cities-moscow-subway/">CBDC</a>s). He also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>BRICS is a natural pole of attraction because its chief focus is to promote multilateralism and global governance, not least in the areas of economics and finance.</p></blockquote>
<h2>BRICS Future Role Depends on China-India Rivalry</h2>
<p>At the same time, some see these traits jeopardized by the rivalry between China and India, which have differing views on the bloc’s enlargement. While Beijing is pushing for rapid expansion, New Delhi favors association of other countries without necessarily granting them full membership.</p>
<p>BRICS “could evolve to become a counterpart to the Group of Seven (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G7</a>) in world affairs, resulting in a profound impact on international relations,” according to Hung Tran, a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank. Whether this is positive or negative depends on whether China’s or India’s approach prevails, he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Tran elaborated that India “has tried to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-faces-opposition-to-rapid-brics-expansion-from-india-and-brazil-report/">resist</a> China’s efforts to turn the BRICS group into a support organization for China’s geopolitical agenda … and explicit anti-U.S. rhetoric.” India also wants to focus BRICS on <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-president-dilma-rousseff-calls-for-the-creation-of-a-global-south-focused-financial-system/">Global-South</a> economic and financial cooperation, reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar and reforming international financial institutions to give developing countries more voice.</p>
<p>Rowley and Tran’s comments on the role and future of BRICS come after the UAE professor of international affairs and strategy Mohamed El Yattioui <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-expansion-to-make-west-recognize-new-world-order-de-dollarization-uae-professor/">suggested</a> recently that the induction of new members would allow the grouping to push Western nations to accept changes in international relations and recognize what he called the “new world order.”</p>

Researchers Juan Ignacio Iba&#xF1;ez and Alexander Freier make the case that Bitcoin miners&#x2019; demand for cheap electricity provides incentives for increased renewable energy production. However, for mining to play this decarbonizing role, the industry needs to adapt.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Researchers Reveal Bitcoin Mining Could be a Potential Catalyst for Renewable Energy Growth</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) process that underpins Bitcoin has faced criticism for high electricity use and carbon emissions. However, Iba&#xF1;ez and Freier&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2078-1547/14/3/35">research analysis</a> indicates the network&#x2019;s thirst for inexpensive energy may attract miners to renewable sources like solar and wind. This additional revenue stream could aid renewables&#x2019; profitability and incentivize capacity expansion.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;There are reasons to view Bitcoin for decarbonization in a positive light: not only does it need minimal policy support to deploy, but also the advantages of bitcoin mining (interruptibility, flexibility, portability, etc.) are intrinsic technical strengths, whereas challenges are mostly the result of economic factors and contingent technical circumstances,&#x201D; the author&#x2019;s explain.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Effectively, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/unidentified-miners-f2pool-lead-all-time-bitcoin-mining-rankings-a-comprehensive-review-of-bitcoins-historic-block-discovery/">BTC mining</a> would act as a &#x201C;flexible load resource,&#x201D; absorbing excess renewable supply that would otherwise be wasted. The mining industry&#x2019;s mobility and interruptibility make it well-suited to provide grid stability services. By smoothing imbalances between fluctuating renewable generation and variable demand, mining may facilitate increased renewable penetration.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
However, for mining to drive decarbonization, adaptations are required. The researchers note that mining must avoid exacerbating peak grid demand and utilize excess renewable supply only. With predominantly renewable-based operations optimized to grid conditions, the Bitcoin network could plausibly produce a net-decarbonizing impact, Iba&#xF1;ez and Freier&#x2019;s analysis details.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Nonetheless, the authors say uncertainties remain regarding timelines and the feasibility of entirely carbon-neutral mining. Iba&#xF1;ez and Freier&#x2019;s study highlights that <a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/north-tonawanda-welcomed-bitcoin-miners-some-residents-regret-it/article_0f4eb6e6-36f2-11ee-85bc-9be5d17a4da0.html">public backlash</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/white-house-pushes-dame-tax-proposal-to-address-alleged-environmental-costs-of-crypto-mining/">regulations</a> could also threaten the industry&#x2019;s growth. Still, Iba&#xF1;ez and Freier argue Bitcoin holds unique technical strengths that warrant <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kpmg-study-highlights-bitcoin-minings-potential-to-shrink-carbon-footprints/">further research</a> into its potential <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/esg-study-shows-bitcoin-minings-potential-to-eliminate-0-15-of-global-warming-by-2045-claims-no-other-technology-can-do-better/">environmental role</a>, rather than outright dismissal.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;Within the broader field of Bitcoin research, this study positions the energy consumption and decarbonization potential of bitcoin mining as a significant and consequential area of investigation,&#x201D; the study insists. &#x201C;Given the unique attributes and possible impacts of Bitcoin mining on energy grids and climate change, it is our conviction that this issue represents one of the most important future research directions in the realm of Bitcoin studies,&#x201D; the study concludes.&#13;<br />

<h2>Elon Musk&#8217;s X Seeks to Open an &#8216;Entire Financial World&#8217;</h2>
<p>While the acquisition and transition of X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, to the hands of Elon Musk, tech visionary, and eccentric millionaire, has not been without its <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-sparks-controversy-with-twitter-rate-limits-censorship-expert-says-musk-has-stepped-on-a-rattlesnake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiccups</a>, it&#8217;s undeniable that Musk&#8217;s vision has changed the direction of the company &#8211; for good or otherwise, depending who you ask to. The legacy Twitter, commandeered by Jack Dorsey, felt like more of a traditional Nasdaq-listed company with processes carried out by company employees, and users were separated from it.</p>
<p>Musk has tried to scrap this notion, having a more close-to-the-user approach and introducing the idea of rewarding content providers with part of the revenue received by the company using this content as the hook. This is nothing new, as monetization has been implemented widely in the content industry; however, X seems to want to do it in the most universal way possible.</p>
<p>This is evidenced by the renewed requirements that users wishing to benefit from this plan need to fulfill, which have been <a href="https://twitter.com/Support/status/1689781903514017792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1689781903514017792%7Ctwgr%5E46bc733a422113e56563e8b07aa9ca75ac7cf4cd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2023%2F08%2F10%2Fx-formerly-twitter-lowers-requirements-for-its-ad-revenue-sharing-program%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lowered</a> recently with the idea of getting more people to benefit from the program.</p>
<h2>Using a Legacy Payment System</h2>
<p>However, Musk&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1683656350046232578?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ambition</a> of making X&#8217;s users able to &#8220;conduct their entire financial world&#8221; and <a href="https://twitter.com/X/status/1679572360695824384" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X&#8217;s</a> &#8220;effort to help people earn a living directly on Twitter&#8221; crash with the reality of using legacy payment rails to distribute gains. At the time of writing, Twitter only allows users to receive these earnings by using a Stripe account, a U.S. and Dublin-based payments processor.</p>
<p>This limits the reach of X&#8217;s programs to only the 45 countries where the company is <a href="https://stripe.com/es-419-us/global" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a>, leaving users of countries like Russia &#8211; which is facing economic sanctions from Western countries &#8211; and developing or excluded nations like Venezuela outside of the scope of these.</p>
<p>This does not have to do with X launching its own cryptocurrency &#8211; in fact, Musk has outright <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/x-will-never-launch-a-crypto-token-says-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">denied</a> this will ever happen &#8211; but using cryptocurrency payment rails based on low-fee tokens or even U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins while still following compliance and tight KYC procedures could be the solution to keep expanding the platform&#8217;s user base.</p>
<p>At the same time, X could also accept these same cryptocurrencies for paying for advertisements and premium memberships, allowing these same users to invest in getting more reach for their content, generating a circular economy out of these activities.</p>
