					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum supporters are confident that prices will break the $2,000 level. However, recent moves by its founder, Vitalik Buterin, and the Ethereum Foundation, the team managing the smart contracting platform, raises concerns, especially from coin holders and traders, on whether the coin has what it needs to break above key resistance levels. ETH Transfer Raises Concerns Among Investors On May 5, a tracker, LookOnChain, noticed that Vitalik.eth, the domain associated with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, transferred 200 ETH, which is worth about $400,000 at current valuation, to Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange.

					<description><![CDATA[The second largest crypto blockchain Ethereum is preparing for a new upgrade that will reduce transaction fees on the network. The upgrade tagged “Dencun” will also introduce more use cases for Ethereum.  Notably, Ethereum Foundation made the announcement of Dencun upgrade just three weeks after the Shapella upgrade. With the upcoming Dencun upgrade, Ethereum network users can now transact with lower fees.  Introducing Dencun Upgrade &#8211; What You Need To Know The upcoming Dencun upgrade will feature Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). These are proposals that aim to bring changes to the network. The Ethereum community usually reviews the proposals to accept or reject them. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Reap Profits As Mining Difficulty Hits 3-Month Low If the community accepts the EIPs, they become a part of the Ethereum network codes. The Dencun upgrades have four proposals, including EIP-1153, EIP-6475, EIP-4844, and EIP-6748.  The first proposal is EIP-4844 or Proto-Danksharding or The Surge. The Surge aims to bring in “data blobs” for Layer 2 solutions to post transaction and proof data instead of CALLDATA.  The blobs offer lower gas costs since they’re never stored on the blockchain permanently. The blob aims to lower the transaction fee on Ethereum.  Other Dencun Proposals Bring Diverse Changes The second important proposal for review is the EIP-6780. This proposal is to deactivate the SELFDESTRUCT opcode but still preserve its functionality. EIP-6780 proposal will allow the creation and erasure of contracts in a single transaction but not delete the contract code or storage. Related Reading: PEPE Market Cap Crosses $1 Billion As Gemini Listing Rumors Spread The third proposal is EIP-1153 which will bring two new opcodes, TSTORE and TLOAD, to the network. The developers aim to provide transient storage that will be cleared once a transaction ends. This will add more use cases, from re-entry locks to single-transaction ERC20 approvals. The fourth proposal is EIP-6475: SSZ Optionals. This change supports EIP-4844 since it defines one of its SSZ elements in the transaction format. The aim is to facilitate forward compatibility with SSZ objects that will be introduced to the network.  While the four proposals above remain the major ones, the development team has others that might be considered too. One of the probable ones is EIP-2537: Precompile for BLS12-381 curve operations. -Featured image from Pexels and chart from Tradingview]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Dogecoin market saw a significant drop in price on May 4 to a low of $0.077 but eventually increased by 5.19% the next day. Despite the bear&#8217;s pressure, Dogecoin bulls are struggling to regain positive market sentiment.  Notably, the Dogecoin price has experienced a slight 0.53% increase within 24 hours. According to CoinMarketCap, DOGE has a 24-hour trading volume of $345,154,234, up by 37.60%. Related Reading: PEPE Market Cap Crosses $1 Billion As Gemini Listing Rumors Spread Based on its market cap of $11.02 billion, Dogecoin is presently ranked No. #8 among all cryptocurrencies with a price of $0.07. Bulls Trying To Ease Market Pressure Dogecoin market sentiment seems bearish as today&#8217;s Fear &#38; Greed Index is 27 (Fear). This indicates a relatively low investor sentiment towards DOGE and suggests that the market may be experiencing fear or uncertainty. Notably, DOGE is experiencing high volatility, fluctuating rapidly over short periods. Despite the downtrend, the Dogecoin bulls are trying to ease market pressure by continuing to buy the asset and pushing its price up. Dogecoin trades below the 50-Day and 200-Day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). These levels indicate that DOGE is in a downtrend or bearish movement due to high selling pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator shows 45.24, which suggests that the asset&#8217;s momentum is relatively neutral. An RSI reading of 45.24 is closer to the oversold region than the overbought territory, which may indicate that the asset is slightly undervalued or oversold. The MACD trades below the signal line, indicating that the sellers control the market. The MACD histogram also confirms the bearish sentiment as the histogram is below the zero line. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Reap Profits As Mining Difficulty Hits 3-Month Low The momentum will likely continue going down if the bulls cannot maintain the selling pressure. Some Factors Affecting Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Below are some key factors affecting Dogecoin: Endorsement From Celebrity: The involvement of celebrities, news coverage, and engagement from the community have contributed significantly to the growth of Dogecoin.  This cryptocurrency has become an important financial instrument, often included in institutional investment portfolios and widely accepted by exchanges. Notably, famous figures such as rapper Snoop Dogg, rock band KISS leader Gene Simmons, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have been vocal about their support for Dogecoin, with Musk tweeting about the cryptocurrency since 2019 and each tweet causing a surge in its price. Market Sentiment: Like any other asset, the price of Dogecoin is influenced by market sentiment. If investors are optimistic about the future of Dogecoin, they may buy more, driving up the price. Conversely, if investors are bearish about the cryptocurrency, they may sell their holdings, causing the price to decline. -Featured image from Pixabay and chart from Tradingview]]></description>

<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator shows 45.24, which suggests that the asset&#8217;s momentum is relatively neutral. An RSI reading of 45.24 is closer to the oversold region than the overbought territory, which may indicate that the asset is slightly undervalued or oversold.</p>
<p>The MACD trades below the signal line, indicating that the sellers control the market. The MACD histogram also confirms the bearish sentiment as the histogram is below the zero line.</p>

<p>The momentum will likely continue going down if the bulls cannot maintain the selling pressure.</p>
<h2>Some Factors Affecting Dogecoin (DOGE) Price</h2>
<p>Below are some key factors affecting Dogecoin:</p>
<p><b>Endorsement From Celebrity</b><b>:</b> The involvement of celebrities, news coverage, and engagement from the community have contributed significantly to the growth of Dogecoin. </p>
<p>This cryptocurrency has become an important financial instrument, often included in institutional investment portfolios and widely accepted by exchanges. </p>
<p>Notably, famous figures such as rapper Snoop Dogg, rock band KISS leader Gene Simmons, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have been vocal about their support for Dogecoin, with Musk tweeting about the cryptocurrency since 2019 and each <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1628328918964109313" rel="nofollow">tweet</a> causing a surge in its price.</p>
<p><b>Market Sentiment</b><b>:</b> Like any other asset, the price of Dogecoin is influenced by market sentiment. If investors are optimistic about the future of Dogecoin, they may buy more, driving up the price. Conversely, if investors are bearish about the cryptocurrency, they may sell their holdings, causing the price to decline.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Polygon (MATIC) is slightly shedding its gains today as the bears aim to seize control of its price. Despite the price fluctuations, its trading volume is up by 16%, indicating growing interest from traders.  Polygon has dropped below the $1 mark since April 23. However, it trades within the $0.9 and $1 price range. What&#8217;s Next For MATIC? MATIC is in a sideways trend today, forming a red candle on the price chart. The recent price volatility might reflect the activities in the general crypto market, where the top coins are slightly gaining. Related Reading: PEPE Market Cap Crosses $1 Billion As Gemini Listing Rumors Spread MATIC has dropped below its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), with bearish sentiment in the short and long term. Also, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 40.24 in the neutral zone.  However, the indicator is moving downwards and might descend into the oversold region of 30 if the bears prevail.  MATIC&#8217;s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is slightly above the signal line and shows convergence. Also, it has a negative value, a bearish signal for the asset. The technical indicators suggest that MATIC might experience further price decline before the bulls rally again. MATIC is trading close to the $0.9451 support level, and the bears at the $1.0064 resistant level have kept its price down.  If the current market conditions persist, a descent to the next support level of $0.9231 is possible. However, MATIC is currently in a sideways trend reflecting traders&#8217; hesitation in the market. It will likely fall to the $0.9451 resistance before the bulls rally again.   Securitize Launches On Polygon Despite Price Drop A trading firm, Securitize,  launched a feeder fund on the Polygon blockchain.

					<description><![CDATA[UMA (UMA) has registered an impressive 28.7% gain in the last seven days, according to data by CoinMarketCap. In a week marked by market losses and little gains, the DeFi token showed much resilience to emerge as one of the biggest weekly gainers.  Although most of the market stands in awe of the stunning bullish performance of the popular meme coin &#8211; PEPE -, UMA’s remarkable price gain has recorded much profit for its investors, drawing significant attention. Related Reading: PEPE Market Cap Crosses $1 Billion As Gemini Listing Rumors Spread UMA’s Price Action  Initially, UMA began trading the week around a price region of $1.95. The token showed no significant movement until two days after when it attempted a bullish run but couldn&#8217;t break past the resistance level at $2.31.  On May 5, i.e., yesterday, UMA experienced a hike in its market price, gaining by over 43% to move from $2.18 to break above the $3 price mark for the first time since August 2022.  Although UMA&#8217;s price has since slipped from such high levels, the DeFi token appeared to have found support and could be gearing for another breakout. At the time of writing, UMA is trading around $2.55, with a 0.22% loss in the last 24 hours. In this same period, the token’s trading volume has boosted by a staggering 438.82% to attain a value of $336.70 million.  Interestingly, UMA’s price growth is also reflected by the growing traction on its platform. Based on data from Stelareum, Total Value Locked (TVL) on the UMA protocol has grown from $10.33 million to $11.12 million over the last two days.  UMA trading at $2.523 &#124; Source: UMAUSD Chart on Tradingview.com Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Reap Profits As Mining Difficulty Hits 3-Month Low UMA Protocol Set To Record New Partnerships Amidst the impressive market performance of the UMA token, its underlying network appears to make much progress on the adoption front.

The Optimistic Snapshot Execution, or oSnap as it is known, enables the “execution onchain of transactions performed off-chain immediately but with protections against harmful proposal execution.” The last protocol to integrate the oSnap module was the popular decentralized exchange, ShapeShift.

					<description><![CDATA[We’re officially in the meme coin season as Floki Inu becomes the latest meme-based token to experience a significant price pump. The cryptocurrency inspired by Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu pup has long been considered as the next big memecoin and it appears to be living up to its hype.  Floki Inu is currently up 40% in the past 24 hours and is the second-best performing crypto-asset during this period after the fast-rising Pepe token.  Floki Inu Benefiting From High-Profile Listings This latest price surge can be linked to a series of high-profile listings by exchanges in recent days. Bitfinex was the first to announce the listing of Floki on May 3rd in a move that came out of the blue and surprised many in the crypto community.  This was followed by Binance, the largest exchange in the world, disclosing on May 5th that it would be listing Floki alongside Pepe in its innovation zone, with users able to deposit as of May 5th.  The exchange further noted that it would begin trading the tokens on May 6th across four pairs: PEPE/USDT, PEPE/TUSDT, FLOKI/USDT, and FLOKI/TUSD. Binance also intends to permit borrowing on both assets and plans to add new margin pairs for FLOKI and PEPE on Isolated Margin in the next 48 hours. The Isolated Margin pairs include FLOKI/USDT and PEPE/USDT. News of this listing caused significant excitement to the crypto community, which led to a positive market movement for both assets. PEPE achieved a new market high of $0.0000028, surpassing the $1 billion market cap, while FLOKI also increased by 60% within a few hours.  During this period, Floki Inu has experienced increased trading volume as many investors look to purchase the token in anticipation of a bull run. The recent bull-run of PEPE, which has risen by 11,000% in less than a month, has spurred the hype for memecoins and Floki Inu appears to be the major beneficiary.  Related Reading: Former DoJ Kennedy Jr, Laments on Global Financial Censorship, Shows Support For Bitcoin What&#8217;s Next For Floki Inu? Floki Inu has gained a substantial following as a community-driven cryptocurrency that is looking to adopt a unique approach to decentralization. Its low transaction fees and suite of products, including an NFT metaverse game, the FlokiFi Defi ecosystem, the Floki University, and the NFT marketplace, have placed it high among crypto enthusiasts. In addition, the Floki team has always positioned the project as community-first and has made high-profile partnerships with sports clubs to gain adoption among mainstream crypto users.  Related Reading: BRC-20 Token Standard A Hotspot For New Memecoins As PEPE Soars This latest price surge is expected to bring about renewed interest in the token that appeared to have stalled in recent months.

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a series of corrections in the last few weeks, following a rally over the past few months. According to a recent report by Santiment, investors are actively depositing ETH to various crypto exchanges, and this activity has reached its highest level in the past eight months.  While this trend may suggest a growing interest in the cryptocurrency, it also indicates that the price of ETH may experience surging volatility in the near future. As more investors deposit their ETH into exchanges, this influx of supply may impact the demand and cause fluctuations in the market.  In other words, the surge in active ETH deposits may be a harbinger of potential price turbulence, which could impact investors&#8217; portfolios.

					<description><![CDATA[New York Attorney General (AG) Letitia James has proposed a new state bill to regulate the cryptocurrency industry further, as she believes the space is enduring “rampant fraud and dysfunction”. This new set of crypto regulations would impose independent public audits of crypto exchanges, ensuring that New York residents do not lose their cryptocurrency investments to deceptive business practices. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Lawyer Castigates The SEC’s Argument Saying It’s Unfounded And Absurd New York AG Announces &#8216;Strongest And Most Comprehensive&#8217; CRPTO Act On Friday, May 5th,  the office of the New York Attorney General released a press statement, disclosing the plans to augment state regulations over cryptocurrency and crypto-related organizations. James proposed the “Crypto Regulation, Protection, Transparency, and Oversight” (CRPTO) Act as a new piece of crypto legislation. James described the CRPTO Act as “the strongest and most comprehensive” batch of regulations over the crypto industry in the United States. The AG’s office noted that the proposed bill, if passed, will safeguard investors, consumers, and the broader economy. In her proposal, the attorney general suggested that the state of New York impose independent public audits of crypto exchanges and prohibit residents from owning brokerages and cryptocurrency-issuing companies to prevent conflicts of interest. Additionally, the bill would mandate crypto organizations to reimburse customers for fraud-related losses. The CRPTO Act is quite comprehensive, as it also tackles the regulation of the stablecoin ecosystem. The proposed state law specifies that firms should only be allowed to market a digital asset as a stablecoin if it is backed one-to-one by “U.S. currency or high-quality liquid assets as defined in federal regulations”. The CRPTO proposal will make it to the floor of the New York State Senate and Assembly during the 2023 legislative session. If passed, it would give the attorney general&#8217;s office the authority to issue subpoenas for violations of the regulations and impose civil penalties (up to $10,000 for individuals and $100,000 for organizations). New York Regulators To Continue Crackdown On Crypto Following the huge collapses that rocked the crypto industry in 2022, various federal agencies, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have turned up the heat on the digital asset industry this year. In response, several crypto organizations have bemoaned the lack of clarity clouding cryptocurrency regulations in the country. Interestingly, not only the Federal regulatory authorities are currently on high alert. State regulators, like the New York AG’s office, have also intensified regulatory efforts on the crypto industry. For instance, the New York Attorney General’s office filed a lawsuit against the crypto platform KuCoin in March, alleging the firm provided brokerage services without properly registering. In February, the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) ordered Paxos to stop minting stablecoin BUSD, stating that the dollar-pegged asset is an unregistered security. With the proposed set of crypto regulations by attorney general Letitia James, it doesn&#8217;t appear that the New York regulators are slowing down in their clampdown on the crypto industry this year.  In any case, the cryptocurrency industry continues to show strength, with a market cap of $1.177 trillion.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin miners have received a boost in profits after the scheduled difficulty level adjustment resulted in a positive balance. This is the first time since February that the difficulty, which controls the issuance of coins on the network, has decreased. Recent data from Braiins showed that Bitcoin computing power experienced a drop of over 45+ EH/s between April 20 and 28. However, this trend has been reversed with the increase in miner profits over the last week. Despite the recovery of the hashrate to 350 EH/s, it was not sufficient to prevent a 1.45% difficulty adjustment retracement, as stated by Mempool.space. Currently, the mining difficulty level is at 48T (trillions).  This change in difficulty level affects the miners&#8217; profitability, as less competition for the reward means increased estimated income for those still connected to the network. Bitcoin Miners Profit As Hashprice Increases The current price for Bitcoin hashpower rose to 0.088 USD/TH/day (88 USD/PH/day), up from 0.077 USD/TH/day (77 USD/PH/day) on May 2. This 11.49% increase over three days is a positive development for Bitcoin miners, indicating increased profitability for their operations. The hashprice is a crucial metric for calculating the profitability of a mining operation, representing the value assigned to a unit of computation in dollars per terahash or petahash per day. While the cause of the significant hashrate drop last week is uncertain, the current state of the network justifies the quick reconnection of miners.  Recently, there has been increased interest in BRC-20 tokens, which are used to create memecoins, leading to network congestion in Bitcoin within a few days of their release. As recently reported, this could be a possible factor in the hashrate drop. As a result of this high activity on the network, the fees are now making up 12.4% of the miners’ revenue.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Out: Experts Predict $36,000 Target As Market Outlook Remains Positive Bitcoin Commissions Rise After New Ordinals Record  In the wake of the rising interest in tokens that can be registered to Bitcoin through Ordinals, the value of transaction fees paid by Bitcoin users has surged. Within a single day, the average transaction fees have more than doubled. As per the data from Mempool.space, the current transaction fees range from 70 sat/vB to 100 sat/vB. This implies that a transaction of 140 vB (median) would require payment of almost $4 USD to get confirmed within the first few minutes. Note that the sudden interest in tokens registered through Ordinals is responsible for the backlog of transactions that need confirmation, leading to a surge in average commissions. According to Murch, a Bitcoin developer, the mempool depth has reached 104 blocks despite having 8 blocks per hour for the last six hours. The rise of Ordinals NFTs has not been without controversy, as some Bitcoin maximalists blame this trend for the increased transaction fees that have resurfaced in recent months.  Related Reading: Former DoJ Kennedy Jr, Laments on Global Financial Censorship, Shows Support For Bitcoin Bitcoin Price Analysis At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $29,000, up 2% in the last week.

					<description><![CDATA[The memecoin ecosystem has once again brought magic to crypto investors as PEPE the frog records massive gains and unbelievable numbers. The now popular PEPE meme token based on Ethereum was originally inspired by the Bitcoin BRC-20 PEPE which launched earlier in March, 2023. PEPE&#8217;s exponential price growth in its barely first month recorded close to 38,900% ROI for early investors. This has led to crypto enthusiasts and developers to explore the original BRC-20 token standard version with which the first PEPE was created on. The BRC-20 is a new and unique token standard that has recently gained massive popularity and exposure due to the successes of the Ethereum based PEPE.

This new token standard was created by a pseudonymous on-chain analyst called Domo. Domo created the BRC-20 token standard in March 2023 to facilitate transfers of fungible tokens across the Bitcoin network. This new experimental standard would also enable developers and programmers to create and send fungible tokens, including memecoins, via the Bitcoin ordinals protocol. While several token standards are present in the blockchain industry, the BRC-20 was modeled after the popular Ethereum ERC-20 standard, although there are some fundamental differences. The ERC-20 standard which requires using smart contracts to launch a token is quite different from the BRC-20. The latter simply requires a Bitcoin wallet to mint and create tokens without using smart contracts. Related Reading: SUI Gets A Bear Introduction On Day 2, Will Sell Pressure Continue? PEPE Sets A Precedence For Newer Memecoins Recently, there has been a frenzy of newer memecoins launching into the crypto market using the BRC-20 token standard due to its popularity. According to data reports from Coinmarketcap, 8,500 tokens, including memecoins, have been minted and launched using this standard. This has resulted in a massive surge in the BRC-20 token market capitalization and transaction volume which were reported to outperform Bitcoin by over 50% between April 29 and May 2, 2023. We can see that in the last 10 days number of BRC20 tx has largely surpassed that of ordinals. They might even soon overload the bitcoin network and cause issues. pic.twitter.com/FSGzkfeTJT &#8212; Crypto Koryo (@CryptoKoryo) May 2, 2023 The increasing transaction volumes and market capitalization of BRC-20, have drawn the interests of many investors who explore a variety of tokens created using this new token standard. However, it is important to note that the BRC-20 standard is still in its experimental phase, and as such, caution should be exerted when exploring tokens based on it.
