<p class="md-end-block md-p">Horizon Blockchain Games and Polygon Labs have announced a strategic partnership designed to revolutionize web3 infrastructure with an integration of Sequence, Horizon's comprehensive web3 developer platform, into Polygon Supernets.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The collaboration is aimed at promoting scalability, security, and improved user experience within the platform. The introduction of Horizon's Sequence product into Polygon Supernets is poised to respond to and take care of the specific requirements and needs on an enterprise level, alongside providing tooling for decentralized application developers.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Sequence operates a web3 wallet and infrastructure stack, encouraging accelerated development on Polygon Supernets. The alliance offers credits to incentivize projects, which includes a toolkit composed of the Sequence Wallet, Token &amp; NFT APIs, Indexer, Relayer, Node Gateway, Marketplaces, and SDKs for projects aligning with Polygon Supernets, Polygon zkEVM, and Polygon PoS.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The partnership builds upon previous successes of Horizon and Polygon Labs collaborations. Past notable collaborations include SuperGaming&rsquo;s Tower Conquest, Cool Cats, BoomLand, Magic Eden, Sunflower Land, among others. Through this strategic alliance, developers and brands are being presented with a wide array of web3 tools with Sequence's all-in-one stack, aiming to augment the web3 development experience within the Polygon ecosystem.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Adding to the portfolio of successful collaborations, Horizon and Polygon have already seen success with their web3 trading card game, Skyweaver. Developed on Polygon PoS for its scalability, environmental sustainability, and transaction speed, it was designed to provide an intuitive experience for its players, many of whom were new to web3. </p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Horizon is a long-standing collaborator in the Polygon ecosystem, and integrating their Sequence Wallet and developer stack into Polygon Supernets marks another significant stride in building web3 infrastructure on Polygon," shares Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon Labs.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Polygon Supernets</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Polygon Supernets, currently at its test version v0.9, represents a crucial development phase for the Polygon community. This version is a significant step towards the finasl release v1.0, reflecting the maturation of the product suite. It's important to bear in mind that this is a test release and may come with certain limitations, including breaking changes and lack of backward compatibility. While users are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the new features, they should approach this version strictly as a test iteration.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Some of the key features in v0.9 are expanded allowlists and transaction blocklists, staking and token separation support, NFT bridge support, and enhanced transaction fee management. These additions bring the "Super networks" vision of Polygon Supernets a step closer to realization, introducing new core contracts and consensus client primitives. The MVP stage of the protocol now boasts expanded bridge transaction allowances, the introduction of MATIC staking, and support for different ERC tokens, among others.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Given the inherent risks associated with a test release, the Polygon team has undertaken a comprehensive source code audit to ensure the product's reliability and security. However, the final release version will undoubtedly carry more stability and an array of new features, bringing us one step closer to a more scalable, secure, and user-friendly blockchain ecosystem.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Notably, Horizon and Polygon Labs are also offering more support routes for brands and developers to penetrate the Web3 ecosystem. The provision of credits for projects developed on Polygon Supernets with Sequence further helps out aspiring developers who may just be starting out in the ecosystem. Horizon's all-in-one Sequence stack simplifies web3 development and content creation while enhancing user experience, making web3 technology more accessible.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">On a wider scale, Polygon Labs, renowned for developing Ethereum scaling solutions for the Polygon protocols, has achieved notable milestones since its inception. As a testament to its impact, it has seen over 261 million unique addresses, 1.4 million smart contracts created, and 2.7 billion total transactions. Major web3 projects and corporations, such as Aave, Uniswap, Robinhood, and Stripe, have found a home in the existing Polygon network. </p>
