<p>On the third of January 2023 Bitcoin will celebrate its 14th birthday. What is in store for the freedom currency?</p>
<p>The man, woman, or group of people that went by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto minted the Bitcoin genesis block on January 3, 2009. In that first block, Nakamoto wrote the following headline from the Times newspaper: &ldquo;Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Such a headline being written into the genesis block of the fastest growing asset in history really puts into perspective as to &lsquo;why&rsquo; Satoshi Nakamoto spent the time on engineering something that might provide a liferaft out of the poverty-inducing monetary system that persists to this day.</p>
<p>The monetary system makes the world go round, and yet nobody really questions how currency comes into existence. It&rsquo;s not taught at schools, and even probably the vast majority of individuals who work in banks or financial agencies don&rsquo;t have a clue as to how our debt-based monetary system actually works.</p>
<p>The renowned industrialist Henry Ford said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The noble venture that is Bitcoin was probably allowed to flourish because those in the banking system initially ignored it, and then they laughed at it. However, the laughing went on long enough for Bitcoin to gain the network strength through decentralised nodes, that allowed it to become the securest computing network on earth.</p>
<p>Some attribute the saying to Gandhi in his struggle for Indian independence from the British &ldquo;First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bitcoin is in the fighting phase right now. The bankers and those that lead the world&rsquo;s financial agencies have realised to their horror that Bitcoin has become a force to be reckoned with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the full force of the &lsquo;system&rsquo; can be brought to bear on the Bitcoin network. A fight to the death of either of the systems has now been initiated, and only the future will tell us if the decentralised Bitcoin network will be able to withstand the tsunami of misdirection from the mainstream media, and the crushing weight of regulation that will seek to grind the cryptocurrency sector into the dust.</p>
<p>The fear is that control over the minds of the populace will give the central banks the time they need in which to roll out their central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). And of course, once these are embedded across the world, liberty and freedom can be crushed once and for all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To quote former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair: &ldquo;Education, education, education.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We live in a world where mainstream news generally always carries a particular slant, and where television and social media is full of inanities that lull us all into mind-numbing indifference. Retaining freedom is worth the time spent on educating oneself. Who will do so?</p>
