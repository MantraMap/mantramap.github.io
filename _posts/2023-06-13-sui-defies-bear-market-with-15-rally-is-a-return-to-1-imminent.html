Over the last 24 hours, SUI has put on a tremendous rally and has risen over 15% in this time period. With this rally, the altcoin has moved once more into bullish territory, which begs the question of whether SUI would be on its way back to $1 soon. SUI Crosses $0.7 After Rising Over 15% SUI returned to its bullish trend on Monday with a sharp recovery that saw its price rise quickly. The resulting surge in price saw the digital asset’s price rise above $0.7 after touching as low as $0.5 on Saturday. This over 15% rise also saw the altcoin dominate as one of the top gainers for the day.

The rise in price comes at a time when most of the market is still nursing loss with Bitcoin barely holding on to the $26,000 level. As such, this suggests some level of deviation on the part of the altcoin from the general market trend, which could point toward more upside to come. Is The Race To $1 Back On? Following its much-anticipated launch back in May 2023, the price of SUI traded well above the $1 price mark even as presale participants were able to sell their coins at a huge markup. However, the digital asset quickly lost footing above this level and dropped back down rapidly.

This saw its price fall to a new low of $0.5 last week before rallying back up above $0.7 on Monday. With this latest rally, it is possible that SUI could retest the $1 resistance but that depends on whether the bulls are able to keep momentum going. At the time of writing, the bears have already begun to take over the reins as SUI’s price has lost the $0.7 support.

Nevertheless, bulls must reclaim and hold the $0.7 support if SUI is to make a return to the $1 level.
