<p>Metamask supports <strong>any network that is compatible with the Ethereum network,</strong> such as the <strong>Binance Smart Chain, Cronos,</strong> and <strong>Avalanche</strong> networks. Users will need to manually add these networks to their wallets based on the documentation given by each network.</p>



<p>The default network for all wallets is the <strong>Ethereum</strong> mainnet. However, users are also able to connect <strong>Metamask</strong> to other blockchain networks, such as <strong>Polygon, Fantom, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Cronos, Harmony ONE, Velas, HECO, xDAI.</strong></p>



<p>Last month, <strong>ConsenSys</strong> updated its privacy policy, stating that it collects IP addresses and wallet addresses of the wallet users when they use the infrastructure service Infura, which is also owned by <strong>ConsenSys</strong>. <strong>Infura</strong> is the default way for <strong>MetaMask</strong> users to connect to the <strong>Ethereum</strong> blockchain. The company updated its privacy policy following the <strong>Uniswap DEX</strong>.</p>

<p>Coincu previously <a href="https://news.coincu.com/149533-consensys-wont-collect-user-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that ConsenSys was met with a lot of criticism from the community after updating the privacy policy. The company has voiced its commitment to protecting the privacy of its users in its latest announcement with more specific updates. </p>



<p>Accordingly, <strong>ConsenSys</strong> says it does not store wallet account address information when the waller users make a <strong>&#8220;read&#8221; </strong>request through Infura, such as to check their account balance in <strong>MetaMask</strong>. So there is never a problem with linking a wallet account address with an <strong>internet protocol (IP)</strong> address.</p>

<p>Users may borrow stablecoin (MAI) at <strong>0% interest</strong> through <strong>Mai</strong> <strong>Finance</strong>, a zero-interest lending system. Anyone may establish <strong>QiDao</strong> vaults and put down assets to be used as security for loans.</p>



<p>With the overcollateralized stablecoin system known as Mai, loans are always secured by having more value locked than the debt.</p>

</div></figure>



<p><strong>ChainSecurity</strong> revealed a new type of reentrancy flaw in <strong>Curve</strong> in the middle of <strong>October 2022</strong>. The so-called read-only reentrancy vulnerability enables an attacker to revisit the <strong>get virtual price()</strong> oracle function through a carefully written smart contract and obtain an inflated LP token price in return, opening the door for criminals to benefit. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1526.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="941" height="420" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1526.png" alt="Amber Group: Vulnerability In Mai Finance&#039;s Vault Has Been Fixed" class="wp-image-153960" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1526.png 941w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1526-300x134.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1526-768x343.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1526-750x335.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 941px) 100vw, 941px" title="Amber Group: Vulnerability In Mai Finance&#039;s Vault Has Been Fixed 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>To get the price of an LP token produced from the pegged assets of a stable swap pool, a lending protocol linked with Curve LPs often employs the oracle function offered by <strong>Curve</strong> and named <strong>get virtual price()</strong>.</p>



<p>For the time being, the attacker is free to alter the execution flow any way they choose. What happens if the attacker calls <strong>get virtual price()</strong> once more in the fallback function&#8217;s initial line? The virtual price increases when the quantity of Curve LP tokens is reduced, and the balances are not updated. Then, another batch of underlying assets might be removed, or even some pools could be drained using the manipulated pricing.</p>

<p>Ethereum founder <a href="https://news.coincu.com/149564-vitalik-buterin-dissatisfied-coindesks-rank/"><strong>Vitalik Buterin</strong></a> revealed his prognosis for <strong>the crypto sector in 2023</strong> in an interview with Bankless&#8217; David Hoffman, addressing Hoffman&#8217;s rising concerns that the adoption wave of Decentralized applications is now finished and there are less chances for developers in the future.</p>



<p>As a result, Vitalik Buterin outlined three significant unfulfilled potential in crypto that he intends to achieve: <strong>large-scale crypto wallet usage; development of inflation-resistant stablecoins; and increased popularity of Ethereum-based applications.</strong></p>



<p>Vitalik Buterin views<strong> the establishment of a stablecoin</strong> as the process of establishing more crypto wallet infrastructure to make it easy for everyone to use and ensure that the product is capable of taking on billions of users. It will be a revolution for the industry if it is <strong>inflation-resistant, internationally accessible, and robust</strong> to all kinds of conditions that occur, both <strong>on-chain and in the broader macro-economy</strong>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;If we can establish a stablecoin that can actually live in a number of settings, including the growing inflation in the US dollar, it opens up a lifeline for everyone to overcome.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Finally, the Ethereum founder stated that any <strong>technical breakthroughs</strong> that contribute to Ethereum removing login privileges from Facebook, Google, Twitter, and other centralized monopolies will allow Ethereum to finally take over. More market dominance in Internet-based apps.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Imagine being able to log in with Ethereum to work and replace Facebook, Google, and Twitter as the *rulers* of the Internet; isn&#8217;t that a great opportunity?&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, it appears that, in the context of &#8220;freezing,&#8221; Vitalik Buterin has more to say about <strong>his aspirations</strong> for the industry in the near future, in an effort to bolster those who are presently working and continue to follow the market.</p>



<p>Not only did the Ethereum founder do an in-depth interview with Bankless, but he also published an article on his own page <strong>in early December 2022</strong> to share his knowledge and advice with the blockchain community regarding the approaching years.</p>

<p>The action against <strong>LBRY</strong> shows the SEC is <strong>actively broadening the definition of disgorgement</strong>, according to <strong>Gabriel Shapiro</strong>, General Counsel of Delphi Labs. It aims to consider all LBC token releases as sales.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">SEC is radically expanding the concept of &quot;disgorgement&quot; in its case vs <a href="https://twitter.com/LBRYcom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@LBRYcom</a> &#8211;treating all distributions of LBC (to employees, to users of the app, etc.) as sales &amp; valuing the resulting benefits of distributions as = profits based on the then-current spot price of LBC <a href="https://t.co/XoIE1TqA9K" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/XoIE1TqA9K</a></p>&mdash; _gabrielShapir0 (@lex_node) <a href="https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1605177909752184833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 20, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>In the non-fraud lawsuit against <a href="https://news.coincu.com/147396-lbry-has-been-troubled-with-apple/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LBRY</a>, the XRP attorney is acting abusively. He brought up this as an obvious reference to the SEC&#8217;s strategy of putting an end to cryptocurrency. <strong>Deaton</strong> mentioned the <strong>SEC v. KiK </strong>summary ruling, in which the commission was unsuccessful in obtaining disgorgement.</p>



<p>The SEC is matching the distribution advantages to profits made on the current LBC spot price, it was further said.</p>



<p>Lawyer for XRP holders and <strong>amicus curiae </strong>in the XRP litigation <strong>John Deaton</strong> criticized the SEC&#8217;s stance on the cryptocurrency market. He emphasized the claim made by the commission in its objection that all funds raised by the cryptocurrency businesses were used for operations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The SEC is <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4af.png" alt="üíØ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> being abusive in this NON-FRAUD case and it reflects its overall approach to crypto &#8211; which is to kill it. In Kik after a summary judgement the SEC didn‚Äôt get disgorgement. This is about the message the SEC is sending to crypto in general.</p>&mdash; John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1605231668012408833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 20, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Deaton said that the SEC raised disgorgement after these allegations. According to the XRP attorney, under Liu, it is intended to be offset by proper business costs. The watchdog, however, argued that all of the LBRY&#8217;s funds were put to use.</p>

<p>Based on information obtained from the Nansen platform, the majority of the priciest items traded on <strong>Polygon</strong> in the previous twenty-four hours were trading cards related to <a href="https://news.coincu.com/152401-donald-trump-launches-new-nft-collection/">Donald Trump NFT Collection</a>.</p>



<p>The statistics for each week have shown tremendous improvement as well. As can be seen in the illustration below, approximately <strong>332,000 users</strong> have <strong>created new NFTs or traded</strong> on Polygon blockchain in the past week.</p>



<p>Former President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> <strong>NFT </strong>made available last week a compilation of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/152664-45000-donald-trump-nft-sold-out-within-hour/">45,000 NFTs</a>. The NFTs that were being traded on <a href="https://news.coincu.com/153884-polygon-co-founder-aims-to-make-beacon/">Polygon</a> were quickly purchased up until they were sold out.</p>



<p>According to the information provided by OpenSea, the overall volume of the NFT Trump collection is <strong>6332 ETH</strong>, which is equivalent to around <strong>$7.5 million</strong>.</p>



<p>The twelve most costly NFTs have valuations that range anywhere from <strong>28.5k MATIC</strong> to <strong>3.4k MATIC</strong>, which translates to approximately <strong>$22.8k to $2.7k USD</strong>.</p>

<p>In addition, the floor price is <strong>0.344 ETH</strong>, which is equivalent to <strong>$406.74 USD</strong>. This is a fourfold increase in comparison to the original starting price of <strong>$99</strong>.</p>



<p>The reaction on social media suggests that Trump&#8217;s decision may be an attempt to combine the NFT fan contact with political activism in advance of the next presidential election. The most significant gain is accrued by the Polygon Network as a result of Donald Trump&#8217;s NFT collection being released.</p>



<p>In point of fact, both the total number of mints and the total number of users of Polygon OpenSea have reached their greatest point <strong>since November</strong>.</p>

<p>The crypto trading company said that once FTX failed, it was left in a situation where its immediate liquidity was insufficient to cover lender recalls. However, the company&#8217;s top executives remained certain that they could survive the FTX infection storm. It hopes that once the reorganization plan is fully completed, the business will resume as usual.</p>



<p>The company also made a point of stating that it had asked for<strong> a light touch provisional liquidation order</strong>, which is frequently used when a company has<strong> a balance sheet solvent but a cash flow insolvent status</strong>. This enables the corporate reorganization to rapidly and successfully address the company&#8217;s cash flow insolvency challenges.</p>

On <strong>November 11</strong>, FTX and a number of other businesses run by <strong>Sam Bankman-Fried </strong>filed for<strong> Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</strong></p>

<p>The agreement, which takes the form of a non-binding term sheet, would substantially alter Greenidge&#8217;s present business model by moving it away from self-mining and toward hosting NYDIG&#8217;s mining rigs.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1844971/000162828022032258/gree_exhibit991x20222012.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filing</a> on Tuesday with the <strong>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</strong>, the company&#8217;s board is actively discussing the possibility of filing for voluntary bankruptcy and the timing of such a filing since cash burn is unsustainable. Even if the agreement with NYDIG is approved, Greenidge will still require $20 million in new funding from now through 2023 in order to stay afloat.</p>



<p>With the arrangement, <strong>NYDIG</strong> would buy miners with a mining capacity of about <strong>2.8 exahashes per second (EH/s) </strong>to be hosted by <strong>Greenidge</strong>, enabling <strong>NYDIG</strong> to get mining rights three months after the fulfillment of debt restructuring and hosting agreements. </p>

<p>The company would agree to a debt reduction of <strong>$57 million to $68 million </strong>for <a href="https://news.coincu.com/131801-greenidge-additional-losses-in-q3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Greenidge</a> in exchange for the miner purchases, the transfer of mining infrastructure and credits to <strong>NYDIG</strong>, and other considerations equating to those things.</p>



<p>As of <strong>September 30</strong>, the loan in issue still had a balance of around <strong>$74.7 million</strong>. <strong>Greenidge</strong> had predicted that it would have to fork up a minimum of <strong>$66.5 million in principal payments over the course of 2023 before coming to an agreement with NYDIG.</strong></p>



<p>The filing showed that Greenidge would host NYDIG&#8217;s equipment, thereby switching its revenue model from self-mining to hosting. In 2022, hosting has shown to be a challenging economic model to sustain, especially for miners like Greenidge who are impacted by natural gas costs.</p>



<p>In order to secure the remaining amount of the NYDIG loan, Greenidge would also pledge a sizeable chunk of its unencumbered assets as security. The company would continue to be the owner of miners with a <strong>1.2 EH/s capacity</strong>. Greenidge has a <strong>2.5 EH/s mining capability as of October 31, 2022</strong>, with around <strong>24,500 active miners.</strong></p>

<p>The miner&#8217;s financial situation is still unknown, and there is a serious question about its capacity to continue as a going concern, the company <a href="https://ir.greenidge.com/node/7706/html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> in its filing. It spent almost <strong>$8 million</strong> of its funds on operations last month, of which <strong>$5.5 million </strong>was used to pay principal and interest. The company had a cash balance of about <strong>$22 million </strong>as of <strong>November 30, 2022.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Greenidge</strong> further cautioned that although <strong>NYDIG</strong> and the company will make an effort to sign legal documents that contain the terms described in this release, there <strong>can be no assurances that these terms won&#8217;t change significantly or that the transactions discussed in this release will actually take place.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/151433-argo-blockchain-asks-for-resume-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Argo Blockchain</a> and <a href="https://news.coincu.com/152037-core-scientific-an-proposal-of-72-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Core Scientific</a> are two more miners who have cautioned about currency burn rates, in addition to <strong>Greenidge</strong>.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/130931-greenidge-seeks-to-raise-up-to-22-8-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, <strong>Greenidge</strong> had been seeking to increase capital by up to<strong> $22.8 million.</strong></p>

<p>Despite having a banner year across the board in its art business, the auction house <strong>Christie&#8217;s</strong> reported a <strong>significant drop</strong> in the amount of NFT that was sold this year in <strong>comparison to 2021</strong>.</p>



<p>Christie&#8217;s was successful in selling <strong>87 NFTs</strong> for a combined total of <strong>$5.9 million in 2022</strong>. Over<strong> 100 non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</strong> with a total value of more than <a href="https://news.coincu.com/47739-christies-sold-150-million-in-nfts/">$150 million</a> were sold at the art auction house <strong>in 2021</strong>; one of these was <strong>Beeple&#8217;s &#8220;Everydays: The First 5000 Days&#8221; NFT</strong>, which was sold for <strong>$69.4 million</strong>. Between the years 2021 and 2022, Christie&#8217;s NFT sales <strong>dropped by 96%</strong>.</p>



<p>Christie&#8217;s made <strong>significant headway</strong> in expanding its <strong>web3 and NFTs vertical in 2022</strong>, despite the fact that its NFT volume was smaller than in previous years. On<strong> July 18</strong>, it made its first investment, which was in a blockchain interoperability firm called<strong> LayerZero</strong>, which was developed by the company that established the venture fund.</p>

<p>Christie&#8217;s also auctioned works by <strong>Diana Sinclair</strong>, an 18-year-old NFT artist. Sinclair had developed media for a previous NFT sale of an unreleased Whitney Houston single that had brought in <strong>$1 million</strong>. After then, Sinclair became a member of the <strong>United Talent Agency</strong>, which is a prominent talent representation organization.</p>



<p>The depressed market circumstances during 2022 led to a general decrease in the number of NFT trades. On the other hand, the week beginning May 1 of this year had the greatest number of NFT trades ever conducted, which totaled<strong> $1.2 billion</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>The Beacon</strong> accelerator in <strong>New York</strong> has announced that it will provide <strong>early-stage cryptocurrency startups</strong> with guidance and funding. Beacon has already invested in <strong>15 separate firms.</strong> He would not reveal the identities of the startups, saying only that they will be revealed in the new year.</p>



<p><strong>Nailwal</strong> established <a href="https://news.coincu.com/120183-polygon-and-cere-network-web3-fund/">Symbolic Capital</a> in<strong> August</strong> with a <strong>$50 million fund</strong>, of which this accelerator is a subsidiary. Together with <strong>Kenzi Wang (co-founder of Symbolic Capital)</strong>, Prateek Sharma (former vice president at Sequoia Capital), and Uri Stav (former chief security officer at Digital Currency Group), Nailwal manages the startup accelerator.</p>



<p>In order to help guide and fund startup entrepreneurs, the accelerator has created a <strong>12-week program</strong>. Over <strong>30 founders from 15 firms</strong> in fields as diverse as DeFi, infrastructure, and gaming participated in the program&#8217;s inaugural &#8220;<strong>Cohort 0</strong>,&#8221; which launched i<strong>n October.</strong> To be considered for the next group, applications must be submitted <strong>by January 31</strong>. Along with <strong>SoftBank&#8217;s Neil Cunha-Gomes, Coinbase&#8217;s Dan Kim, Electric Capital&#8217;s Maria Shen, and Pantera Capital&#8217;s Paul Veradittakit</strong>, Beacon also counts these investors as advisors.</p>

<p>Beacon is creating a <strong>community for program participants and graduates</strong> to stay in touch with one another. Beacon boasts that it has created <strong>a bespoke platform</strong> for investors to examine ideas, view video pitches, research founder histories, and get personal introductions to company leaders.</p>



<p>Next month, Beacon will offer a live demo day where founders can present their products to over <strong>300 investors.</strong> Ultimately, its goal is to produce<strong> the next hundred web3 unicorns</strong>.</p>

<p>The company CEO <strong>Evgeny Gaevoy</strong> was thinking about what to do in the event that<strong> TerraUSD (UST)</strong>, a stable cryptocurrency tethered to the value of one US dollar, collapsed.</p>



<p>Around <strong>$15 billion</strong> worth of circulating UST coins were supported by reputable investors, including <strong>Lightspeed Venture Partners</strong>, who also funded the parent corporation. However, a tiny group of people began tweeting about its impending extinction as early as <strong>2021</strong>, claiming that algorithm-based stable coins that were not backed by officially recognized currencies were destined to fail.</p>



<p><strong>Gaevoy</strong> developed a strategy that month with <strong>Marina Gurevich</strong>, his wife and the <strong>COO</strong> of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/133886-wintermute-paid-96-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wintermute</a>. The integration of Wintermute&#8217;s trading platforms with Terra&#8217;s blockchain technology took a month.</p>

<p><strong>Wintermute</strong> put up its own servers and operated <strong>Terra</strong> software nodes to acquire a front-row view of UST&#8217;s transactions and pricing, just how high-frequency trading firms aim to get the fastest access to stock market data. <strong>4,000 lines of code were written for brand-new trading algorithms</strong>. Then, on <strong>May 7</strong>, when the cost of UST dropped to <strong>$0.98</strong>, Gaevoy instructed his staff to schedule night shifts for the upcoming week.</p>



<p>Two days later, UST started its breathtaking freefall, and Wintermute launched its arbitrage plan.</p>



<p>The Terra play was a signature move for Gaevoy, who also had the guts to gamble in the dangerous area of decentralized finance, which many crypto businesses ignore.</p>

<p>In contrast to more specialized trading businesses, Wintermute&#8217;s approach is to explore all facets of digital assets.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>‚ÄúWe are not the best ones in everything we do,‚Äù Gaevoy says.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, its all-inclusive strategy and earnings from over a billion deals have piled up to significant amounts. Wintermute achieved <strong>$1.05 billion in revenue and $582 million in profits in 2021</strong> despite having just <strong>53 workers</strong>. Gaevoy holds a third of the business, making him at least hundreds of millions of dollars richer.</p>



<p><strong>Wintermute</strong>, a company that trades digital assets, made <strong>$225 million in sales in the first nine months of 2022 </strong>as opposed to<strong> $1.05 billion for the entire year of 2021.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gaevoy</strong> told the magazine that <strong>Wintermute had $720 million in assets and $400 million in equity.</strong></p>



<p>The CEO collected <strong>$12 million </strong>in dividends from the company&#8217;s owners last year.</p>
