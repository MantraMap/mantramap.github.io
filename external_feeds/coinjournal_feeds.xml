<li>Coinbase has rolled out a new subscription service called Coinbase One.</li>
<li>The service will give members access to $0 trading fees among other benefits.</li>
<li>The Coinbase One is expected to roll out across 35 countries in the near future.</li>
</ul>
<p>After staying in Beta since 2021, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/coinbase/">Coinbase&nbsp;</a>has officially opened its zero-fee subscription service called Coinbase One. The service has also been expanded outside the US into countries like the United Kingdom, Germany, and Ireland.</p>
<p>Through Coinbase One, customers will have the option of paying $29.99 per month to enjoy zero trading fees and higher staking rewards. Customers can pay for the subscription using their linked bank account (ACH) or linked debit card.</p>
<h2>Zero trading fees on Coinbase</h2>
<p>According to the statement issued by Coinbase, the Coinbase One service allows customers to access $0 trading fees, dedicated 24/7 phone support, $1M Account Protection, and pre-filled Form 8949 in Coinbase Taxes.</p>
<p>The statement by Coinbase in part reads:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Eligible users may sign up for Coinbase One which is an automatically renewing subscription requiring recurring payments. A Coinbase One subscription grants you the benefits of: (a) a waiver of Coinbase fees for buying, selling, and converting digital currencies on the Coinbase platform (which does not include Coinbase Pro&rsquo;s order matching platform), provided that a spread in the price is still included in all buys, sells, and conversion of digital currencies on the Coinbase trading platform (learn more about fees here); (b) a dedicated customer support line available twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week, three-hundred and sixty-five (365) days a year; and (c) Coinbase Account Protection. Coinbase may modify or suspend this program at any time upon notice.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>However, the fee-free trading volume limit as found in customers&rsquo; account settings will apply. When customers trade over their set trading volume limit, they will be responsible for paying regular trading fees.</p>
<h2>Widening international reach</h2>
<p>Coinbase aims to expand the Coinbase One service in 35 countries in the future as Coinbase tries to widen its international reach.</p>
<p>The move also comes just a month after <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/coinbase-unveils-a-global-crypto-exchange-as-crypto-crackdown-in-the-us-intensifies/">Coinbase unveiled a global crypto exchange</a> following the tightening regulatory environment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Bitcoin has been through many bear markets before, always surging back to higher highs</li>
<li dir="ltr">Dan Ashmore, our Head of Research, cautions against naive extrapolation of past returns, however</li>
<li dir="ltr">Until this past year, stock markets had done nothing but rise during Bitcoin&rsquo;s existence</li>
<li dir="ltr">Bitcoin was launched in 2009 as the stock markets bottomed, and the bull run afterward was one of the longest in history</li>
<li dir="ltr">This needs to be considered, cautions Ashmore, whilst sample size of Bitcoin trading with any sort of liquidity is also small</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin is volatile. Also true: water is wet and the sky is blue.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">A quick glance at a Bitcoin chart will tell you all you need to know about the meteoric rises and bone crushing pullbacks that the asset has produced over the years. In truth, it should be plotted on a scale, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/13809920">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">When looking at Bitcoin markets, therefore, it is tempting to jump to the conclusion that &ldquo;we have been here before&rdquo;. Bull markets and bear markets, easy come and easy go. Or, as Jeff Bridges <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL5avnRFovQ"><u>put it</u></a> so poetically in the Big Lebowski, &ldquo;strikes and gutters, ups and downs&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">While Bitcoin has drawn down many times before and, at least previously, always bounced back, I believe it is naive to extrapolate past resurgences into the present. Because no, we have not been here before.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">To be clear, I am not saying Bitcoin will not rise to new heights again. It easily could (I hold Bitcoin as part of my portfolio, albeit via a monitored allocation and obeying the boring all adages of diversification and risk management, but hey &ndash; that is for another time). My point, however, is that we have zero point of reference for the current situation. Despite a surge of 75% in the last six months, Bitcoin is 60% off its high in Q4 of 2021, with many investors underwater if they opened positions in the past three years as Bitcoin truly established itself on the mainstream stage. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let me explain why things are different this time around, and why assuming with blind confidence that Bitcoin will surge upward imminently may be misguided. First, the below are the biggest peak-to-trough drawdowns in Bitcoin history (the recent/current one is highlighted in yellow):&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/13810017">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">Clearly, Bitcoin has been here before. Right?&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Well, no it hasn&rsquo;t. Look at the dates of the above: all these drawdowns are from 2012 onwards. This is because Bitcoin was only launched in 2009. Indeed, it didn&rsquo;t really have any sort of liquidity or infrastructure (such as exchanges or a marketplace) until 2012 (and even then, liquidity was extremely thin).&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">And consider what has happened in the wider economy since Bitcoin was launched in 2009. On March 9th 2009, two months after Bitcoin launched, the Nasdaq hit a low of 1268. The S&amp;P 500 did the same, hitting a nadir of 676.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since then, markets have enjoyed one of the most remarkable, longest and explosive bull runs in recent history, as basement-level interest rates propelled asset prices to dizzying all-time highs. By late 2021 at their peaks, the Nasdaq hit a level of 16,057, the S&amp;P 500 4,793. Since those aforementioned lows in March 2009, that represents returns of 12.7X and 7.1X respectively. A historic period of gains.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Presenting the returns of both the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 since Bitcoin was launched in January 2009 (note &ndash; this goes back a couple of months before the trough of the stock market in March of that year and hence the returns are not as empathic as above) shows the run in markets visually throughout Bitcoin&rsquo;s life:</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/13811514">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">Or perhaps the next chart is better, showing quite how boisterous the stock market throughout Bitcoin&rsquo;s life during the period up to and including 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/13811605">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, every single dip in Bitcoin&rsquo;s history took place whilst the wider financial markets were humming along swimmingly. This all changed in 2022, of course, when inflation spiralled and the world&rsquo;s central banks began hiking rates at the fastest rate in recent memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Suddenly, for the first time in Bitcoin&rsquo;s existence, it was ticking along block-by-block while financial markets elsewhere were falling. And they were falling quickly, the S&amp;P 500 shedding nearly 20% in 2022, the Nasdaq losing over a third of its value. Not only were these losses the worst of any period in Bitcoin&rsquo;s life, they were, aside from minor falls in 2011 and 2018, the <em>only losses it had ever seen.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, this time is <em>different.&nbsp;</em>Blind faith in Bitcoin bouncing back aggressively because of the simple conclusion that it has done so before is a dangerous assumption to make. Again, Bitcoin could easily do exactly this, but it would be foolish to assume it is a guarantee because it has happened in the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The reality is that, until this past year, the world had no idea how Bitcoin would trade outside of the zero-interest rate vacuum that we have been operating in for the past decade. There is no trade history for Bitcoin going back to previous recessions, no chart one can pull up to assess how it weathered inflation in the 1970s, no reference point to anything but a stock market printing green candle after green candle.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Not only did all those previous resurgences come amid a period of cheap money and expanding central bank balance sheets, but Bitcoin markets were also incredibly illiquid. It took barely a drop of capital to move prices, as Bitcoin exploded from a fraction of a cent to thousands of dollars per coin. Bitcoin&rsquo;s existence has been brief itself, at 14 years, but its status as a financial asset of any sort of liquidity is even briefer again.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">So, for one last time: this is not a piece making any forecasts about the future of Bitcoin. I don&rsquo;t want to wade into such murky waters (not here, anyway!). Rather, it is a piece cautioning that we have such a small sample size to work with when it comes to Bitcoin, and it is important to be cognisant of that when assessing how it trades.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin has never experienced a bear market in the wider economy before. Until now. Overlooking that critical fact is a dangerous game to play.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Bit Digital share price has been in a strong bullish trend this year.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">It has soared by more than 375% from the lowest level in December.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Bit Digital stock price jumped on Thursday as cryptocurrency prices drifted upwards. BTBT stock has jumped by more than 375% from the lowest level in December, making it one of the best-performing companies in the industry.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bit Digital new machines&nbsp;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bit Digital is a relatively small&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/mine/hub/"><u>Bitcoin mining</u></a> company with a market cap of over $195 million. It competes with the likes of Marathon Digital and Riot Blockchain among others. The firm also provides Ethereum staking solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">BTBT shares have done well this year, helped by the strong performance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In most periods, mining companies have a close correlation with the price of Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The most recent Bit Digital news is that the company is considering expanding its mining operations in Iceland. The CEO told Wall Street Journal that the firm had acquired another 5,000 machine to diversify its mining operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Like other companies in the cryptocurrency industry, Bit Digital is concerned about the lack of regulatory clarity in the United States. With no explicit regulations, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the CFTC have decided to govern by lawsuits.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the same time, the Biden administration is considering raising taxes for companies in the industry. A paper by the Treasury Department recommended raising taxes by letting mining companies pay 30% of their total power consumption.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">After launching the new mining machines in Iceland, Bit Digital will generate most of its revenue in the country and in Canada.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The BTBT stock price is also rising because of the performance of&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/"><u>Bitcoin</u></a> prices. BTC jumped to a high of $27,205, higher than this week&rsquo;s low of $25,500.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bit Digital stock price forecast&nbsp;</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/04/18/1684417448229-650f8ca2-4de2-4972-9b73-224a99ca62b6.png" style="width: 626px;height: 304.631px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="626" height="304.631"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Turning to the daily chart, we see that the BTBT share price has been in a strong bullish trend in the past few months. It has managed to move above the key resistance level at $2.11, the highest point on July 21st last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bit Digital has also moved above all moving averages while the Klinger Oscillator has drifted upwards. The momentum oscillator has continued rising. Therefore, the stock will likely continue rising as buyers target the next key resistance point at $3. A drop below the key support level at $2.11 will invalidate the bullish level</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Hedera Governing Council has today announced that COFRA Holding has joined the Governing Council.</p>
<p>As a member of the Hedera Governing Council, COFRA will work to create innovative, blockchain-based solutions on Hedera, primarily focusing on areas like supply chain transparency and tokenization. COFRA Holding is a family enterprise with interests in sectors including real estate investment, sustainable food, clean energy, fashion retail, private equity and asset management.</p>
<p>In a statement commenting about COFRA&rsquo;s entry into the governing council, the Co-Chair of Hedera&rsquo;s Membership Committee, Simon Olson, said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t solve the world&rsquo;s most intractable problems by working in isolation. It&rsquo;s a coordination problem. In order to overcome problems like climate change and effectuate change on a global scale, you need to work with a wide cross-section of stakeholders. COFRA has a long, successful track record of building coalitions to tackle difficult problems and we believe that they will contribute enormously to Hedera.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2>The rise of the Hedera Network</h2>
<p>Hedera is a leading, open-source, leaderless proof-of-stake network and it has processed more than 8 billion transactions so far.</p>
<p>The network has one of the highest real-world transactions per second (TPS) of any blockchain, which is the main driving factor behind the high number of transactions on the network.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="http://blockchain.cs.ucl.ac.uk/blockchain-energy-consumption/">study by the University College London</a> found that Hedera&rsquo;s hashgraph proof of stake consensus algorithm is the most energy efficient, which makes it an ideal partner for climate-conscious businesses like COFRA.</p>
<h2>Hedera price reaction</h2>
<p>Although the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/hedera/">Hedera (HBAR) price</a> reacted mildly to the news, it could be the beginning of a reversal from the HBAR bear market that <a href="https://www.coinlore.com/coin/hedera-hashgraph/forecast/price-prediction">most technical indicators have been predicting</a>.</p>
<p>HBAR jumped by about 2% following the news to hit a seven days high of $0.05351.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul class="decimal_type">
<li>Ripple has today announced it has acquired Metaco.</li>
<li>Ripple (XRP) price jumped by 5.50% after the news.</li>
<li>At press time, XRP was trading at $0.469.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/ripple/what-is-ripple/">Ripple </a>has today announced its acquisition of Metaco, a Swiss-based provider of digital asset custody and tokenization technology. The move affirms Ripple&rsquo;s determination to take on the crypto custody market.</p>
<p>Both Metaco and Ripple share &ldquo;strong crypto DNA, top-tier institutional customers, and a long history of working with regulated entities to create secure enterprise-grade solutions.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The growing institutional crypto custody market</h2>
<p>With this acquisition, Ripple will expand its enterprise offerings providing customers with the technology to custody, issue, and settle any type of tokenized asset. On the other hand, Metaco will accelerate its growth trajectory since it now has access to Ripple&rsquo;s established customer base, capital, and resources to continue delivering on its commitment to banking and institutional clients.</p>
<p>In a statement commenting on the new acquisition, the CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Metaco is a proven leader in institutional digital asset custody with an exceptional executive bench and a truly unmatched customer track record. Through the strength of our balance sheet and financial position, Ripple will continue pressing our advantage in the areas critical to crypto infrastructure. Bringing on Metaco is monumental for our growing product suite and expanding global footprint.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Ripple is set to use the acquisition to leverage from the growing institutional crypto custody market which is projected to hit a 10 trillion market cap by 2030. Recent research conducted by Ripple showed that a majority of financial institutions and enterprises around the world have plans to use crypto custody solutions in their business within the next three years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">EU regulators have approved MiCA regulations</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">MiCA could pave the way for innovative crypto projects to prosper</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">MCADE price has retreated, although it could rise 10 times</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Europe&rsquo;s first comprehensive rules for crypto regulation are fast becoming law. Regulators in the region approved the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) rules on May 16 in what is seen as the first step towards getting crypto into a legal framework. Analysts think MiCA is a good development for crypto and will usher in a new era of quality investments. That comes even as&nbsp;<a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=investment_opportunity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> grows popular among investors. With upcoming regulatory changes, the potential for innovative projects with solid use cases like Metacade to flourish is so high.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>The MiCA regulations and what it means for crypto</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">MiCA rules are expected to be implemented beginning in 2024. It will compel firms that trade, issue, and hold cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and tokenized assets within the EU to have a licence. According to Sweden&rsquo;s finance minister Elisabeth Svantesson, MICA will protect the EU citizens who have invested in digital assets. That comes amid recent market events and the susceptibility of crypto to abuse.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Of essence is also the desire of the European authorities to foster innovation and make the crypto-sector attractive. In other words, MiCA doesn&rsquo;t intend to stifle crypto but promote it. That defeats fears over the potential for regulators to stifle or ban crypto.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What is Metacade, and why has it been a sensation?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade is a Web 3.0 community hub for gamers. The platform is built on the Ethereum network. Web 3.0 gaming and blockchain enthusiasts can interact, connect, and share exciting experiences and earn through GameFI initiatives. With a fun and exciting virtual hangout for gamers, Metacade also seeks to become the ultimate gateway to the Metaverse world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade became a sensation when it launched, with its presale selling out quickly, thanks to a strong community of Web 3.0 gamers and investors. In particular, investors are attracted to the gamefi economics of the platform, which seeks to make Metacade a self-sustaining arcade. Investors can speculate on the native token MCADE or stake it for passive income. By owning MCADE, investors have exclusive access to the Metacade platform, including participating in various earnings opportunities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some of the features that have made Metacade popular include its Play2Earn, Create2Earn, and Work2Earn opportunities. It means investors can compete in games, contribute to the community hub, and take gig jobs to boost their income base.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To make Metacade self-sustainable, the network has revenue streams from advertising on the platform, job listing, launchpad, and game testing. In the future, Metacade aims to be community-led, with plans to adopt a DAO structure by the second quarter of 2023.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>The future of Metacade and how it could benefit from positive regulation</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Investors would be excited that Metacade is launching when there are increased calls for regulating the crypto sector. Innovative projects of the kind of Metacade have been longing for this.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As regulations set in, investors would feel safe investing in novel projects with the potential for long-term success. That&rsquo;s because regulation would clear the uncertainty that has beset crypto projects. It would set a trend where only projects that make a positive contribution to its investors survive.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">With Metacade regarded as one of the most sustainable Web 3.0 and blockchain projects, investors could reap big in a regulated environment. Coupled with a strong and projected growth of Web 3.0 games, Metacade success could be huge as crypto gathers momentum.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Is it the right idea to invest in Metacade now?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">After a successful presale, Metacade is at the stage of listing on exchanges. It has so far been listed on Uniswap, BitMart, and MEXC Global. The listing was met with glamour, with the price more than doubling in value afterwards.</p>
<p dir="ltr">MCADE has now slowed down and traded at $0.022 at press time. Although this price is still higher than its final presale value of $0.020, it is attractive for early investors. As more listings follow, the price of MCADE could explode, with analysts earmarking a 10x increase by the end of 2023.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Binance Australia has with immediate effect halted all Australian Dollar deposits for its users, according to a statement the company tweeted on Thursday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The crypto exchange announced it would not facilitate AUD bank transfers via PayID, citing the decision of a third-party payment provider as the reason for the action.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>We regret to inform you that with immediate effect we are unable to facilitate PayID AUD deposits for Binance users due to a decision made by our third party payment service provider. We understand from our third party payment service provider that Bank Transfer withdrawals will also be impacted and we will advise users on timeline when this is confirmed</em>,&rdquo; the crypto exchange&rsquo;s notice to users <a href="https://twitter.com/Binance_AUS/status/1659018600496373760" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">read</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A follow-up tweet from the exchange said that users will continue to access AUD withdrawals, with any changes set to be communicated in due time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have confirmed with our local payment partner that our users can continue to withdraw AUD and we will update with any further changes on timing as we know more.

<p dir="ltr">While the AUD bank transfers are suspended for now, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/binance/">Binance</a> says its users can still <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/buy/au/">buy</a> and sell cryptocurrencies using credit or debit card.

<p dir="ltr">In the initial statement, Binance Australia said it was working towards finding an alternative payments provider. Binance also assures users that funds are SAFU.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Binance Australia&rsquo;s banking problems come at a time the broader crypto industry is seeing a growing impact from challenges related to fiat on-ramps.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The recent collapse of crypto friendly bank Silvergate Bank and the exit of the Cosmopolitan Commercial Bank from the space is expected to exacerbate the situation even more amid strict crypto banking regulation.</p>

<li>MiCA rules to govern the European crypto industry starting with July 2024</li>
<li>The market may move ahead of the deadline</li>
<li>Europe becomes a leader in cryptocurrency market regulation</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The cryptocurrency market had a strong comeback in 2023. After a year when it appeared that the bad news couldn&rsquo;t stop (i.e., FTX saga, Luna bankruptcy, etc.), some light at the end of the tunnel gives hope to crypto fans.</p>
<p>So far, the leading cryptocurrencies have rallied in 2023. Bitcoin, for instance, rallied from $16k to $30k without any meaningful correction. But one may argue that the rally happened on the back of a weak dollar.</p>
<p>Now that the dollar gets stronger against its peers, as seen in the EUR/USD, and AUD/USD exchange rates, Bitcoin keeps holding close to the recent resistance area. So the question is &ndash; what will be needed for the crypto rally to continue?</p>
<p>First, Bitcoin needs to hold inside the bullish channel. Or, if it drops below the lower edge, it needs to hold the series of higher highs and higher lows intact.</p>
<p>Second, Bitcoin and the overall cryptocurrency industry need some positive news to boost sentiment. One such piece of news came out of Europe, as crypto rules get final approval and will start taking effect in July 2024.</p>

<h2>MiCA rules to regulate the European crypto space</h2>
<p>MiCA, or <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cryptocurrency-rules-europe-digital-assets-c31679868357c342be6e03624c38539f">Markets in Crypto Assets, got final approval this week</a>. The European Council adopted the set of rules to govern the European cryptocurrency industry starting in July 2024.</p>
<p>Sure enough, some may argue that the starting date is too far away, but the markets usually move way in anticipation of events. In any case, by approving MiCA, Europe takes the lead in regulating the cryptocurrency industry.</p>
<p>All in all, it is a piece of good news for an industry shattered by scandals. Should the US dollar weakness return, then the leading cryptocurrencies may have more room to rally on top of the 2023 gains.</p>

<p class="fr-img-space-wrap2">BNB, Cardano and Polygon were looking to break key resistance areas as crypto prices rose late Wednesday.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">Stocks jumped as all the major US indices ended the day higher while Bitcoin bounced above $27,400 again.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Other coins to see gains include XRP, Dogecoin and Litecoin.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market remains largely flat today after a slow week for the broader market amid investor cautiousness on US debt-ceiling sentiment. On Wednesday, US <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/stocks/">stocks</a> closed higher as reports emerged of positive progress from lawmakers, with the Dow ending over 400 points up and the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both notching +1.2%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In crypto, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> was changing hands just above $27,000, Ethereum (ETH) was at $1,824, and XRP (XRP), one of the best performers today among the top 10 cryptocurrencies, traded near 45 cents.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/binance-coin/">Binance Coin (BNB)</a>, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cardano/">Cardano (ADA)</a> and <a href="https://coinjournal.net/polygon/">Polygon (MATIC)</a> were among altcoins to see a slight uptick, while XRP, Litecoin and Dogecoin have also climbed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here is a short term price prediction for BNB, ADA and MATIC.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">BNB (BNB) price</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bnb/">BNB</a> is trading at $314, about 1% in the green at the time of writing after bulls turned up to defend the $310 area.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the 20-day EMA ($317) and 50-day EMA (319) are offering a major resistance zone. With the averages suggesting further weakness, bears are likely to try to pull the price below the strong support at $300. If they succeed, the BNB/USD pair could extend the decline to $270.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the other hand, if the price bounces off support and BNB sees fresh demand, a rise to the highlighted EMAs could afford buyers breathing space to target the hurdles in the $330 &ndash; $350 range.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p></span>
<h2 class="fr-img-space-wrap2">Cardano (ADA) price</h2>
</div>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/cardano/">Cardano</a> was above $0.37 at the time of writing. While ADA/USD is up 3% in the past 24 hours and has broken above a key horizontal line, the bulls are not in the clear yet. &nbsp;To pull the price higher, buyers need to break past $0.40 in order to target the recent uptrend peak of $0.46.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If bears succeed in retaking control, the ADA/USD pair could decline to $0.30.</p>
<div class="fr-img-space-wrap"><span class="fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib fr-draggable"><span class="fr-img-wrap">

<p></p></span>
<h2 class="fr-img-space-wrap2">Polygon (MATIC) price</h2>
</div>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/polygon/">Polygon</a> is currently trading at $0.87, up by about 5% in the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bulls are likely to try to push the price above the resistance line at $0.91. If they succeed, the MATIC/USD pair target the psychological $1.00 area, with potential to retest the supply wall near $1.20.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the flipside, if the price turns down and break below the new range support, further weakness could offer bears the encouragement to target $0.70.</p>
