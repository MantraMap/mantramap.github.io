Australian users can still buy and sell crypto tokens using their debit or credit cards, the exchange clarified in today&#8217;s announcement. The platform&#8217;s derivatives license was withdrawn in April following controversy with Binance user accounts and a request from the crypto exchange. Binance Australia will no longer allow users to deposit and withdraw AUD on the exchange weeks after first announcing the decision [&#8230;]
