<p>New York, USA, July 27th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>LiveArt, the Web3 Platform for Art and Culture, announced a groundbreaking NFT collection, Kingdom of the Laughing Man, by Yue Minjun, one of the most important contemporary Chinese artists creating today.&nbsp;</p><p>Yue Minjun, the contemporary art giant of the 21st century, enters the digital art space with his inaugural Web3 project. The artist&rsquo;s works fetch millions of dollars at auctions worldwide (USD 6.9 million sales record at Christie's HK) and are in the permanent collections of the SFMoma, Denver Art Museum, The Culture Centre of Francois Mitterrand, Guangdong Museum of Art, Shenzhen Art Museum, and other leading art institutions. Collaborations with artists like KAWS and fashion brands like Comme De Garcons have cemented Yue Minjun's signature style in global pop culture.</p><p>Kingdom of the Laughing Man launches with Boundless, a generative collection of 1,200 unique NFT artworks echoing Yue Minjun&rsquo;s iconic self-portraits. All Yue Minjun Boundless collection holders will have the opportunity to purchase unique physical prints signed by the artist based on the NFTs they own. Subsequent drops will feature 3D animated art and culminate with an immersive metaverse experience. The collection is offered exclusively on LiveArt.</p>"I've explored numerous media with my art over the years. This new digital frontier excites me the most as I can bring my art to life in a way that I haven't been able to with physical media. In Web3 I can create a new engaging experience and relationship with the next generations of art collectors shaping the art world of the future," says Yue Minjun."Yue Minjun exemplifies the caliber of artists who call LiveArt home in this new digital world. I think he is probably the most significant contemporary artist to commit fully to a Web3 journey today, and we are honored and excited for the historic opportunity we can offer our collectors," says Boris Pevzner, CEO and Co-Founder of LiveArt.<p>The first drop is set to launch on August 8, 2023, on LiveArt. It is expected to sell out during a "pre-sale" exclusive to collectors and LiveArt X Card holders, according to LiveArt insiders.
