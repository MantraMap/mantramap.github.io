The Turkish lira saw a record drop in its exchange rate with the U.S. dollar when the country&#x2019;s central bank halted intervention after the recent presidential vote. </strong></p>
<h2>Turkish Investors Seek Safe Haven in Stablecoin Tether Despite Global Crackdown on Crypto</h2>
<p>Demand for <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT/">tether (USDT)</a> in Turkey has been high since early May despite an ongoing crackdown on crypto assets around the world, Bloomberg noted. While the prices of major cryptocurrencies are falling, the Turkish lira has fared even worse, the report points out.</p>
<p>The national fiat dropped 11% against the dollar during the past week after the central bank pulled back from intervention following the reelection of Turkey&#x2019;s long-time President Recep Tayyip <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/erdogan-suggests-turkish-russian-payment-system-local-media-reports/">Erdogan</a>. Turkish state banks resumed support on Wednesday after the currency&#x2019;s biggest slide in over a year.</p>
<p>With the lira having lost 80% of its value since the previous election in 2018, it&#x2019;s down 20% against the dollar in 2023 alone, Turks have been turning to crypto assets, especially stablecoins like the U.S dollar-pegged tether. According to data from Kaiko, lira transactions peaked in May at 18% and accounted for 10% of total crypto trading volumes in early June.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Investing in stablecoins allows people to keep the value of their wealth, it&#x2019;s one of the ways to hold on to some value when inflation is this high,&#x201D; former banker and university lecturer Ebru G&#xFC;ven was quoted as saying. At the same time, G&#xFC;ven remarked, regulations have made it hard to buy dollars or gold.</p>
<p>The report also highlights that tether&#x2019;s share of the trading volumes on a leading domestic crypto exchange, Btcturk, has reached 20%. That&#x2019;s compared to 1% on Binance, the world&#x2019;s largest digital asset exchange by trading volume, according to data from Coinmarketcap.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s noticeable that despite historically low volumes, demand for stablecoins on Turkish markets has remained robust,&#x201D; Kaiko Analyst Dessislava Aubert commented. Last month, tether&#x2019;s share of trading volumes on local markets reached its highest level since 2020, she added.</p>

Despite this impressive figure, a data analyst at blockchaincenter.net compiled metrics that reveal the company&#x2019;s investment has decreased in value by 14%. The data also indicates that if Microstrategy had invested in ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) instead of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, the company&#x2019;s portfolio would have increased by 54%.</strong></p>
<h2>Blockchaincenter.net&#x2019;s &#x2018;There Is No Second Best&#x2019; Data Set</h2>
<p>Microstrategy, a company that offers business intelligence, mobile software, and cloud-based services, currently holds the <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/treasuries/">largest amount</a> of bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) among publicly listed firms. In April, the company <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/microstrategys-bitcoin-holdings-reach-140000-btc-after-acquiring-1045-more-bitcoins/">acquired</a> an additional 1,045 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, bringing its total stash to an even 140,000. However, recent <a href="https://www.blockchaincenter.net/en/there-is-no-second-best/">statistics</a> reveal that the value of Microstrategy&#x2019;s bitcoin portfolio has decreased by 14% as of Sunday. This means that the company&#x2019;s cache, which was purchased for $4.206 billion, is now worth $3.631 billion.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.ph/JlmxA">Archived</a> blockchaincenter.net statistics reveal that Microstrategy&#x2019;s portfolio would have been more profitable today if the company had invested in <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH/">ethereum (ETH)</a> instead of <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a>. This data set, called &#x201C;There is no second best,&#x201D; challenges the opinion of Microstrategy&#x2019;s founder, Michael Saylor, who believes that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is the leading crypto asset and that there is no second best. The creator of the data set, <a href="https://twitter.com/rohmeo_de">Holger</a> from blockchaincenter.net, collected these metrics because he considers himself a &#x201C;data nerd&#x201D; and believes that claiming &#x201C;there is &#x2018;no second best crypto asset&#x2019; is a bit of a stretch.&#x201D;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-592930 size-full" title="If Microstrategy Chose ETH Over BTC, the Firm Would Be up 54% and Ahead by More Than $2B, Data Reveals" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/whatiffs.jpg" alt="If Microstrategy Chose ETH Over BTC, the Firm Would Be up 54% and Ahead by More Than $2B, Data Reveals" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/whatiffs-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/whatiffs-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/whatiffs-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/whatiffs-190x107.jpg 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/whatiffs-380x214.jpg 380w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/whatiffs-760x428.jpg 760w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/whatiffs.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>Holger&#x2019;s chart paints an entirely different picture of what could have been for Microstrategy if the company had invested in ether instead of bitcoin. According to the data, if Microstrategy had purchased ether, the company would now hold 3,681,627 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, and its portfolio would be valued at $6.461 billion. This means that instead of experiencing a 14% loss, the investment in ether would have resulted in a $2.255 billion in profit for the company. However, that&#x2019;s not all that Microstrategy missed out on. By staking its ether stash, the company could have earned an additional 326,225 ether, resulting in a staking profit of around $572.5 million at an annual percentage rate (APR) of 4%.</p>
<p>Holger&#x2019;s data set reveals yet another interesting fact: if Microstrategy were to trade its <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> today, the company would receive 2,069,232 ether using today&#x2019;s exchange rates. This ethereum portfolio would generate an estimated $182 million per year from staking, which Holger insists is more operating income than Microstrategy has ever had. However, it&#x2019;s highly unlikely that Saylor and his company will switch over to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, as he holds <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> in the highest esteem.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s worth noting that the data presented by Holger on blockchaincenter.net is subject to change over time. However, the data set also acknowledges that Michael Saylor&#x2019;s decision to &#x201C;convert his company cash (and more) into bitcoin could have been (and still can be) the greatest decision ever.&#x201D; While the data suggests that investing in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> could be a lucrative move for Microstrategy today, it&#x2019;s important to remember that the crypto market is subject to change at any moment. Ultimately, only time will tell which crypto asset will come out on top.</p>

In a Bloomberg Invest panel, Clayton stated that while he supports the agency and the law, the crypto regulation issue should be treated with nuance.</strong></p>
<h2>Former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton Calls for Nuance When Dealing With Crypto</h2>
<p>Jay Clayton, Former SEC Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took a stance on the escalade of enforcement actions the organization is currently taking against cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
<p>The agency recently slapped <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a>, two of the largest cryptocurrency businesses in the world, with illegal brokerage charges, stating that they allowed U.S. customers to purchase unregistered securities.</p>
<p>In a joint Bloomberg panel with Dan Morehead, founder and managing partner of Pantera Capital, Clayton stated that while he supported the SEC and the current law definitions, he had other ideas regarding enforcement.</p>
<p>When asked if he agreed with current SEC Chairman Gary Gensler&#8217;s moves, Clayton <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Dpgmc5aa4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I was there, people would say I was a crypto hawk. We effectively shut down the ICO craze. I do think we are having very blunt conversations about something that requires nuance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Clayton clarified that crypto and blockchain were just technologies and that using these technologies in different aspects of the financial system should be &#8220;non-controversial.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Tokenization and Stablecoins</h2>
<p>Clayton, nominated by Donald Trump and serving as SEC chairman from 2017 to 2020, had to deal with the rise of crypto as an insurgent technology in financial markets. However, while the current SEC chairman Gary Gensler has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chairman-gensler-stresses-existing-fiat-digital-currencies-are-sufficient-amid-coinbase-and-binance-actions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">questioned</a> the value of cryptocurrency, Clayton believes there are valid use cases for crypto and blockchain technology.</p>
<p>One of these use cases is tokenization, a process that uses a representation of an asset in a blockchain to simplify the management of such an asset. Assets and securities tokenization is a business predicted to reach the $4 to $5 billion mark by 2030, <a href="https://quant.network/research/citi-predicts-4-trillion-of-tokenised-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according</a> to Citi. Clayton explained using tokenized securities will probably be &#8220;more efficient than what we are doing today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clayton also detailed that stablecoins, which are cryptocurrency assets linked to the value of other assets &#8211; generally of a fiat token like the U.S. dollar &#8211; had a clear use case. He declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am remarkably impressed by the functionality of true stable stablecoins&#8230; it is a remarkable technology at the retail level to be able to transfer dollars around the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clayton added that using stablecoins would allow for conducting know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) procedures more efficiently and that the U.S. should be looking into this technology.</p>

According to the CFTC, the judge&#8217;s ruling that the Ooki DAO is a &#8220;person&#8221; under the Commodity Exchange Act sets a new legal precedent. This decision could be quite significant as it&#8217;s the first ruling to establish the legal status of DAOs and their accountability under the law.</strong></p>
<h2>CFTC Lawsuit Could Define Legal Status of DAOs in the United States</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://deepdao.io/organizations">current statistics</a>, there are 12,745 decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) with treasuries holding over $20 billion in crypto assets. Since the infamous failure of the first DAO in 2016, which caused a rift in the Ethereum community, DAOs have been a hot topic. Many supporters, however, have assumed that DAOs are immune to legal repercussions, given their decentralized and autonomous nature, and the fact that they&#8217;re made up of numerous market participants.</p>
<p>The CFTC&#8217;s recent victory in the lawsuit against Ooki DAO, however, could be the beginning of the end for the notion that DAOs are immune to legal action. It all started in September 2022 when Ooki DAO was <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.400807/gov.uscourts.cand.400807.1.0.pdf">accused</a> by the CFTC of breaking the Commodity Exchange Act. The DAO was allegedly operating as a futures commission merchant (FCM) from June 1, 2019, to around August 23, 2021, and was also accused of facilitating illegal margined, and leveraged retail commodity transactions.</p>
<p>Despite the accusations, Ooki DAO remained silent and failed to respond to the lawsuit’s deadline. As a result, the CFTC was poised to win the case by default. Judge William H. Orrick entered the default judgment order on June 9. The DAO was found guilty of operating an illegal trading platform and acting as an FCM, resulting in a civil monetary penalty of $643,542.</p>
<p>The CFTC was quick to point out that the judge&#8217;s ruling that the DAO is a &#8220;person&#8221; under the Commodity Exchange Act is a game-changer. In a <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8715-23">press release</a>, the CFTC emphasized the significance of the decision, stating that &#8220;the court held that the Ooki DAO is a ‘person’ under the Commodity Exchange Act and thus can be held liable for violations of the law. The court then held that the Ooki DAO did, in fact, violate the law as charged.”</p>
<p>“The founders created the Ooki DAO with an evasive purpose, and with the explicit goal of operating an illegal trading platform without legal accountability,” CFTC Division of Enforcement director Ian McGinley said. “This decision should serve as a wake-up call to anyone who believes they can circumvent the law by adopting a DAO structure, intending to insulate themselves from law enforcement and ultimately putting the public at risk.”</p>
<p>The regulatory landscape in the U.S. in 2023 has been nothing short of chaotic. From commodities to securities, financial watchdogs have been cracking down on a wide range of industries. The list of regulators involved is extensive, including over a dozen banking and securities regulators from various states, the New York Attorney General&#8217;s Office, the SEC, and the CFTC.</p>
<p>The classification of crypto assets as both commodities and securities has only added to the confusion, with regulators also targeting products associated with staking, lending, and interest-bearing accounts. With so many accusations, lawsuits, and projects under scrutiny, it&#8217;s starting to feel like a regulatory warzone out there. As the regulatory crackdown on crypto continues, supporters of the digital currency are left wondering: who will be the next target?</p>

<h2>Exchanges Witness Significant Bitcoin and Ethereum Outflows in Wake of SEC Lawsuits</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Less than a week has passed since the SEC took action against two of the world&#x2019;s largest exchanges, with Binance&#x2019;s lawsuit <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/">occurring</a> on June 5, 2023, and Coinbase&#x2019;s lawsuit <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">following suit</a> on June 6. As previously reported by Bitcoin.com News, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-records-significant-outflows-of-btc-eth-and-stablecoins-exceeding-1-45-billion/">record outflows</a> from Binance have been observed, and cryptocurrency enthusiasts have been extensively withdrawing <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> and <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH/">ethereum (ETH)</a> from centralized exchanges.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
According to data collected from <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/">cryptoquant.com</a>, 2.155 million <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> were held on centralized trading platforms the day prior to Binance&#x2019;s lawsuit. Since then, however, 22,263 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> valued at $574.15 million using current exchange rates have been withdrawn. As of 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) on Sunday morning, there were 2.133 million <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> held by various exchanges. A similar trend is evident in ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) withdrawals, as 15.96 million <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> were held by exchanges last Sunday on June 4, 2023.&#13;</p>
<h2>A Game of Musical Chairs: While Binance&#x2019;s Weekly Outflow Surged, Other Exchanges Record Significant Inflows</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Presently, that figure has decreased to 15.72 million ether, indicating that approximately 241,366 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> valued at $422.78 million was removed using today&#x2019;s ether exchange rates. In total, between bitcoin and ethereum, $996.94 million in value has been withdrawn from centralized trading platforms within the past week. A multitude of individuals have transferred funds away from exchanges, but data shows some deposited this cryptocurrency into different trading platforms. It appears as though some <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> whales are engaging in a game of musical chairs.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
For example, data from <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/Balance">coinglass.com</a> indicates that Binance experienced withdrawals totaling 40,427 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> during the past seven days, with 7,008 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> removed in the last 24 hours alone. In contrast, Coinbase witnessed an addition of 2,959 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> to its reserves this week, though 20 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> were withdrawn in the past day. While Binance experienced outflows, the subsequent top four exchanges saw noticeable inflows. After Coinbase, Bitfinex received deposits of 1,556 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, Okx added 3,772 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> to its reserves, and Gemini saw an influx of around 1,070 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> within the past week.&#13;<br />

<h2>Jim Rickards on BRICS Currency Challenging U.S. Dollar Dominance</h2>
<p>Economist and “Currency Wars” author Jim Rickards shared his predictions about a proposed BRICS currency in an opinion piece published by the Daily Reckoning earlier this week. The leaders of the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are expected to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-leaders-set-to-discuss-common-currency-to-challenge-us-dollar-dominance-in-upcoming-summit/">discuss</a> the proposed common currency at their next leaders&#8217; summit in August.</p>
<p>&#8220;On Aug. 22, about 2½ months from today, the most significant development in international finance since 1971 will be unveiled,&#8221; Rickards wrote, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>It involves the rollout of a major new currency that could weaken the role of the dollar in global payments and ultimately displace the U.S. dollar as the leading payment currency and reserve currency. It could happen in just a few years.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The process by which this will happen is unprecedented, and the world is unprepared for this geopolitical shock wave,&#8221; he opined.</p>
<p>Rickards explained that there are currently eight nations that have formally applied to join the economic bloc and 17 others have expressed interest in joining. The eight are Algeria, Argentina, Bahrain, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, he detailed, adding that the 17 countries are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Senegal, Sudan, Syria, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>In April, Anil Sooklal, South Africa’s ambassador to the BRICS economic group, revealed that 19 countries have either applied to join or have expressed interest in joining. &#8220;We are getting applications to join every day,&#8221; he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-getting-applications-to-join-every-day-attracts-19-requests-before-summit/">stated</a> at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;By every measure — population, landmass, energy output, GDP, food output and nuclear weapons — BRICS is not just another multilateral debating society. They are a substantial and credible alternative to Western hegemony. BRICS acting together is one pole of a new multipolar or even bipolar world,&#8221; Rickards stressed.</p>
<h2>De-Dollarization of Global Payments and Global Reserves</h2>
<p>The economist then discussed the global de-dollarization trend, as a growing number of countries shift away from using the U.S. dollar in trade settlements in favor of national currencies. &#8220;What’s behind this quest to ditch the dollar? In no small part the answer is U.S. weaponization of the dollar through the use of sanctions,&#8221; the Currency Wars author described.</p>
<p>“Many other nations began to conclude that they could be next if they run afoul of the U.S. on certain issues. And that fear has greatly accelerated the push to opt out of the dollar system entirely,” he continued, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>The BRICS+ present a realistic effort to de-dollarize global payments and eventually global reserves.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rickards noted that efforts to shift to using national currencies “may soon be superseded by a new BRICS+ currency, which will be announced in Durban, South Africa, at the annual BRICS leaders’ summit Conference on Aug. 22–24.”</p>
<p>Believing that the new BRICS currency “will be pegged to a basket of commodities for use in trade among members,&#8221; Rickards predicted: &#8220;Initially, the BRICS+ commodity basket would include oil, wheat, copper, and other essential goods traded globally in specified quantities.&#8221;</p>
<p>He further explained: &#8220;In all likelihood, the new BRICS+ currency would not be available in the form of paper notes for use in everyday transactions. It would be a digital currency on a permissioned ledger maintained by a new BRICS+ financial institution with encrypted message traffic to record payments due or owing by participating parties.” He clarified that this new currency will not be a cryptocurrency “because it is not decentralized, not maintained on a blockchain, and not open to all parties without approval.&#8221;</p>
<p>The economist concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>Based on the impracticality of commodity baskets as uniform stores of value, it appears likely that the new BRICS+ currency will be linked to a weight of gold.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;This plays to the strengths of BRICS members Russia and China, who are the two largest gold producers in the world and are ranked sixth and seventh respectively among the 100 nations with gold reserves,&#8221; he stressed.</p>
<p>While Rickards anticipates the unveiling of the new BRICS currency at the forthcoming leaders&#8217; summit of the economic bloc, there is widespread skepticism regarding the feasibility of such a currency. This skepticism extends to individuals like <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-dollar-will-lose-dominant-status-china-and-india-could-play-key-role-in-currency-shift-says-economist-lord-oneill/">Lord Jim O&#8217;Neill</a>, the British economist credited with coining the acronym BRIC.</p>

<h2>Theories, Guidance, and Principles &#x2014; Crypto Market Sentiment Grows Chaotic Across Reddit</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The United States is currently witnessing a major crackdown on crypto firms and digital assets, following the Securities and Exchange Commission&#x2019;s (SEC) lawsuit against <a class="sc-hWhWUk dZhDeq" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/">Binance</a> and <a class="sc-hWhWUk dZhDeq" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">Coinbase</a>. As a result, there are numerous theories circulating about the so-called &#x2018;<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=Chokepoint%202.0&src=typed_query">Operation Chokepoint 2.0</a>&#x2018;, with crypto advocates attempting to explain why the crypto market is experiencing a downturn. A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/145u03n/three_reasons_were_dumping_pick_one/">recent post</a> on the Reddit forum r/cryptocurrency has identified three key reasons why the crypto economy is facing significant losses.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
According to the post on Reddit, one theory for the recent downturn in the crypto market is that investors are selling altcoins on Robinhood after the exchange <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robinhood-to-delist-cardano-solana-and-polygon-amidst-sec-regulatory-pressure/">decided</a> to delist <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>, SOL, and MATIC. Another possibility is that a &#x201C;big time market maker&#x201D; or &#x201C;crypto fund&#x201D; is exiting the market and selling off all of their holdings. Finally, the post&#x2019;s creator speculated that the SEC may be preparing to take action against other market participants. &#x201C;These are my best [three] guesses,&#x201D; the Redditor wrote. &#x201C;Even in crypto, it&#x2019;s not usual to see a 30% dump on alts within a 4H candle, so there has to be some pretty significant news coming around.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-592839 size-full" title="Altcoins Feel the Heat: Crypto Market Theories Run Wild, While Proponents Seek Guidance " src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/meyhem.jpg" alt="Altcoins Feel the Heat: Crypto Market Theories Run Wild, While Proponents Seek Guidance " width="1280" height="200" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/meyhem-300x47.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/meyhem-1024x160.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/meyhem-768x120.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/meyhem.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px">&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Meanwhile, on the same subreddit, a vocal bitcoin proponent took the opportunity to highlight the resilience of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> during these turbulent times. &#x201C;Times like this just prove (yet again) that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is here to stay, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is the pillar of the crypto space as a whole, and, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is king,&#x201D; the Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/145u8lk/btc_does_not_give_a_damn_about_this_craziness/">declared</a>. &#x201C;With this recent crash we have seen <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> dominance rise to its highest level in years. Furthermore, so far, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is yet to really be harmed by all of this craziness.&#x201D; The Redditor also insists that <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH/">ethereum (ETH)</a> may be in &#x201C;a similar boat,&#x201D; but not everyone feels <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> is safe.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-592840 size-full" title="Altcoins Feel the Heat: Crypto Market Theories Run Wild, While Proponents Seek Guidance " src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/considers.jpg" alt="Altcoins Feel the Heat: Crypto Market Theories Run Wild, While Proponents Seek Guidance " width="1280" height="200" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/considers-300x47.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/considers-1024x160.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/considers-768x120.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/considers.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px">&#13;</p>
<h2>Crypto Redditors Desperately Seek Strategies While Bitcoin Subreddit Mocks Altcoin Losses</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
As the crypto market continues to experience turbulence, numerous Redditors are turning to their peers for advice on which assets are safe to hold and which ones to avoid. &#x201C;What are you doing now? Are you accumulating? Are you selling? Are you rebalancing? Are you just hodling and moving your funds from exchanges to your wallets?&#x201D; one Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/145uvcx/blood_is_on_the_streets_what_do_you_do_now_and/">inquired</a> over the weekend. Meanwhile, in another post on r/cryptocurrency, an individual <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/14616xs/im_not_selling/">shared their decision</a> to hold onto their investments for the long haul.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
According to the Redditor, &#x201C;the SEC is suing a bunch of CEXs and declaring lots of coins to be securities. Bad for prices in the short term, but my investments are long term investments.&#x201D; Many others agreed with the Redditor&#x2019;s sentiment as one individual <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/14616xs/comment/jnntn0x/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3">remarked</a> that the post was a &#x201C;sensible take in a crazy market.&#x201D; One person jokingly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/14616xs/comment/jno0utd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3">suggested</a> that the Redditor &#x201C;knows how to navigate the market with common sense. He doesn&#x2019;t belong here with us degens.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
These types of discussions, theories, and strategies can be found all over social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and r/cryptocurrency. However, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/comments/144a9ye">conversation</a> on r/bitcoin is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/143crau/tick_tock_next_block/">markedly different</a>, with numerous posts <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/145z3r7/happy_weekend_and_dont_do_shitcoins/">celebrating</a> the downfall of altcoins.&#13;<br />

The umbrella group calls for implementing stricter advertising rules on major platforms like Twitter and Tiktok as well as preventing influencers from misleading investors.</strong></p>
<h2>BEUC Complains About Promotion of Risky Crypto to European Consumers on Social Media</h2>
<p>The European Consumer Organization, better known by its French abbreviation BEUC (Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs), has filed a complaint with the European Commission and consumer authorities in the EU against Tiktok, Twitter, Instagram, and Youtube, alleging that they facilitate misleading crypto promotion.</p>
<p>“These social media companies are responsible for allowing misleading advertisements of crypto assets to multiply on their platforms (both through advertising and influencers),” the bureau said in an <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/press-releases/beuc-acts-against-social-media-platforms-facilitating-misleading-crypto-asset" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> presenting its “Hype or harm? The great social media crypto con” <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/sites/default/files/publications/BEUC-X-2023-073_Hype_or_harm_The_great_social_media_crypto_con.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>.</p>
<p>This constitutes an unfair commercial practice which “exposes consumers to serious harm i.e., the loss of significant amounts of money,” the organization added, suggesting that crypto is still a highly risky investment product that it deems “not suitable for many consumers.”</p>
<p>Established in 1962, BEUC unites 45 European consumer protection organizations from 32 countries in the European Union, the European Economic Area (EEA), and applicant nations. The complaint has been filed together with nine of its members in Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovakia, and Spain.</p>
<p>The Bureau claims in the report there’s ample evidence of the misleading promotion of crypto on said platforms that contravenes their own advertising policies. It also calls on the Consumer Protection Cooperation Network, a body bringing together public authorities competent in the field of consumer protection, to request certain changes from the companies.</p>
<h2>European Authorities Urged to Ensure Social Media Giants Protect Users From Scams</h2>
<p>The organization insists on the adoption and enforcement of stricter advertising policies by the platforms promoting crypto as well as implementing measures to prevent influencers from misleading consumers in regards to the nature of crypto assets which it describes as volatile and speculative.</p>
<p>“Consumers are increasingly being promised ‘get rich quick’ investments by ads and influencers on social media. Unfortunately, in most cases, these claims are too good to be true,” BEUC Director General Monique Goyens was quoted as stating.</p>
<p>Goyens noted that the sector will soon be regulated with the EU’s newly <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-council-adopts-new-rules-for-europes-crypto-markets/">adopted</a> Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation. However, she also pointed that the law does not apply to social media firms “benefiting from the advertising of crypto at the expense of consumers” and elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are turning to the authorities in charge of protecting consumers to ensure Instagram, Youtube, Tiktok, and Twitter fulfil their duty to protect consumers against crypto scams and false promises.</p></blockquote>
<p>BEUC’s action coincides with the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/uk-bans-refer-a-friend-bonuses-with-tougher-crypto-marketing-rules/">introduction</a> of tougher advertising rules for businesses marketing crypto assets to U.K. consumers by Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) this week. The watchdog said it wants to ensure investors are duly warned about the risks, banned ‘refer a friend’ bonuses, and imposed a cooling-off period for first time crypto buyers.</p>

<h2>Nigeria&#8217;s SEC Labels Crypto an &#8216;Extremely Risky&#8217; Asset Class</h2>
<p>Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission has said the crypto exchange’s local affiliate is operating illegally. In a <a href="https://sec.gov.ng/circular-on-the-activities-of-binance-nigeria-limited/">circular</a> issued on June 9, the Nigerian regulator discouraged local residents from dealing with  Nigeria. The announcement by the Nigerian regulator came less than 24 hours after Binance’s beleaguered U.S. affiliate was forced to suspend dollar deposits and withdrawals.</p>
<p>In addition to branding the affiliate&#8217;s operations illegal, the Commission also warned Nigerians of the risks of investing in crypto assets or related products, particularly when the service provider is not registered or regulated by the SEC. The regulator meanwhile reiterated its message against investing in an asset class which it described as &#8220;extremely risky.&#8221; To Binance’s Nigerian affiliate, the regulator said:</p>
<blockquote><p>By this circular, Binance Nigeria Limited is hereby directed to immediately stop soliciting Nigerian investors in any form whatsoever.</p></blockquote>
<p>The regulator also promised to provide updates on further &#8220;regulatory actions against Binance Nigeria and other similar platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p>The move by the Nigerian SEC adds to Binance&#8217;s woes which <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/">climaxed</a> when the U.S. launched a lawsuit against the giant crypto exchange and its affiliates. The U.S. regulator has also sought an emergency <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-seeks-court-approval-to-freeze-binance-us-crypto-assets-citing-customer-safety-concerns/">court injunction</a> that would allow it to freeze assets held by Binance U.S.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<h2>Nigerian Blockchain Association Applauds Commission&#8217;s Decision</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the Nigerian blockchain and crypto association, the Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria (SIBAN), has said it welcomes the Commission’s decision which shows that the SEC &#8220;is watching the market and want to ensure the market is properly regulated.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, in a <a href="https://siban.org.ng/the-securities-and-exchange-commission-secular-on-binance/">statement</a> that has since been withdrawn, the SIBAN editorial team said the regulator should also consider working with the local stakeholders when drafting regulations. According to the team, doing this &#8220;enable[s] local businesses to thrive in the digital asset market.&#8221;</p>
<p>The SIBAN team also requested the SEC &#8220;consider putting systems in place to support that national blockchain policy.&#8221; The team added that it is willing to work with the SEC &#8220;for the greater good of our nation.&#8221;</p>
