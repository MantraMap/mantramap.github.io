<ul><li>Coinbase has agreed to pay $50 million to the New York State Department of Financial Services.</li><li>The fine stems from a potential violation of AML laws by Coinbase due to improper background checks.&nbsp;</li><li>The settlement will require the crypto exchange to invest another $50 million to improve its compliance program.&nbsp;</li><li>The company’s share price has gone up more than 13% since the news of the settlement came out.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Coinbase has reached a <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/Coinbase-and-NYDFS-reach-agreement-to-resolve-compliance-investigation" rel="nofollow noopener">settlement</a> with the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) over charges related to improper background checks during the opening of new accounts. The American <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-calls-out-apple-blocking-nft-ios/">crypto exchange</a> will pay a $50 million fine to the New York regulator to settle the charges.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase will invest $50 million to improve compliance</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr202301041" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from the NYDFS, Coinbase’s compliance program had significant failures which led to the violation of NY Banking Law and the NYDFS’s transaction monitoring and cybersecurity regulations among other things. These violations exposed the crypto platform to serious criminal conduct including fraud, possible money laundering, and potential narcotics trafficking.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“It is critical that all financial institutions safeguard their systems from bad actors, and the Department’s expectations with respect to consumer protection, cybersecurity, and anti-money laundering programs are just as stringent for cryptocurrency companies as they are for traditional financial services institutions,”</p><cite>NYDFS Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris&nbsp;</cite></blockquote>



<p>As part of the settlement, Coinbase will be required to pour in an additional $50 million in its compliance program over the next two years. This investment will go towards ensuring that the platform’s compliance procedures are in line with the NYDFS’s standards, in addition to addressing the present concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase, acknowledged the settlement on <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1610646785369772039" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today. “We’re proud of our commitment to compliance, but we are also willing to acknowledge where we have fallen short” Grewal tweeted.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re grateful for today’s resolution – we’ve never shied away from working with regulators on making the industry a safer, more compliant space, and we share NYDFS’s commitment to protecting customers.</p>&mdash; paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1610646816273334275?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">January 4, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The settlement has sent Coinbase’s share price soaring. At the time of writing, the <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/coin" rel="nofollow noopener">stock</a> was trading at $38.18, up more than 13% since market open.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What is Bonk Inu?</h2>



<p>According to the project’s one-pager, BONK was <a href="https://www.bonkcoin.com/one-pager" rel="nofollow noopener">issued</a> as the first Dog-centered meme token on Solana’s blockchain. The protocol claims to be “for the people, by the people” and aimed at building “a fun meme coin where everyone gets a fair shot”. Also, the team supposedly grew tired of “toxic Alameda tokenomics”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alamadea Research and FTX were significant contributors to Solana’s ecosystem before SBF’s empire crumbled in November 2022.</p>



<p>Upon launch, 50% of the coin’s 100 trillion total supply was airdropped to Solana users. The allocated airdrop supply was distributed among Solana NFT collections, early OpenBook traders, Solana developers, and artists in the SOL’s ecosystem. The project also added a burn mechanism to stem inflation and manage token supply.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="748" height="611" src="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/BONK-Tokenomics.png" alt="Crypto Traders Go BONK-ers For Viral Solana Memecoin, Token Up 80% Today 4" class="wp-image-580332" srcset="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/BONK-Tokenomics.png 748w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/BONK-Tokenomics-300x245.png 300w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/BONK-Tokenomics-269x220.png 269w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/BONK-Tokenomics-746x609.png 746w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" title="Crypto Traders Go BONK-ers For Viral Solana Memecoin, Token Up 80% Today 5"><figcaption>Image &#8211; BONK</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Orca Liquidity Providers Go BONK-ers</h2>



<p>Apart from massive returns for holders, the team announced rewards for liquidity providers on Solana-native crypto exchange Orca. Orca users can earn over 1000% in yield APIs on SOL, USDC, and USDH pairs with BONK.</p>



<p>The token is also available for trading on platforms like ByBit, Huobi, Gate IO, and Raydium to name a few.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="348" src="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Orca-Bonk-Yield-1024x348.png" alt="Crypto Traders Go BONK-ers For Viral Solana Memecoin, Token Up 80% Today 5" class="wp-image-580334" srcset="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Orca-Bonk-Yield-1024x348.png 1024w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Orca-Bonk-Yield-300x102.png 300w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Orca-Bonk-Yield-770x261.png 770w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Orca-Bonk-Yield-1536x522.png 1536w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Orca-Bonk-Yield-269x91.png 269w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Orca-Bonk-Yield-746x253.png 746w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Orca-Bonk-Yield-1376x467.png 1376w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Orca-Bonk-Yield.png 1605w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Crypto Traders Go BONK-ers For Viral Solana Memecoin, Token Up 80% Today 6"><figcaption>Image &#8211; Orca </figcaption></figure>



<h2>Meme Coin Mania</h2>



<p>Bonk Inu joined the fray alongside other popular meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu amid lethargic cryptocurrency prices. The new token spots a Shiba Inu dog as well, much like its meme coin rivals DOGE and SHIB.</p>



<p>At press time, Solana’s first meme coin boasted trading volumes of over $100 million in the last 24 hours. In terms of market cap, BONK is still a far cry away from <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wrapped-dogecoin-coming-soon-bitgo/">DOGE</a> and SHIB with market caps of over $9 billion and $4.5 million respectively.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Lawyers representing the Bitcoin miner said the company was losing north of $53,000 daily due to a hosting agreement with Celsius.</li><li>The company will shutter hosting services for 37,000 Bitcoin mining rigs owned by the defunct crypto lender.</li><li>Both companies filed for bankruptcy following a harsh year for crypto asset prices in 2022. </li></ul>



<p>Bitcoin mining company Core Scientific will shut down Celsius mining machines following an agreement between the two crippled crypto entities. The deal was disclosed during a bankruptcy hearing on Tuesday, per reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Celsius hired Core Scientific to provide hosting services for the crypto lenders&#8217; BTC mining business. The crypto mining company also received $54 million in funding from Celsius in 2021 as part of a $200 million fundraising effort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Core <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-owes-5-4-million-core-scientific/">mounted</a> legal pressure on Celsius in October 2022 claiming that the crypto lender owed around $5.4 million in hosting fees. Core Scientific lawyers told the court that powering Celsius mining machines cost the company $53,000 in losses on a daily basis. The company also told U.S. Judge David R. Jones that the hosting capacity provided to Celsius could generate roughly $2 million in revenue per month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Tuesday, both entities agreed to unplug 37,000 mining machines owned by bankruptcy crypto lender Celsius. It’s unclear if the deal includes a payment of $5.4 million in hosting fees claimed by the troubled cryptocurrency mining company last year.</p>



<h2>Core Scientific Bankrupt, Riot Blockchain Rebrands</h2>



<p>A myriad of crypto companies collapsed amid sunken crypto prices and massive corporate failures among industry stakeholders. Core Scientific, previously a Bitcoin mining giant, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 2022 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rosemariemiller/2022/10/27/core-scientific-unable-to-pay-bills-warns-of-bankruptcy/" rel="noopener">citing</a> market conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another crypto miner, Riot Blockchain, rebranded as Riot Platforms in a bid to diversify as rising power costs in the U.S. threatens mining businesses. </p>



<p>Argo Blockchain also announced plans to sell its Helios mining facility in Texas to Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital for $65 million. Argo also secured an additional $35 million loan to help stave off bankruptcy in the bear market. </p>

<p>Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin core developer who claims to be the longest contributor to the flagship cryptocurrency, fell victim to a hack earlier this week that led to a loss of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoins.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Lost basically all of his Bitcoin</strong></h2>



<p>Dashjr&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1609613748364509184" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">claimed</a>&nbsp;that he had lost &#8220;basically all&#8221; of his Bitcoin (BTC) holdings in a hack that occurred on New Year&#8217;s Day. In a Twitter thread, Dashjr revealed that he had traced some of the stolen funds to a wallet address that received almost 217 BTC. At the time of writing, the&nbsp;<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1YAR6opJCfDjBNdn5bV8b5Mcu84tv92fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stolen BTC</a>&nbsp;was worth $3.6 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Bitcoin dev stated that the hack was the result of a compromised PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) key, and added that the IP address of the attacker was traced to a ColoCrossing server. He was unable to explain how his cold wallets were breached but noted that he had last accessed them in September.</p>



<p>Users on Twitter responded by speculating that the hack may be connected to a security breach that Dashjr tweeted about in November. In the wake of the attack, Dashjr called out ColoCrossing for allegedly &#8220;dropping the ball on abuse investigation last time&#8221; and vowed to change server providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also warned people not to use Bitcoin Knots, a Bitcoin wallet signed with his now-compromised PGP key. Dashjr reached out to the FBI for help but has not yet received a response.</p>



<p>Binance CEO <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/changpeng-zhao-takes-a-dig-kraken-kucoin/">Changpeng Zhao</a> was among those who responded to Dashjr’s plight. CZ&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1609663902610034691" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reassured</a>&nbsp;him that he had asked his security team to monitor the situation. The Binance chief further offered to freeze the stolen funds, should they find their way to Binance.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Sorry to see you lose so much. Informed our security team to monitor… We deal with these often, and have Law Enforcement (LE) relationships worldwide,&#8221; &nbsp;</p><cite>CZ told Dashjr</cite></blockquote>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Lawyers representing Bankman-Fried in the criminal trial asked Judge Lewis Kaplan to redact the names of two sureties who co-signed Sam&#8217;s bail bond.</li><li>SBF was released in December 2022 after posting bail for $250 million, per reports.</li><li>U.S. Federal prosecutors charged the FTX founder with eight counts from fraud to money laundering. </li></ul>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried’s lawyers filed a motion to redact the name of two co-signers for SBF’s massive $250 million bail. Bankman-Fried posted bail in December after appearing before a Manhattan court.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Sam’s Request</h2>



<p>Bankman-Fried’s court representatives submitted a letter motion in a bid to keep two of Sam’s bail co-signers a secret. Bankman-Fried’s lawyers requested a “limited modification to one portion of the bail conditions”, said the letter sent to U.S. Judge Lewis Kaplan and the criminal court.</p>



<p>In December 2022, authorities released the disgraced FTX Founder after Bankman-Fried posted bail for $250 million. The court included house arrest, location monitoring, and an international travel ban as part of SBF’s bail conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried’s lawyers asked the court to redact the two remaining names of the bail bond co-signers. SBF’s legal counsel also requested that the U.S. government keep the names of the individuals private as well.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Specifically, we request an order from the Court directing that the names and other identifying information of Mr. Bankman-Fried’s two remaining bail sureties (1) be redacted on the bond they will sign, and (2) not be publicly disclosed by the Government.</p></blockquote>



<p>The letter <a href="https://twitter.com/tier10k/status/1610265485706240001?s=20&amp;t=bunj9iJUBGfJ25wvfnaDew" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a> that the U.S. government “takes no position on the request”, suggesting that the decision is entirely up to Judge Kaplan and the court.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried Extradited To America</h2>



<p>Former crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried was extradited to the United States in December after waiving his right to contest extradition in a Bahamian court. Following the court order, SBF as he’s known was flown to Manhattan, New York.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried faces multiple criminal charges from fraud to campaign finance violations. The CFTC, Department of Justice, and the SEC all filed charges against SBF over FTX’s collapse in November 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX Co-Founder Gary Wang signed plea deals, admitting to stealing customer funds, and supposedly flipping on Sam Bankman-Fried. The FBI also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/u-s-doj-launches-probe-into-372-million-ftx-hack-following-bankruptcy-filing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opened</a> investigations on a $400 million hack <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2022/11/21/ftx-hacker-moved-nearly-200-million-of-ether-to-different-wallets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suffered</a> by FTX shortly after Chapter 11 bankruptcy was filed. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The Securities Commission of The Bahamas addressed “material misstatements”  made by FTX CEO John Ray III after the crypto exchange collapsed in November.</li><li>The Commission accused Ray of making unfounded claims based on incomplete information.</li><li>Friction between both parties crossed into a new year amid ongoing bankruptcy proceedings and investigations into FTX&#8217;s billion-dollar crash.</li></ul>



<p>Tensions between the FTX’s bankruptcy administration and the Securities Commission of The Bahamas escalated on Tuesday as the watchdog fired back over claims made by CEO John Ray III</p>



<p>On January 3, the SCB published an announcement in a bid to dispel misinformation that emerged from the new FTX boss. Ray was hired to lead the fallen crypto exchange through bankruptcy shortly after Sam Bankman-Fried unwillingly filed for Chapter 11 protection.</p>



<p>According to the court documents, Ray’s team claimed that the Bahamas watchdog instructed Bankman-Fried’s exchange to mint roughly $300 million in fresh FTT tokens, the native token of the crippled platform. The SCB <a href="https://twitter.com/SCBgov_bs/status/1610084773472485380?s=20&amp;t=NZwY4oxkIRTTZhyLjhSx2w" rel="nofollow noopener">countered</a> this claim, calling the allegations “unfounded” and based on incomplete reporting.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The US Debtors’ continued lack of diligence when making public statements concerning the Commission is disappointing, and reflects a cavalier attitude towards the truth and towards The Bahamas that has been displayed by the current officers of the Chapter 11 Debtors from the date of their appointment by Sam Bankman-Fried.</p></blockquote>



<p>Back in later 2022, the SCB also addressed claims that Bahamas authorities gave FTX permission to open local withdrawals.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Securities Commission of The Bahamas Corrects Material Misstatements made by Chapter 11 Debtors <a href="https://t.co/FkSXEt9fz5" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/FkSXEt9fz5</a></p>&mdash; Securities Commission of The Bahamas (@SCBgov_bs) <a href="https://twitter.com/SCBgov_bs/status/1610084773472485380?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">January 3, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<h2>FTX Embroiled In Tussle With Bahamas Authorities</h2>



<p>Indeed, friction between the two entities sparked in November after FTX accused Bahamas regulators of stealing cryptocurrencies from the crypto exchange. The SCB countered that Ray publicly disclosed the claims without liaising with Bahamas regulators or responding to communication attempts.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Mr. Ray has not once reached out to the Commission to discuss any of his concerns before airing them publicly, The Commission has still not received a response to its 7 December 2022 letter to Mr. Ray offering cooperation with Chapter 11 Debtors.</p></blockquote>



<p>The SCB reportedly <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/3-5-billion-ftx-customer-crypto-bahamas/">secured</a> around $3.5 billion in FTX customer crypto after a hacker stole roughly $400 million in digital assets from the platform. Ray’s team asked the court for control over the digital assets as bankruptcy proceedings seek to settle creditors and debtors alike. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The Bahamian Securities Commission took control of the assets on November 12 due to concerns that FTX was vulnerable to cyberattacks.</li><li>Hackers stole nearly $400 million in digital assets hours after Founder Sam Bankman-Fried filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on November 11.</li><li>Notably, the tokens secured from FTX Digital Markets Ltd were worth $3.5 billion in November.</li></ul>



<p>Digital currencies belonging to FTX customers are held by the Securities Commission of the Bahamas, said a press statement published by the regulator on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Commission secured customer assets from FTX Digital Markets Ltd on November 12 following an exploit on the sunken crypto exchange a day before. An unknown hacker attacked the platform and stole nearly $400 million in crypto tokens. The FBI <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/u-s-doj-launches-probe-into-372-million-ftx-hack-following-bankruptcy-filing/">announced</a> investigations into the hack, per reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Founder Sam Bankman-Fried, Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, and Co-Founder Gary Wang were also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2022/12/14/ftx-founder-and-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-arrested-in-the-bahamas/" rel="noopener">charged</a> with fraud and money laundering by the Department of Justice, CFTC, and SEC.</p>



<p>Notably, the $3.5 billion held by the Bahamian regulator was valued using November 12 market prices. Crypto Twitter participants also speculated that a piece of the holding could be in FTT and Serum (SRM) tokens. The Commission has not responded to questions about the specific tokens held.</p>



<p>Thursday’s announcement also addressed claims that the Bahamas regulator told Bankman-Fried’s to open local withdrawals, denying such a request.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>FTX Customer Assets Await Court Order</h2>



<p>The Bahamian Securities Commission said the assets will remain under custody until a Supreme Court issues an order. Per the official statement, the SCB will hold the assets in “digital wallets controlled by the Commission, for safekeeping”. The current market value of the tokens held by the watchdog is unclear at press time. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The digital assets transferred on 12 November 2022 to digital wallets under the exclusive control the Commission are being held by the Commission on a temporary basis, until such time as The Bahamas Supreme Court directs the Commission to deliver them to the customers and creditors who own them, or to the JPLs to be administered under rules governing the insolvency estate for the benefit of the customers and creditors of FTXDM</p></blockquote>



<p>Customers in Turkey and Japan could be the first to access their cryptocurrencies from the bankruptcy exchange. Per reports, Liquid announced a plan to return customer assets by mid-February 2023. Disgraced crypto tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried bought Liquid crypto exchange after the Japanese crypto exchange was hacked for $100 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>The Department of Justice charged Eisenberg with market manipulation of the MNGO token.</li><li>Eisenberg exploited Mango Markets for $110 million in cryptocurrencies back in October 2022.</li><li>The Solana-based decentralized exchange offered Eisenberg and the other hackers $47 million as a bug bounty if the group returned $67 million in digital assets.</li></ul>



<p>Avraham Eisenberg was arrested on Tuesday after the U.S. Department of Justice charged Eisenberg with market manipulation over an October hack on the decentralized exchange Mango Markets. The platform allows users on Solana to buy, sell, lend and trade cryptocurrencies on Solana’s blockchain network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) comprised of MNGO token holders govern the exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The Charges</h2>



<p>Indeed, the DOJ charged and arrested Eisenberg for “market manipulation offenses”, per an official statement from U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday. Eisenberg also stands accused of commodities fraud and commodities manipulation, as revealed by a second filing.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Eisenberg engaged in a scheme involving the intentional and artificial manipulation of the price of perpetual futures contracts on a cryptocurrency exchange called Mango Markets.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Mango Markets $110 Million Hack</h2>



<p>Mango Markets was exploited for around $110 million in cryptocurrencies on October 11, 2022. The hacker leveraged a loophole in Mango’s price oracle to trigger massive withdrawals from the DEX.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On October 15, 2022, Eisenberg said he “was involved with a team that operated a highly profitable trading strategy” on Mango. The DOJ’s indictment said Eisenberg and his team generated illicit wealth by trading MNGO perpetual tokens between several counts.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Statement on recent events:<br><br>I was involved with a team that operated a highly profitable trading strategy last week.</p>&mdash; Avraham Eisenberg (@avi_eisen) <a href="https://twitter.com/avi_eisen/status/1581326197241180160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">October 15, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>According to the court filing, the hacker group then manipulated Mango’s token price and created an artificial asset price pump by purchasing MNGO in vast amounts. Eisenberg allegedly leveraged the assets as collateral to borrow a myriad of digital currencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Afterward, Eisenberg drained liquidity from the DEX and withdrew $110 million in several cryptos. The trader claimed the process aligned with “legal open market actions” and the exploit was the consequence of Mango Markets’ lack of anticipation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mango offered Eisenberg and his team $47 million as a bug bounty. In exchange, the platform asked the hackers to return $67 million in tokens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The controversial FTX hack last month, which led to a loss of more than $370 million, has once again been brought into the limelight. The United States Department of Justice has launched a criminal probe into this matter. According to a report by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-27/us-probes-how-372-million-vanished-in-hack-after-ftx-bankruptcy" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, this probe is separate from the fraud case that former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is currently facing in Manhattan.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Funds exploited from FTX have been frozen by authorities</strong></h2>



<p>The investigation into the hack is being headed by the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team of the Department of Justice. This team consists of a network of prosecutors who specialize in digital asset investigation. A person familiar with the matter has revealed that a portion of the exploited funds has been frozen by authorities. This investigation is separate from the fraud charges that have been brought against&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-to-be-released-after-posting-250-million-bail/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>. The former CEO had previously indicated that the exploit may have been an inside job.</p>



<p>The hack was initially&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/0xfoobar/status/1591261359152705538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a>&nbsp;by the crypto Twitter community.

The initial figure was close to $650 million since FTX employees had started transferring assets into cold wallets as a&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/_Ryne_Miller/status/1591326796305530880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1591326796305530880%7Ctwgr%5E5804e9a63837a114a4351ef76deb5e6f21c40948%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fftx-reportedly-hacked-as-officials-flag-abnormal-wallet-activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">precaution</a>. </p>

<p>The exploit was later acknowledged by current CEO John Ray III who stated that there had been “unauthorized access” within hours of filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy on 11 November.&nbsp;&nbsp;The days following the hack saw the perpetrator swapping the exploited tokens for ETH. These funds were then bridged to Bitcoin using the RenBridge service. The perpetrator also employed mixer services to obscure the money trail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
