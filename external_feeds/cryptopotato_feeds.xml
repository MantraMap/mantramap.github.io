            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new survey by Binance Research, the research arm of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, found that most institutional investors are optimistic about the outlook of cryptocurrencies for the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Binance Research conducted the survey from March 31 to May 15, 2023, with 208 global institutional clients and VIP users as the respondents. The study, dubbed the &#8220;<a href="https://research.binance.com/en/analysis/institutional-crypto-outlook-survey-2023" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Institutional Crypto Outlook Survey</a>,&#8221; explored the respondents&#8217; attitudes, preferences, motivations, and adoption toward crypto investments.</p>
<h2>A Positive Crypto Outlook</h2>
<p>The respondents comprised a diverse mix of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/institutional-investors-are-still-buying-crypto-according-to-a-coinbase-survey/" data-wpel-link="internal">institutional investors</a> with various levels of experience and assets under management (AUM). More than 48% of the participants have over five years of crypto investing experience. Funds with crypto AUM below $25 million made up 52.4% of the surveyees, while those with AUM above $100 million accounted for 22.6%.</p>
<p>In the outlook category, 63.5% of the respondents expressed optimism for the crypto sector over the next 12 months. And when the time frame was extended to a decade, 88% of the surveyees indicated a positive outlook for crypto.</p>
<p>Regarding allocation, 47.1% of the participants disclosed that they maintained their crypto holdings over the past year, while 35.6% increased theirs within the same period. About half of the respondents expect to increase their crypto possessions with time, while 4.3% would do the opposite in the next year.</p>
<p>Investors&#8217; interests were focused on layer-1 and layer-2 sectors and infrastructure. Roughly 54% of participants found infrastructure most important to them or their fund, followed by layer-1 and layer-2 sectors at 48.1% and 43.8%. Decentralized applications (dApps) were discovered to be the most used in recent months.</p>
<h2>Driving Crypto Adoption</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the respondents expressed their belief in more real-world use cases and improvements in regulatory clarity fueling the drive for crypto adoption. Approximately 27% demanded more real-world use cases, while 25.3% asked for regulatory clarity.</p>
<p>The need for increased institutional participation through banks and other financial institutions also emerged as another driver of crypto <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/institutional-adoption-of-defi-is-many-years-away-says-blackrock-executive/" data-wpel-link="internal">adoption</a>, followed by stronger security like fraud detection and custody solutions.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The results highlight institutional investors&#8217; belief in broad ecosystem developments rather than short-term price action in driving widespread crypto adoption,&#8221; the report stated.</p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[Once cyberattacks are added to the mix, a total of $11.5 billion worth of crypto has been lost to bad actors last year.
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TRM Labs, a leading blockchain analysis firm focused on preventing cybercrime, has released a comprehensive report on the illicit sums lost to bad actors in the crypto space in 2022.</p>
<p>The figures are quite notable, especially given the declining prices and interest in the market last year.</p>
<h2>Improved Cybersecurity Measures</h2>
<p>In spite of the plummeting value of various digital assets due to crypto winter and the myriad collapses that accompanied it, the number of scams and thefts in the industry has not decreased significantly, at most staying in proportion to similar cases in previous years.</p>
<p>For instance, over $12 billion were <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/overall-losses-from-defi-exploits-exceed-12-billion-in-2021-elliptic-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">lost</a> to DeFi exploits in 2021. Although this figure dwarfs the $3.7 billion lost to exploits in 2022, it’s worth noting that those $12 billion represent a sevenfold increase in DeFi exploits over the prior year, making 2022 an outlier by any measure.</p>
<p>In 2022, $3.7 billion was stolen across over 175 incidents, each of which resulted in an <a href="https://www.trmlabs.com/illicit-crypto-ecosystem-report-2023#Theft" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">average loss</a> of $20 million for the investors of the exploited projects. It’s worth noting that the smart contracts that were the main target of DeFi exploits in 2021 seem to have improved – only about 10% of cyberattacks in 2022 were protocol exploits, with the remaining 90% targeting the rest of the platforms’ infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Investors Still Enticed by Illicit Platforms</h2>
<p>About $7.8 billion were lost to pyramid schemes and similar Ponzi platforms in 2022. If other scams – such as romance frauds and phishing attacks – are taken into calculation, the crypto community lost over $9 billion in 2022 alone.</p>
<p>Although the pyramid scheme-type frauds at least provided some sort of value to investors until they ignominiously collapsed, the rate of fraudulent investment platforms and tokens – often offering a mere pipe dream – doubled in 2022, resulting in a total of $2.57 billion worth of crypto outright stolen from investors worldwide.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, pyramid schemes made up the lion’s share of ill-begotten gains, with about $7.8 billion in value disappearing overnight once they were no longer able to recruit new gullible marks.</p>
<p>The top 10 pyramid schemes accounted for 54% of the total take. The largest ones to collapse in 2022 were Forsage and the Trade Coin Club, with <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/victims-of-2-4b-bitconnect-ponzi-to-receive-17m-in-restitution/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitconnect</a> following close behind them.</p>
<p>About 40% of pyramid schemes in 2022 took place on the TRON network, mostly involving USDT. The report also touches on the sums involved in illicit markets, which, although very illegal, only generated about $1.5 billion in revenue for bad actors, far less than the amount generated by outright fraud.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is an evident pattern in the crypto market when it comes to Meme tokens like Doge, Shiba, and Pepe.</p>
<p>They all have a hype that only a few cashed on, and the rest are trying to onboard the passed bus. Unlike them, utility tokens tend to come with slower growth, less hype, but also with long-term potential.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Telegram-3.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258160" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Telegram-3.png" alt="aitgpt" width="2560" height="1440" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Telegram-3.png 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Telegram-3-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Telegram-3-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Telegram-3-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Telegram-3-1536x864.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Telegram-3-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Telegram-3-50x28.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a></p>
<h2>Utility vs Meme Tokens</h2>
<p>In the world of cryptocurrencies, the clash between utility tokens and meme tokens has captured significant attention. Meme tokens, like ike Doge, Shiba, and Pepe, characterized by their explosive but oftentimes short-lived hype, often leave investors high and dry.</p>
<p>On the other hand, utility tokens like AI TalentGPT (AITGPT) present a different narrative, offering real-world value and long-term potential. This article explores the presale of AI TalentGPT, delving into the advantages of utility tokens over meme tokens and how AI TalentGPT stands out as a promising solution that reshapes the crypto landscape.</p>
<p>In contrast, Utility tokens demonstrate a more gradual growth trajectory, characterized by lesser hype and a focus on long-term potential. Unlike Meme tokens, Utility tokens offer tangible value and real-world utility, which contributes to their sustained and meaningful development over time. This divergence in approach highlights the importance of considering the underlying value and utility of a token when assessing its long-term prospects in the crypto market.</p>
<h2>The Lifecycle of Meme Tokens</h2>
<p>In recent times, the cryptocurrency market has witnessed a surge of meme tokens like Doge, Shiba, and Pepe that gain popularity overnight, driven by social media buzz and celebrity endorsements. Investors are enticed by the promise of quick and astronomical returns, lured into the frenzy by the allure of easy profits.</p>
<p>However, the reality often proves harsh, as meme tokens are highly volatile and susceptible to pump-and-dump schemes. Once the hype subsides, these tokens rapidly plummet in value, leaving investors with substantial losses.</p>
<h2>The Value Proposition of Utility Tokens</h2>
<p>In contrast, utility tokens like AI TalentGPT (AITGPT) operate on a different principle. Rather than relying solely on speculative fervor, utility tokens derive their worth from the tangible benefits they offer within their respective ecosystems. AI TalentGPT (AITGPT) serves as the fuel that powers the AI TalentGPT platform, providing users with access to premium features, services, and participation in the platform&#8217;s governance. These tokens are rooted in real-world applications, addressing genuine problems and driving meaningful innovation.</p>
<h2>AI TalentGPT: Revolutionizing the Crypto Space</h2>
<p>AI TalentGPT (AITGPT) is poised to revolutionize the crypto space by merging the power of AI and utility tokens. The platform offers a novel approach to talent acquisition, employing AI technology to streamline the recruitment process and connect job seekers with suitable opportunities. By leveraging the AI TalentGPT ecosystem, users can access premium features, contribute to AI training tasks, and engage in knowledge exchange.</p>
<p>The presale of <a href="https://www.aitalentgpt.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">AI TalentGPT (AITGPT)</a> presents a unique opportunity for investors. Unlike meme tokens that fade into obscurity, AI TalentGPT is driven by a genuine need for AI-powered recruitment solutions, ensuring sustained demand and utility. The presale participants not only become early adopters but also gain voting rights, allowing them to actively shape the future of the platform.</p>
<h2>Utility of AI TalentGPT (AITGPT)</h2>
<p>The primary motive of <a href="https://www.aitalentgpt.com/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AI TalentGPT (AITGPT)</a> tokens is to incentivize user engagement in MyBeamery Platform to facilitate AI training by completing simple tasks and earn. Also, this token will help to ensure long-term sustainability of AI TalentGPT Platform (ChatGPT-based AI Recruitment Platform).  The support team will work for the tokens, and users can trade it making AI talentGPT an open community-based platform. People who hold this token will also get to vote for the features and updates.</p>
<h2>What We Have Learnt</h2>
<p>As the battle between utility and meme tokens rages on, AI TalentGPT (AITGPT) emerges as a standout player in the crypto space. By focusing on utility, real-world applications, and long-term value creation, AI TalentGPT sets itself apart from the short-term hype associated with meme tokens like Doge, Shiba, and Pepe.</p>
<p>The presale of AI TalentGPT offers investors the opportunity to support an innovative platform that addresses the job market&#8217;s needs while positioning themselves for potential long-term gains. As the utility token revolution continues, AI TalentGPT paves the way for a more sustainable and promising future in the crypto industry.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a successful breakout above the critical $30K resistance level, Bitcoin&#8217;s price is currently maintaining its position above this level. However, there are concerning indications emerging that suggest a potential retracement or change in direction in the near future.</p>
<h2><strong>Technical Analysis</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3><strong>The Daily Chart:</strong></h3>
<p>After a strong bullish breakout above the crucial resistance level at $30K, the upward momentum in Bitcoin&#8217;s price has halted on the daily chart.</p>
<p>The price is currently consolidating above this level, but caution is advised as the RSI indicator is signaling overbought conditions, indicating a potential short-term decline. If it retreats below $30K, the recent breakout could be considered false, leading to a possible reversal.</p>
<p>In such a scenario, the 50-day moving average around $28K and the 200-day moving average near $25K would likely act as support levels.</p>
<figure id="attachment_258115" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-258115" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-Daily-Jul-1-2023-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-258115 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-Daily-Jul-1-2023-scaled.jpg" alt="btc_price_chart_0107231" width="2560" height="1464" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-Daily-Jul-1-2023-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-Daily-Jul-1-2023-300x172.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-Daily-Jul-1-2023-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-Daily-Jul-1-2023-768x439.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-Daily-Jul-1-2023-1536x879.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-Daily-Jul-1-2023-2048x1171.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-Daily-Jul-1-2023-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-258115" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3><strong>The 4-Hour Chart:</strong></h3>
<p>Examining the 4-hour timeframe, it is clear that the price of Bitcoin is currently in a consolidation phase, tightly ranging above the previously breached $30K resistance level.</p>
<p>This consolidation follows a rapid and steep ascent after breaking out from a significant descending channel. Although the RSI indicator is hovering near the midpoint of 50% in this timeframe, there is a notable chance of a short-term retracement, particularly if the $30K level is unable to sustain the price.</p>

<h2><strong>On-chain Analysis</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/profile/u/Edris?tab=quicktake" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Bitcoin Miners Position Index</strong></h3>
<p>Analyzing the behavior of Bitcoin miners can provide valuable insights, especially following the recent price rally above the important $30K resistance level. Miners play a crucial role in the Bitcoin network, and their actions can significantly impact the market.</p>
<p>The Miners&#8217; Position Index Metric (MPI) is depicted in the chart, representing the ratio of total miner outflow (in USD) to its one-year moving average. A higher value indicates that miners are sending more coins than usual, suggesting potential selling activity. If miners collectively sell a portion of their reserves, it could trigger a decline.</p>
<p>The chart clearly shows a notable increase in MPI during the recent upward movement of BTC&#8217;s price above $30K.</p>
<p>This can be interpreted as miners selling some of their holdings to ensure they can cover their operational expenses, particularly if there is a market downturn in the future. However, if this selling behavior continues, it may result in an oversupply of Bitcoin and potentially lead to a significant price crash. Investors should exercise caution and monitor this situation closely.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Max Keiser is of the opinion that Ripple will lose its case against the SEC. However, the reason is different from what you may think. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Max Keiser has once again come out with a comment on the ongoing case between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple &#8211; the company behind XRP.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin permabull thinks Ripple will lose, but the reason is not what many might think.</p>
<ul>
<li>Max Keiser is a well-known proponent of Bitcoin &#8211; one that&#8217;s been very vocal about the primary cryptocurrency&#8217;s merits.</li>
<li>He&#8217;s also bashed multiple altcoins on many different occasions, and Ripple&#8217;s XRP hasn&#8217;t been an exception.</li>
<li>In a recent tweet, he said that Ripple will definitely lose its case against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. But why?</li>
<li>Well, Keiser seems to think that Gensler &#8211; the SEC&#8217;s Chairman &#8211; is a &#8220;leg-breaker for the banking mob.&#8221;</li>
<li>Citing an article from the Wall Street Journal where the SEC called out spot Bitcoin ETF filings &#8220;inadequate,&#8221; he said:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>As explained, the SEC runs a protection racket for Wall St. crooks so this is no big surprise. It also means XRP will definitely lose their case &#8211; as well as everything not Bitcoin (BTC is untouchable).</p>
<p>Not on the basis of law, but because Gary&#8217;s a leg-breaker for the banking mob.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Just a week ago, Keiser also openly called Ripple a Ponzi Scheme while maintaining that the SEC will &#8220;kill XPR.&#8221;</li>
</ul>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The meme coin landscape is continuing to evolve every week, creating an abundance of opportunities for dramatic gains.</p>
<p>One token garnering significant attention from the masses is <a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b_thuglife_33357" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Thug Life ($THUG)</a>, a new and culturally resonant project in the meme coin space.</p>
<p>Given its unique value proposition and appealing tokenomics, there’s a growing consensus among low-cap crypto traders that $THUG could be the next big meme coin once it makes its open-market debut.</p>
<h2>Unique Hip-Hop Themed $THUG Token Makes Its Mark</h2>
<p>Thug Life, using the ticker symbol $THUG, stands out from the plethora of meme coins by grounding itself in the richness of hip-hop culture.</p>
<p>Paying homage to the Thug Life movement of the 80s, the project aims to foster a sense of resilience amid the ever-changing crypto landscape.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the $THUG token seeks to create a community and rally supporters thanks to its hilarious market-themed memes.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258134" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="365" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-300x182.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This appealing setup has already managed to attract the attention of investors, amassing over $150,000 in the first two days of its presale.</p>
<p>The presale&#8217;s allure has also been driven by the fact that early investors can buy $THUG tokens for just $0.0007 – with no price increase scheduled during the presale&#8217;s lifespan.</p>
<p>If that wasn&#8217;t enough, Thug Life also benefits from potential links with rap icon Snoop Dogg, referenced multiple times in the project&#8217;s branding.</p>
<p>Although there&#8217;s no direct link between Thug Life and Snoop yet, the rapper is no stranger to the world of cryptocurrency – meaning there&#8217;s certainly scope for collaboration if things continue moving in the right direction.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b_thuglife_33357" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>Visit Thug Life Presale</strong></a></p>
<h2>Thug Life’s Transparency &amp; Community Focus Set Stage for Success</h2>
<p>Importantly, Thug Life’s team aims to ensure the project is more than just a catchy name – they also plan to make $THUG as transparent as possible, an approach that&#8217;s unfortunately fallen by the wayside in the meme coin space.</p>
<p>As noted on the <a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b_thuglife_33357" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Thug Life website</a>, the team has pledged to lock liquidity for three months post-presale, effectively safeguarding investors from rug pull scenarios.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258133" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="343" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-300x171.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-50x28.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Moreover, 70% of the total token supply has been allocated to presale investors, emphasizing the team&#8217;s commitment to building a strong community.</p>
<p>By enabling early supporters to secure a stake in the project’s success, Thug Life creates the foundation for a loyal community base – evidenced by the huge influx of new members to the official <a href="https://t.me/thuglifetoken" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Telegram channel</a>.</p>
<p>Thug Life’s <a href="https://twitter.com/thug_life_token" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter page</a> has also rocketed to over 2,500 followers in the space of two days, further showcasing the project’s widespread appeal.</p>
<h2>Investor Excitement Grows About Potential $THUG Price Surge</h2>
<p>Speculation is already rife that Thug Life could be the next big sensation in the meme coin market.</p>
<p>Jacob Bury, a well-known crypto influencer, has already <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVtbCRWEmgA&amp;t=2s&amp;ab_channel=JacobCryptoBury" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">predicted</a> a price surge once $THUG makes its debut on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) after the presale ends.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258132" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="295" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-300x147.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>The project’s commitment to community engagement has been referenced in both videos, given that Thug Life&#8217;s team has already planned a post-presale airdrop campaign.</p>
<p>Details are still scarce on this campaign, but the team has set aside 15% of the total token supply for community rewards – hinting that the airdrop could significantly benefit early adopters.</p>
<p>Ultimately, only time will tell whether this hip-hop-themed crypto project will be the next big crypto, but one thing is for certain &#8211; $THUG is undoubtedly a project to watch closely in the weeks ahead.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Kraken's issues with US government agencies continue. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kraken has been ordered to turn over sensitive user information for clients that had transactions worth in total over $20,000 over the course of a year.</p>
<p>The tax agency said it wants to determine whether crypto investors have been cheating on their tax reports.</p>
<ul>
<li>The IRS filed the initial court petition in the Northern District of California earlier this year, claiming that it had previously issued summons to the exchange in 2021 that the latter ignored. The agency also said it wants to check for tax liabilities for users transacting in the aforementioned amount between 2016 and 2020.</li>
<li>Now, Judge Joseph Spero <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.407965/gov.uscourts.cand.407965.34.0.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">ordered</a> Kraken to turn over the required information, which includes the user&#8217;s name, pseudonyms, if any, taxpayer identification number, phone number, email and physical address, birthdate, etc.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Court must determine whether the Government’s summons is narrowly tailored, that is, whether it is &#8216;no broader than necessary to achieve its purpose.&#8217; The Court finds that to the extent the first three requests are aimed at establishing the identities of the Kraken account holders who fall within the Doe definition, the information sought in these requests is much broader than what is necessary to achieve that purpose for the vast majority of Doe users.&#8221; &#8211; the Judge wrote.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>However, Judge Spero has seemingly rejected the IRS&#8217; requests to receive more detailed information regarding the users&#8217; source of wealth, employment data, etc.</li>
<li>Kraken was among the first crypto entities to go under the regulatory scope of another US government agency &#8211; the Securities and Exchange Commission.</li>
<li>A few months before the SEC went after Binance, Coinbase, and several digital assets, it reached an <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/btc-eth-plunge-4-following-sec-termination-of-kraken-staking/" data-wpel-link="internal">agreement</a> with the veteran US exchange to halt its staking service and pay $30 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[More than 80% of the funds from the sanctioned pro-Russian entities were traced to centralized crypto exchanges.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A year after invading Ukraine, Russia’s military fundraising groups have raised millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies despite sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other countries.</p>
<p>While it appears that Russian military procurement and disinformation groups have <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/russia-has-received-over-2-million-in-cryptocurrency-donations-chainalysis-says/" data-wpel-link="internal">raised</a> about $4.2 million, comparatively smaller than Ukraine’s over $212 million, research by blockchain analytics firm Elliptic has <a href="https://hub.elliptic.co/analysis/crypto-payments-to-russian-military-fundraisers-reaches-20-million-amid-ukraine-counter-offensive-and-wagner-revolt/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">discovered</a> that the nation has raised as much as $20 million in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2>Russian Military Groups Raise $20M in Crypto</h2>
<p>Elliptic made the discoveries after NATO allies identified and sanctioned new Russian financiers. A deeper analysis showed that half of the donated funds came through U.S.-sanctioned entities.</p>
<p>More than 80% of the funds from the sanctioned pro-Russian entities were traced to centralized crypto exchanges, showing that they were the most common destination for the assets. Besides centralized platforms, the entities also engaged with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, including cross-chain bridges, non-fungible token (NFT) services, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).</p>
<p>Among the sanctioned entities are individuals and groups that have <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/pro-russian-outfits-turn-to-crypto-fundraising-to-support-war-efforts-against-ukraine-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">embraced</a> crypto for several reasons. Some see digital assets as a source of fundraising, and others, as an incentive. For instance, U.S.-sanctioned individual Alexander Zhuchkovsky heavily promoted the Terricon NFT project aiming to raise funds for the Russian war effort. However, NFT marketplace OpenSea deleted the collection before it could raise any funds.</p>
<p>On the other hand, senior officials at the Donetsk People’s Republic disclosed that they reward intelligence about Ukrainian military positions with bitcoin (BTC). U.S.-sanctioned Task Force Rusich has also suggested that its supporters bury dead Ukrainian soldiers and demand BTC from their families in exchange for information on the location of their bodies.</p>
<h2>Growing Sanctions Risk</h2>
<p>While global sanctions regimes have intensified their positions against pro-Russian individuals and entities raising money to acquire military equipment, supposedly humanitarian groups have released crypto donation wallets, revealing exposure to sanctioned individuals.</p>
<p>One example is the Russian Humanitarian Mission (ROM), which solicits crypto donations through the wallets of Russian fighter Evgeny Poddubny, who is sanctioned by the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Ukraine. Elliptic found that Poddubny receives funds from sanctioned and criminal platforms like darknet markets <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/heres-how-darknet-markets-scrambled-for-users-after-hydras-collapse-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hydra</a> and Shkaf, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/atomic-wallet-hackers-continue-laundering-funds-through-binance-kucoin-huobi/" data-wpel-link="internal">Garantex Exchange</a>, and Bitzlato Exchange.</p>
<p>The movement of funds underscores growing sanctions risks to crypto services and the need for effective compliance regimes in the nascent sector.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Binance’s lowkey profile is one of the most powerful women in crypto, as well as the mother of CZ’s children.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A low-profile but highly influential senior executive at Binance has spoken out as the company begins legal battles against two top market regulators in the United States.</p>
<p>Yi He, who boasts a massive fortune as one of the company’s early shareholders, has also had children with Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ).</p>
<h2>The SEC Lawsuit</h2>
<p>He <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/crypto-s-most-powerful-woman-speaks-out-as-crisis-rocks-binance-1.1939022" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">spoke</a> to Bloomberg in a series of interviews – one of which took place in Dubai last month, shortly before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/3-most-serious-claims-in-the-sec-lawsuit-v-binance/" data-wpel-link="internal">136-page lawsuit</a> against her company.</p>
<p>At that time, the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) had already <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-are-binance-and-cz-being-accused-of-a-closer-look-at-the-cftc-filing/" data-wpel-link="internal">sued</a> the company on some overlapping charges, such as serving U.S.-based customers from its international platform. He struck a conciliatory tone with such regulators, saying she respects their “attitude” and “intentions.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she still thinks their actions are misguided. “If they really took the time to understand our industry, they would see that if Binance isn’t compliant, then practically no other global trading platform or offshore company is,” she said.</p>
<p>Binance published a <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/community/playing-by-the-rules-an-overview-of-binances-compliance-program-7787599269355947143" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">blog post</a> on Thursday outlining the lengths to which it tries to remain legally compliant worldwide. The company’s 8000-person workforce includes “750 core and supporting compliance staff” consisting of “former law enforcement officers, regulators, crypto, fintech, and traditional banking compliance experts.”</p>
<p>The exchange is known for having no formal headquarters, thus making it theoretically harder to sue or regulate. It’s also been criticized for being shrouded in opacity, from its governance structure to its <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-responds-to-reuters-claims-about-mixing-user-funds/" data-wpel-link="internal">handling</a> of client assets.</p>
<p>According to He, Binance offers more transparency than its critics often claim and strives to cooperate with regulators rather than evade them. “The trend of regulations is inevitable globally,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not something you can solve by shouting ‘fight’ a couple of times.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Yi He and CZ: What’s Going On?</h2>
<p>He’s history with CZ stretches back years to her time at OKCoin in 2014, where she later hired him as a Chief Technology Officer (CTO). CZ later asked her to be a consultant at Binance in 2017, where she helped rewrite parts of the company’s whitepaper.</p>
<p>She’s also the mother of CZ’s children – an open secret among crypto industry insiders. “What do they call it in the entertainment industry? CP?” she said when questioned on the topic. CP is a Chinese internet slang term for ‘shipping.’</p>
<p>He referred to Zhao less as a romantic partner and more as a “comrade in arms,” rejecting comparisons of their relationship to that of failed FTX and Alameda CEOs Sam Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison.</p>
<p>In fact, He claimed she and CZ’s relationship went beyond dating in some capacity. “A co-founder relationship is about comradeship, a dating relationship is about chemistry. The former is based on shared beliefs and goes beyond gender, the latter is based on physical attraction and selfish desires,” she said.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[BitcoinSV is today's best performer from the top 50 with a 18% surge. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin went on a short-lived roller-coaster yesterday but has reclaimed $30,000 after dumping to a 10-day low.</p>
<p>Yet, its dominance over the altcoins has declined a lot on a daily scale, as some, such as LTC, LDO, VET, and BSV, have shot up.</p>
<h2>BTC&#8217;s Dump and Pump</h2>
<p>After last week&#8217;s massive price surge, which drove bitcoin from $26,500 to over $31,000 at one point, the cryptocurrency had calmed and remained in a tighter range between $30,000 and $31,000.</p>
<p>It tried to overcome the latter yesterday when the bulls drove it to a daily high of $31,250. Despite failing there, it initially lost only $200 and remained above $31,000 for a few hours.</p>
<p>However, it all changed after a WSJ <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-dumps-below-30k-as-sec-warns-that-recent-btc-spot-etf-filings-are-inadequate-wsj/" data-wpel-link="internal">report</a> emerged claiming that the SEC deemed the recent BTC Spot ETF filings, from the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity, as &#8220;inadequate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bitcoin reacted with an immediate price drop that drove it south by $1,500 to a 10-day low of $29,500. However, the bulls stepped up once again and recovered almost all losses, with BTC currently sitting around a grand higher.</p>
<p>Its market capitalization stands close to $600 billion as of now, but its dominance over the alts has taken a major hit and is down below 50%. In fact, the metric has declined by almost 1% in the past 24 hours.</p>

<h2>LTC Sees 14-Month High</h2>
<p><em>CryptoPotato</em> <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/litecoins-hash-rate-hits-ath-as-halving-countdown-narrows-and-ltc-nears-100/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> yesterday that Litecoin&#8217;s price action drove it to a multi-month high of its own, just under $100. This comes as the network&#8217;s hash rate jumped to an ATH ahead of the next halving. However, the landscape for LTC holders changed for the better once again in the past 24 hours as the asset soared to over $110 for the first time since April 2022.</p>
<p>Dogecoin, Polkadot, Ethereum Classic, and Lido DAO are the other notable performers from the larger-cap alts, with gains of up to 7% daily.</p>
<p>BitcoinSV has skyrocketed the most from the top 50 alts, having surged by 18% to over $50.</p>
<p>ETH and BNB are up by 1.5% and sit above $1,900 and $240, respectively.</p>
<p>The total crypto market cap has remained relatively stagnant at just under $1.2 trillion.</p>
