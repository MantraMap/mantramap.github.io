					<description><![CDATA[Solana (SOL) has managed to shake off recent price dips, rekindling bullish optimism among investors. This resurgence comes on the heels of a determined effort by sellers to flip the altcoin&#8217;s trajectory bearish, following a price rejection at the critical $29 resistance level.  However, SOL&#8217;s retreat from this resistance proved to be a strategic move as it found support in the bullish order block (OB) at $22, setting the stage for a renewed uptrend. SOL&#8217;s journey from the formidable $29 price mark to the bullish order block at $22 was pivotal. A recent price analysis has underscored the importance of this OB as a key level for the altcoin&#8217;s potential reversal of fortunes.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Keeps Energy Alive, Snags 26% Gain – Here’s The Inside Scoop With a long-term perspective in mind, Solana&#8217;s ability to rally from this OB demonstrates the resolve of buyers to reclaim control. This recovery has not only bolstered sentiment but also signified the strategic importance of this price juncture in steering the trend. BTC&#8217;s Influence On SOL&#8217;s Trajectory One notable factor underpinning Solana&#8217;s current narrative is the role of Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency. As SOL seeks to flip the $25.3 resistance level into a supportive base for further gains, its success may very well depend on the continued bullish advance of Bitcoin. The interplay between these two prominent cryptocurrencies remains a significant aspect to monitor, as BTC&#8217;s trajectory often influences the broader altcoin market sentiment. At present, Solana stands at a price of $24.50, as per CoinGecko data. Despite a slight decline of 1.0% over the last 24 hours, the altcoin has showcased a commendable seven-day rally of 8.8%, indicative of its capacity to rebound from adversities.  Solana weekend price action. Source: Coingecko However, a notable challenge emerges as SOL inches closer to the $25.7 mark. The impending supply pressure at this level could potentially stall the upward momentum, prompting a sideways trend and leading to a consolidation phase. Solana: Clearing The Path Forward Should the SOL price encounter intensified supply pressure around the $25.7 threshold, a distinct possibility is the emergence of a narrow price range during trading sessions. This consolidation phase, while seemingly a temporary lull, may serve a vital purpose. By trimming away weaker positions, this period could pave the way for a definitive directional movement.

					<description><![CDATA[Shiba Inu (SHIB) has transformed its breakout into a remarkable rally, continuing to build momentum in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. The surge has not only captivated the attention of crypto enthusiasts but has also brought a considerable number of meme token holders out of the depths of losses, marking a significant turning point in their investment journey. With SHIB&#8217;s current price resting at $0.00001120 per CoinGecko, the token has showcased an impressive 12.5% surge in the past 24 hours, while its seven-day journey witnessed a striking 25.8% increase.

The bullish sentiment has been unyielding, with sellers seemingly absent from the scene, painting a promising picture for the token&#8217;s trajectory. SHIB Targets And Challenges Ahead While the ongoing momentum keeps the market sentiment upbeat, experts point to the first significant resistance point at $0.0000106. This juncture will likely be closely monitored by traders, as potential sellers could make their presence felt. #SHIB Penetration of the Shiba candle at the resistance level is a sign of the continuation of the upward trend. #SHIBUSDT pic.twitter.com/cZ4s0BwOGC — Andrew Griffiths (@AndrewGriUK) August 11, 2023 If the bullish momentum persists, the next target for SHIB rests at $0.000012. Observing the current price action, the likelihood of SHIB reaching these levels appears favorable, painting a bright outlook for this meme coin. The transformation in SHIB&#8217;s fortunes extends beyond price fluctuations. Previously, a prolonged period of time saw over 80% of SHIB holders facing losses. However, recent data from Chain Afirk, an African web3 community on Twitter, indicates a significant shift.  The market capitalization of Shiba Inu is currently $6.4 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Approximately 33.03% of SHIB holders have now transitioned into a profitable position, signaling a shift in the memecoin&#8217;s fortunes. This change not only brings relief to long-time holders but also underlines the growing resilience of the token. Shiba Inu: The Key NVT Signal Analyzing the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) signal provides further insights into SHIB&#8217;s current state. According to Glassnode data cited by a price analysis, the NVT metric has surged to 170.52. This high NVT signal implies that SHIB&#8217;s market capitalization has surpassed its transaction volume, potentially pointing to an inflated state. This phenomenon could be indicative of the token reaching a market top, warranting vigilance from investors.

This juncture will likely be closely monitored by traders, as potential sellers could make their presence felt.</p>

<p>— Andrew Griffiths (@AndrewGriUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewGriUK/status/1689973959939231745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">August 11, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p>If the bullish momentum persists, the next target for SHIB rests at $0.000012. Observing the current price action, the likelihood of SHIB reaching these levels appears favorable, painting a bright outlook for this meme coin.</p>
<p>The transformation in SHIB&#8217;s fortunes extends beyond price fluctuations. Previously, a prolonged period of time saw over 80% of SHIB holders facing losses. However, recent <a href="https://twitter.com/ChainAfrik/status/1689887919127871488" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">data from Chain Afirk</a>, an African web3 community on Twitter, indicates a significant shift. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/LN09Udaf/" width="1835" height="893"/></p>

<p>Approximately 33.03% of SHIB holders have now transitioned into a profitable position, signaling a shift in the memecoin&#8217;s fortunes. This change not only brings relief to long-time holders but also underlines the growing resilience of the token.</p>
<h2><strong>Shiba Inu: The Key NVT Signal</strong></h2>
<p>Analyzing the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) signal provides further insights into SHIB&#8217;s current state. According to Glassnode data cited by a <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/age-old-shib-holders-are-no-longer-underwater/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">price analysis</a>, the NVT metric has surged to 170.52.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-546970 size-large" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/a-58.png?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C483" alt="" width="860" height="483" srcset="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/a-58.png?w=1324 1324w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/a-58.png?w=460 460w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/a-58.png?w=768 768w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/a-58.png?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C483 860w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/a-58.png?w=750 750w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/a-58.png?w=1140 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></p>
<p>This high NVT signal implies that SHIB&#8217;s market capitalization has surpassed its transaction volume, potentially pointing to an inflated state. This phenomenon could be indicative of the token reaching a market top, warranting vigilance from investors.</p>

<p>Shiba Inu&#8217;s breakout has evolved into a rallying force, breathing new life into the meme-inspired token and offering a glimmer of hope to holders. The journey from underwater to profitable has been a notable shift, underscoring the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[GMX, the native token powering GMX, a decentralized perpetual exchange for trading complex crypto derivatives, is under intense selling pressure when writing on August 11. Trackers show that the governance token is down 7% on the last trading day, pushing monthly losses to 24%. This downturn has seen prices tumble close to $40, a critical support level last printed in January and June 2023.  Whales Dumping, Prices Fall Despite this setback, DeFiLlama&#8217;s data is stable as GMX&#8217;s Total Value Locked (TVL) remains over $534 million. Most of the trading platform&#8217;s liquidity is locked in Arbitrum, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Additionally, another portion is locked on Avalanche, a fourth-generation Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform focused on decentralized finance (DeFi). The sell-off on August 11 coincides with actions by GMX &#8220;whales.&#8221; According to Lookonchain data, four whales sold 62,274 GMX worth $3 million. Address &#8220;0xb824&#8221; liquidated 19,786 GMX, translating to 514 ETH, and &#8220;0xa38a&#8221; sold 11,667 GMX for 305 ETH, losing $50,000 in the process. Meanwhile, &#8220;0X85b7&#8221; sold 20,000 GMX for 510 ETH, and &#8220;0x0b80&#8221; mirrored this move, dumping 10,820 GMX. Related Reading: Curve Finance Resurgence: 70% Of Stolen Funds Recovered, Redemption On The Horizon Whales are selling amid a constant decline in TVL in DeFi. This contraction can be traced to the general cool-off from late 2021, when crypto prices peaked before dropping in 2022, crashing on-chain activity, especially in DeFi. At spot rates, it is changing hands at $46, an almost 50% decline from $91 registered in Q2 of 2023. Even so, the token is up nearly 4X from its all-time low. Whales&#8217; action, nonetheless, could send ripples of uncertainty throughout the GMX and DeFi communities. Crypto traders actively keep track of whale activity. Usually, when they sell, as was the case today, it could sow fear, leading others to follow suit, heaping more pressure on prices. GMX Launches v2 Beta On August 6, GMX released the v2 version in beta on Arbitrum and Avalanche. The exchange said this version introduces several enhancements, including support for more assets, including XRP. With v2, users can also utilize diverse collateral types for trading positions while trading more quickly with reduced fees and lower slippage.  Related Reading: Did XRP Price Really Hit $50 On Gemini Exchange With v2, the exchange adds, is the introduction of isolated pools for liquidity providers to customize their exposure to preferred tokens.

					<description><![CDATA[Cardano (ADA), the blockchain platform renowned for its scalability and technological approach, has made significant strides in the crypto market, as highlighted by the recently released Messari report.  The report provides valuable insights into Cardano&#8217;s achievements in Q2 2023, solidifying its position as a prominent player within the industry.  With a strong focus on fostering a robust ecosystem and pushing the boundaries of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Cardano is poised to reshape the landscape of blockchain technology, according to Messari.  Cardano TVL Ranking Skyrockets, Climbs From 34th to 21st Per the report, Cardano experienced substantial growth in stablecoin value, with a 34.9% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase and a significant 382.1% year-to-date (YTD) surge.  Indigo Protocol emerged as a frontrunner in stablecoin and synthetic asset issuance, solidifying its dominance in the space. Furthermore, the Total Value Locked (TVL) witnessed a shift towards newer projects, as protocols created in the past six months accounted for 47.4% of TVL dominance in Q2.  Related Reading: Curve Finance Resurgence: 70% Of Stolen Funds Recovered, Redemption On The Horizon The TVL in USD rose by 9.7% QoQ and 198.6% YTD. Cardano&#8217;s TVL ranking climbed from 34th to 21st across all chains in 2023. On the other hand, average daily decentralized application (dapp) transactions on Cardano surged by 49% QoQ, marking the third consecutive quarterly increase. Moreover, Minswap, an automated market maker (AMM), showcased the largest absolute growth in transaction volume.  However, several new dapps also contributed to the overall surge. Minswap&#8217;s popularity soared in Q2, surpassing the leading NFT marketplace jpg.store regarding dapp transactions.  This trend aligned with the sectoral shift, as DeFi activity gained momentum while NFT activity experienced a decline. The overall increase in dapp transactions reached a substantial 49.0% QoQ, averaging 57,900 daily transactions. Q2 NFT Metrics Reflect Market Correction According to Messari, NFT metrics experienced a decline in Q2. Average daily NFT transactions dropped by 35.7% QoQ to 2,900, while the total quarterly trading volume fell by 41.9% QoQ to $46.2 million.  This downward trend aligned with the broader market, as even blue-chip collection floor prices declined in 2023.  Notably, NFT sales volume remained concentrated primarily in jpg.store, which dominated the marketplace with a 98% market share. Nevertheless, unique buyers continued to drive NFT activity, while a relatively small number of sellers catered to this larger pool of buyers. Messari further highlights that Cardano&#8217;s ecosystem showcased expansion in multiple sectors, particularly in DeFi. Protocols for swaps, stablecoins, synthetics, and unique Cardano-centric services like lending staking power surfaced alongside the incumbents.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rides On Bullish Waves As Shibarium Launch Nears, Buy Now? Cardano&#8217;s second quarter showed substantial growth and diversification across various sectors, including DeFi, NFTs, and Layer-2 solutions.  Key statistics revealed a surge in stablecoin value, a shift in TVL dominance towards newer projects, and an impressive increase in average daily dapp transactions.  While NFT metrics experienced a decline, the ecosystem demonstrated resilience and competition among protocols.  In contrast, Cardano&#8217;s native token, ADA, has been experiencing a decline in line with the broader market trend since April 15, after reaching its yearly peak of $0.4620. ADA is trading at $0.2933, reflecting a 1.4% decrease in the past 24 hours. Over the last fourteen days, it has declined nearly 6%.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin seems on the verge of seeing downside volatility during today’s trading session if bears can break current support. However, price action has been slow as all major narratives, including those from macroeconomic forces, have lost strength. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024/25: 4-Year Cycle And Elliot Wave Can Coexist As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $29,300 with sideways movement across the board. Low volatility has been suppressing BTC’s price action, a status quo that could persist until macroeconomic forces come back into the picture in September. Nassim Taleb Lashes Out At Bitcoin Again In the meantime, Bitcoin critics are using the drop in volatility, and trading volume, to support their arguments against the cryptocurrency. Wall Street operator, professor, and author Nassim Taleb stands among the latter. Via his X account, Taleb showed his almost 1 million followers the chart below pointing at the Bitcoin price and the decline in trading volume. Using the chart and the metric as a proxy to gauge Bitcoin adoption, Taleb stated: When I said pple lost interest in bitcoin, it was based on this: BTC Volume is slowly disappearing, down &#62;85% from the peak. As volume drops, manipulations become easier but, at some point, manipulators will need to exit. This is how Open Ponzis implode. The chart above shows BTC declining trading volume since 2020 when the cryptocurrency entered a rally that took it from a low of around $3,000 during a “Black Swan” event, the COVID-19 pandemic, to an all-time high of $69,000. At that time, similar to today, BTC and the crypto market spend years in a “Crypto Winter” with declining prices. Once the sector rallied, many jumped in on the action swelling the trading volume to an all-time high. In that sense, Taleb seems to be hinting at a downside for the price of the cryptocurrency following a rise in price with low trading volume, which often leads to a decline. One crypto investor tried to show Taleb a different version of the chart above, which goes back to 2014 when the cryptocurrency was trading just above $100. The user pointed out that BTC has seen periods of volatile volumes as the cryptocurrency became a mainstream asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Next Leg Lower Underway And At Risk for Key Reasons However, Taleb dismissed the user with the following: Imbecile, if you knew how to read the chart you&#8217;d see only now a rise in price WITH DROP in volume.

<h2>Nassim Taleb Lashes Out At Bitcoin Again</h2>
<p>In the meantime, Bitcoin critics are using the drop in volatility, and trading volume, to support their arguments against the cryptocurrency. Wall Street operator, professor, and author Nassim Taleb stands among the latter.</p>
<p>Via his X account, Taleb showed his almost 1 million followers the chart below pointing at the Bitcoin price and the decline in trading volume. Using the chart and the metric as a proxy to gauge Bitcoin adoption, Taleb <a href="https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1689974862587006976" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I said pple lost interest in bitcoin, it was based on this: BTC Volume is slowly disappearing, down &gt;85% from the peak. As volume drops, manipulations become easier but, at some point, manipulators will need to exit. This is how Open Ponzis implode.</p></blockquote>

<p>The chart above shows BTC declining trading volume since 2020 when the cryptocurrency entered a rally that took it from a low of around $3,000 during a “Black Swan” event, the COVID-19 pandemic, to an all-time high of $69,000.</p>
<p>At that time, similar to today, BTC and the crypto market spend years in a “Crypto Winter” with declining prices. Once the sector rallied, many jumped in on the action swelling the trading volume to an all-time high.</p>
<p>In that sense, Taleb seems to be hinting at a downside for the price of the cryptocurrency following a rise in price with low trading volume, which often leads to a decline.</p>
<p>One crypto investor <a href="https://twitter.com/BelisariusT/status/1689977703049388032" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">tried</a> to show Taleb a different version of the chart above, which goes back to 2014 when the cryptocurrency was trading just above $100. The user pointed out that BTC has seen periods of volatile volumes as the cryptocurrency became a mainstream asset.</p>

<p>However, Taleb dismissed the user with the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Imbecile, if you knew how to read the chart you&#8217;d see only now a rise in price WITH DROP in volume.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Black Swan author has been a Bitcoin critic, comparing the cryptocurrency with a “cult” and predicting that the sector <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/crypto-bitcoin-price-ai-boom-tech-stocks-taleb-black-swan-2023-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will eventually “fade.&#8221;</a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Curve Finance (CRV), a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, announced significant progress in its recovery efforts following a recent hack that resulted in losing $73.5 million across several projects within its factory pools.  The attack on July 30 exploited a critical security flaw known as a &#8220;reentrancy vulnerability,&#8221; allowing malicious actors to drain funds from Curve&#8217;s smart contracts. Curve Finance Commits To Restitution Process For Hacked Funds In a significant effort, Curve Finance has successfully retrieved 70% of the funds affected by the hack. While this achievement marks an important milestone, an active investigation is underway to recover the remaining balance and hold the perpetrators accountable. Related Reading: Kraken Surges Ahead In Altcoin Liquidity To Overtake Coinbase In US: Kaiko Understanding the gravity of the situation, Curve Finance has also taken proactive measures to ensure a fair and transparent distribution of the recovered funds to affected users. The protocol is diligently working to measure the respective shares of each impacted account, aiming to facilitate an equitable restitution process that prioritizes user protection and trust restoration. Curve Finance&#8217;s recovery efforts are further bolstered by their recent announcement of a $1.85 million bounty. This generous reward will be granted to anyone who can provide accurate information leading to the identification and apprehension of the attackers holding the remaining funds.  By offering this substantial bounty, Curve Finance actively encourages community participation and collaboration to expedite the investigation and bring the perpetrators to justice. Curve’s Post-Hack Safety Report Following a thorough investigation, Curve Finance discovered that the exploit primarily targeted the aleth, peth, mseth, and crveth pools.  The vulnerability stemmed from a bug within the vyper 0.2.15-0.3.0 version, which the protocol promptly identified as the root cause of the breach. By swiftly pinpointing the issue, Curve Finance was able to take immediate action to mitigate any further risk to its users.

It is important to note that all other pools on Curve Finance have been confirmed as safe and unaffected by the exploit, according to Curve&#8217;s update. This assurance gives users the confidence to continue utilizing the platform, knowing that their funds remain secure within these pools. Alongside the technical remediation, Curve Finance collaborates with security experts, auditors, and the broader DeFi community to conduct thorough audits and implement additional security measures.  This collaborative approach aims to reinforce the protocol&#8217;s resilience and prevent similar incidents in the future. Overall, Curve Finance&#8217;s recovery of 70% of the hacked funds, coupled with its ongoing investigation and bounty initiative, underlines the protocol&#8217;s commitment to user protection and the broader DeFi community.  According to Token Terminal data, Curve Finance&#8217;s circulating market cap currently stands at $518.76 million, reflecting a decrease of 22.29% over the analyzed period.  The fully diluted market cap, which represents the potential future market value of the project, is estimated at $1.97 billion. Curve Finance&#8217;s total value locked (TVL), a crucial indicator of the protocol&#8217;s popularity and user engagement, currently amounts to $2.44 billion. Despite a decline of 35.19% over the analyzed period, Curve Finance maintains a substantial TVL, highlighting its significance within the DeFi landscape.

					<description><![CDATA[Curve DAO (CRV) has continued to decline recently. Here&#8217;s what on-chain data says regarding if a rebound is probable for the coin anytime soon. What Curve DAO Metrics Hint At Regarding Futures Price Action In a new insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has recently discussed how the underlying metrics related to CRV have looked. The first relevant metric here is the &#8220;Supply Distribution,&#8221; which tells us the percentage of the Curve DAO supply each investor group holds. In particular, the cohort of interest here holds between 10,000 and 100 million tokens of the asset. This is an extensive range covering the likes of the sharks and whales. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the holdings of this CRV group over the past year: Looks like the value of the metric has sharply gone up recently &#124; Source: Santiment As displayed in the above graph, the indicator&#8217;s value has shot up recently, implying that sizeable Curve DAO investors, such as the sharks and whales, have sharply expanded their reserves. About two weeks back, these holders had been carrying a combined 33% of the circulating supply, but today that value has risen to 41%. &#8220;This is a massive ascension and is now the most by far that these sharks and whales have held in well over a year,&#8221; notes Santiment. Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Volume Remains Extremely High, More Gains Ahead? This accumulation from these key investors has come right after the big plunge that Curve DAO observed, suggesting that they find the current levels a worthy buying opportunity. Naturally, this is a positive sign for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. The next indicator of interest here is the &#8220;whale transaction count,&#8221; which keeps track of the total number of CRV transfers happening on the chain carrying a value of more than $100,000. The value of this metric seems to have been relatively low recently &#124; Source: Santiment When Curve Dao had observed its plunge earlier, the value of this indicator had registered a sharp spike. This means that the whales had been actively making moves back then. Since then, however, the metric&#8217;s value has returned to normal, suggesting that these humongous investors aren&#8217;t showing any extraordinary activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Surges, Recovery Being Driven By US Investors? As these investors had made many transfers earlier for selling purposes, the indicator calming down could imply that this cohort has stopped applying selling pressure. &#8220;With prices still significantly lower than two weeks ago, a follow-up whale transaction spike may be a foreshadow to a quick recovery,&#8221; explains the on-chain analytics firm. CRV has been at relatively high levels recently in terms of the development activity (that is, the amount of work that the Curve DAO developers have been putting into the public GitHub repository). The indicator has seen some high values recently &#124; Source: Santiment Generally, a high development activity implies that the coin is still being backed by its developers, which can be one of the signs to look out for to know if a project is still alive and kicking. Santiment said: By no means is 10-14 notable GitHub submissions per day breaking any records, but it is indicative of a team that is still looking to innovate, improve, and move past the recent FUD news that negatively impacted the crowd&#8217;s perceptions of it. CRV Price Curve DAO is trading around $0.59 at the time of writing, down 3% in the last week.

					<description><![CDATA[On August 10, the price of XRP inexplicably spiked for a brief moment on the Gemini exchange. For a moment, the price of XRP reached an astounding $50 per coin before quickly crashing back down to the same level on spot markets on other exchanges. Brief Price Surge On Gemini According to various posts on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), it would seem that Gemini experienced a technical issue that caused the XRP price displayed on their exchange to show an erroneous price of $50. During that time, however, XRP was trading around only $0.63.  Related Reading: Bittrex, SEC Reach Settlement In Securities Violation Case It would appear as if Gemini is currently experiencing a thin order book after recently relisting XRP on its spot markets. Users have posted screenshots on social media of the token&#8217;s price on the exchange rising above $1 several times. However, the exchange has since updated its chart to make it look like the cryptocurrency only spiked to $1.50. Gemini updates XRP chart to reflect $1.50 spike &#124; Source: Gemini The bump, which took a few seconds to correct, was likely a result of low liquidity. According to crypto trading expert Ali Martinez, the liquidity was so low that only a $37,000 order was enough to move XRP prices on the exchange by 2%. $XRP hit $50 on @Gemini, but now they have updated their charts to make it seems like #XRP hit $1.60. 😅 Still, the market depth on this #crypto exchange is very low. Only a $37,000 order is required to move #Ripple prices by 2%. pic.twitter.com/k5u2GV5PnH — Ali (@ali_charts) August 11, 2023 Another observer also mentioned that a user had accidentally put up a sell order for a lot of tokens at $50, spiking up the price on Gemini in the process. A price swing of that magnitude seems highly impossible without any major news or event driving widespread interest in XRP.  Following this, as of the time of writing, the exchange has announced it has put its platform into full site maintenance. the order book is very thin, i have been watching all day, at one point there was nothing for sale, someone put a lot to sell at $50.00 and someone must have fat fingered a market order and then they were the proud owner of $50 XRP, this was from a few hours ago pic.twitter.com/W5AoG2eV0r — John S (@lifebythedrop63) August 11, 2023 Token price trending at $0.63 &#124; Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Relisting XRP Gemini is the latest exchange to relist XRP after Ripple&#8217;s partial victory in court against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Due to regulatory concerns, the token was initially delisted on various exchanges after the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple in 2020.  However, US Judge Analisa Torress ruled in July that XRP sales to the general public are not in violation of federal laws, so many of these crypto exchanges have gone ahead to relist XRP on their platforms. Related Reading: New Milestone For Ethereum Could Spell Good News For ETH Price Other crypto exchanges that have also moved to relist the token since the ruling include Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.6311, up by 33.09% in the past month. Despite the initial euphoria community members may have experienced due to the Gemini glitch, the Ripple ecosystem still has a long way to go before XRP can actually hit $50 on the open market.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On August 10, the price of XRP inexplicably spiked for a brief moment on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/gemini-and-genesis-owner-barry-silbert-go-to-court/" rel="nofollow">Gemini exchange</a>. For a moment, the price of XRP reached an astounding $50 per coin before quickly crashing back down to the same level on spot markets on other exchanges.</p>
<h2>Brief Price Surge On Gemini</h2>
<p>According to various posts on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), it would seem that Gemini experienced a technical issue that caused the XRP price displayed on their exchange to show an erroneous price of $50. During that time, however, XRP was trading around only $0.63. </p>

<p>It would appear as if Gemini is currently experiencing a thin order book after recently relisting XRP on its spot markets. Users have posted screenshots on social media of the token&#8217;s price on the exchange rising above $1 several times. However, the exchange has since updated its chart to make it look like the cryptocurrency only spiked to $1.50.</p>

<p>The bump, which took a few seconds to correct, was likely a result of low liquidity. According to crypto trading expert Ali Martinez, the liquidity was so low that only a $37,000 order was enough to move XRP prices on the exchange by 2%.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24XRP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$XRP</a> hit $50 on <a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@Gemini</a>, but now they have updated their charts to make it seems like <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XRP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#XRP</a> hit $1.60. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f605.png" alt="😅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Still, the market depth on this <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/crypto?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#crypto</a> exchange is very low.

<p>Another observer also mentioned that a user had accidentally put up a sell order for a lot of tokens at $50, spiking up the price on Gemini in the process. A price swing of that magnitude seems highly impossible without any major news or event driving widespread interest in XRP. </p>
<p>Following this, as of the time of writing, the exchange has announced it has put its platform into full site maintenance.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">the order book is very thin, i have been watching all day, at one point there was nothing for sale, someone put a lot to sell at $50.00 and someone must have fat fingered a market order and then they were the proud owner of $50 XRP, this was from a few hours ago <a href="https://t.co/W5AoG2eV0r" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/W5AoG2eV0r</a></p>

<h2>Relisting XRP</h2>
<p>Gemini is the latest exchange to relist XRP after <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-attorney-withdraws-from-sec-lawsuit/">Ripple&#8217;s partial victory</a> in court against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Due to regulatory concerns, the token was initially delisted on various exchanges after the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple in 2020. </p>
<p>However, US Judge Analisa Torress <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-judge-deems-xrp-sale-non-investment-contract/" rel="nofollow">ruled</a> in July that XRP sales to the general public are not in violation of federal laws, so many of these crypto exchanges have gone ahead to relist XRP on their platforms.</p>

<p>Other crypto exchanges that have also moved to relist the token since the ruling include <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/large-exchanges-relist-xrp/">Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.6311, up by 33.09% in the past month. Despite the initial euphoria community members may have experienced due to the Gemini glitch, the Ripple ecosystem still has a long way to go before XRP can actually hit $50 on the open market.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Worldcoin, the brainchild of OpenAI’s Sam Altman, made its official entrance into the world of cryptocurrencies in July. At first, things went smoothly as the euphoria from the launch grew. But this would only be short-lived because regulators began to pay close attention to Worldcoin’s data collection activities. In the last couple of weeks, regulators in various jurisdictions have brought Worldcoin under a microscope, significantly impacting the price of its native token, WLD. Regulatory Concerns Engulfs Worldcoin Not too long after its launch, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin first raised alarm about Worldcoin’s technology. According to Buterin, there were major privacy and security concerns, highlighting that user data collected using Worldcoin’s orbs could be prone to abuse.

In light of this, the Kenyan government launched a crackdown on the firm, leading to a temporary pause of its activities in the country. Worldcoin’s problems didn’t end there as Germany’s Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision (BayLDA) also launched an investigation. The regulator’s concern centered on Worldcoin’s data processing practices and how it was transferring information. Most recently, the company has come under fire in Argentina where regulators are currently investigating its operations in the country. This is in addition to regulators in the United Kingdom and France also questioning Worldcoin’s data handling practices. Can WLD Price Recover From This? In light of the increased regulatory scrutiny around Worldcoin, its native WLD token has naturally suffered. WLD’s price has been on a consistent decline following its initial price pump on launch day, falling double-digits in the last few weeks. With so many investigations into the activities of the company, it is likely that this downtrend will continue. And if lawsuits were to result from these investigations, then WLD price could suffer the same fate as XRP following the SEC lawsuit back in 2020.

This signals growing interest in the coin which could lead to a price recovery. But such a recovery would only be short-lived as long as the uncertainties surrounding Worldcoin remain. Over the last 24 hours, the price of WLD has fallen 6.79% to trade at 1.7 at the time of this writing. It is recording losses of 25.64% on the weekly chart, but meager gains of 1.72% on the 30-day chart.
