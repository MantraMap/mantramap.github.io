<p class="md-end-block md-p">Yesterday May 4th (aka Star Wars Day), NFT startup Cryptoys unveiled their newest NFT collection based on the massive media franchise.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The announcement follows the company's successful collaboration with toy brand Mattel on the Masters of the Universe collections.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The Star Wars NFTs, priced at $39.99 each, will be minted on the Flow blockchain, which hosts popular collectibles platforms like NBA Top Shot and NFL All Day. Each NFT will have one of five stylized skin designs and will be available in "Common," "Rare," "Legendary," "Grail," and "Ultra Grail" rarity levels. The collectibles will be presented in Star Wars-inspired digital "holocrons," a reference to the data storage devices used in the film franchise. Buyers will receive a "blind box" pack, meaning they won't know which character they've purchased until they open it.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Cryptoys&rsquo; Star Wars NFT collection is set to drop on May 24. The collection will be minted in the Flow blockchain, which has been recently stirring up news as a potentially revolutionary NFT ecosystem. Flow is notable for being the home of the successful NBA Top Shot NFTs. Back in November 2022, longtime toymaker Mattel released their own NFT marketplace on Flow. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This Star Wars NFT collection is not the first of its kind though. VeVe, a digital collectibles platform featuring NFTs from various Disney and Marvel properties, has previously released sets containing 3D digital models, digital posters, and comic book covers related to the Star Wars universe. With the upcoming launch of Cryptoys' Star Wars NFT collection, fans of the franchise will have yet another opportunity to own unique digital collectibles inspired by their favorite characters.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The bear cycle of 2022 has been generally bad for crypto, and NFTs were not spared. Meta announced their abandonment of their NFT projects just last March. However, a potentially new market would be NFT toys. Mattel has been steadily expanding its own digital ecosystem, despite giants like Disney and Walmart pulling out.Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.
