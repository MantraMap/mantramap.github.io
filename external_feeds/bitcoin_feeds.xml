The move comes as traders continue to react to Binance’s decision to approve the coin as a collateral asset, in addition to the upcoming launch of Shibarium. Dogecoin also snapped its recent losing streak today.</strong></p>
<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h2>
<p>Shiba inu (SHIB) jumped to a three-month high on Saturday, with prices surging by as much as 10%.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.000008551 on Friday, SHIB/USD surged to a peak of $0.000009509 earlier in today’s session.</p>
<p>This resulted in the meme coin climbing to its strongest point since May 6, when price reached a high of $0.00001007.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the move comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved past a resistance level of 67.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 73.62, which is its highest level since February.</p>
<p>Should momentum continue throughout the weekend, the next target for bulls is likely to be a ceiling at $0.00001025.</p>

<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>In addition to SHIB, dogecoin (DOGE) also rose higher today, snapping a three-day losing streak in the process.</p>
<p>DOGE/USD rallied to a high at $0.07628, less than 24 hours after the meme coin was at a low of $0.07279.</p>
<p>As a result of this surge in price, DOGE is now trading at its highest point since Wednesday, after breaking out of a resistance zone of $0.0760.</p>

<p>This coincided with the RSI moving past its own ceiling at the 52.00 mark. It is currently at a reading of 55.84.</p>
<p>Despite today’s rally, dogecoin is still trading nearly 3% lower than at the same point last weekend.</p>

Ethereum neared a multi-week low.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) dropped to below the $29,000 level on Saturday, as traders continued to digest the latest nonfarm payrolls report.</p>
<p>Following a high of $29,302.08 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD slipped to a bottom of $28,885.34 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>This was the first time since Tuesday that the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency had fallen below $29,000.</p>

<p>Saturday&#x2019;s decline came as the relative strength index (RSI) moved to a long-term support level at 42.00.</p>
<p>The index is currently tracking marginally below this point, as bears attempt to maintain the current downward momentum.</p>
<p>However, price has since consolidated, and as of writing is trading above today&#x2019;s low, with a current price of $29,022.59.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) remained above the $1,800 level, despite bearish sentiment intensifying on Saturday.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,817.41 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, following a peak of $1,847.91 the day prior.</p>
<p>The decline saw ethereum drop close to Tuesday&#x2019;s low at $1,812, which was the weakest point the cryptocurrency had hit since June 21.</p>

<p>This latest downturn comes as price strength moved below a key support point at the 43.00 mark.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 41.57.</p>

Kenya&#8217;s ICT Minister Eliud Owalo has said Worldcoin&#8217;s verification services were being carried out within the confines of the law.</strong></p>
<h2>Worldcoin Activities Not in Breach of Kenyan Laws</h2>
<p>Alex Blania, the co-founder and CEO of Worldcoin’s founding entity Tools for Humanity (TFH), announced on Aug. 2 that his organization had &#8220;paused World ID verifications in Kenya.&#8221; According to Blania, this move gives his organization time to address some of the concerns raised by Kenyan regulators.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">TFH has paused World ID verifications in Kenya as we continue to work with local regulators to address their questions. We apologize to everyone in Kenya for the delay.</p>
<p>World ID is built for privacy. We look forward to resuming operations, while continuing global rollout.</p>
<p>&mdash; Alex Blania (@alexblania) <a href="https://twitter.com/alexblania/status/1686846072901996544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The remarks by Blania follow reports that the Kenyan government has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kenyan-government-says-it-has-suspended-worldcoin-activities/">suspended</a> Worldcoin activities over public safety concerns. Before the government decided to suspend Worldcoin’s activities, the Kenyan data regulator <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kenyan-data-regulator-issues-warning-as-residents-rush-to-get-worldcoins-free-money/">warned</a> residents against giving away their details via TFH’s eye scanners which are also known as &#8220;Orbs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite facing heat from regulators and government officials, TFH’s crypto project appears to have won the backing of the country’s ICT minister, Eliud Owalo. In remarks made on the day Worldcoin’s activities were suspended, Owalo insisted that Blania’s organization was &#8220;acting within the law.&#8221; The ICT minister also pointed to the fact that most Kenyan participants were not being forced to share their details.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<h2>Mitigating Crowd Volumes</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, in an apparent response to concerns raised by the Kenyan government when it announced the suspension of Worldcoin’s activities, Blania suggested that his organization is pro-privacy.</p>
<p>&#8220;World ID is built for privacy. We look forward to resuming operations while continuing global rollout,&#8221; Blania said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/alexblania/status/1686846072901996544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1686846072901996544%7Ctwgr%5Eebf06a01e10226394a00784028b46d5865f732eb%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2023%2F08%2F03%2Fworldcoin-plans-to-resume-iris-scans-in-kenya%2F">tweet</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in addition to Blania’s tweet, the Worldcoin team released a statement in which they also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/worldcoin-plans-to-resume-iris-scans-in-kenya/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMfPA6pIpqUWe-CzV592VpYen1_C8wEVK6DV5xPD-5NylMdXJVy1ivs-PYhvnoiZW648qnrA7rsMuYwTewCq0S83lHYALQqMnFto0lnHw6nzz8es2c0viUdg9ItkRaAtfTt_lyclLKEhntvKysBtA6mC3Hn6_9tEm2rHggXglcl8">confirm</a> the temporary pause of verification services in the East African country. The team, however, characterizes the pause as a step it took &#8220;to mitigate crowd volume.&#8221;</p>

In a blog post, the protocol also announced that the Base mainnet deployment was slated for August 9, allowing free access to developers to launch their apps on top of it.</strong></p>&#13;
<h2>Base Opens Ethereum Bridging, Announces Mainnet Launch</h2>&#13;
<p>Base, the Ethereum L2 (layer 2) scaling layer built by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-sec-asked-coinbase-to-delist-all-crypto-assets-except-bitcoin-prior-to-filing-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://base.mirror.xyz/h028XVTdP7QtZZfWAHuJ9OYmMNs0Fyi4e4fJZH_5ik4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it will open its mainnet on August 9, allowing apps to be deployed by any developer interested in the network. Also, to prepare for this launch, the protocol has already opened access to <a href="https://bridge.base.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bridge</a> selected ERC-20 tokens to the Base layer from Ethereum.</p>&#13;
<p>At launch, the bridge only allows bridging ethereum, Coinbase staked ethereum, dai, and USDC, to Base. The bridge also processes withdrawals of the same assets to Ethereum. However, more options could be added in the future. Base is already part of the <a href="https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top ten</a> scaling solutions with the most value locked according to L2beat, a protocol aggregator.</p>&#13;
<p>With the Ethereum bridge opening, Base has reached its peak value, <a href="https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/base" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registering</a> more than $92 million in total value locked (TVL). The network also experienced an explosion in its TVL due to the issuance of meme token bald on June 30, which started a rally that allowed its value to rise 40,000% in just 48 hours, only to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/08/03/15-billion-withdrawn-from-defi-following-curve-bald-and-base-hacks/?sh=6e9c8b5f3389" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fall</a> to its launch levels shortly after.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h2>The &#x2018;Onchain Summer&#x2019;</h2>&#13;
<p>Also, as part of the launch of the new L2 chain, the protocol will be sponsoring the &#x201C;Onchain Summer,&#x201D; <a href="https://base.mirror.xyz/h028XVTdP7QtZZfWAHuJ9OYmMNs0Fyi4e4fJZH_5ik4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defined</a> by Base as &#x201C;a month-long on-chain festival put on by 50 of the best builders, brands, products, artists, and creators,&#x201D; giving users something to do on-chain &#x201C;highlighting art, music, gaming, advocacy, and more.&#x201D;</p>&#13;
<p>The full lineup of collaborators for this event will be announced on August 9. Nonetheless, Coinbase has posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1687087044579966976?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a> linking this event with brand names such as Coca-Cola and Atari, and well-known cryptocurrency names like Opensea, Pixelmon, and Optimism.</p>&#13;
<p>Also, the protocol will use 100 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> to give grants to developers and builders in partnership with Prop House, an infrastructure platform that allows users to assign capital to creators.</p>&#13;
<p>These grants will be directed to various activities related to Base, including delivering art, building innovative apps and protocols, defending and advocating crypto, advocating for sensible legislation, and building applications using <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/account-abstraction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">account abstraction</a>.</p>&#13;

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro explained that he hoped for a positive reception of the proposal by the nations that are part of the bloc.</strong></p>
<h2>Venezuela Officially Applies to Enter BRICS</h2>
<p>Nicolas Maduro, President of Venezuela, announced that the government had already presented an official application to join the BRICS bloc, comprised of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. In a weekly TV program &#8220;Con Maduro Mas,&#8221; Maduro detailed that Venezuela hopes to join the organization to &#8220;learn, support and help&#8221; grow the bloc&#8217;s vision.</p>
<p>Maduro <a href="https://www.telesurtv.net/news/venezuela-solicita-incorporacion-brics-20230801-0016.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Venezuela made its proposal to join the group and we hope it will be positively valued by the nations that integrate it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maduro praised the role of the BRICS bloc in the international geopolitical arena, declaring that it constituted &#8220;the driving force behind the emergence of the multipolar world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Delcy Rodriguez, vice president of the country, <a href="https://sputniknews.lat/20230803/venezuela-formaliza-la-peticion-de-ingreso-del-pais-a-los-brics-1142234228.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that this application puts Venezuela close to developing new ways of economic cooperation &#8220;away from the unilateral hegemonism.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is expected BRICS will consider adding new members in the next <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-invites-69-leaders-to-august-summit-western-countries-omitted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">summit</a> to be held in South Africa later this month.</p>

<h2>Venezuela&#8217;s Path to BRICS</h2>
<p>Venezuela&#8217;s intention of trying to enter the BRICS bloc had been revealed by Maduro before. During an official visit to Brazil in May, Maduro stated that Venezuela wished to join the bloc to &#8220;accompany the construction of this new architecture, of the new world that is already being born.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the time, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio &#8216;Lula&#8217; da Silva <a href="https://www.europapress.es/internacional/noticia-lula-defiende-ingreso-venezuela-grupo-brics-20230529221743.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed</a> Maduro&#8217;s intentions, declaring that he favored Venezuela joining BRICS. He said Venezuela&#8217;s application would be discussed alongside other requests during the next BRICS meeting.</p>
<p>China and Russia also took Venezuela&#8217;s interest positively. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told <a href="https://sputniknews.lat/20230531/rusia-ve-intencion-de-venezuela-de-unirse-a-brics-como-evidencia-de-la-autoridad-del-grupo-1140059862.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sputnik</a> that they welcomed &#8220;the early integration of the largest possible number of party partners to the great BRICS family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Russian foreign minister for Latin America, Alexandr Schetinin, commented that Maduro&#8217;s statements reflected the &#8220;growing authority that the BRICS are acquiring in the current international situation due to his point of view of what is happening.&#8221;</p>

The milestone has been reached despite increased regulatory pressure on the world’s largest trading platform for digital assets in the past few months.</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Exchange Binance Adds 30 Million Users in a Year</h2>
<p>The biggest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume, , now has 150 million registered users, its chief executive unveiled in a tweet on Thursday. In the post, CZ also marked some of the company’s recent successes that came amid heightened regulatory scrutiny of its business operations around the world.</p>
<p>This year, Binance has been targeted by authorities in a number of its established markets. In the U.S., it’s involved in legal battles with the country’s securities and derivatives commissions, which <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-sued-by-cftc-for-alleged-violations-of-trading-and-derivatives-rules/">sued</a> it for breaking laws in their respective fields.</p>
<p>In Europe, the exchange is under <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/french-investigation-targets-binance-allegations-of-money-laundering-and-regulatory-violations/">investigation</a> by French prosecutors for money laundering and was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-ordered-to-cease-all-crypto-services-in-belgium/">ordered</a> by Belgium’s financial watchdog to cease providing crypto services in the country. It also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-withdraws-its-crypto-license-application-in-germany/">withdrew</a> its license applications and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-unit-in-britain-cancels-uk-regulatory-authorization/">canceled</a> its registrations in several countries.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>Despite the challenges on both sides of the Atlantic, Binance has been able to grow its user base by 30 million in the past year. Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu noted in a <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1687064530239778816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> that in July 2022 the exchange said the number of its registered users had exceeded 120 million.</p>
<p>The blogger, better known by his Twitter handle, Wu Blockchain, also quoted data from web analytics firm Similarweb, according to which Binance’s top five sources of traffic in the last three months have been Turkey, Vietnam, Russia, Argentina, and India.</p>
<p>Besides the lawsuits filed by regulators, a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-reportedly-investigated-in-us-for-russia-sanctions-violations/">probe</a> by the U.S. Department of Justice is looking into whether the crypto trading platform has been used by Russians to circumvent sanctions imposed on their country over its military invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>While amid this regulatory crackdown, the market share of Binance’s U.S. subsidiary <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-us-market-share-shrinks-amid-legal-battle-with-sec/">shrank</a> significantly, a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-is-illegal-in-china-binance-does-90-billion-of-business-there-anyway-2a0af975" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> by the Wall Street Journal revealed on Tuesday that Binance users in China exchanged $90 billion of crypto assets in a month, making the country its biggest market. That’s despite a ban on crypto trading since 2021.</p>
<p>In his tweet, CEO Changpeng Zhao also highlighted some of his company’s recent successes. Binance is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-japan-to-launch-with-34-listed-cryptocurrencies/">restoring full services</a> in Japan this month, following the acquisition of a locally registered and regulated exchange in November 2022. It also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-obtains-dubai-license-to-provide-crypto-exchange-services/">obtained a license</a> to provide crypto services in and from Dubai.</p>

<h2>Impact of Fitch&#8217;s Rating Downgrade on US Dollar</h2>
<p>Several economists have offered their perspectives on the adverse effects stemming from Fitch Ratings&#8217; decision to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/white-house-yellen-slam-fitchs-us-rating-downgrade-biden-officials-call-it-bizarre-and-baseless/">downgrade</a> the long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating of the United States from AAA to AA+. Fitch Ratings is one of the top three credit rating agencies in the U.S.</p>
<p>Citic Securities&#8217; chief economist, Ming Ming, told the Global Times on Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amid the increasingly complex geopolitical situation today, more and more countries have started the de-dollarization process and Fitch&#8217;s downgrade of the U.S. rating may accelerate that process.</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to Fitch Ratings&#8217; downgrade, both the White House and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen released <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/white-house-yellen-slam-fitchs-us-rating-downgrade-biden-officials-call-it-bizarre-and-baseless/">statements</a> expressing strong disagreement with the decision. Yellen asserted that the change was &#8220;arbitrary and based on outdated data&#8221; while officials from the Biden administration called Fitch&#8217;s downgrade decision &#8220;bizarre and baseless.&#8221;</p>
<p>A growing number of nations globally are actively working to decrease their dependence on the U.S. dollar, particularly after the U.S. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dollar-to-play-lesser-role-due-to-its-weaponization-digital-currencies-economist-jeffrey-sachs-says/">weaponized</a> its currency. Leading the efforts towards de-dollarization are the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). The economic bloc has been pushing for the use of national currencies in trade settlements. De-dollarization is expected to be among the major topics discussed at the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currency-not-on-agenda-for-leaders-summit-nations-to-focus-on-de-dollarization/">BRICS leaders&#8217; summit</a> that will take place on Aug. 22-24.</p>
<p>“The negative effect of U.S. monetary policy on the world economy is very significant … some countries have been badly hurt by the U.S. monetary tightening,&#8221; Lian Ping, chief economist of Zhixin Investment, told the news outlet.</p>
<p>The chief economist added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fitch&#8217;s downgrade of its credit rating may also be a part of the gradual decline of the U.S. dollar system.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Schiff on US Rating Downgrade, Crash, Dollar Collapse</h2>
<p>Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff warned of a U.S. dollar collapse and the challenges faced by the U.S. economy in a series of tweets this week. His warnings come after Fitch Ratings <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/white-house-yellen-slam-fitchs-us-rating-downgrade-biden-officials-call-it-bizarre-and-baseless/">downgraded</a> the United States&#8217; long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating from AAA to AA+. Fitch is one of the three largest credit rating agencies in the U.S.</p>
<p>Noting that “Fitch downgrading U.S. Treasuries to AA+ from AAA is meaningless, as Treasuries are junk bonds,” Schiff tweeted on Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>When it comes to rating sovereign credit, the primary risk is currency depreciation, not default. Given the trajectory of U.S. government deficit spending, a dollar collapse is inevitable.</p></blockquote>
<p>The rating firm also replaced the &#8220;negative watch&#8221; it <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fitch-maintains-negative-watch-on-us-rating-despite-debt-limit-resolution/">previously placed</a> on the U.S. and assigned a “stable outlook” instead. In a follow-up tweet, Schiff wrote: “Even more ridiculous is that Fitch has the [U.S.] outlook as &#8216;stable.'&#8221;</p>
<p>In another tweet, the economist opined: &#8220;Credit ratings don&#8217;t matter as the U.S. probably won&#8217;t default, but a soaring national debt does matter as the U.S. will print, driving down the value of the dollar. That reduces the real value of Treasuries. If we get hyperinflation that is basically the equivalent of default.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schiff also cautioned that the U.S. economy is on a course toward a crash. The gold bug explained that rising Treasury yields will lead to &#8220;larger federal budget deficits, a weaker economy, a falling dollar, rising current account deficits, higher unemployment, lower stock &amp; real estate prices, a financial crisis, ramped up QE, and higher inflation.&#8221;</p>
<p>He tweeted on Thursday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Treasuries are collapsing as oil prices surge &#8230; Once the dollar falls with Treasuries and gold rises with oil, the party is over. Say goodbye to a soft-landing and brace for impact. Recession + higher inflation = crash.</p></blockquote>

Sorry for the bad news,&#8221; Kiyosaki said.</strong></p>
<h2>Robert Kiyosaki&#8217;s Crash Landing Warning</h2>
<p>The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, has reiterated his warning about the U.S. economy heading for a “crash landing.” His cautionary message followed the decision by Fitch Ratings, one of the top three credit rating agencies in the U.S., to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/white-house-yellen-slam-fitchs-us-rating-downgrade-biden-officials-call-it-bizarre-and-baseless/">downgrade</a> the U.S. debt rating from AAA to AA+.</p>
<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.</p>
<p>Kiyosaki tweeted Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>First shoe to drop. Fitch rating services downgrades U.S. credit rating from AAA to AA+. Brace for crash landing. Sorry for the bad news yet I have been warning for over a year the Fed, Treasury, big corp CEOs have smoking fantasy weed. Take care.</p></blockquote>
<p>The famous author has been warning about an impending economic crash for quite some time. In May, he stated that he believes the U.S. economy is headed for a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-us-economy-headed-for-crash-landing-financial-pandemic-started-corruption-high/">crash landing</a>, rather than a soft landing or a hard landing as some economists have suggested. Last month, he said that a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosakis-warnings-giant-crash-incoming-end-of-us-dollar-approaching/">giant crash is coming</a> and the end of the U.S. dollar is approaching. He emphasized that he still recommends gold, silver, and bitcoin, noting that these three investments are the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-about-stocks-bonds-mutual-funds-says-bitcoin-best-for-unstable-times/">best for unstable times</a>.</p>
<p>This week, Kiyosaki said the U.S. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-us-economy-not-strong-america-broke-says-he-still-prefers-bitcoin/">economy is not strong</a> and America is broke. He further predicts an<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-more-banks-are-about-to-fail/"> increase in bank failures</a>, attributing blame to the Biden administration and the Federal Reserve for destroying regional banks. Kiyosaki warned that regional banks are being <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-regional-banks-are-being-wiped-out-calls-fed-criminal/">wiped out</a> due to Fed policies. Moreover, he anticipates that the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) will introduce a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-us-dollar-will-die-citing-brics-nations-plan-to-launch-gold-backed-currency/">common currency</a> that will kill the U.S. dollar.</p>
