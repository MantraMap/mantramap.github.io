At the time of writing, there are indications of a potential market recovery, at least the major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum are posting decent gains. Aptos (APT) is one of the tokens that is expected to experience an increase in bullishness and price. Although APT‚Äôs gains are minuscule at 1.7% in the last 24 hours, the project&#8217;s partnerships and on-chain developments point to a somewhat rosy picture. APT price rose to $8.30 at the time of writing, contributing highly to this bullish momentum. Source: Coingecko Related Reading: Shiba Inu All Green Today ‚Äì What‚Äôs The Energy Behind The Glow?
