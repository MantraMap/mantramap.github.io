<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/rolls-royce-2022-sales-118-year-record/">Rolls-Royce 2022 Sales Surge to 118-Year Record High</a></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Rolls-Royce recently </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/rolls-royce-rides-ongoing-luxury-104307619.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">revealed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> record annual sales and a strong order book spearheaded by buyers from the Middle East in 2022. According to the luxury automobile maker, it sold 6,021 cars last year for the first time in its 118-year history. This remarkable feat also represents a sizable 8% rise in sales volume from the 5,586 vehicles sold in 2021. It is worth noting that 2021 was also a record year for Rolls-Royce in terms of sales volume. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Describing 2022 as a momentous year, Rolls-Royce CEO Torsten Müller-Ötvös also touched on Rolls-Royce&#8217;s inaugural fully electric model Spectre. In his own words:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Not only did we reveal Rolls-Royce Spectre, our marque&#8217;s first ever fully-electric series model to the world, it was also the first year we ever delivered more than 6,000 cars in a single 12-month period, with strong demand across our entire product portfolio. But as a true house of luxury, sales are not our sole measure of success: we are not and never will be a volume manufacturer.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition, Müller-Ötvös also commented on the luxury automaker&#8217;s bespoke, customized approach, saying:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Bespoke is Rolls-Royce, and commissions were also at record levels last year, with our clients&#8217; requests becoming ever more imaginative and technically demanding &#8211; a challenge we enthusiastically embrace.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The all-electric Rolls-Royce Spectre will go on sale at the end of 2023. </span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Other Key Takeaways from Latest Rolls-Royce Record Sales</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition to Middle Eastern buyers, Rolls-Royce also said other regions boosted its latest record sales volume. These include the USA, which remained its top market with around 35% of sales, Asia-Pacific, and Europe. However, the British luxury automobile brand also revealed that it experienced significant headwinds in China, its second-largest market. According to Rolls-Royce, coronavirus-related constraints led to a single-digit drop in sales across Greater China – including Hong Kong. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite the Chinese setback, Müller-Ötvös stressed that the growth in other regions offset this decrease. Furthermore, the Rolls-Royce chief executive also disclosed that the company still had a long order book for much of this year.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Our order book stretches far into 2023 for all models. We haven&#8217;t seen any slowdown in orders,&#8221; said he.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Demand for all Rolls-Royce models also remains exceptionally strong in 2023 despite halting sales in Russia last February. The company pulled out of the Eastern European nation early last year following its unprovoked invasion of neighboring Ukraine. At the time, Russian-bound orders for Rolls-Royce cars made up 250 to 300 units per year. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to Rolls-Royce, there is still a waiting list of customers willing to pay half a million euros for its cars. On average, each luxury car commands a hefty price tag of $534,000. </span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Rolls-Royce Reportedly Unaffected by Global Semiconductor Shortages</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Currently owned by German automobile brand <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/bmw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BMW</a>, Rolls-Royce previously revealed that it maintained good production levels during global chip shortages. According to the Goodwood-based car manufacturer, its parent company BMW ensured a substantial supply of parts to support the production intensity. </span></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/former-ftx-us-boss-insight/">Former FTX US Boss Promises to Share Insight on Exchange’s Operations</a></p>
<p>Brett Harrison, the former President of the United States offshoot of the now-bankrupt FTX Derivatives Exchange has promised to <a href="https://twitter.com/BrettHarrison88/status/1612261507659694082" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">share</a> additional details about the operations of the trading platform. Harrison revealed this via his Twitter handle in response to a user’s comment on his earlier tweet.</p>
<p>Harrison earlier demanded to know why tech startups around today do not do what American retail giant, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon.com Inc</a> (NASDAQ: AMZN) did by going public in their early years. Additionally, he quizzed to know how companies “reconcile the desire to stay private for long periods of time while rushing into token issuance?”</p>
<p>Rather than answer this series of questions posed by the former FTX President, a Twitter user with the handle, @JamesChristoph_ asked Brett Harrison in a blunt manner what he knew about FTX US and the time he got to know what he knew.</p>
<p>Brett Harrison was drafted into FTX US back in May 2021 after leading a successful career at Citadel Securities as a high-speed trading executive. Harrison helped court the growth of FTX US and oversaw some of the firm’s notable achievements including the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftx-us-raises-400m-valued-8b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising</a> of $400 million at a market valuation of $8 billion.</p>
<p>“We’ve grown tremendously from nothing, from relative obscurity into the fourth or fifth largest exchange in the US in a concise period while going up against a very competitive landscape of Coinbase, Kraken – these large, 10-year incumbents,” Harrison said in a statement at the time.</p>
<p>During his tenure, FTX US also made a lot of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftx-us-acquires-embed-financial-stocks-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisitions including</a> that of Embed Financials, a startup the exchange hoped will help it to enhance the new stock offerings for its customers in the United States.</p>
<p>The veteran crypto executive exited the company in September, a few months before the implosion of the crypto behemoth.</p>
<h2>Former FTX Boss’s Insight: When to Anticipate</h2>
<p>Responding to James Christoph’s tweet, the former FTX boss said he will share details about what he knows of the exchange in time. There were no further details about when or through what medium he will choose to share the information.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’ll share in time</p>
<p>&mdash; Brett Harrison (@BrettHarrison88) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrettHarrison88/status/1612261507659694082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The probe on Harrison’s knowledge about the defunct trading platform takes its roots in the notion that as a major executive at the exchange, he might have been privy to some details that ought to have been shared earlier.</p>
<p>Since the collapse of FTX, the trading platform, and the trio of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/sam-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, Gary Wang, and Caroline Ellison have been the subject of investigations by US authorities. No one has named the former FTX boss as a person of interest in the collapse of the trading platform, a situation that no one can tell will remain so for long.</p>
<p>At this time, FTX investors and creditors, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftx-creditors-1-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">numbering up to about a million</a>, are unsure when they will be able to withdraw their funds stock when the exchange suspended withdrawals and filed for bankruptcy.</p>

<p>As the team behind Nomad Bridge works on relaunching the platform, a fresh movement of 1200 ETH has been noticed from one of the wallet addresses linked to the hack. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/nomad-bridge-wallet-1-5m-tornado-cash/">Exploited Nomad Bridge Wallet Transfers $1.5M to Tornado Cash</a></p>
<p>A wallet address belonging to Nomad Bridge, which faced a $190 million exploit last week, has recently moved a total of $1.57 million in <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH</a> to the banned crypto mixer Tornado Cash.</p>
<p>As per the PeckShield data, attackers of the cross-chain interoperability protocol transferred 1,205 ETH (about $1.5 million) to Tornado Cash.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PeckShieldAlert?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PeckShieldAlert</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/nomadxyz_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@nomadxyz_</a> bridge exploit related address has transferred ~1,205 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$ETH</a> (~$1.5M) to Tornado Cash<a href="https://t.co/tBpkQXjqDW">https://t.co/tBpkQXjqDW</a> <a href="https://t.co/3308uOzMfs">pic.twitter.com/3308uOzMfs</a></p>
<p>&mdash; PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1612302234670485505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>It is clear that the attackers have once again turned active and are moving funds to crypto mixer platforms to make them untraceable. The recent activity suggests that the hacker might be cashing funds. A further look into this shows that the hacker transferred 12 batches of 100 ETH to the sanctioned mixer.</p>
<h2>The Nomad Bridge Hack and Fund Transfer to Tornado Cash</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/nomad-19m-bounty-190m-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nomad Bridge exploit</a> was among the top ten largest crypto hacks that took place in 2022. On August 1, 2022, several hundred explorers flocked to steal all the total value locked in the bridge in a matter of hours after the security breach. As a result, the Nomad Bridge lost a total of $190 million in total.</p>
<p>The Nomad Bridge had locked tokens in a smart contract that was exploited. So far, the team at Nomad has recovered only $30 million which is quite minimal compared to the loss that the platform suffered. Bridge hacks have been quite often during the last year of 2022 with hackers stealing several hundred million dollars last year.</p>
<p>Decentralized finance (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeFi</a>) witnessed major hacks throughout the last year. The hackers have been successful in exploiting the bridges connecting different blockchain platforms. In the DeFi space alone more than $3 billion worth of digital assets has been stored in 2022. After the hack back in August 2022, Nomad chief executive officer Pranay Mohan <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-company-nomad-offers-10-120544764.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We will not prosecute white hats. But we will continue to work with our partners, intelligence firms, and law enforcement to pursue all other malicious actors to the fullest extent under the law.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However, over the last two weeks, the Nomad team has made an effort to relaunch the bridge. The team has been putting a lot of effort in order to recover those lost funds and implement the required adjustments in order to restart the Nomad Token Bridge. After the relaunch, holders of the madAssets will be able to use the updated bridge in order to retrieve their recovered funds.</p>

<p>The UK PM has been in renewed talks with relevant stakeholders regarding an Arm IPO listing on the London Stock Exchange. </p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/arm-london-ipo-listing-plans/">British PM Rishi Sunak Revives Arm London IPO Listing Plans</a></p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/arm-london-ipo-listing-plans/">British PM Rishi Sunak Revives Arm London IPO Listing Plans</a></p>
<p>British Prime Minister <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/rishi-sunak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rishi Sunak</a> has revived discussions with Japan’s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/softbank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoftBank</a> Group Corp regarding an Arm Ltd London IPO. According to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e2f9a6f1-10bb-41ea-9b95-ea028ee10e9c" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Financial Times</a>, the chip designer is highly sought after for a London Stock Exchange listing amid other external constraints.</p>
<p>Sunak reportedly met with Arm’s CEO Rene Haas last month at the British Prime Minister’s official residence. Inside sources also stated that SoftBank’s billionaire founder Masayoshi Son also joined the meeting virtually. According to two people briefed, the meeting regarding the proposed Arm London IPO was very constructive and positive. Interestingly, both Arm and Softbank declined to provide insight into last month’s discussions, which were also attended by Arm’s chief legal officer Spencer Collins.</p>
<h2>London Faces Uphill Battle to Secure Arm IPO</h2>
<p>Sunak’s revived efforts to secure London’s role in the planned Arm initial public offering comes at a pivotal time for the British economy. This development also comes following months of political unease that derailed a London listing attempt in 2022. Presently, officials and the London bourse face an uphill battle to secure a UK role for the native tech group’s IPO. The reason is the higher associated costs and complexities behind such a move. Moreso, Son, and SoftBank previously indicated that they were angling for a New York, United States listing instead. According to Son at a shareholders’ meeting in June last year, most of Arm’s clients are based in the US. Despite his implied preference, Son also stressed that SoftBank has yet to decide.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the London Stock Exchange executives are open to sharing the planned listing with New York. Under plans drawn up in 2022, then-Prime Minister Liz Truss and former Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng launched a last-ditch bid for an Arm dual listing. Under this arrangement, the prominent semiconductor company would float simultaneously in London and New York. Although this structure may seem appealing, several companies usually opt against it due to its associated expense and complexity. Whether SoftBank would eventually settle for a dual listing currently remains unknown.</p>
<h2>Proposed IPO Comes at a Critical Time</h2>
<p>The UK capital market would receive a huge shot in the arm if it can eventually secure an Arm Ltd listing. The Cambridge-founded and headquartered semiconductor firm initially had a London listing with a New York secondary listing before SoftBank took over. The Japanese multinational conglomerate holding company acquired Arm for $32 billion back in 2016 after the Brexit vote. Should the British-based chip designer return to the London Stock Exchange, it would be the largest tech group listing there.</p>
<p>Although SoftBank initially faced considerable pressure to float Arm early this year, much of that pressure has eased. As it stands, the Japanese group looks to delay any listing until later in the year when market conditions improve. SoftBank also seeks to return Arm to the public markets following the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/59c0d5f9-ed6a-4de6-a997-f25faed58833" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">collapse</a> of a 66 billion pounds sale to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/nvidia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nvidia</a> (NASDAQ: NVDA).</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ant-linked-firms-shares-rise/">Ant-linked Firms See Shares Rise Markedly Following Jack Ma Control Relinquishment</a></p>
<p>The shares of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ant-financial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ant</a>-linked firms <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/shares-of-ant-linked-firms-rise-after-news-of-jack-ma-ceding-control-alibaba-jumps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">jumped Monday</a> on news that Ant Group founder <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/jack-ma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack Ma</a> is ceding control of the fintech giant. The Hong Kong-listed shares of Ma&#8217;s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/alibaba-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alibaba Group</a> closed 8.7% higher, while the shares of other Ant-staked companies also rose. The Alibaba Group affiliate company indirectly owns between 5%-20% stake in firms such as Longshine Technology Group, Jilin University Zhengyuan Information Technologies, and Shanghai Golden Bridge Infotech. Ant also has part ownership in Orbbec Inc and Hundsun Technologies.</p>
<p>Ant revealed over the weekend that Ma would <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/jack-ma-give-up-control-ant-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">give up company control</a> following an overhaul. This overhaul seeks to establish a line under a regulatory crackdown that came about soon after the preemption of Ant&#8217;s massive stock market debut two years ago.</p>
<p>Greater China market strategist at Hong Kong&#8217;s Saxo Markets, Redmond Wong, weighed in on Ma ceding control of Ant. According to Wong, this development should help clear some uncertainties and chart a new path for developing and expanding the group&#8217;s business. As Wong put it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It should have removed some of the authorities&#8217; concerns about the group as the change was likely a negotiated outcome with the authorities. And investor sentiment towards the China Internet sector is likely to improve further.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Managing Partner at Shanghai-based investment consultancy Aquariusx, Alexander Sirakov, also commented, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Investors can stop guessing and can finally assign a risk premium to the new company that Ant was transformed to be.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Some analysts opine that relinquishing control would pave the way for Ant to revive its failed initial public offering (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-initial-public-offering-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPO</a>). However, the changes announced Saturday suggest that there might be a further delay due to listing regulations. Furthermore, Ant stated Sunday that it had no plans to initiate an IPO.</p>
<h2>Chinese Finance Regulatory Head Provides Correction Update Amid Ant-linked Firms Shares Climb</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Guo Shuqing, head of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), also commented amid the rise in Ant-linked firms&#8217; shares. In a recent interview, Guo said that the correction of some platform companies&#8217; financial businesses is basically complete. Although these companies currently total 14, Guo refrained from naming any of them. Instead, he stated that a few outstanding issues present among these companies require a resolution.</p>
<p>Guo concluded that the authorities will adopt normalized regulation in light of the previously mentioned rectifications. He further said that these authorities could also encourage platform companies to operate compliantly.</p>
<p>In a research note, banking giant Morgan Stanley said it would elevate Alibaba to the summit of its China internet stocks for 2023. The New York-based banking powerhouse cited easing regulation as a critical reason for its decision.</p>
<p>Despite a change of guard at Ant&#8217;s control center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University finance professor Li Nan doubts little will change. According to Li, the fintech&#8217;s inherent problems still hold sway even after it changes control.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ant-group-ipo-jack-ma-control/">Ant Group Says They Have No Plans for IPO as Jack Ma Gives Up Control</a></p>
<p>On Sunday, January 7, Chinese fintech giant Ant Group said that they have no plans for Initial Public Offering (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-initial-public-offering-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPO</a>) after all the buzz around it for the last few months.</p>
<p>Speaking to Reuters, the company spokesperson <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ant-group-says-no-plan-ipo-focusing-business-optimisation-2023-01-08/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ant Group has been focusing on its business rectification and optimization, and does not have a plan for an IPO&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>With the Chinese regulators cracking down on the country&#8217;s local tech landscape, Ant Group has been facing the heat as well.</p>
<p>Ant Group is now on the completion of its two-year regulatory-driven restructuring. This is since Chinese authorities were trying to impose a fine of more than $1 billion on the financial firm.</p>
<h2>Jack Ma Gives Control of Ant Group</h2>
<p>The latest announcement to turn down the IPO comes just a day after founder <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/jack-ma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack Ma</a> relinquished his control once again. As per the announcement last weekend, Ant Group will adjust its voting rights structure.</p>
<p>The change involves giving voting rights to a total of 10 individuals including the founder, employees, and management. Jack Ma&#8217;s ceding control of his Ant Group comes at a time of his retreat from his empire following China&#8217;s crackdown on the local tech industry.</p>
<p>The adjustments with Ma&#8217;s going won&#8217;t be impacting any individual shareholder. Jack Ma has disappeared from public view ever since he gave a speech criticizing regulators after a scuttled Ant listing in 2020. Since then, Ant has focussed on overhauling its business operations and appeasing regulators. Also, Ant Group has ramped up its capital base for its consumer loan affiliate. Furthermore, they have built firewalls in order to serve wealth management and consumer lending.</p>
<h2>Change In Control Further Pushes IPO Plans</h2>
<p>China&#8217;s domestic A-share market requires companies can wait for three years after they had a change in the controller for listing on Shanghai’s STAR Market. However, for Hong Kong&#8217;s market, the waiting period is one year.</p>
<p>Ma is still holding the economic interests and voting rights in the company following the change. Last year in July 2022, Ant&#8217;s affiliate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. said that Ma “intends to reduce and thereafter limit his direct and indirect economic interest in Ant Group over time” to a percentage that doesn&#8217;t exceed 8.8%.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/wedoctor-ipo-h2-2023/">WeDoctor Plans to Float Its IPO by H2 2023</a></p>
<p>Chinese online healthcare services provider, WeDoctor is set to float its Initial Public Offering (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-initial-public-offering-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPO</a>) by the second half (H2) of this year. The WeDoctor IPO plans were <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-09/tencent-backed-wedoctor-plans-ipo-filing-by-end-of-april?srnd=technology-vp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> by Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>According to the sources, the firm is considering either a Hong Kong or US listing and that the plans from the firm could change over time, noting that talks are still in the preliminary stages. The IPO plans will come off as the second the company will be spearheading in years as its previous attempt was crushed by the crackdown on homegrown tech companies prevalent when it first tried in 2021.</p>
<p>WeDoctor is transforming access to medicine in an innovative digital manner. It connects more than 3000 hospitals, 300,000 doctors, and 200 million patients together. Founded in 2010 in Hangzhou China, WeDoctor now occupies a very pivotal position in the telemedicine sector in China.</p>
<p>The company is backed by <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tencent Holdings Ltd</a> (HKG: 0700) and it last raised funding last year from a single investor that was backed by the Shandong government. Notably, the funding at the time came in at $163 million and it gave WeDoctor a post-money valuation of $7 billion.</p>
<p>According to sources who spoke to Bloomberg, the size of the company’s IPO has not been decided. In the company’s first attempt to go public in 2021, the application for listing elapsed, echoing the lack of readiness to give startups like WeDoctor that control users’ sensitive info a leap that may go beyond borders.</p>
<p>At this time, the Chinese government appears to be easing down on its crackdown on top tech companies and this may be a perfect window for WeDoctor to launch.</p>
<h2>WeDoctor IPO May Gain Approval Like Ant Group’s Expansion</h2>
<p>There are certain trends in the Chinese financial markets that are suggesting an easing on crackdowns for tech companies. As Coinspeaker <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/chinese-ant-consumer-finance-unit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> earlier, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) approved the expansion of the registered capital of Ant Group’s Consumer Finance Unit from 8 billion Yuan to 18.5 billion Yuan.</p>
<p>While still subject to the meeting of certain conditions by the tech giant, the approval is a significant milestone when compared to the grip regulators had on Ant Group, stirring the squashing of its proposed IPO back in 2020. The speculation now remains that, for the regulators to ease up on Ant Group, chances are that the proposed WeDoctor IPO plans may also be allowed to pass.</p>
<p>A major bone of contention is the firm’s proposed plans to list in the US also. While the Chinese regulators are likely to shift grounds, the firm may be required to make some concessions also as both countries are still in a subtle war pertaining to data accessibility and transfer from each other’s shores.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-btc-price-17000-resistance/">Bitcoin (BTC) Price Clears Key $17,000 Resistance, Eyes $18,000 Mark</a></p>
<p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) price recently gained some momentum that saw it break past the $17,000 benchmark. The flagship cryptocurrency surged to a new yearly high of $17,248, per CoinMarketCap <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">data</a>. However, it has since retraced its steps and was seen trading at $17,208, as of press time. Thus, representing an over 4% rise from its yearly low of $16,521 that was recorded on New Year&#8217;s day.</p>
<h2>What to Look Out For in Bitcoin (BTC) Price Movements</h2>
<p>Currently, BTC price appears to be holding its own, consolidating gains as it nears the next $17,250 resistance level. Should it break this barrier, the next resistance will be the $17,500 mark, another major resistance. For the BTC price, surpassing the $17,500 would be a major bullish move. And it will set the tone for a potential rally, albeit for the short term.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, if the BTC price fails to clear the $17,250 resistance, then a downward correction may begin to play out, with the next immediate support expected to be around the $17,150 level.</p>
<p>Following this, the main support would be the $17,000 level, but once the price dips below that, then it might retest the $16,800.</p>
<h2>Crypto  Crisis Deepens</h2>
<p>Without a doubt, the fate of crypto still hangs in the balance, despite the new year holding huge promises for the industry. The uncertainty is mostly a result of the recent controversy around Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group (DCG).</p>
<p>As earlier reported by Coinspeaker,  the crypto behemoth is currently being investigated by U.S. authorities. That is over allegations of shady business dealings in the way its subsidiary transacted with Gemini. Although Silbert denied those allegations, DCG recently <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/dcg-shuts-down-hq-subsidiary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down</a> the operations of its wealth management unit. However, the move has further fuelled fears of an impending candal that may yet shock the crypto world in 2023.</p>
<p>As Mark Cuban also recently predicted, a major scandal may yet impact the trajectory of the crypto industry this year. And considering how big of an industry giant DCG is, any scandal involving it would undoubtedly send the industry plunging into the deep once again.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/wyre-imposes-withdrawal-limit/">Wyre Imposes 90% Withdrawal Limit on Customers</a></p>

<p>Crypto payment provider Wyre has <a href="https://twitter.com/sendwyre/status/1611774169389080576" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> that its customers will only be able to withdraw up to 90% of their funds, based on its current daily withdrawal limit. The firm announced the revision to its withdrawal policy through Twitter.</p>
<p>It said, “While customers will continue to be able to withdraw their funds, at this time, we are limiting withdrawals to no more than 90% of the funds currently in each customer account, subject to current daily limits.&#8221; This means that any withdrawal requests beyond this limit will be rejected.</p>
<p>The firm also announced changes to its management structure. Former Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, Stephen Cheng was appointed as its interim CEO. Meanwhile, former CEO Ioannis Gianna will transition into the role of executive chairman.</p>
<h2>Reason for New Withdrawal Limit</h2>
<p>The revision of the withdrawal policy is the latest in a series of moves the company is making to stay afloat. The firm stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are exploring strategic options for our company that will enable us to navigate the current market environment and deliver on our mission to simplify and revolutionize the global payments ecosystem.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After reports emerged that <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bolt-crypto-firm-wyre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolt Financial&#8217;s planned buyout of Wyre</a> fell through, the firm laid off 75 employees. One of these who spoke in confidence to Axios noted that this was done without any severance package. Another noted that the CEO had communicated a potential shutdown.</p>
<p>When asked to comment, Ioannis Gianna explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We’re still operating but will be scaling back to plan our next steps.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The End of an Era?</h2>
<p>Founded in 2013, this may very well be the end of an era for Wyre. Some of its partnerships have already begun to crumble. Last week, MetaMask announced the end of its partnership with Wyre, removing Wyre from its mobile payments aggregator. MetaMask is also working to remove Wyre from its extension.</p>
<p>Whether or not it is the end, if Wyre goes down, it won’t do so alone. One company that will be particularly affected is Topps, an NFT collections company.</p>
<p>Topps suspended NFT transactions on its platform and announced to its customers that it was assessing the situation with Wyre. However, the firm reassured its customers, announcing that the collections remain safe and secure.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-doj-website-sbf-victims/">US DOJ Opens Website for SBF Victims, Implores Them to Come Forward</a></p>
<p>The United States Department of Justice has established a website to cater specifically to victims of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/sam-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> (SBF), former CEO of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a>. The website opens communication channels between US prosecutors and the SBF victims, urging them to send an email for verification.</p>
<p>According to a recently-released DOJ <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/united-states-v-samuel-bankman-fried-aka-sbf-22-cr-673-lak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press statement</a>, federal crime victims have certain rights which must be protected. These include &#8220;The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim&#8217;s dignity and privacy,&#8221; among others. In addition, the US prosecutors stated that federal crime victims have the right to &#8220;full and timely restitution as provided in law.&#8221; Also notable among the 10-list victim rights:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole proceeding.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Lastly, the Department of Justice added:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the crime or of any release or escape of the accused.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>US prosecutors believe that the website will serve as a better means of providing notifications and updates for victims instead of contacting them individually. The reason is that those directly affected by the FTX collapse could number more than 1 million, making mail contact impractical.</p>
<h2>Beyond the SBF Victims Development</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, FTX has agreed to cooperate with Bahamas Joint Provisional Liquidators (JPLs) in other developing matters around the SBF case. According to a January 6th <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftx-debtors-and-ftx-dm-bahamas-announce-cooperation-agreement-301715690.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">press statement,</a> both parties would work together to optimize fund recovery efforts for stakeholders. In addition, the Bahamas Supreme Court-appointed JPL would take charge of the disposition of real estate in the Caribbean nation. Furthermore, FTX and the JPL also agreed that the latter would confirm assets held by Bahamian authorities.</p>
<p>Despite the progressive collaboration between FTX and the Bahamas JPL, the exchange&#8217;s CEO John Ray III suggested room for more resolutions. As he put it, &#8220;there are some issues where we do not yet have a meeting of the minds, but we resolved many of the outstanding matters and have a path forward to resolve the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Furthermore, JPL member Brian Simms also pointed out the diverse tools available to each jurisdiction in accomplishing the given objective. As a result, Simms expressed belief in both parties reaching a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
<p>Since FTX&#8217;s dramatic collapse in November last year, Bankman-Fried has been arrested and extradited to the United States. Early this year, the disgraced former FTX CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sbf-pleads-not-guilty-us-charges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pleaded not guilty</a> to all 8 criminal charges against him. These charges include conspiracy to commit money laundering, misuse of customer funds, as well as wire fraud.</p>
<p>SBF pleaded not guilty before a New York District Court judge and in the presence of his lawyers, Mark Cohen, and Christian Everdell. If convicted at a trial set for October 2nd this year, the former crypto wunderkind could face up to 115 years in prison.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried is currently at his parent&#8217;s house on a $250 billion bond.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mexican-cbdc-issuance-2024/" rel="prev">next</a></p>
