<h2>ClassyCrypto Contributes Terra Classic (LUNC) Burn Effort</h2>
<p>Terra Classic influencer ClassyCrypto in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/ClassyCrypto_/status/1605291349351321623" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a> on December 21 announced officially burning 100% of its LUNC validator commission. The burn included Classy&#8217;s Crypto Sphere validator commission of nearly 8 million LUNC tokens, <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">ad revenue from </span><span class="r-18u37iz">LUNC</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> videos on YouTube, </span>and others.</p>
<p>ClassyCrypto said they have burned almost 13 million LUNC tokens after a 0.2% burn tax. He also shared the transaction details of sending LUNC to the burn address. It shows 12,787,487.63 LUNC tokens sent to the burn address, with 25,575 LUNC tokens as transaction fees.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">&#8220;I also burnt all of the ad revenue our </span><span class="r-18u37iz">LUNC</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> videos on YouTube have generated this month. Our LUNC focus is burning.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Other Terra Classic community members thanked ClassyCrypto for doing was he promised and contributing to the burn effort of the community.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, ClassyCrypto tweeted that Classy&#8217;s Crypto Sphere validator is moving to a 100% commission-burned model. It will be &#8220;moving toward a 100% non-profit, 100% for the community model.&#8221; He revealed the plan to burn billions of LUNC tokens in 2023.</p>
<p>The Terra Classic community has burned over 36.231 billion LUNC tokens until now. Most of the burn is contributed by<span id="total" class="badge bg-dark text-end lh-1"> crypto exchange <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-binance-burns-over-6-billion-terra-classic-lunc-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance with over 20 billion LUNC tokens burned</a>.

<p>The business tycoon has been charged with fraud, money laundering, presenting a fake financial picture of his organization, and using customers&#8217; money. He is facing extradition to the U.S.</p>
<h2>The companies reconsidering SBF grants</h2>
<p>ProPublica, a non-profit organization, on Tuesday, announced that they will be returning the 1.6 million USD that they got from SBF’s foundation, Building A Stronger Future. This money was supposed to be used for public health, biosecurity, and coronavirus. It was part of a 3-year grant of 5 million USD. The firm stated that it would find other ways for the fund. On the day, SBF stepped down as the head of FTX and filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. Court, ProPublica suspended all its grants. However, it is still unclear where this money will go.</p>
<p>Vox Media was given 200,000 USD by SBF’s family foundation and the company has also decided to return all the money. The spokeswoman for Vox told that they have already spent 14,000 USD for issues like climate change, fighting global poverty, and other challenges of society, in the month of August, For Vox as well it remains unclear how they will find a new funding partner or return the spent money.</p>

<p>The news organization Intercept is reconsidering the grant of 500,000 USD that was given to them as a part of a 4 million USD grant. “At this time, we are still gathering the information we need to make a principled decision in accordance with our mission and values,” spokesman Rodrigo Brandao said on Tuesday. Earlier the company said that this has left a hole in their funding pocket.</p>
<p>The company Semafor accepted SBF’s grant in the month of May, this year with the hope that they would be able to carry independent journalism. However, they are reconsidering and waiting for the authorities to take a decision.</p>

<h2>When were these fundings made?</h2>
<p>The funding, investments, and generous gifts made by SBF to newsrooms were part of a larger pattern that included roughly $40 million in political donations this cycle. This was large to Democratic-aligned groups. Before fraud allegations were made public and FTX was largely regarded as one of the more responsible businesses in the cryptocurrency market.</p>

The virtual universe, also known as the metaverse, is a vast digital space that experts believe will eventually replace the internet. People can buy property in this world, make <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/">NFT</a> exhibits, sell the digital content they create, or play games designed specifically for this virtual world while wearing VR glasses.</p>
<p>The popularity of the Metaverse is increasing, especially with the aid of numerous significant companies, such as Facebook. One of the most divisive investment topics in the future is expected to be <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/year-ender-top-metaverse-projects-to-invest-in-2023-heres-the-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">metaverse projects</a>.</p>
<h2>Top 3 Metaverse Trends To Watch In 2022</h2>
<h4>Augmented and Virtual Reality in Gaming</h4>
<p>Virtual gaming relies heavily on 3D technology, AR and VR assemblies, and sonic systems. These technologies have experienced exponential growth as this market has grown, increasing their value and market relevance. The market for AR and VR headsets increased by 60.8% in 2021. However, according to the International Data Corporation&#8217;s (IDC) Quarterly AR/VR Headset Tracker, the APAC region alone shipped 2.19 million units. The gaming industry undergoes new revolutions thanks to these technologies.</p>
<h4>Metaverse Events</h4>
<p>Fortnite concerts Online have drawn in 10.7M users. Live events and advertisements in the Metaverse could cost up to US$800 billion. In 2024, the global market for video game software and hardware could reach $400 billion, with the remaining opportunities coming from live entertainment and social media. Over 75,000 sales for a total of almost US$25 million have been made of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentraland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decentraland</a> pieces of land, NFT tokens, and virtual land plots in the Decentraland Metaverse. Future concerts will be completely altered by this trend.</p>
<h4>The complexity of Metaverse Avatars</h4>
<p>Avatars are likely to become more advanced, according to metaverse trends. Avatars currently come in a wide variety of shapes. This includes photorealistic forms that almost exactly resemble people in the real world as well as 2D avatars.</p>
<p>The advanced, almost photorealistic avatars offered by Meta are well known. Over time, more and more of the company&#8217;s products will support these avatars. Microsoft, meanwhile, focuses on using AI technology to make avatars. However,  that blends in with a business setting thanks to responsive animation. It is simple to create avatars and export them into various metaverse implementations thanks to well-known apps like Zepeto and OSUVOX.</p>

Authorities have already implied a 30% tax on the capital gains earned from crypto trading in India. However, the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/reserve-bank-of-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indian Central Bank</a> governor has issued a warning regarding the next financial crisis.</p>
<h2>RBI Chief warns of a financial crisis</h2>
<p>In the<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pDiWyN0IWQ&amp;ab_channel=ReserveBankofIndia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> BFSI insight Summit</a>, Shaktikanta Das, RBI Governor talked about the recent collapse and developments in the crypto industry. However, he warned of the next possible financial crisis and mentioned that it will come from private digital assets.</p>
<p>Das further asserted that he still holds the same view regarding that digital assets and wants them to be prohibited. Meanwhile, he also added that the crypto has no underlying value. Private Digital assets are major risks for macroeconomic and Financial Stability.</p>
<p>RBI Chief mentioned the recent decline in the crypto market highlighting the major <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.binance.com/es/feed/post/126268" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">FTX collapse</a>. These episodes have proved to be a major supporter of the Indian authorities&#8217; stand against crypto. However, Das stated that a change in the value of any product is a function of the market.</p>
<h2>Crypto origin is to bypass the system</h2>
<p>RBI Chief stated that the origin of cryptocurrency is to bypass and break the system. Meanwhile, Das argued that he is yet to hear any credible argument of what public good crypto serves. There is no clarity about it. He marked the crypto as speculative activity and it should be prohibited.</p>
<p>Earlier, Coingape reported that the <a href="https://coingape.com/rbi-india-digital-rupee-launch-cities-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RBI launched the pilot phase</a> of Central Bank Digital Currency <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(CBDC)</a>/ Retail digital Rupee on December 1, 2022. The watchdog will be testing the settlement of secondary market transactions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Indian government has faced heavy criticism from citizens for imposing high taxes rate on retail crypto trade.</p>

Since Solana Foundation had close relationships with FTX and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sbf/">SBF</a>&#8216;s other companies, it took the fall for the crisis.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Solana prices slumped to a record low of $13 (on November 11), days after the news of the FTX liquidity crisis crippled the market. Since then, SOL has struggled to recover.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">The price of Solana hit an all-time high of $260.06 during the bull run of 2021 (on Nov. 6). SOL prices have been declining ever since and are currently trading at $12.08.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132433" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21124626/SOLANA.jpg" alt="Solana" width="926" height="642" /></p>
<h4 style="color: #252525">SOL&#8217;s Future Prospects</h4>
<p style="color: #252525">According to several cryptocurrency analysts, it could be challenging for SOL to return to its all-time high ($260) because Solana&#8217;s fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $100 billion was never justified.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptopredictions.com/solana/">cryptopredictions.com</a>, SOL can breach the $40 barrier by 2026.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Given that the value proposition offered by the Solana ecosystem remains more or less the same (despite market sentiments not being in favour of Solana, which is one of the main reasons behind its price crash), it is very likely that SOL will touch the $100 mark in the next bull run.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Since SOL is in a dip, if you can hold it for the long term, that is, until the next bull run hits and market sentiments are in favour of Solana, you can make decent money from this investment.</p>

<h4 style="color: #252525">How Much Money You Would Make if Solana (SOL) Reaches $100?</h4>
<p style="color: #252525">Let&#8217;s say you invest a modest $100 in SOL tokens today. This will get you 8.28 SOL tokens at the current price of $12.08. In the event that SOL hits $100, your $100 investment will become worth $828, giving you an 8x  or 728% return on investment.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Let&#8217;s assume that you buy $1000 worth of SOL tokens today. At the current rate, you will have approximately 82.78 tokens. Your $1000 investment will be worth $8278 if liquidated at the price of $100. If SOL hits the $100 mark in the next 3 years, you will get an annualised ROI of 102% on your investment.</p>
<p>It is important for anyone considering investing in Solana or any other cryptocurrency to carefully research the asset and understand the risks involved before making any investment decisions.</p>

The original work is worth more than the postcard you purchased from the museum, much like the priceless nature of Matisse or Van Gogh, and the same logic applies to NFTs and their copyrights.</p>
<p>Influencers and celebrities aren&#8217;t far behind in the NFT race. The <a href="https://coingape.com/nft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT collections</a> of well-known celebrities like Snoop Dogg, Paris Hilton, Eminem, Bella Hadid, etc. have been released for their fans. The way we think about ownership and digital marketing has changed as a result of NFTs. Unsurprisingly, the NFT industry has been growing faster than ever, and the non-fungible tokens craze hasn&#8217;t spared Indian celebrities.</p>
<h2><strong>Top 5 Bollywood celebrities who owned NFTs in 2022</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Amitabh Bachchan</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132411" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21115021/Amitab-bachchan.jpg" alt="Amitab bachchan NFT" width="752" height="423" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The renowned Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan joined the NFT movement in November 2021. In addition to autographed Sholay posters and other items related to the movie, he also launched Madhushala, his father&#8217;s celebrated poetry recital. Through an <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/best-nft-marketplaces-where-to-create-and-sell-nfts-in-2022/">NFT marketplace</a>, the collection was auctioned off for Rs. 7.18 crores.</p>
<h3><strong>Salman Khan</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132412" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21115116/Salman-khan.jpeg" alt="Salman Khan NFT" width="800" height="448" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Wanted actor debuted his NFT line, which was inspired by his film Dabangg. A total of 200 NFTs, 42 of which were movie scenes, were part of the NFT series he started. Salman Khan announced his NFT series on Twitter on December 25, 2021, and the collection launched on December 30, 2021. Fans could use <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">ETH</a> or MATIC tokens to purchase NFTs.</p>
<h3><strong>Rajnikant</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132413" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21115200/Rajnikant.jpg" alt="Rajnikant NFT" width="640" height="640" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Thalaiva of the south Indian film industry, Rajinikanth, is also involved with NFTs. He launched his collection in July 2021 in collaboration with the Singapore-based non-fungible token marketplace Diginoor.io. However, his 2007 film Sivaji: The Boss was featured in his non-fungible token collection. On Diginoor.io, customers could use a debit card or a cryptocurrency of their choice to buy their favorite movie moments.</p>
<h3><strong>Sunny Leone</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132415" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21115244/Sunny-Leone.jpg" alt="Sunny Leone NFT" width="1200" height="900" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sunny Leone debuts her own non-fungible token collection, Misfitz, making her the first Indian actress to do so. Unusual patterns, boisterous characters, and an eclectic atmosphere characterized the collection. However, in November 2021, the collection, which contained about 9600 non-fungible tokens, quickly ran out of stock.</p>
<h3><strong>Manish Malhotra</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132256" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20132601/jpg_20221220_132346_0000.jpg" alt="Manish Malhotra NFT" width="1200" height="800" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Manish Malhotra, a famous fashion designer in India, is the first in his profession to enter this market. He unveiled five exclusive sketches and runway GIFs of his clothing in October 2021. However, Lisa Ray, Deepika Padukone, Kareena Kapoor Khan, and Alia Bhatt wore.</p>
<p>However, when the auction went live on the WazirX, it was completely sold out. The Illuminous Showstopper, a famously worn outfit by Kareena Kapoor Khan, generated the highest payment of 3,000 WRX, or roughly USD $4,000. (almost Rs 2.8 lakh).</p>

FIL tokens are used as payment for these services as well as a financial incentive to guarantee that files are consistently stored over time.</p>
<p>As a<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/proof-of-work-pow/"> proof-of-work</a> token, FIL allows the Filecoin community to mine and receive additional coins as payment. Additionally, FIL can be used on the Filecoin network, where users can pay miners to store or retrieve their data. In the event that there are no or insufficient proofs, the token may also be used as collateral.</p>
<h3><b>Filecoin (FIL) Price Analysis</b></h3>
<p>Filecoin’s price today is $2.93, with a market capitalization of $1B and a 24-hour trading volume down by 4.62%. Now it stands at $127 million. At the same time, the circulating supply is approximately 344,966,605 FIL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132396" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21105612/FIL_1D_graph_coinmarketcap1.jpg" alt="Source: coinmarketcap" width="1161" height="500" /></p>
<h6>Source: Coinmarketcap</h6>
<p>Despite the negative market trends, the technical analysis of the Filecoin price shows a significant surge fueled by FIL growth. The Filecoin (FIL) price has increased significantly in comparison to counterparts such as Stellar and <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>.</p>

<h2><b>How Much Money Would You Make If FIL Reaches $10?</b></h2>
<p>According to <strong><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptopredictions.com/filecoin/" rel="nofollow">Cryptopredictions.com</a></strong>, FIL can go as high as $10.9 by December 2025. Let’s assume that you invest a modest $100 in Filecoin today.</p>
<figure id="attachment_132397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132397" style="width: 1491px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-132397" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21105732/Screenshot-2022-12-21-at-10-17-09-Filecoin-FIL-Price-Prediction-2023-2024-2026.png" alt="Filecoin Prediction chart" width="1491" height="847" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-132397" class="wp-caption-text">Filecoin Prediction chart</figcaption></figure>
<p>According to today’s price, which is $2.92, you will have approximately 34.26 FIL. If Filecoin’s price hits $10 in the next few years, your $100 will become approximately $342.6. Let’s say you bought $100 worth of FIL coins today. With the current rate, you will have approximately 34.26 coins. However, you can potentially make $342 when it reaches the $100 mark.</p>

It is one of the largest publicly listed crypto mining companies in the U.S. Core Scientific has decided to file for bankruptcy due to falling crypto prices and rising energy prices that deteriorated its finances.</p>
<p>Despite the $72 million in financing from its lender B. Riley last week to avoid bankruptcy, the crypto miner was unable to work efficiently and will work on restructuring, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/KenzieSigalos/status/1605420482005704705" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> CNBC. Core Scientific plans to keep mining until it restructures its balance sheet.</p>
<p>Core Scientific’s market cap dropped to $78 million on Tuesday, down from a $4.3 billion valuation in July 2021 when it went public. The CORZ stock price has fallen more than 98% in the last year. On Tuesday, the stock price ended at $0.21, up 3.07%.</p>
<p>According to a person familiar with the company’s situation, the company is still generating positive cash flow. However, cash is insufficient to repay the <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-bitcoin-mining-giant-core-scientific-could-file-for-bankruptcy-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financing debt owed on mining equipment</a> it was leasing. Core Scientific will not liquidate and operate normally until reaching a deal with senior security noteholders, which hold the majority of the company’s debt.</p>
<h2>Crypto Twitter Reactions To Core Scientific Bankruptcy</h2>
<p>Crypto influencers took to Twitter to report Core Scientific&#8217;s bankruptcy filing. Many crypto miners are facing financial constraints amid the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bear market</a>.</p>
<p>Crypto researcher Dylan Leclair reported that the firm owns approximately 5% of the global hash rate. He also shared the situation of listed crypto miners with many having stock prices down over 90% in 2022.</p>
<figure id="attachment_132410" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132410" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-132410" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21114843/Crypto-Miners-Performance.jpg" alt="Crypto Miners Performance" width="710" height="378" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-132410" class="wp-caption-text">Crypto Miners Performance</figcaption></figure>
<p>Crypto investor and board member at Iris Energy Mike Alfred said Core Scientific had told him that the company would have 13 EH by July of this year when he first looked at the company in the summer of 2021.</p>
<p>Many people showed concerns over the future of bitcoin mining as several crypto miners such as Argo Blockchain and Iris Energy are facing bankruptcy risks.</p>

<p>Core Scientific joins the list of other crypto miners who have succumbed to the crash in the crypto space and the soaring energy prices. A month ago, the Bitcoin miner had already hinted about <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-bitcoin-mining-giant-core-scientific-could-file-for-bankruptcy-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extreme pain in its operations</a> and cash crunch owing to the market conditions.</p>
<p>Core Scientific was mining some proof-of-work digital assets such as Bitcoin. As we know, this requires high-end machinery and hardware while also consuming massive electricity in the process. Over the last year, the price of Core Scientific (NASDAQ: CORZ) stock has tanked by 99% losing more than $4 billion in valuations.</p>
<p>Last year in July 2021, the Bitcoin miner had gone for a public listing via a special purpose acquisition vehicle or SPAC. Although the company still generates a positive cash flow, it&#8217;s not enough to repay the financial debt on equipment, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/20/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-filing-for-bankruptcy-will-keep-mining.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said sources</a> familiar with the matter.</p>
<h3>Core Scientific&#8217;s Further Action Plan</h3>
<p>The sources also added that core Scientific is not willing to liquidate, however, it would continue to operate normally while reaching a deal with senior security noteholders, who hold a majority of the company&#8217;s debt.</p>
<p>In their filing earlier in October, Core Scientific said that holders of their common stock might suffer a total loss on their investment. However, the Bitcoin miner&#8217;s deal with its convertible note holders is such that if the market conditions for Bitcoin improve, common equity holders might not get totally wiped out.</p>
<p>Core Scientific has operations currently in North Dakota, North Carolina, Georgia, and Kentucky. It is also one of the largest providers of blockchain infrastructure and hosting.</p>
<p>Core Scientific is not the only Bitcoin miner to face bankruptcy. Compute North, the hosting infrastructure for crypto mining also filed for bankruptcy in September.</p>

As per the latest report from ABC News, SBF who&#8217;s currently in the Fox Hill jail of The Bahamas has agreed to his extradition to the US on multiple charges.

As per the latest report from ABC News, SBF who&#8217;s currently in the Fox Hill jail of The Bahamas has agreed to his extradition to the US on multiple charges.</p>
<p>Reports suggest that SBF has signed his extradition paper and a hearing for the same will happen on Wednesday in Nassau. The <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-12-21/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-signs-extradition-papers/101796332" target="_blank" rel="noopener">development</a> has been confirmed by Bahamas Acting Commissioner of Corrections Doan Cleare.</p>
<p>After signing his surrender documents on Tuesday, the Bahamas Commissioner said that SBF will sign a separate set of papers and finalize his waiver of rights to fight extradition.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Federal authorities are looking to fly back SBF to the U.S. soon after Wednesday&#8217;s hearing. The Bloomberg <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/sam-bankman-fried-to-fly-to-us-wednesday-escorted-by-fbi-agents-1.1861932" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> notes that the disgraced FTX founder will be accompanied to the US by FBI agents in a non-commercial aircraft. Another source familiar with the matter said that the plane will leave from a private airport in The Bahamas.</p>
<h3>Not A Good Christmas for SBF</h3>
<p>Sam Bankman Fried has been facing severe charges over the misuse of customers&#8217; funds at FTX which led to a dramatic collapse of a $32 billion company. Some previous <a href="https://coingape.com/how-much-jail-time-sbf-is-looking-at-if-convicted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> suggest that SBF might face 115 years of prison which is equivalent to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>After getting earlier this month, the Bahamian court also denied bail to SBF last week. Since then, he&#8217;s been placed in one of the most notorious jail facilities of the island nation i.e. Fox Hill.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Bahamian authorities will escort Sam Bankman-Fried from the prison to the court. Although initially hesitant, SBF has agreed to the extradition to the U.S. This change in attitude might be partly due to the expectation that SBF could get bail in the US. So far, it isn&#8217;t clear where SBF is planning to land on Wednesday.</p>

This facility is now available to 160 countries across the world.</p>
<p>Currently, Uniswap supports Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum. It means over the DEX, users can purchase their respective cryptocurrencies such as DAI, ETH, MATIC, USDC, USDT, WBTC and WETH.</p>
<p>Amid the recent collapse of crypto exchange FTX, trust from <a href="https://coingape.com/uniswap-unveils-new-feature-to-rival-crypto-exchanges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">centralized exchanges</a> has dropped as many investors are moving their crypto into self-custody. As a result, the demand and trading volumes on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have also shot up.</p>
<p>DEX&#8217;s offers greater user protection since they have self-custodial wallets, and are permissionless and immutable protocols. But when compared to centralized exchanges, DEXs don&#8217;t offer a very sound onboarding experience. With the latest move, the Uniswap DEX is planning to solve this exactly.</p>
<h3>Uniswap Partners With MoonPay</h3>
<p>In partnership with MoonPay, Uniswap will now allow users to transact in DeFi via the Uniswap Web App and buy crypto using any card and bank transfers. Users just need to connect their wallet to the Uniswap Web app and can buy crypto instantly. The DEX platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://uniswap.org/blog/web-fiat-on-ramp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re bringing you the best fiat on-ramp experience &#8211; no spread fees on USDC, the lowest processing fees in the market, and instant access!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Uniswap has also made it clear that they would not collect any financial information of their users such as credit card, debit card, and bank information. Besides, they also don&#8217;t collect any personally identifiable information for their users. Uniswap has also placed minimum and maximum caps for the purchase of different crypto and stablecoins.</p>
<p>After the purchase, users can see their digital assets in their wallets within minutes. So far, the off-ramp facility of moving crypto to a bank account isn&#8217;t available. But the DEX added that they are working on it.</p>
<p>Also, users cannot purchase NFTs directly using cards or bank accounts. They first need to purchase ETH and buy NFTs through it.</p>

Earlier, reports suggested that the billionaire was already in the hunt for his replacement. It may be recalled that Musk had fired former CEO Parag Aggarwal among others as his first official act since taking over as the company head. It remains to be seen how his favorite cryptocurrency <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/dogecoin/">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a> will perform if someone replaces Musk.</p>

<h2>Software And Servers</h2>
<p>In a reaction to the Twitter poll on his leadership, Musk said he will still have some oversight on the company even if someone takes charge as new CEO. In line with his aggressive approach in leading the social media company, Musk said he would like to lead the software and servers teams. This is regardless of if he continues to be the CEO or not. Also, it will be interesting to see how soon would Musk be able to find his replacement. It may be recalled that he said his role as Twitter CEO would be temporary.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that, I will just run the software &amp; servers teams.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Solana price prediction: a bearish breakdown of the month-long range setup puts Solana&#8217;s price in a longer correction. Thus, losing the $12.75 support may intensify the ongoing selling pressure and push the prices back to the last swing low of $11.35.

Thus, losing the $12.75 support may intensify the ongoing selling pressure and push the prices back to the last swing low of $11.35. But will this support replenish the bullish momentum or encourage prolonged downfall?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $12.75 breakdown sets Solana coin price for a 7.5% downfall.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An evident bullish divergence in the daily-RSI slope indicates a potential bullish reversal from $11.35</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Solana coin is $192 Million, indicating a 0.3% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/d/DaNmqCfB.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For nearly a month, the Solana price wobbled in a fixed range from $15 to $12.75. This long consolidation was supposed to bolster the coin price for higher recovery once it breached the overhead resistance of $15.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the recent sell-off in the crypto market triggered by <a href="https://coingape.com/massive-bnb-selling-amid-binance-fud-where-is-it-heading/">FUD surrounding Binance</a> and hearsay for US Fed to tighten interest rate hikes caused significant outflow in Solana coin. As a result, the coin price ended the range setup in the seller&#8217;s favor with a breakdown of $12.75 support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 16th, the Solana price breached the $12.75 support with increasing volume, indicating the sellers are aiming to visit lower levels. However, with the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market, this altcoin is stuck in a retest phase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the SOL price trades at $12.25 with an intraday gain of 2.35% Furthermore, the higher price rejection candle attached to this daily candle indicates the intense selling pressure from above.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this selling pressure persists, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> should eventually drop 7.5% lower to pierce the $11.35 support. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, if the recent selling pressure was solely due to panic selling in the market, the Solana price should rebound from the $11.35 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative strength index:</strong> Despite the sideways price action, the higher high movement in the daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> indicates growth in underlying bullishness and a higher possibility for price reversal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMA&#8217;s:</strong> the large gap between the crucial EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200) indicates the overall trend is bearish.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $12.7 and $15</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $11.35 and $10</span></li>
