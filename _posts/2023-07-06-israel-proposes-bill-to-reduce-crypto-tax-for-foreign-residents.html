<p>Israeli foreign residents may soon benefit from a tax exemption on the sale of digital currencies. </p>
<p>A new bill that would afford certain tax benefits to Israel&rsquo;s crypto sector has passed a preliminary reading in the Knesset, the country&rsquo;s parliament.</p>
<p>A proposed bill that would exempt foreign residents from capital gains tax on the sale of digital assets and reduce tax on crypto options from 50% to about 25% passed its preliminary reading on Wednesday.</p>
Israel Vies to Attract Investment
<p>The bill, sponsored by Knesset member Dan Illouz, has the full support of Israel&rsquo;s coalition government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Illouz explained the bill is part of a larger economic strategy to attract investors and companies to the country.</p>
<p>The bill&rsquo;s explanatory note details:</p>

<p>Despite the growth potential of Israeli companies in the field, the regulatory reality in Israel is not adapted to the digital currency industry. Therefore, it is proposed to make a number of legislative amendments that will reduce the regulatory gap.</p>

<p>If passed, the bill would grant tax benefits similar to those afforded to high-tech firms to Israel&rsquo;s crypto sector. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Illouz said in a press statement:</p>

<p>Up until now, workers in the crypto industry had to pay double the tax on their options compared to workers in the traditional high-tech industry. Moreover, foreign investors in the blockchain industry were not entitled to the same benefits as those entitled to investors in the traditional high-tech industry.</p>

<p>Adding,</p>

<p>This law amendment aims to balance the situation and eliminate the discrimination in taxation.</p>

<p>The bill further proposes that &ldquo;digital currency&rdquo; be used separately from &ldquo;security.&rdquo;</p>
Move Signals That Israel is Embracing Crypto
<p>The country&rsquo;s decision to equal taxation for crypto investors is a clear sign of actively embracing the industry.</p>
<p>Israel has been working toward integrating crypto into its economy. The country&rsquo;s central bank, the Bank of Israel, issued principles for regulating stablecoin activity in February.</p>
<p>The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange also revealed the Israeli government would conduct testing of a blockchain-based platform for issuing digital bonds. The project, dubbed &ldquo;Eden&rdquo;, aims to reduce costs and optimise the procedure of national bond issuance.</p>
<p>Israel&rsquo;s largest bank, Bank Leumi, also stated it would become the first Israeli bank to enable crypto trading, following a partnership with Paxos. The bank&rsquo;s digital platform, Pepper Invest, said that collaborating with Paxos would allow its customers to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrencies.</p>
