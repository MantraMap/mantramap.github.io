					<description><![CDATA[The latest Bitcoin price action has pushed momentum into the positive on just about every timeframe that matters: From today the daily through the monthly. If these signals confirm with a June monthly close, the train might have officially left the station when it comes to the next crypto bull run. BTCUSD Momentum Builds Across Multiple Timeframes Imagine a train that’s come to a complete stop. It’s a lot easier to board a train as it’s idle, and before it has gained momentum. Momentum starts off slow, then once the train really begins rolling it picks up seemingly unstoppable steam. Slowing back down takes force, time, and distance before it once again comes to a stop. Getting in the train’s path can prove dangerous. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breaks Above $30,000: Is The Bull Run Back On? If Bitcoin price can continue to climb through the end of June, strengthening bullish momentum will confirm across nearly every significant timeframe from the daily to the weekly to the monthly. That is according to the LMACD, which in the chart below shows the following timeframes forming a bullish crossover and buy signal: 1D, 3D, 1W, 2W, 3W, and 1M (clockwise).

					<description><![CDATA[The cryptocurrency Stacks (STX) has recently experienced a remarkable turnaround, with its price bouncing back after reaching a multi-month low of $0.4412. Investors have seized the opportunity to &#8220;buy the dip,&#8221; resulting in a continuous upward trend for STX over the past few days. As a result, STX is now trading at $0.7916, marking a significant 29% increase from its lowest level this month. Potential Catalysts For STX Two primary reasons drive the surge in Stacks&#8217; price. Firstly, the decision by Blackrock to file for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission has sparked positive sentiment. However, uncertainties remain regarding the acceptance of the iShares Bitcoin Trust, as Coinbase is slated to serve as the custodian of the coins. Furthermore, the ongoing conflict between Coinbase and the SEC adds to the regulatory uncertainty surrounding the situation. Related Readings: Bitcoin Just Gained Over 18% In Seven Days: What’s Happened When This Has Occurred In The Past? Furthermore, the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against major exchanges Binance and Coinbase is expected to benefit Bitcoin, as both regulatory agencies recognize Bitcoin as a commodity rather than a security. Consequently, many investors in alternative cryptocurrencies may shift their focus to the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Stacks, which is closely tied to Bitcoin&#8217;s ecosystem and enables the development of decentralized applications (dApps), stands to benefit from this changing investor sentiment. The expanding Stacks ecosystem is another significant factor contributing to the rise in STX price. Bitflow Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, recently introduced an sBTC/sBTC stableswap pool, enabling seamless token swaps. This development enhances the utility and adoption of Stacks, ultimately bolstering its positive price performance. What’s Next For Stacks? From a technical analysis standpoint, Stacks exhibits promising signals. The daily chart reveals the formation of a bullish falling wedge pattern, indicating a potential trend reversal. STX has also surpassed the 25-day exponential moving average and is currently testing the 50-day MA. Moreover, the breakthrough of the key resistance level at $0.5281, the lowest point in March, further reinforces the bullish sentiment. As buyers set their sights on the next resistance point at $0.90, a potential 9% increase from the current level, Stacks continues to attract attention. Related Readings: Mask Foundation Moves 2.5 Million Tokens To Exchanges, Huge Dip Incoming? The Stacks price is $0.79 at press time, reflecting a change of -2.10% over the past 24 hours. The recent price action has left Stacks&#8217; market capitalization at $1,101,401,654.52. Notably, Stacks has demonstrated an impressive 277.22% change since the beginning of the year, indicating its strong growth potential. STX serves as the native token of the Stacks blockchain, which operates as a layer 2 blockchain network leveraging the security of the Bitcoin blockchain for transaction settlement. With its unique positioning and robust ecosystem, Stacks continues to capture the attention of investors and developers alike.

					<description><![CDATA[The fate of Binance USD (BUSD), the stablecoin introduced by Binance, hangs in the balance as its market capitalization has experienced a significant decline of over 80% in 2023. From November 2022 to June of the current year, BUSD&#8217;s market capitalization has plummeted from USD23 billion to USD4 billion. Notably, the capitalization suffered an 18% loss in May alone, as reported by CCData, an analysis company. TrueUSD (TUSD) Gains Traction As BUSD Market Cap Declines As the market capitalization of BUSD continues to decline and reach a critical level, representing less than 5% of the overall stablecoin market capitalization, Binance has begun actively promoting the adoption of TrueUSD (TUSD). While TUSD&#8217;s market capitalization still falls slightly below that of BUSD, currently standing at over USD3.1 billion, it has surpassed BUSD in terms of trading volumes. According to data provided by CCData, the trading volumes of TUSD have tripled, indicating a growing interest and usage of the stablecoin. Related Reading: Mask Foundation Moves 2.5 Million Tokens To Exchanges, Huge Dip Incoming? TrueUSD (TUSD), introduced in 2017 by TrustToken, has emerged as the fifth-largest stablecoin in the market, trailing closely behind BUSD. Functioning as an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token, TUSD secures its value with dollar reserves deposited in multiple US-based banking entities. The company behind TUSD ensures a 1:1 convertibility with the US currency, instilling confidence in its stability and reliability among users. As BUSD&#8217;s market capitalization experiences a significant decline, the growing popularity and trading volumes of TUSD serve as a testament to the increasing demand for an alternative stablecoin option. Also, Binance&#8217;s shift towards promoting TUSD suggests a strategic response to the changing landscape of stablecoin usage and market dynamics. The steep decline in BUSD&#8217;s market capitalization can be attributed to its impending discontinuation. In February 2023, NewsBTC reported that Paxos would cease issuing the BUSD stablecoin due to an ongoing lawsuit filed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As per Paxos&#8217; official statement, BUSD will be redeemable until February 24, 2024, marking the potential date for its exit from the market. Investors Move To USDT As It Nears Its All-Time High Capitalization As the market capitalization of Tether (USDT) continues to rise steadily, approaching its all-time high, investors are taking notice and making strategic moves. According to data from CoinMarketCap, USDT&#8217;s current market capitalization stands at $82.9 billion (USD), close to its previous peak of $83.2 billion, reached in May 2022. This upward trajectory has prompted investors to diversify their portfolios and explore alternative stablecoin options.

Also, Investors are drawn to USDT due to its stability and pegging to the US dollar, offering a reliable store of value amidst market fluctuations. With its widespread acceptance and liquidity, USDT has become a preferred choice for traders, providing a convenient and secure means of preserving their capital during volatile market conditions. At press time, USDT was trading at $0.9780 per coin with a 24-hour price increase of 1.38%. Featured image from iStock, charts from Tradingview and CCData]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Gods Unchained, a blockchain card trading game developed by Immutable Studio, has launched on Epic Games Store (EGS). Following this launch, GODS, the native token of the Gods Unchained ecosystem, has rallied 50% from June 2023 lows, expanding in line with the broader cryptocurrency markets spearheaded by Bitcoin, which is currently trading above $31,000. Gods Unchained launches on Epic Games Store The game recently announced its debut on Epic Games Store, a digital gaming distribution platform with over 230 million PC gamers, including a community of digital trading card enthusiasts.  As one of the original web3 games, Gods Unchained has been at the forefront of decentralized gaming. Now, intending to attract more mainstream trading card game and strategy gamers, Gods Unchained is undergoing an update, with an updated logo and updated visuals across different points, which would launch with the Epic Games Store release. Related Reading: MATIC Price Recovery Hits Roadblock, When Will Bulls Break Through? The PC game also teased a mobile-friendly design focused on onboarding new users. In a comment about the launch Daniel Paez, the executive producer of Gods Unchained, said EGS will introduce the web3 game to a “massive audience of traditional PC gamers and TCG enthusiasts.&#8221; Blockchain gaming, NFT activity recovering The deployment on EGS is timely. Specifically, it is when the cryptocurrency market is recovering after months of lower lows in 2022. During the last bear cycle, cryptocurrency prices crashed from 2021 peaks, impacting activity. Out of this, there was a significant contraction in non-fungible tokens (NFT) activity, which translated to low activity. In the Gods Unchained blockchain games, all trading cards are represented as unique NFTs. These represent ownership and can be transferred between users, even exchanged for cash or other cryptocurrencies. Since trading cards vary in rarity, the value assigned to each can change. According to DappRadar, unique active wallets (UAWs) remain stable at around 1,150 but lower than 2021 peaks when it spiked to over 4,000. At the same time, Gods Unchained generated over $745,000 in active transaction values. At the moment, GODS, the native token of the Gods Unchained game, is rising in sync with the broader cryptocurrency market. GODS is trading at $0.16, up 50% from June lows. GODSUSDT Candlestick arrangement shows that the token is bottoming up after dropping 75% from February 2023 highs. Last year, Immutable Studio, the developer of Gods Unchained, had to let go of multiple employees, including a senior game designer James Wakeham. These restructuring efforts resulted in a 6% reduction in the company&#8217;s workforce, yet, Immutable Games remained optimistic about its future.

					<description><![CDATA[By the completion of its daily candle on Wednesday, Bitcoin had gained over 18% in just seven consecutive sessions, abruptly ending the steady drift lower which had dominated its price action since Bitcoin put in its mid-April high above 30,000. How unusual is this magnitude gain in only a week’s time, and what’s happened in the past after similarly robust rallies? Let’s take a closer look at Bitcoin’s price history to find out. Bitcoin’s Price History Suggests Higher Prices Ahead As we examine Bitcoin’s price history for which there is reliable data (2011 to the present), the number one cryptocurrency by market cap has experienced numerous instances of gains greater than or equal to +18% over the span of seven days. Bitcoin gains &#62;= 18% in Seven Days &#124; BTCUSD on TradingView.com Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovers Above Critical Level, Why Bulls Could Be Ready To Charge Because the number of occurrences will vary depending on holding time, we’ll start by listing the number of times this has happened next to our hypothetical hold times of 7 days through 90 days. Holding time is defined as the amount of time one held Bitcoin before exiting. For example, if one hypothetically purchased Bitcoin following the trigger event (i.e., +18% over the span of seven days) and sold it 30 days later, this would be a holding time of 30 days. Bitcoin Occurrences of +18% Gains in Seven Consecutive Days by Holding Time (2011 &#8211; Present) 98 occurrences using a 7-day hold time 73 occurrences using a 15-day hold time 57 occurrences using a 30-day hold time 30 occurrences using a 90-day hold time Clearly, gains of this magnitude in just a week’s time are not uncommon for Bitcoin, an asset with numerous instances of large price advances especially when considering its relatively short price history compared to traditional risk assets. Bitcoin Results Slightly Less Bullish In Recent Years While a gain of over 18% in such a brief time period may lead some traders to lean bearish, the data suggests otherwise, with historical average results clearly positive across the board for all holding times from 2011 to the present. &#160; Bitcoin gains &#62;= 18% in Seven Consecutive Days with Various Hold Times. 2011 &#8211; Present. Because Bitcoin’s early price history experienced arguably outsized gains relative to its more recent history, let’s take a look at average results for the same degree of gains in a week’s time but only examining data for the last five years (6/23/18 to the present). Bitcoin gains &#62;= 18% in Seven Consecutive Days with Various Hold Times. Last Five Years. While once again results are positive across the board, the hypothetical results over more recent data are significantly lower, with the average 90-day return of +25.6% over the past five years a far cry from the +109.4% returns for the same 90-day window over the full price history from 2011 to the present. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Surges 8% And Defies Gravity – Bulls Eye $30K While some traders may argue that the past five years is less representative data due to the occurrence of two major bear markets for Bitcoin and crypto more broadly, Bitcoin has shown positive follow through on average for both time periods across all the hold times we examined. While the past does not predict the future, the recent powerful price advance appears to suggest that Bitcoin is poised for greater gains in relatively near future.

For example, if one hypothetically purchased Bitcoin following the trigger event (i.e., +18% over the span of seven days) and sold it 30 days later, this would be a holding time of 30 days.

<p><strong>Bitcoin Occurrences of +18% Gains in Seven Consecutive Days by Holding Time (2011 &#8211; Present)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>98 occurrences using a 7-day hold time</li>
<li>73 occurrences using a 15-day hold time</li>
<li>57 occurrences using a 30-day hold time</li>
<li>30 occurrences using a 90-day hold time</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly, gains of this magnitude in just a week’s time are not uncommon for Bitcoin, an asset with numerous instances of large price advances especially when considering its relatively short price history compared to traditional risk assets.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Results Slightly Less Bullish In Recent Years</h2>
<p>While a gain of over 18% in such a brief time period may lead some traders to lean bearish, the data suggests otherwise, with historical average results clearly positive across the board for all holding times from 2011 to the present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Bitcoin gains &gt;= 18% in Seven Consecutive Days with Various Hold Times. 2011 &#8211; Present.
<p>Because Bitcoin’s early price history experienced arguably outsized gains relative to its more recent history, let’s take a look at average results for the same degree of gains in a week’s time but only examining data for the last five years (6/23/18 to the present).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-539437 aligncenter" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hold-Times_Last-5-Years2-460x285.png" alt="" width="460" height="285" srcset="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hold-Times_Last-5-Years2-460x285.png 460w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hold-Times_Last-5-Years2-860x534.png 860w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hold-Times_Last-5-Years2-768x477.png 768w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hold-Times_Last-5-Years2-750x465.png 750w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hold-Times_Last-5-Years2.png 975w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"/></p>
Bitcoin gains &gt;= 18% in Seven Consecutive Days with Various Hold Times. Last Five Years.
<p>While once again results are positive across the board, the hypothetical results over more recent data are significantly lower, with the average 90-day return of +25.6% over the past five years a far cry from the +109.4% returns for the same 90-day window over the full price history from 2011 to the present.</p>

<p>While some traders may argue that the past five years is less representative data due to the occurrence of two major bear markets for Bitcoin and crypto more broadly, Bitcoin has shown positive follow through on average for both time periods across all the hold times we examined. While the past does not predict the future, the recent powerful price advance appears to suggest that Bitcoin is poised for greater gains in relatively near future.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In the volatile and unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies, major transactions often signal impending market movements. Recently, Lookonchain, an on-chain analytics firm, reported a substantial transfer of MASK tokens, initiated by the Mask Network Foundation. According to their findings, the foundation moved nearly 3 million MASK tokens out of its wallets, an event that could potentially lead to significant market fluctuations. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $3.69, following a decline of over 2.5% over the past 24 hours. The noteworthy shift of 2.5 million MASK tokens, equating to over $9 million, could potentially trigger further price variations. Related Reading: DeFi Liquidity Pool: A Guide to Liquidity Pool Token The intent behind the substantial token transfer remains speculative, prompting varied interpretations within the crypto community. Mask Network Foundation transferred 3M $MASK ($11.25M) out today. Among them, 2.5M $MASK ($9.4M) was transferred to #Binance and #OKX. And 500K $MASK was transferred out 1 hour ago, which may be transferred to #OKX later.https://t.co/mBI4PbZaLa pic.twitter.com/BXQNceMuxs — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 23, 2023 Mask Network Foundation&#8217;s Large-scale Transfer According to Lookonchain, the Mask Network Foundation distributed 2.5 million tokens, which are worth more than $9 million, between Binance and OKX. An additional 500,000 tokens were also transferred out of the foundation&#8217;s wallets, but they have not yet surfaced on any exchange platform so far. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Continues To Rise While Market Sees Correction This particular move has led to speculations of an impending sell-off within the next 24-48 hours. Meanwhile, the transfer could signify the Mask Network Foundation&#8217;s strategy to bolster market-making activities. By moving a significant number of the tokens to exchange platforms, the foundation could be aiming to stimulate trading volume and attract a wider range of traders to the project. Despite the 2.5% drop in MASK&#8217;s value, the move could potentially stabilize the token&#8217;s price by fostering liquidity and demand in the market. While it&#8217;s too early to definitively predict the impact of these transactions on MASK&#8217;s market position, the movements undeniably indicate an upcoming shift in the MASK network token market. MASK&#8217;s Latest Price Action The MASK token price has increased in the past 7 days, with the token breaking multiple resistance levels. MASK is currently trading at $3.70, up by nearly 10% over the past week. However, over the past 24 hours, MASK has seen a slight decline down by 2.5%. Though it is not certain if there has been any huge sell-off yet of the tokens transferred to exchanges, the token has plunged from its 24-hour high of $3.84. The token currently has a market capitalization of $302.6 Million, making it rank 107th among the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. MASK&#8217;s daily trading volume has also significantly moved in the past 7 days. The token&#8217;s volume has surged from as low as $31 million last Friday to as high as $93 million in the past 24 hours.

					<description><![CDATA[As the world of crypto continues to evolve, traders and analysts are closely monitoring the Bitcoin (BTC) charts for clues about future price movements. Among them, the popular analyst known as Credible Crypto has shared his insights, predicting a new all-time high for Bitcoin by 2023. The prognosis relies on the assumption of a continuing &#8220;parabolic advance&#8221; that could drive the token beyond its previous peak of $69,000. Predicting A Parabolic Advance For Bitcoin The essence of Credible Crypto&#8217;s prediction lies in the nature of Bitcoin&#8217;s &#8220;parabolic advance.&#8221; This concept describes a situation where momentum in the price of an asset increases exponentially until it reaches its peak. Related Reading: Nansen Forecast For Bitcoin Bull Run: Regulatory Clarity And Lower Inflation According to Credible Crypto, such advances have been evident in Bitcoin&#8217;s history, as observed during its ascents from $3,000 to $14,000 and from $10,000 to $60,000.  Bitcoin’s recent performance, characterized by firm support at $25,000 on monthly timeframes, is considered by Credible Crypto as potentially setting the stage for another round of parabolic advance. This new climb, the analyst suggests, should produce monthly moves of more than $10,000, filling the $40,000 gap to the previous all-time high. A &#8216;Logical&#8217; Guess For New Heights While cautioning that these are estimations based on current market conditions, the trader puts forth October 2023 as a &#8220;fairly logical guesstimate&#8221; for when Bitcoin could reach its new all-time high. He clarifies that it&#8217;s not a definitive prediction, but rather an estimation based on the logic of Bitcoin&#8217;s past behavior.  The analyst noted: I am not saying we MUST hit new all-time highs by October, I AM saying I do think we will hit new ATH by the end of this year, and if someone forced me to pick a month in which I think this will occur it would be October. Let’s see how things play out. Meanwhile, over the past 7 days, Bitcoin has made significant moves. The asset has shown a huge recovery from its recent bloodbath amid the United States Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit on the two largest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. Bitcoin has tapped a notable high of above $30,000 bringing the asset to record a nearly 20% gain to its value in the past 7 days. Notably, BTC&#8217;s surge comes amid financial giants such as BlackRock embracing the crypto future. BlackRock, which is the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, last week disclosed its latest plan to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) if it gets approved by the US regulator, sparking an incredibly rally in the price of BTC. Related Reading: BlackRock Inches Closer To Launching Bitcoin ETF: Potential Impact On BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin currently trades above $30,000 after trading below that price range throughout last week. In the past 7 days, Bitcoin’s total market capitalization has also seen a boost of 18.1%, amounting to an additional $90 billion. The market capitalization of Bitcoin presently hovers at $585.2 billion, an increase from last Friday&#8217;s $494 billion. Featured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, seems to have entered a phase of consolidation above the $30,000 mark following a notable surge of over 10% on Tuesday.  While the price movement has generated a lot of interest among investors, it remains uncertain whether Bitcoin will maintain its upward momentum or experience a pullback in the coming days. Bitcoin Uncertain Trajectory Ben Lilly, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, and economist, recently shared his thoughts on the current state of Bitcoin&#8217;s price action and its potential future trajectory.  In a recent analysis, Lilly dubbed the current price movement the &#8220;Larry Fink Pump,&#8221; referencing the recent announcement by BlackRock&#8217;s CEO Larry Fink regarding the company&#8217;s increased interest and application for a  Bitcoin spot ETF. While the pump has caused some excitement among investors, Lilly notes that several factors could cause the rally to falter.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Suggests BTC Rally Is Far From Over For one, Bitcoin has already wiped out the remaining high-leverage liquidity to the upside, and the Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) spot seems to have lost its short-lived trend already.  Additionally, the fuel meter discussed in a recent Alpha Bites episode by Benjamin Skew of Jarvis Labs LLC has dropped significantly from its pre-pump levels, which could indicate a bearish case for Bitcoin in the short term. Despite these potential bearish factors, Lilly remains optimistic about Bitcoin&#8217;s future. He notes that the $24,000 level is still sitting there and could be had if the price breaks the 200-day moving average, which is currently creeping above it. If this happens, he predicts that Bitcoin could drop to $21,000-$22,000. However, Lilly also sees the possibility of an upside scenario for BTC. He notes that low-leverage liquidity sits at $32,000, and he would &#8220;love to see it taken out.&#8221;  Looking at the returns by trading session, he points out that the New York session seems to be leading the way. He notes that when the trend of the New York session ends, there&#8217;s a bit of a lag before the price responds to the downside, suggesting that the June options max pain of $25,000 may not happen. Lilly also highlights the recent increase in the whale holding chart, as seen in the chart below, which indicates that large Bitcoin holders, commonly referred to as whales, are once again accumulating the cryptocurrency.  This is the first time a trend like this has been observed since mid-January, suggesting that there may have been significant accumulation happening before the recent surge in BTC’s price. Related Reading: Is Chainlink The Most Undervalued Altcoin? It’s Do Or Die For LINK Overall, Lilly concludes that investors should not be quick to fade this Bitcoin rally. While there are potential bearish factors at play, there are also several bullish indicators. Investors should track the data to see if the trend continues and be prepared for potential volatility events in the future. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has maintained a stable price for several days. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $30,100 and has managed to stay in positive territory, with a slight increase of 0.6% over the past 24 hours.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, seems to have entered a phase of consolidation above the $30,000 mark following a notable surge of over 10% on Tuesday. </p>
<p>While the price movement has generated a lot of interest among investors, it remains uncertain whether Bitcoin will maintain its upward momentum or experience a pullback in the coming days.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Uncertain Trajectory</h2>
<p>Ben Lilly, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, and economist, recently <a href="https://twitter.com/MrBenLilly/status/1672085368777129986?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared his thoughts </a>on the current state of Bitcoin&#8217;s price action and its potential future trajectory. </p>
<p>In a recent analysis, Lilly dubbed the current price movement the &#8220;Larry Fink Pump,&#8221; referencing the recent announcement by BlackRock&#8217;s CEO Larry Fink regarding the company&#8217;s increased interest and application for a  Bitcoin spot ETF.</p>
<p>While the pump has caused some excitement among investors, Lilly notes that several factors could cause the rally to falter. </p>

<p>For one, Bitcoin has already wiped out the remaining high-leverage liquidity to the upside, and the Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) spot seems to have lost its short-lived trend already. </p>
<p>Additionally, the fuel meter discussed in a recent Alpha Bites episode by Benjamin Skew of Jarvis Labs LLC has dropped significantly from its pre-pump levels, which could indicate a bearish case for Bitcoin in the short term.</p>
<p>Despite these potential bearish factors, Lilly remains optimistic about Bitcoin&#8217;s future. He notes that the $24,000 level is still sitting there and could be had if the price breaks the 200-day moving average, which is currently creeping above it. If this happens, he predicts that Bitcoin could drop to $21,000-$22,000.</p>
<p>However, Lilly also sees the possibility of an upside scenario for BTC. He notes that low-leverage liquidity sits at $32,000, and he would &#8220;love to see it taken out.&#8221; </p>
<p>Looking at the returns by trading session, he points out that the New York session seems to be leading the way. He notes that when the trend of the New York session ends, there&#8217;s a bit of a lag before the price responds to the downside, suggesting that the June options max pain of $25,000 may not happen.</p>
<p>Lilly also highlights the recent increase in the whale holding chart, as seen in the chart below, which indicates that large Bitcoin holders, commonly referred to as whales, are once again accumulating the cryptocurrency. </p>

<p>This is the first time a trend like this has been observed since mid-January, suggesting that there may have been significant accumulation happening before the recent surge in BTC’s price.</p>

<p>Overall, Lilly concludes that investors should not be quick to fade this Bitcoin rally. While there are potential bearish factors at play, there are also several bullish indicators. Investors should track the data to see if the trend continues and be prepared for potential volatility events in the future.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin has maintained a stable price for several days. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $30,100 and has managed to stay in positive territory, with a slight increase of 0.6% over the past 24 hours.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitfinex’s utility token, LEO, stands out from the crowd with positive moves amid the market-wide downturn that suppressed most coins. It saw an 8.69% price increase on the day and added 11.42% over the past seven days, which placed it among the top-gaining coins on the last day. LEO token’s move today follows a consistent price increase since June 20, after Bitfinex announced a public grant to support the open-source development of Qubes OS in partnership with Tether, USDT stablecoin issuer. LEO Outperforms Top Coins With Recent Action LEO&#8217;s value did not only strengthen against the dollar but outperformed the two market forerunners, Bitcoin and Ethereum, in terms of 24-hour price change. At the time of writing, LEO is up 9% against Bitcoin and nearly 8% against Ethereum. The bullish momentum presented in LEO&#8217;s price movement suggests a move to conquer the $4 psychological level.  Related Reading: Is Chainlink The Most Undervalued Altcoin? It’s Do Or Die For LINK The token&#8217;s price stalled at the consolidation channel between $3.51 and $3.6 over the past weeks. But currently, LEO is trading at a low of $3.63 and a high of $3.93. Also, its bull-bear power is neutral, indicating a fierce struggle to prevail between the bears and the bulls as the histogram bars show long green candle stick patterns. Notably, the token has bounced off the 200 Exponential Moving Average, indicating a golden cross, meaning LEO is witnessing an upward trend due to a strong buying interest. It also suggests the bulls are in action to trigger a further uptrend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has exceeded 78, meaning the asset is leaving the overbought territory. This move indicates that LEO&#8217;s price is approaching a swing rejection where it could break its last record high. BitFinex/Tether Grant May Have Influenced LEO’s Price Momentum Qubes OS is a free, open-source security-oriented desktop operating system that touts itself as a reasonably secure OS. It allows users to secure through compartmentalization. And Qubes OS aims to provide security and enhanced privacy through isolation.  Bitfinex and Tether&#8217;s 100,000 USDT grant highlights went toward the company to support projects that drive the development of secure and decentralized technologies. In a statement, Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Tether and Bitfinex, said the firms recognize that privacy and security are paramount in the digital age. Related Reading: Stacks (STX) Succumbs To Market Correction, Slides By 10% In The Last Day Also, the LEO token&#8217;s price move could have gained momentum through the brief market rebound over the last 48 hours. As of yesterday, June 22, LEO closed with a 0.6% price increase when the global crypto market capitalization improved by 3%. Although the market retraced slightly, LEO’s momentum only peaked, suggesting stronger market forces at play.
