The Bitcoin price regained the $29,000 mark today for the first time since last Thursday. The decisive impulse was provided yesterday by the news that with First Republic Bank the next big bank in the US is about to be seized by the US Federal Reserve and FDIC. As was the case after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the news triggered a rally for Bitcoin that initially catapulted the price above the crucial $27,800 resistance level before a brief consolidation and then continuation of the price surge took place. With the reaction, Bitcoin is strengthening its digital gold narrative. As analyst James V. Straten predicts, the correlation between Bitcoin and gold will continue to increase as interest rates remain high and weak banks are purged. Even on a 30-day rolling average, the correlation stands at 57%, its highest level in almost 2 years.

According to Choi, the second wave of bank failures, led by First Republic Bank, will cause the Fed to pump more liquidity into the financial system. The &#8220;market is a liquidity junkie and already pricing this in.&#8221; As Bitcoinist reported today, the M2 money supply has fallen to a historic 90-year low. Every time money has been slashed to this extent in the history of the United States, there has been a recession and banking crisis.
