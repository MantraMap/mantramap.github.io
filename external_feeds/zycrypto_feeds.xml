<p>Bitcoin has continued to come under pressure, tagging along with Ether and other cryptocurrencies amid regulatory concerns for the crypto sector and profit-taking activities.</p>



<p>At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $27,978, down 8.06% since it tapped a ten-month high of $31,000 on April 14. On the other hand, Ether was exchanging hands at $1,859, down just over 13% in the past week, with <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-dogecoin-and-cardano-mount-center-stage-this-month-heres-what-to-expect/">most altcoins</a> being hammered a little bit more.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s gradual decline has led some analysts to focus on cues to help foretell its next possible move.</p>



<p>According to Brian Q, senior market analyst at Santiment, investors should look out for Bitcoin’s utility metric even as the cryptocurrency gets torn between revisiting $30,000 or $25,000. In his view, <em>“without a rising number of coins moving from address to address, and without a rising number of addresses interacting with those rising coins, most price rallies are historically short-lived.”</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80159" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>He further noted that bull traps often occur when prices rise quickly but utility lags, a scenario that arose in the first quarter of 2023.</p>



<p><em>“Traders become FOMO&#8217;ers and buy into the inflating market caps, and then get blindsided when the rally comes to a quick halt shortly after they bought. We can see that this occurred with the 3-month pump at the beginning of 2023,” </em>he added<em>.</em></p>



<p>On that note, Brian highlighted three more metrics traders should watch out for in determining Bitcoin’s utility. According to him, traders should closely monitor trading volume, daily active addresses, and circulation. While these metrics have not been impressive recently, he emphasised that on-chain utility conditions need to improve for the cryptocurrency’s price to recover.</p>



<p>Despite utility metrics displaying lacklustre behaviour, other vital metrics such as whale activity and the market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) have been surging, suggesting increasing interest in Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Today, crypto analyst Hoss shared a chart by Glassnode showing that whales with more than 10,000 BTC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/data-highlights-massive-btc-accumulation-by-whales-as-extreme-fear-grips-bitcoin-price/">have been accumulating</a> rapidly while smaller addresses are selling.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the MVRV, an indicator that has historically proven excellent at detecting major tops or bottoms, has recently tapped an 11-month high. This observation was made today by Gaah, an analyst for Santiment who expressed hope for its continued rise.</p>



<p><em>“There is still room to continue the Bitcoin price recovery, causing MVRV to reach the yellow line (intermediate region &#8211; trend transition phase) around 2.10,” </em>he wrote.</p>



<p><em>“By projecting the market behaviour of the last bear market in 2018, the Bitcoin price later this year 2023 has great chances to reach $45,000 and build a bullish structure transitioning between the bear market to a new bull market,” </em>he went on, adding that <em>“the probability of new highs in 2023 is still there.”</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="1200" height="700" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ethereum-Transitions-Into-A-Proof-of-Stake-Blockchain-After-Successful-Merge.jpg" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Ethereum Transitions Into A Proof of Stake Blockchain After Successful Merge" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ethereum-Transitions-Into-A-Proof-of-Stake-Blockchain-After-Successful-Merge.jpg 1200w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ethereum-Transitions-Into-A-Proof-of-Stake-Blockchain-After-Successful-Merge-300x175.jpg 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ethereum-Transitions-Into-A-Proof-of-Stake-Blockchain-After-Successful-Merge-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ethereum-Transitions-Into-A-Proof-of-Stake-Blockchain-After-Successful-Merge-768x448.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div>
<p>The price of Ether (ETH) has taken a significant hit in the past few days, dropping by over 13% after tapping a ten-month high of $2,137 earlier this month. Over the past 24 hours, ETH has fallen by 1.4% and was trading at $1,826 at press time, as per CoinMarketCap data.</p>



<p>Ether’s recent price action can largely be attributed to the Shanghai or <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-and-bitcoin-prices-hold-steady-post-shanghai-upgrade/">Shapella upgrade</a>, which was implemented on April 12. The event enabled withdrawals of approximately $34 billion worth of tokens locked on Ethereum’s staking contracts, marking the network’s complete transition to a fully functional proof-of-stake network.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ether-withdrawals-soar"><strong>Ether Withdrawals Soar</strong></h2>



<p>Almost two weeks after Shanghai, Ethereum’s metrics have continued to shine, with 1,668,384 ETH worth just over $3 billion being withdrawn so far, as per data by Dune Analytics. Notably, around 65% of the total ETH withdrawn so far comes from partial withdrawals, while the rest is from full withdrawals.</p>



<p>According to Tom Wan, an analyst at crypto research firm 21 Shares, most Ether withdrawals seem to be coming from centralized exchanges such as Kraken and Coinbase.</p>



<p>According to the pundit, Monday-April 24, had the most full withdrawals, with (278.2k) ETH flowing into Kraken, Coinbase, and Cream. At just over 870,000 ETH, Kraken and Coinbase account for the majority (78.3%) of the principal withdrawals.</p>



<p>However, Kraken&#8217;s leading withdrawal count can be attributed to regulatory scrutiny, which has forced it to shut down its staking services for US citizens. Since Shanghai, Kraken has received 598k $ETH ($1.1B) in both partial and full withdrawals.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Institutions Throng to ISPs</strong></h2>



<p>Meanwhile, as CEXs continue taking out their Ether, the number of coins sent to staking pools has surged gradually. In addition to the Merge, which saw Ethereum shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) in September 2022, the Shanghai upgrade has further sparked the interest of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-shanghai-upgrade-could-spark-decentralization-in-staking-as-big-guns-are-forced-to-step-back/">institutional investors</a> in the second largest cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>According to Wan, Institutional Staking Providers (ISPs) have witnessed significant inflows of ETH staked “as Shanghai has reduced the liquidity risk for investors.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Sunday, the analyst highlighted a chart showing the five leading staking service providers for institutional investors &#8211; Bitcoin Suisse, Figment, Kiln, Staked.us, and Stakefish &#8211; have collectively staked 224,000 ETH (About $410 million) in the last 30 days.</p>



<p>Furthermore, institutional investors seem also to be eyeing Ether’s attractive staking rewards even as they continue to bet on higher prices.</p>

<p>Early Bitcoin investor and industry proponent Chamath Palihapitiya, who declared about two years ago that Bitcoin had <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-has-effectively-replaced-gold-billionaire-venture-capitalist-chamath-palihapitiya-declares/">usurped gold</a> and forecasted the leading cryptocurrency would skyrocket to the $200,000 level, is now taking a more cautious approach toward crypto assets.</p>



<p>The billionaire businessman claims that the American crypto market now faces potential extinction due to increasing regulatory pressure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crypto-is-dead-in-america"><strong>“Crypto Is Dead In America”</strong></h2>



<p>The U.S. crypto market is in great peril.</p>



<p>This is what Warren Buffett disciple Chamath Palihapitiya suggested during a recent episode of the <em>All-In Podcast</em> alongside fellow investors Jason Calacanis, David Sacks, and David Friedberg. Palihapitiya, who is the founder and CEO of Social Capital, a California-based venture capital firm, noted that regulators in the United States have “firmly pointed their guns at crypto”. He added that this could lead to the demise of the fledgling crypto sector within the nation.</p>



<p>It will be recalled that the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, last week tied the implosion of Silvergate and Signature Bank to their bitcoin activities while testifying before a House financial services committee. “You had Gensler even blaming the banking crisis on crypto,” Palihapitiya opined.</p>



<p>The SEC has been breathing heavily down Bitcoin’s neck in recent months following the unprecedented collapse of the now-defunct digital asset exchange FTX last November, which sent shockwaves throughout Washington DC, where disgraced founder Sam Bankman-Fried had become a key political donor.</p>



<p>The SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-action-against-coinbase-triggers-ballistic-reaction-from-crypto-community/">sent </a>a Wells Notice to the publicly-listed Coinbase exchange in March, basically warning the company of impending enforcement action due to potential violations of U.S. securities law. In Palihapitiya&#8217;s opinion, despite Coinbase’s efforts to play by the rules and attempts to work with regulators, it has encountered challenges in obtaining requisite licenses. By contrast, fraudulent companies like FTX have come closer to acquiring a license.</p>



<p><em>“[Crypto companies are] probably the ones that were the most threatening to the establishment, and they were the ones that, in fairness to the regulators, did push the boundaries more than any other sector of the startup economy. So now, they’re paying the price for that. The bill has come due for them,&#8221; Palihapitiya stated.</em></p>



<p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-ceo-is-considering-relocating-company-outside-of-the-u-s-due-to-unfavorable-regulation/">hinted </a>last week that he would consider relocating the company away from the U.S. if the country does not create a clearer rulebook for the crypto market.</p>



<p>The former Facebook executive Palihapitiya was an early investor in Bitcoin (he bought a million BTC for $80 in 2010). He also speculated in 2017 that the value of Bitcoin could reach a whopping million dollars within two decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin is currently changing hands at around $27,681, down by 60.21% from its $69,044 historic record set in November 2021.</p>

<p>Standard Chartered says the fierce crypto winter is finally over. According to the banking giant, there’s nothing but blue sky between here and its $100,000 <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-analyst-sights-100000-for-bitcoins-near-term-price-after-this-pattern-surfaced/">bitcoin price projection</a>.</p>



<p>If the bank is right, the flagship cryptocurrency could hit the six-figure price tag by the end of 2024.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-btc-will-have-hit-100-000-by-2024-year-end-standard-chartered"><strong>BTC Will Have Hit $100,000 By 2024 Year End: Standard Chartered</strong></h2>



<p>With crypto winter finally over, Standard Chartered Bank believes Bitcoin, the world’s oldest and biggest cryptocurrency, will cost $100,000 per single coin by 2024.</p>



<p>In a Monday research report, Geoff Kendrick, the bank&#8217;s head of digital assets research, pointed to several factors that could push BTC to the $100K milestone. The most significant of which is the banking sector turmoil which helped “re-establish bitcoin’s use as a decentralized scarce digital asset.”</p>



<p>“Against this backdrop, bitcoin has benefited from its status as a branded safe haven, a perceived relative store of value, and a means of remittance,” Kendrick wrote.</p>



<p>The Standard Chartered analyst also cited the stabilization of risk assets as the U.S. Federal Reserve approaches the end of its tightening cycle as another potential catalyst for Bitcoin’s climb to the coveted $100,000 mark. “While BTC can trade well when risky assets suffer, correlations to the Nasdaq suggest that it should trade better if risky assets improve broadly,” the report noted.</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s supply is halved every four years, making the OG cryptocurrency twice as rare. The next halving is in 2024, which makes Standard Chartered believe the incoming event will give Bitcoin a major lift. “As we approach the next halving, we expect cyclical drivers to become more constructive, as they have in previous cycles,” Kendrick stated.</p>



<p>Bitcoin has gained over 63% since the beginning of 2023. However, the asset’s performance over the past week has faced considerable fluctuations, with a high of around $30,502 on April 15 and a low of $27,045 on April 24.</p>



<p>Standard Chartered predicted in December 2022 that Bitcoin could plummet to as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-risks-crashing-to-5000-in-2023-standard-chartereds-chief-strategist-warns/">low as $5,000</a>. The latest prediction suggests that the banking group is now ultra-bullish on the bellwether crypto.</p>



<p>In the report on Monday, Standard Chartered also identified the possibility of Bitcoin’s dominance rebounding to the 50-60% range. The top crypto’s share of the total cryptocurrency market currently stands at around 44.1%, according to CoinGecko.</p>



<p>Bitcoin is trading hands at $27,256.38 at the time of publication — down over 10% in the past week. For now, the psychological barrier remains at $30,000.</p>

<ul>
<li>Coinbase has asked a federal court to compel the Securities and Exchange Commission to respond to a petition against the body seeking regulatory clarity.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase noted that the actions of the SEC show that the commission is set to continue with its aggressive approach to regulation.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Pundits and legal experts around the digital asset space have hailed the petition as a step in the right direction as &#8220;the<em> best form of defense is attack.”&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulatory approach has come under fire by crypto executives and commentators in recent months after the commission filed actions against firms without clear-cut regulations.</p>



<p>Coinbase has <a href="https://www.coinbase.com//blog/coinbase-takes-another-formal-step-to-seek-regulatory-clarity-from-sec-for">filed</a> a suit against the SEC demanding a response from the commission over a petition filed in July 2022. The petition sought clarity on whether digital assets would be treated in line with the current framework for traditional assets. </p>



<p>“&#8230;<em>propose and adopt rules to govern the regulation of securities that are offered and traded via digitally native methods,” </em>a section of tthe petition reads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest move by the American exchange giant comes after the chairman of the SEC, Gary Gensler, insisted during a Committee hearing in Congress that there are rules in place to regulate digital assets, with the Commission requiring more funds and manpower. </p>



<p>Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase, stated that the actions of the SEC show that it plans to deny the petition but it should do so to the public.</p>



<p>“<em>From the SEC&#8217;s public statements and enforcement activity in the crypto industry, it seems like the SEC has already made up its mind to deny our petition. But they haven&#8217;t told the public yet. So the action Coinbase filed today simply asks the court to ask the SEC to share its decision,” </em>he said.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-attack-is-the-last-card-on-the-table">Attack is the last card on the table</h2>



<p>The action filed by Coinbase is the first formal swipe against the SEC after it was served with a Wells Notice with growing concerns over litigation with the commission. In recent months, the SEC has mounted pressure on exchanges and digital asset firms in its regulatory enforcement strategy.</p>



<p>Kraken came under the SEC’s radar and subsequently agreed to cease its staking operation in the US in part of a $30 million settlement. Despite these cases, digital asset firms mull over the lack of clarity in regulation in the US.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Coinbase does not take any litigation lightly, especially when it relates to one of our regulators. Regulatory clarity is overdue for our industry,&#8221; </em>Grewal added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital asset lawyer Jeremy Hogan is among commentators who <a href="https://twitter.com/attorneyjeremy1/status/1650677446604214272?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">hailed</a> the move by Coinbase as a positive step adding that <em>&#8220;the best defense is a good offense.”</em></p>

<p>While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) considers LUNA, the native token of the Terra ecosystem, a security, a court in South Korea has declared that it does not have attributes of a financial investment product regulated by the Capital Markets Act.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-security-violation-charges-against-terra-co-founder-dismissed"><strong>Security Violation Charges Against Terra Co-Founder Dismissed</strong></h2>



<p>According to local reports, the southern district court in Seoul has dismissed charges of securities violations against the co-founder of collapsed crypto issuer Terraform Labs Daniel Shin.</p>



<p>The court indicated in the judgment that LUNA (now LUNC) was a non-security under the Korean Capital Markets Act. South Korean prosecutors charged Shin, who left Terraform Labs in March of 2020 to focus on payments app Chai, with allegedly extracting illegal profits as he dumped $105 million of the LUNA token at a market top without notifying investors. The authorities were also seeking an arrest warrant for Shin, arguing that LUNA constitutes a financial investment security.</p>



<p>However, the judge has reportedly said, “It is difficult to see Luna Coin as a financial investment product regulated by the Capital Markets Act.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the latest ruling, the court also rejected the prosecutor&#8217;s request to seize the accused’s assets and arrest based on securities law infringements. The Seoul Southern District Court explained that it was hard to see that the property subject to the allegation had been “acquired by crime or an asset derived from it.&#8221; </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Fall Of Do Kwon</strong></h2>



<p>Some crypto pundits thought Do Hyeong Kwon — popularly known as Do Kwon — his algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD and its sister token LUNA would take them to the promised land. But then the stablecoin veered away from its dollar peg. Everything unravelled. Over $50 billion evaporated. Life savings were erased.</p>



<p>An arrest warrant had been issued for Do Kwon, who co-founded Terraform Labs with Shin in 2018. Kwon, who had been on the run from authorities since the stunning implosion of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022, was finally <a href="https://zycrypto.com/terras-luna-sees-selloff-following-founder-do-kwons-arrest-in-montenegro/">apprehended </a>by Montenegrin police last month for trying to travel with a fake passport. The SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/do-kwon-terraform-labs-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-alleging-securities-fraud/">charged </a>the South Korean native with violating securities law following his apprehension. Notably, Kwon’s lawyers are pushing to have these SEC charges dismissed.</p>



<p>Kwon recently<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-17/do-kwon-loses-bid-to-block-sec-from-seeking-singapore-records?leadSource=uverify%20wall"> suffered a legal blow</a> as a United States judge denied his plea to bar the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from obtaining certain records related to Terraform Lab’s operations in Singapore.</p>



<p>The former Terraform Labs CEO currently faces criminal fraud charges brought against him by U.S. prosecutors and charges relating to violating the Capital Markets Act back home in South Korea. Both the U.S. and South Korea have requested the extradition of the fallen crypto star, but he will likely first face trial in Montenegro.</p>

<p>Cardano whales did not take a single break during the weekend. According to key metrics, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-impressive-fundamentals-fuel-speculation-for-ada-reaching-1-price-milestone/">Cardano</a> is on fire as transactions carried out on the network continue to skyrocket.</p>



<p>Active <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-primed-for-massive-boom-as-ada-whales-network-activity-heats-up/">ADA whales</a> can be credited for this development, mainly because they make up the “big hands” in the market and have mostly contributed to the spike in large transactions. Taking to Twitter, an analyst in the crypto market spotlighted whale movements on the network. His tweet revealed how whale transactions have surged in recent times.</p>



<p>Per the data shared by the analyst, the number of large transactions on the network surged past 3,000 last week. Around this time, ADA transactions exceeding $100,000 on the Cardano network rose.</p>



<p>Although a slight dip was recorded later, an upward correction followed, and transactions skyrocketed to new levels in April. On April 1st, large transactions hit 4,000. Whales managed to push through the bumpy ride, and transactions neared 5,000 on the 11th of April and are now on their way to crossing those levels.</p>



<p><em>“Large ADA transactions are on the rise, suggesting that Cardano network activity is heating up as institutional players and whales make their moves.This is a bullish sign supporting the ADA uptrend!” The analyst wrote.</em></p>



<p>As the analyst asserted, the ongoing development might be linked to the rising interest rate in Cardano from institutional players in the market. Notably, Grayscale Investments, the world&#8217;s largest digital currency asset manager, rebalanced its funds in the first quarter of 2023. </p>



<p>In the most recent fund component weightings, Cardano is now at 28.31%. This marks an upsurge in component weightings for Cardano from the previous year.</p>



<p>With Grayscale holding significant space for Cardano in its Smart Contract Platform Ex-Ethereum Fund (GSCPxE Fund), exposure to institutional players could undoubtedly increase.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) has had a commendable run for the past month. The asset is among a few others securing monthly gains past 10%. Cardano (ADA) has managed to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum ( ETH), with monthly gains going up to 17%; the second highest, behind Solana (SOL). </p>



<p>Although Cardano ( ADA) was pushed to the red zone in the last hours, gains from the last 72 hours still sit at 3.44% at the time of this report. Cardano (ADA) now trades at a press time price of $0.38.</p>

<p>On April 23, 2011, the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, sent his final emails to fellow developers in which he made it clear he had “moved on to other projects,” at the time handing over a cryptographic key he had used to send network-wide alerts.</p>



<p>Fast forward to April 2023, and the Bitcoin story is, in many ways, still just starting. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-message-from-satoshi-nakamoto"><strong>The Message From Satoshi Nakamoto</strong></h2>



<p>12 years ago, the pseudonymous Bitcoin founder penned one of the final correspondences with a friend. The mysterious creator conveyed in his final email that they had “moved on to other things” and confidently proclaimed that the Bitcoin project was entrusted in “good hands” with software developer Gavin Andreesen and “everyone”. Notably, nobody has been able to track down the projects that Nakamoto moved to ever since.</p>



<p>After handing over control of the Bitcoin source code repository to Gavin, Satoshi Nakamoto completely disappeared from the public eye.</p>



<p>As projected, Bitcoin has evolved from an obscure, esoteric project to a trillion-dollar decentralized financial behemoth in the years since its creator’s departure.</p>



<p>Now heralded by governments, politicians, financial institutions, and corporations, the flagship cryptocurrency is in the midst of a mainstream moment. Yet, Satoshi’s identity remains a mystery, and their BTC stockpile of over 1 million remains unmoved. </p>



<p>Australian entrepreneur Craig Steve Wright is mired in a protracted legal fight that hinges on his being able to access crypto wallets allegedly belonging to Satoshi. Multiple pieces of evidence claiming to strengthen Wright&#8217;s claim, including PGP keys, have been disputed, and many in the community are unconvinced that he is the pseudonymous creator.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pressure To Change Bitcoin Code</strong></h2>



<p>Though Bitcoin has yet to live up to all the tenets of Satoshi’s original 2008 white paper, its established monetary policy has made it an appealing store of value for investors.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, a section of industry pundits has made calls to change Bitcoin’s code. Chris Larsen, the billionaire founder of Ripple, for instance, backed a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-creator-chris-larsen-launches-crusade-aimed-at-changing-bitcoins-code/">controversial campaign</a> to persuade the Bitcoin community to alter the network’s existing code and remove its proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm, which requires miners to solve complex puzzles to validate transactions and secure the network, in favour of the less energy-intensive proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-merge-goes-live-and-a-new-era-for-ethereum-begins-heres-the-whole-bushel/">executed </a>this change, which resulted in a 99.9% reduction in total energy use.</p>



<p>Although Bitcoin’s environmental impact has been a subject of debate for years, Larsen’s proposal to follow Ether’s footsteps and change the system designed by Satoshi Nakamoto was strongly rejected by Bitcoiners.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Shanghai update has been implemented in the Ethereum blockchain giving validators access to their staked assets and rewards.</li>



<li>The SEC and CFTC hounding down on the staking arm of digital asset companies will lead to decentralization in the wake of the Shanghai upgrade.</li>



<li>Analysts and users on most centralized trading platforms express mixed feelings concerning the new developments in staking.</li>
</ul>



<p>The Shanghai upgrade has been lauded in several quarters around the cryptocurrency space and is billed to spark new regulatory concerns as users begin to withdraw their staked assets.</p>



<p>After the much anticipated Merge which hit the Ethereum (ETH) network last year, the blockchain transitioned to a proof-of-stake (PoS) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-merge-goes-live-and-a-new-era-for-ethereum-begins-heres-the-whole-bushel/">consensus</a> mechanism replacing miners with validators. With a minimum staking threshold of 32 ETH, average ETH holders were not able to become validators until the emergence of centralized staking through exchanges.</p>



<p>Over 30% of staked ETH is facilitated by exchanges, with Kraken, Coinbase, and Binance leading the pack. Despite being the game-change in attracting over 18 million ETH in months, it raised centralization concerns coupled with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) going after exchanges regarding their staking activities.</p>



<p>In February, Kraken reached an agreement with the SEC to halt its staking service in the US as part of its $30 million settlement with the Commission. Marco Santori, Kraken’s legal officer, stated that the settlement would be completed after locked assets became available. </p>



<p>Users outside the United States can keep their assets with Kraken and continue staking on Ethereum, as the settlement only applies within the US. The SEC has also expressed that its staked assets could be categorized as securities because they are locked up in anticipation of a profit-making.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-there-a-silver-lining-to-this-decentralization-approach"><strong>Is there a silver lining to this decentralization approach?</strong></h2>



<p>Most users would prefer validation on the blockchain to be completely decentralized without entities dictating the pace with their centralized staking pools. However, this is not attainable at least for now, because the minimum requirement to become a validator is 32 ETH, a sum too high for the average user.</p>



<p>Kraken is not the only platform to be affected by regulatory bodies, as Coinbase and Binance face their own with the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), respectively. Coinbase <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-action-against-coinbase-triggers-ballistic-reaction-from-crypto-community/">received</a> a Wells Notice in March raising concerns over some products, including its staking program, Coinbase Earn.</p>



<p>Although a lawsuit has not been filed, the company says it is ready for anything while informing customers that there is a need for patience while expecting their assets after the Shanghai upgrade.</p>



<p>“<em>Customers may need to remain patient. We anticipate the Ethereum protocol will take weeks to months to process unstaking requests immediately following the upgrade,”</em> the company wrote.</p>



<p>In a nutshell, some commentators argue that the SEC is trying to make staking completely decentralized, where users deal directly with the protocols without staking pools.</p>

<p>After a steady decline since Wednesday, Bitcoin traded flatly throughout the weekend despite recovering slightly on Saturday. In the past week, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization has lost over 8% of its value. At press time, BTC was trading at $27,644, up 1.27% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-9-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80078" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-9-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-9-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-9-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-9-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-9-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-is-bitcoin-falling"><strong>Why is Bitcoin Falling?</strong></h2>



<p>Apart from crypto-industry-focused uncertainties that have afflicted the wider digital asset market, Bitcoin’s gradual descent can be attributed to the selling activities of miners.</p>



<p>On Sunday, “Tarek”, an analyst for Cryptoquant, noted that Bitcoin’s drop has brought its price closer to the cost of mining, which is currently around $27,200. This has prompted miners to offload their coins, resulting in downward pressure on the cryptocurrency&#8217;s value.</p>



<p><em>“We notice an increase in the miner outflow index and the selling index of miners, along with a decrease in miners&#8217; reserve. All of this indicates selling pressure from miners during the past few days,”</em> he wrote, sharing a Bitcoin Miners Position Index (MPI) chart, which has been increasing.</p>



<p>He, however, advised investors against panicking, noting that he expects the selling pressure to subside around $27,200-$26,600.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>“Local Top” is in for Bitcoin</strong></h2>



<p>JA Maartum, another Cryptoquant analyst, notes the recent uptick in the activity of movement of “ancient” Bitcoin or dormant addresses could signal a “local top” for Bitcoin.</p>



<p>In trading, a local top refers to a point in an asset&#8217;s price chart where the price peaks before starting to decline. This peak represents a level of resistance where the price has trouble breaking through and continuing to rise. After reaching the local top, the price typically retraces, creating a short-term bearish trend.</p>



<p>According to Maartum, while it’s rare for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/an-ancient-bitcoin-stash-worth-7-8-million-just-moved-after-a-decade-of-slumber/">dormant addresses</a> to be moving around, considering they are still significantly profitable in dollar terms at current market prices, they occasionally re-enter circulation to take profits.</p>



<p><em>“This is a rare occurrence, and it typically happens around market tops (when the market crashes) or bottoms (when old Bitcoin capitulates, such as during the FTX crash). And it happened yesterday as well. 6,000 BTC with an age between 7 and 10 years moved. This could be a sign of a local top,” </em>he wrote<em>.</em></p>



<p>That said, while Bitcoin has been experiencing a minor correction, various experts expect the cryptocurrency to bounce back soon, considering that most fundamentals remain strong. According to Caleb Franzen, a senior market analyst at Cubic Analytics, Bitcoin needs to reclaim $27,820 to establish a bullish move.</p>



<p>In a recent post, the pundit highlighted the cryptocurrency’s 12 and 24-month Williams %R oscillators, which he noted are no longer &#8220;oversold&#8221;. According to him, this has “<em>historically meant that the lows of the BTC bear market are in &amp; that a new bull market is starting.”</em></p>

<p>The once-loved crypto figure turned villain is now at the center of the head following a heated debate with the United States Congress on regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At a hearing in the House Financial Service Committee, lawmakers probed the regulatory approach of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) led by Gary Gensler. In the course of the hearing, Gensler noted that the digital asset industry is fast-paced, making it more difficult for the Commission to track.</p>



<p>Republican lawmakers were not having any of that defence as they lashed out at the Commission for not being decisive on rule-making and spurring confusion in the market which has hurt companies along with investors. Rep Tom Emmer took a direct swipe at Gensler with these words. </p>



<p><em>“You’ve been an incompetent cop on the beat.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Taking the criticism a step further, Emmer noted that the current approach of the SEC is pushing start-ups and other American firms to the “<em>hands of the Chinese Communist Party.” </em>He went on the accuse Gensler of creating no rules in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>During your tenure at the SEC, how many rules has the SEC finalized that actually accommodate the existing regulatory framework and are specifically for the digital asset industry so that the crypto market can come into compliance?……… the answer is zero,” </em>he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gensler has been under fire from digital asset executives and their communities for many controversial regulatory decisions including looking to classify assets as securities.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gensler-remains-undeterred">Gensler remains undeterred&nbsp;</h2>



<p>A group of Republican lawmakers criticized Gensler before the hearing through a letter highlighting that digital asset firms&#8217; lack of compliance is the SEC&#8217;s fault. The letter noted that the lack of clear rules had created non-existent registration processes, and the only entity to blame was the SEC.</p>



<p>Responding to the harsh criticisms received from lawmakers, the SEC chairman restated his commitment to improving the current regulatory framework around digital assets. Gensler stated the need for more resources and manpower to keep up with the fast-changing industry effectively.</p>



<p>“<em>In terms of digital assets, we could certainly use more resources,” </em>said Gensler.<em> “Definitely there are more things to look at and investigate than we have people on the staff to do.”</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="1200" height="700" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Mammoth-BTC-Whale-The-Chinese-Government-Holds-More-Bitcoin-Than-Michael-Saylors-MicroStrategy.jpg" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Mammoth BTC Whale: The Chinese Government Holds More Bitcoin Than Michael Saylor&#039;s MicroStrategy" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Mammoth-BTC-Whale-The-Chinese-Government-Holds-More-Bitcoin-Than-Michael-Saylors-MicroStrategy.jpg 1200w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Mammoth-BTC-Whale-The-Chinese-Government-Holds-More-Bitcoin-Than-Michael-Saylors-MicroStrategy-300x175.jpg 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Mammoth-BTC-Whale-The-Chinese-Government-Holds-More-Bitcoin-Than-Michael-Saylors-MicroStrategy-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Mammoth-BTC-Whale-The-Chinese-Government-Holds-More-Bitcoin-Than-Michael-Saylors-MicroStrategy-768x448.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div>
<p>For the past few years, Bitcoin&#8217;s price has been on a rollercoaster ride, and so have the emotions of its holders. After dropping by more than 50% from its all-time high of nearly $69k in November 2021, Bitcoin bounced back to $45k briefly but then went through another downward spiral to hit a three-month low of $18.9k on June 18, 2022. Since then, the price has been struggling to break out of the $20k-$30k range, and the sentiment in the market has been mixed.</p>



<p>However, one group of Bitcoin holders seems more optimistic than others, as they have resumed accumulating the crypto asset en masse despite the recent market turbulence. These whale addresses hold 100-1k BTC, often regarded as influential players in the Bitcoin ecosystem due to their large holdings and potential impact on the price.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-whale-agiotage-could-hint-at-bitcoin-s-positive-prospect"><strong>Whale Agiotage Could Hint at Bitcoin’s Positive Prospect</strong></h2>



<p>According to the latest data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, whale addresses with 100-1k BTC have added 20,007 BTC to their holdings in the past two days after a month-long selling period. This suggests that these whales are confident about Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term prospects and see the current dip as a buying opportunity.</p>



<p>Not all whale addresses are created equal, and some may have different transaction strategies or motives. For instance, there are also whale addresses with more than 1k BTC, which have been selling more than buying lately, possibly to take profits or rebalance their portfolios. Moreover, some of the whales may be <a href="https://zycrypto.com/1-2-billion-worth-of-bitcoin-leaves-coinbase-in-a-week-proving-institutional-investments-are-heavily-pouring-in/">institutional investors</a> or high-net-worth individuals with access to over-the-counter markets or derivatives not reflected in the on-chain data.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the trend of whale accumulation in the lower range of BTC holdings could indicate that some retail investors or small-scale traders are also following their lead and buying the dip. This could provide some support to the price and prevent it from falling further, as it did in the previous bear market of 2018-2019 when whale selling exacerbated the sell-off.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin Price: What’s Been Going On?</strong></h2>



<p>Speaking of the price, Bitcoin has been oscillating between the $30.5k resistance and the $28.7k support level for the past few days, with neither side gaining a decisive advantage yet.</p>



<p>The short-term&#8217;s lack of a clear direction could reflect the uncertainty and indecision among traders and investors, who are waiting for more clarity on the regulatory and macroeconomic fronts. The recent crackdown on crypto mining and trading in China and the potential tapering of the US Federal Reserve&#8217;s rates could significantly impact Bitcoin&#8217;s price and perception as a safe-haven asset or a speculative bubble.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-6-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80047" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-6-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-6-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-6-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-6-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-6-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The whale accumulation of Bitcoin and the price consolidation around the $20k-$30k range are contrasting but related signals reflecting the ongoing tug-of-war in the cryptocurrency market. Whether the whales are right in their <a href="https://zycrypto.com/global-crypto-market-cap-surges-above-1-trillion-as-bitcoin-makes-bullish-comeback/">bullish outlook</a> and whether the price can break out of its current range remains to be seen. What is certain is that the crypto world is never short of drama and surprises.</p>

<p>The week has been chaotic for the entire cryptocurrency market. With regulatory-centred discourse making rounds again, sentiments are likely to change occasionally. However, the altcoin season seems to be right around the corner, despite the continuous unrest in the market.</p>



<p>Confirming the new development was Author Hayes, the former CEO of cryptocurrency derivatives exchange BitMEX. Taking to Twitter, the former exec posted a screenshot showing the bullish performance of the Ethereum (ETH) altcoin against the USD. With Ethereum’s rise above $2,000, Hayes is certain that altcoin season has, in fact, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/arthur-hayes-sees-a-glorious-altseason-coming-soon-as-ether-price-jumps-above-2-1k/">arrived</a>.</p>



<p>Altcoin season, as the name suggests, is a time when alternative cryptocurrencies in the market enter the bullish zone. During altcoin season, Bitcoin often underperforms as alternative coins lead the market with gains. Investors and traders look forward to the altcoin season, which appears to be extremely promising. </p>



<p>As with previous times, a few altcoins lead the pack during the altcoin season. This time, three altcoins have set the stage for what will come. Leading with gains this month, Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano ADA are dominating.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ethereum-eth"><strong>Ethereum (ETH)</strong></h2>



<p>Ethereum (ETH) is the second most valued cryptocurrency by market cap. The altcoin, which has maintained its position as the second most valued crypto asset by market cap, is making rounds for its outstanding performance this week. Ethereum (ETH) bulls worked overtime, sending the asset price to $2,000 on the 13th of April. Ethereum last hit these levels in August of 2022. ETH hit a high of $2,121 before plunging to a press time price of $1,883.</p>



<p>Ethereum’s price upsurge has been credited to the recent Shapella upgrade. As stakers now have access to their staked ETH, the network has recorded an upsurge in staking activity. Ethereum’s price seems to be surging in tandem, creating room for a potential upward reversal.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dogecoin (Doge)</strong></h2>



<p>Up by more than 6% in the last 7 days, Dogecoin (DOGE), currently the most valuable meme coin, is another promising altcoin poised to outperform in the coming weeks. Trading at $0.08 at press time, with over 6% in losses within the last 24 hours, sentiments are mixed for Doge.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cardano (ADA)</strong></h2>



<p>Prior to the current bloodbath, which has caused ADA to shed over 6% of its gains within the last 24 hours, ADA bulls dominated the market, sending weekly gains up to 11%. </p>



<p>Clearing hourly losses, ADA is up 0.33% in the last hour. ADA is one of the few assets poised to rake in gains, as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-primed-for-massive-boom-as-ada-whales-network-activity-heats-up/">fundamental factors</a> sit in its favour.</p>

<p>An ancient Bitcoin address that laid practically dominant for over a decade came back to life on Friday — transferring 279 Bitcoins worth $7.8 million to new wallets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-another-dormant-bitcoin-whale-awakens"><strong>Another Dormant Bitcoin Whale Awakens</strong></h2>



<p>A Bitcoin whale that had not transacted in over 10 years suddenly came online today.</p>



<p>In October 2012 and May 2013, the wallet received some 1,128 Bitcoin ($31.6 million), <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1649387289745977344">according </a>to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain. Back then, Bitcoin was worth $12 and $195, respectively. No coins went in or out of that wallet until today when the owner transferred $279 BTC worth approximately $7.8 million to three different addresses.</p>



<p>A decade ago when the wallet received its 1,128 bitcoin, investors may have had limited expectations about the price of the OG cryptocurrency and traded it as if it was chump change. At current prices, people who held onto the crypto basically became Bitcoin whales.</p>



<p>This latest transfer came just a day after another ancient wallet <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1648912229264416768">moved </a>2,071.5 BTC — worth $60.7 million — after lying dormant for over nine years. This particular whale acquired 6,071.5 BTC on Dec. 19, 2013, when Bitcoin’s price was around $663.</p>



<p>While sizable Bitcoin trades occur on a daily basis, it&#8217;s not often that coins that old see the light of day again. Some suggest that when old coins are being spent more often, it may indicate a shift in confidence to hold the crypto asset — often spurred by periods of market volatility.</p>



<p>Bitcoin continued its slump Friday for the third consecutive day, dropping 2.33% over the last 24 hours to just above $28,000 as traders seem to move away from risky assets. The top crypto has lost around 8.06% since last Friday. Bitcoin’s slide dragged the rest of the crypto market with it, with the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies dropping by 2.4% to $1.23 trillion, per CoinGecko data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All in all, one positive development for the crypto world on Thursday: the European Parliament <a href="https://zycrypto.com/industry-leaders-upbeat-as-eu-parliament-passes-much-anticipated-mica-regulation/">passed </a>the long-awaited MiCA crypto law, becoming the first major jurisdiction to do so.</p>
