<p>Robinhood has been a top online investing and trading platform for many years. Nevertheless, it has also been the subject of litigation, public outcry, and allegations from the SEC for some of its operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multiple new and old trading platforms are trying to capitalize on these Robinhood shortcomings and emerge as fan favorites. One of them will be Tradecurve, an upcoming DEX (decentralized exchange) currently in its presale stage that some analysts believe has the potential to become a top 3 trading platform, surpassing Robinhood in the process. Today, we will compare these exchanges and find out what makes Tradecurve so appealing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Robinhood vs. Tradecurve - Ease of use</p>
<p>One point of criticism that has been brought up for Robinhood is its sign-up KYC requirement. This eliminates any chance of anonymity while trading, something new traders aim for. Not only that, Robinhood offers more simplistic resources that may not be appealing to the more experienced traders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is a clear difference between Robinhood and Tradecurve, as the latter will not require any sign-up KYC checks. Tradecurve users may simply create an account using their email, connect their crypto wallet to the platform and begin trading. This removal will solve the issue of "no anonymity," as users can now trade in complete privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robinhood vs. Tradecurve - Social trading</p>
<p>Another difference between Robinhood and Tradecurve is that Robinhood offers no social trading opportunities. In comparison, Tradecurve will possess copy trading, meaning users can copy the trades of other individuals for a subscription fee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, traders will benefit from their subscribers while also providing complete transparency to those subscribers regarding the traders real-time trading outcomes, which are maintained on-chain. Meanwhile, the subscribers can generate profits from other traders' choices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robinhood vs. Tradecurve - Range of offerings</p>
<p>There are several differences between Tradecurve and Robinhood regarding the assets they provide. Investors may trade stocks, ETFs, cryptocurrency, and options with Robinhood. The same assets, futures, and gold are available through Tradecurve. Regarding the range of trading options, Tradecurve will surpass Robinhood. Tradecurve's high-leverage products, which start at a leverage ratio of 500:1, will also be available on just one account.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Final Verdict&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many traders would be hesitant to utilize Robinhood as their preferred platform because of a history of lack of transparency around downtime and asset trading limitations. Because of this, Tradecurve is the clear winner as it will provide a decentralized hybrid trading platform that offers low fees, privacy, and borderless access to millions of global traders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investors have been backing this upcoming platform by buying its utility token, TCRV, which is currently worth only $0.012. Interest in this project can also be seen by its total token sales - 20M of tokens as a whole. And since the presale is now in Stage 2, by the time it finishes, this number may skyrocket with its value accompanying it. Experts predict that a 50x increase is in store and a 100x one when the TCRV utility token gets listed on Uniswap after its launch. Those interested can invest in this upcoming top 3 trading platform by following the links below and signing up for its presale.&nbsp;</p>
