<p class="s5">The blockchain space is ever-evolving, and new projects are popping up consistently, aiming to provide a solution to some specific issue that has been a part of the traditional investment space.</p>
<p class="s5">Sparklo is one such project that will be the go-to platform where investors can easily begin making investments in fractionalized NFTS that represent precious metals.</p>
<p class="s5">With the decrease in the value of competing projects such as Polygon (MATIC) and Solana (SOL), investors and traders aiming to get the most out of the space will typically diversify at these times.</p>
<p class="s7">Polygon (MATIC) To Participate in Starkware&rsquo;s L2 Peace</p>
<p class="s5">The official Polygon (MATIC) Twitter page made an announcement that on April 21, 2023, Jordi Baylina and Bobbin Threadbare will participate in Starkware&rsquo;s L2 Peace. </p>
<p class="s5">Additionally, Polygon (MATIC) will also hold a Polygon (MATIC) zkEVM Mainnet Beta AMA where they will provide updates on security, performance metrics, and the roadmap.</p>
<p class="s5">On April 20, 2023, the Polygon (MATIC) cryptocurrency traded at $1.09. In the last 24 hours, Polygon (MATIC) decreased by 1.3%, and its overall decrease in the last two weeks has been at 4.3%.</p>
<p class="s7">Helium Network Migrates To Solana (SOL), but it's Coin Still Loses Value</p>
<p class="s5">Solana (SOL) made a huge announcement on April 19, 2023, noting that Helium Network completed its upgrade and finished its migration to the blockchain.</p>
<p class="s5">The Helium Network will now run on top of Solana (SOL), and the global IoT and Cellular data will be powered by the network.</p>
<p class="s5">When we go over the value of Solana (SOL), on April 20, 2023, the cryptocurrency traded at $22.75. In the last 24 hours, Solana (SOL) dipped by 1.6%, and in the last seven days, it has been down by a total of 4.7%. Based on this, it is clear why investors are beginning to diversify away from Solana (SOL) into presale-stage projects.</p>
<p class="s7">Sparklo (SPRK) To Bring Fractional NFT Ownerships in Gold, Silver, and Platinum</p>
<p class="s5">Sparklo will be the go-to investment platform that will enable anyone on a global scale an opportunity to begin making investments in silver, gold, and platinum through fractional ownership of non-fungible tokens (NTs). This means that on top of Sparklo, every time an investment is made, an NFT is minted. </p>
<p class="s5">Investors can buy a specific percentage of an NFT, a fraction, or they can buy the entire NFT. Upon gaining ownership of an NFT fully that is a representation of a gold bar, for example, they can have it delivered at a location of their choosing. As for its price, the Level One presale has placed the SPRK token at a value of $0.015. Analysts predict that its value will jump 40x in the upcoming months.</p>
<p class="s5">The team is also processing a KYC application, but the network has already been audited by InterFi network and will have its liquidity locked for 100 years.</p>
