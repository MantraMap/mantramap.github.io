<p>In what is looking like an upturn in the crypto market, some notable tokens have begun rallying in price. Some of such tokens are polygon (MATIC) and Avalanche (AVAX).</p>
<p>More notably, Sparklo has also consolidated its position in the crypto market recently, prompting analysts to advise investors to prioritize Sparklo ahead of Polygon (MATIC) and Avalanche (AVAX) as it is a more viable investment option with more room for growth.</p>
<p>Sparklo (SPRK) takes the market by storm&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only a few ardent investors may claim not to know about the waves and high potential that Sparklo has shown in the crypto market since its presale was announced weeks ago. This is following a sustained and steady momentum that Sparklo has, which is prompting more investors to join the project. Ahead of its imminent launch, Sparklo is geared to become the first innovative blockchain investment platform where members can buy, sell or own solid mineral assets like Silver, Gold and Platinum. These assets can be traded using fractionalized NFTs as a representation of the assets.</p>
<p>Also, traders can buy the SPRK token now that it is at a relatively low but ever-growing price value. At the price of only $0.026 per SPRK token, investors can buy the Sparklo token and position themselves for the exponential growth that the token will undergo in the near future. Interestingly, a 50% bonus is up for grabs when investors make a substantial purchase of the SPRK tokens. The project is already in the second phase of the presale and the bonus will end soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interfi Network has backed the Sparklo project by passing its audit at pre-launch. Moreso, investors are assured of the safety of their assets as liquidity will be locked for 100 years thereby preventing an event of a rug pull. We believe that Sparklo is a promising investment opportunity that you should check out below.</p>

<p>positive price action for Polygon (MATIC)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) is an Ethereum-based platform for scaling and infrastructure development of multiple types of applications. Within the last 24 hours, Polygon (MATIC) saw a significant +3.73% upturn in price value. This pegs the price of Polygon (MATIC) at $0.88 as of press time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent news, Mangrove, a decentralized exchange (DEX) will be launching on the Polygon (MATIC) network by June. This move will see an addition of an innovative DeFi tool to the Polygon (MATIC) network and further strengthen the network in the world of blockchain transactions. Although Polygon (MATIC) is making a giant stride, we recommend that you invest in a more stable project like Sparklo, which experts have predicted that its value will rise by more than 2000% this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avalanche (AVAX) announces the introduction of an AI-powered blockchain</p>
<p>Avalanche (AVAX) is a layer one and decentralized blockchain that validates transactions using smart contracts. Recently, the co-founder of the Avalanche (AVAX) network, Emin G&uuml;n Siree announced at the Avalanche (AVAX) Summit II 2023 that the network is proposing a blockchain that will be powered by AI. Emin also highlighted that the AI would make use of Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPTs) to read and parse smart contracts.</p>
<p>In the crypto market, the Avalanche (AVAX) token saw a +3.63% increase in price value within the last 24 hours. As a result, the price of Avalanche (AVAX) is $14.80 currently. The positive price action of Avalanche (AVAX) may be related to the recent announcement of introducing AI into the Avalanche network.&nbsp;</p>
