			            <description><![CDATA[Former Alibaba executive Toby Rush explains why NFT tickets have an edge over the traditional system.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NFT sales have had a rocky start in 2023 but the underlying technology still holds plenty of utility. Ticketing is an interesting yet underdeveloped facet of the NFT space. It stands out as a promising frontier for NFTs in the ever-evolving world of digital advancements.</p>
<p>As a noteworthy application of NFTs, NFT tickets play a significant role in signifying ownership and facilitating access to exclusive experiences and events. These digital tickets serve as tangible proofs of entrance, covering a wide spectrum of events, including theme park attractions, sporting events, and live concerts.</p>
<p>By providing verifiable proof of ownership and authenticity, NFT tickets offer the potential to revolutionize digital authentication and enhance the user experience.</p>
<h2>NFT Tickets vs Traditional Tickets</h2>
<p>The rise of NFTs and their applications in ticketing systems has sparked interest and conversations across various industries and stakeholders.</p>
<p>According to former Alibaba executive Toby Rush, brands and events alike have adopted NFTs into their ticketing processes, reaping rewarding results for both customers and organizations over the past couple of years. The trend is catching fire, captivating a diverse range of stakeholders in what is being touted as an innovative and mutually beneficial landscape.</p>
<p>While speaking with <em>CryptoPotato</em>, Rush said the traditional ticketing industry is plagued by several problems for decades, from scalpers ripping off honest fans out of thousands of dollars for Super Bowl tickets to scammers selling fraudulent tickets at the recent 2023 NBA finals. The number of physical ticket fraud cases, too, is growing at an alarming rate. Rush believes NFT ticketing can address this.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Since NFTs are verifiably unique and their veracity can be easily confirmed on-chain, counterfeiting them is simply impossible in the traditional sense. As for scalping, while profit-seekers can sell NFT tickets on secondary markets at inflated prices, these tokens can also be programmed to incur fees or royalties.</p>
<p>This means organizers can at least get a cut of every secondary sale, unlike traditional ticketing, where scalpers are the only ones to profit from resales.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>NFT Tickets Not Designed as Speculative Asset</h2>
<p>NFTs are volatile. There&#8217;s always a possibility of a drastic fall in an NFT ticket’s value just before the event. But Rush explains that <span style="font-weight: 400;">NFT-based tickets are not designed to be a speculative asset and are </span>not dictated by the market but by the event organizers themselves.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As such, it is important to differentiate between NFTs as a speculative asset &#8211; where an NFT is connected to a speculatively valued piece of art, for example &#8211; and NFTs used as a digital representation of goods.</p>
<p>When it comes to ticketing, NFTs can be used as proof of provenance for cryptographically verifiable access to certain events, so they do not inherently hold value unless tied to something valuable.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The exec further added that the only way NFT tickets’ prices could fluctuate independently is on secondary markets, in which case a seller could set a price ceiling on one, for instance.</p>
<p>This will let the smart contract prevent that NFT ticket from being resold for a higher amount, thereby discouraging ticket scalping and &#8220;ensuring that the most deserving fans can access affordable tickets, even if they are being resold on the secondary market.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Addressing Bottlenecks and Steering Clear of Scams</h2>
<p>NFT tickets are still an underdog but have their fair share of bottlenecks that need addressing. Limited accessibility is a major hindrance to their adoption due to their very technical nature. High gas fees associated with buying and selling are yet another factor. But both of these issues can be solved on the technical level, Rush said in a statement.</p>
<p>The ex-Alibaba executive added that scams concerning NFT-based tickets are very few. But one such is to create similarly named &#8220;lookalike&#8221; tokens and try to sell them as the &#8220;real thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still quite easy to avoid this type of fraud, Rush added, which can be done by simply verifying who issued the tokens in question. Smaller/suspicious marketplaces should also be avoided as an added security step. He also encouraged individuals to always purchase NFTs tickets directly from the issuer.</p>
<p>Rush highlighted the need to exercise vigilance in their responsibility to facilitate secure user interactions within this nascent technology. Phishing scams, for one, have been exemplified in the NFT space. The exec added,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Issuers can advise users to never click on suspicious links, attachments, or pop-ups and always verify URL domain names, email addresses, and social media handles to ensure authenticity.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>No Reason for Regulatory Threat</h2>
<p>The NFT market may have hit the summer slumber, but the post-pandemic shakeup that spurred an explosion has prompted regulators to point out an array of potential risks that still looms large, encompassing concerns over consumer fraud, money laundering, and the evasion of sanctions.</p>
<p>Rush, who is currently serving as the CEO and co-founder of Redeem, believes there shouldn&#8217;t be a regulatory pushback.</p>
<p>He explained that since NFT tickets &#8220;do not hold any intrinsic value by themselves but rather serve as proof of ownership for other physical commodities, such as access rights, they can’t be considered financial assets, so there is no reason for financial regulators to get involved or push against them.&#8221;</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues pumping while the rest of the market flatlines on the back of little to no volatily whatsoever. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another day &#8211; another failure for Bitcoin to break away from its current range around $29,000. The primary cryptocurrency&#8217;s volatility has fallen to historic lows and the rest of the market doesn&#8217;t seem too exciting either.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s one barking exception.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Stagnates at $29K</h2>
<p>They say there&#8217;s never a dull moment in crypto, but if you&#8217;re mostly following the performance of large-cap coins throughout the past week, you can probably see that this can be a bit of an overstatement.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price has completely flatlined throughout the last few days, and the past 24 hours have made absolutely no exception, as seen in the chart below.</p>
<figure id="attachment_264564" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-264564" style="width: 1183px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSDT_2023-08-05_11-40-57.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-264564" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSDT_2023-08-05_11-40-57.png" alt="BTCUSDT_2023-08-05_11-40-57" width="1183" height="485" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSDT_2023-08-05_11-40-57.png 1183w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSDT_2023-08-05_11-40-57-300x123.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSDT_2023-08-05_11-40-57-1024x420.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSDT_2023-08-05_11-40-57-768x315.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSDT_2023-08-05_11-40-57-50x20.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1183px) 100vw, 1183px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-264564" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>BTC&#8217;s price made an attempt to push above $29,300 but was quickly reminded that it&#8217;s not its place and retraced back to where it&#8217;s trading for the past week &#8211; the $29,000 level.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency has become less volatile than gold on a 5-day adjusted basis. That&#8217;s right &#8211; the risky and massively volatile Bitcoin that&#8217;s too unpredictable for traditional portfolios has become less volatile than the most traditional investment of them all.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s worth noting that periods like the current one don&#8217;t usually last long and are a precursor to a major move. We just have to see if it will be to the upside or the downside.</p>
<h2>SHIB Price Pumps Another 5%</h2>
<p>The altcoin market has also remained largely flat through the day, with the majority of major cryptocurrencies being on the losing end, charting small declines below 1%. You can see that in the heatmap below.</p>
<figure id="attachment_264565" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-264565" style="width: 1488px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_0508231.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-264565" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_0508231.jpg" alt="cryptocurrency_heatmap_0508231" width="1488" height="778" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_0508231.jpg 1488w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_0508231-300x157.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_0508231-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_0508231-768x402.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cryptocurrency_heatmap_0508231-50x26.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-264565" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Quantify Crypto</figcaption></figure>
<p>You can also see that one of these things is not like the others and is trading well above the established range. Shiba Inu (SHIB) keeps pumping and is up another 5% throughout the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>The move is an extension of yesterday&#8217;s increase that came on the back of news from Binance. The world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange revealed that it will now support SHIB as collateral for loans.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to see if this rally will continue or if SHIB will calm down and get in line with the rest of the market.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[BlockFi said that the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors have backed the proposal.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bankrupt crypto lender, BlockFi revealed that the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey has conditionally approved its disclosure statement.</p>
<p>The development essentially demonstrated that the reorganization process of BlockFi continues to make gradual progress eight months after filing the voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<ul>
<li>In an official <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230802310688/en/BlockFi%E2%80%99s-Disclosure-Statement-Conditionally-Approved-by-Court" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">statement</a> on August 2nd, Mark Renzi &#8211; BlockFi’s Chief Restructuring Officer, highlighted the lender&#8217;s aim to maximize recoveries for its creditors.</li>
<li>Renzi added that the conditional approval of its Disclosure Statement moves BlockFi &#8220;one step closer to accomplishing that goal.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are confident that our Plan provides the best path to expeditiously return crypto back to our clients and we strongly urge BlockFi’s clients to vote to accept it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If the bankruptcy plan is approved, BlockFi plans to focus on recovering funds from other defunct firms, including Alameda, FTX, 3AC, Emergent, Marex, and Core Scientific, in a bid to &#8220;maximize recoveries for clients and defending against claims by third parties, which threaten to massively dilute clients.&#8221;</li>
<li>However, the proposed bankruptcy plans have met with strict <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blockfis-bankruptcy-plans-faces-stiff-opposition-from-ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">opposition</a> from the disgraced crypto exchange FTX, fallen hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</li>
<li>The plan presents clients with the option for releases if they choose not to withdraw from a voluntary third-party release, which absolves them from any claims and causes of action that BlockFi may have against them. This release is applicable for most clients, with the exception of those who withdrew $250,000 or more from BlockFi Interest Accounts (BIA) or BlockFi Private Client (BPC) Accounts on or after November 2, 2022.</li>
<li>The scheduled date for voting on the proposed reorganization is September 11.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Matter Labs said that public accusations of a complete lack of attribution go against the ethos of Open Source movement.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>zkSync creator and Matter Labs CEO Alex Gluchowski refuted allegations of plagiarizing code without appropriately crediting zero-knowledge scaling firm Polygon Zero. Gluchowski called the accusations &#8220;unfounded, misleading, and extremely disappointing&#8221; from a team the exec &#8220;highly respects.&#8221;</p>
<p>The comments are in response to Polygon Zero&#8217;s lengthy blog post accusing the developers of Matter Labs of copy-pasting &#8220;a substantial amount of source code&#8221; from performance-critical components of the Plonky2 library.</p>
<h2>Matter Labs&#8217; Feud With Polygon Zero</h2>
<p>Polygon <a href="https://mirror.xyz/0x70DF15b0208eFCeFaA541Da9A0ED6C4A884554Fc/gNi8coqXjd1ybFsQBAG7QARUkPHZECu7ihIRkpiVx2Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">claimed</a> that Matter Labs&#8217; recent release, Boojum, integrated certain code from Plonky2, a zero-knowledge technology created by Polygon. While the Plonky2 platform is open-source, Polygon raised concerns about Matter Labs&#8217; failure to include the code in Boojum without original copyrights or clear attribution to the original authors.</p>
<p>In addition to the &#8220;directly copied code,&#8221; Polygon claimed that Boojum is extremely similar to Plonky2, highlighting the use of the same strategy of parallel repetition to foster soundness in a small field, similar custom gates to efficiently arithmetic recursive verification, as well as the same lookup argument developed by the scaling firm&#8217;s teammate Ulrich Haböck.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;To add insult to injury, the founder of Matter Labs claimed that Boojum is more than 10x faster than Plonky2. Wondering how this is possible, given that the performance-critical field arithmetic code is directly copied from Plonky2? You should be.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Polygon further said that it is &#8220;extremely misleading&#8221; to claim that Boojum is 10x faster than Plonky2.</p>
<h2>Response</h2>
<p>Gluchowski <a href="https://twitter.com/gluk64/status/1687263207860166656" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">maintained</a> that the Matter Labs&#8217; team gave credit to Polygon in the first line of the Boojum module and went on to elaborate that nearly 5% of the Boojum code draws inspiration from the Plonky2 codebase. He also emphasized that both Plonky2 and Boojum stem from the RedShift framework, an initiative pioneered by Matter Labs three years before the unveiling of the Plonky2 paper.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We could have done it better. The community rightfully pointed out that there is a more standard approach to attributions, which we will wholeheartedly apply from now on.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Matter Labs asserted that if the Polygon Zero team wanted additional credit, they could have submitted a pull request which the former &#8220;would have happily accepted.&#8221;</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The trio has given the hackers until August 6 to return 90% of the funds, or the bounty would be offered to the public and given to anyone who would identify them.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized exchange Curve Finance has teamed up with Metronome and Alchemix to offer a 10% bug bounty to the attackers behind the recent exploit that saw more than $50 million siphoned off the platforms’ pools.</p>
<p>According to an on-chain <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc45e47f6e7d3e74763032e2fb991fa9a003d8ed55c13c93c6a5368ff322d7742" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">message</a> on one hacker’s Ethereum address, the protocols are willing to cease the pursuit of the case if the attackers return 90% of the stolen funds, keeping 10% for themselves.</p>
<h2>Curve, Metronome, and Alchemix Offer Hacker 10% Bounty</h2>
<p>Recall that four Curve Finance pools were <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/curve-finance-hacker-returns-5-4-million-but-crv-dumps-15/" data-wpel-link="internal">exploited</a> on July 30. The attackers were able to access the pools using Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contract programming language Vyper through a malfunctioning re-entrancy lock.</p>
<p>The exploit affected decentralized finance protocols like Metronome, Alchemix, and Ellipsis. While the total amount lost due to the hack remains unclear, the losses are estimated to be above $50 million.</p>
<p>Curve, Metronome, and Alchemix have taken steps toward recovering the funds by reaching out to attackers on-chain, promising no risk of law enforcement issues if they comply with the offer. The trio has given the hackers until August 6 to return 90% of the funds, or the bounty would be offered to the public and given to anyone who would identify them.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If you choose not to partake in the voluntary return and complete the process by August 6 at 0800 UTC, we will expand the bounty to the public, and offer the full 10% to the person who is able to identify you in a way that leads to your conviction in the courts. We will pursue you from all angles with the full extent of the law,” the protocols said.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Roughly $5.4M Returned</h2>
<p>The platforms proceeded to provide an email address – for the exploiters to contact them for negotiations as soon as possible. They noted that whoever claims to be the exploiter would need to verify their ownership of the addresses holding the stolen funds before any discussions can take place.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a white hat hacker named c0ffeebabe.eth already returned 2,879 ETH worth approximately $5.4 million to the protocol deployer address on July 31 after exploiting one of the exchange’s pools to prevent more losses.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[There are now more live Ethereum futures ETF applications than Bitcoin spot ETF ones.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While anticipation over a potential Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETF has gripped investors, an Ethereum (ETH) ETF approval may also be waiting in the wings.</p>
<p>Bloomberg analysts are now assigning 75% odds of one such product being approved in the United States this year.</p>
<h2>Ethereum ETF On The Horizon</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1687437656613924864" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">tweeted</a> by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart on Friday, the organization’s approval odds are the same as those it assigned for a Bitcoin futures ETF in early September 2021.</p>
<p>The very first U.S.-based fund of the kind – the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) launched in late October of that year, pulling in $1 billion within two days of its launch.</p>
<p>At the time, many companies were vying to list the product after Gary Gensler – Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – stated that he was confident in the investor protections that a futures ETF framework could provide.</p>
<p>Today there are 13 Ethereum ETF applications knocking on the SEC’s door, from 8 different applicants including Bitwise, Proshares, and Grayscale. Based on the SEC’s deadlines, the first in line for approval or denial is Volatility Shares’ Ethereum Strategy ETF, by October 11.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The SEC appears to be changing its posture towards crypto, based on reports of its back channel messaging to ETF issuers,” wrote the analysts. “We believe the SEC would have a hard time in court defending the denial of Ethereum futures ETFs after approving standard and leveraged Bitcoin futures ETFs. “</p></blockquote>
<h2>Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval Odds</h2>
<p>As of August 4, there are 9 active Bitcoin spot ETF applications pending review by the SEC, with the latest applicant being from CBOE on behalf of the Global X Bitcoin Trust.</p>
<p>Like all other applications, CBOE’s latest filing selects <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-to-the-rescue-coinbase-cites-ripple-ruling-seeks-to-end-sec-lawsuit/" data-wpel-link="internal">Coinbase</a> as a surveillance-sharing partner for detecting market manipulation – a crucial issue for the SEC for which its denied every major spot ETF application so far.</p>
<p>Shares for a Bitcoin spot ETF are backed by actual BTC held under custody by the trust and its partners. By contrast, futures ETFs are backed by Bitcoin futures contracts, which may not perfectly track the price of BTC at any particular time.</p>
<p>Unlike competitors, Grayscale is vying to convert its Bitcoin trust into a spot ETF by battling the SEC in court. The company argues that the regulator’s approval of futures ETFs, but not spot ETFs, demonstrates “arbitrary and capricious” treatment of the latter.</p>
<p>Recently, Bloomberg analysts <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bloomberg-boosts-bitcoin-spot-etf-approval-odds-to-65-heres-why/" data-wpel-link="internal">raised</a> their odds of a Bitcoin spot ETF approval this year to 65%, which they expect will come on the back of a Grayscale court victory.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price has gradually declined over the past few weeks after being rejected from the psychological resistance level of $2,000 once more. However, there is a considerable chance to initiate a new bullish leg in the short term.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart:</h3>
<p>On the daily timeframe, the price has recently demonstrated bearish price action. The 50-day moving average, located around the $1,900 mark, was broken to the downside after holding the mark for a few weeks.</p>
<p>The 200-day moving average, trending around the $1,800 area, and the $1,750 support level are likely targets for the market to reach in the coming days. Yet, a rebound from these support elements seems likely, leading to another run toward the $2,000 mark and even higher.</p>
<figure id="attachment_264503" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-264503" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-264503 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-scaled.jpg" alt="eth_price_chart_0408231" width="2560" height="1464" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-300x172.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-768x439.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-1536x879.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-2048x1171.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-264503" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart:</h3>
<p>Looking at the 4-hour chart, the price has failed to hold above the $1,930 level and is currently testing the $1,830 support zone. If this level holds, the market is likely to rally toward the $2,000 level once more, with a high likelihood of finally breaking through it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a breakdown of the $1,830 level would likely result in a further decline toward the $1,750 level in the coming days.</p>

<h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3>Ethereum Taker Buy Sell Ratio</h3>
<p>Over the past few weeks, Ethereum&#8217;s price has been oscillating in a very tight range, leaving investors wondering about the direction of the next move. In this situation, analyzing the futures market sentiment might provide valuable insight.</p>
<p>This chart shows the taker buy-sell ratio, which indicates whether long or short traders are more aggressive. Values above 1 are considered bullish, while values below 1 indicate aggressive selling pressure on aggregate.</p>
<p>As the chart depicts, this metric has been constantly dropping lower below 1, showing little intent to recover. This selling pressure in the futures market is probably offsetting the spot market demand, leading to range-bound price action.</p>
<p>Therefore, investors should look forward to the taker buy-sell ratio rising above 1, which could potentially result in a new higher high in the short term.</p>

<p><strong>Technical Analysis</strong></p>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>XRP/USDT Daily Chart:</strong></p>
<p>Against USDT, the price has been constantly declining after being rejected from the $0.9 resistance level. The market is likely targeting the 50-day moving average around the $0.6 support level.</p>
<p>The 200-day moving average trending near the $0.5 mark is also another key support that the price would test in case of a breakdown of the 50-day MA. In any case, the market seems more likely to rebound from these levels and start a new bullish phase.</p>
<figure id="attachment_264505" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-264505" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/XRPUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-264505 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/XRPUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-scaled.jpg" alt="xrp_price_chart_0408231" width="2560" height="1464" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/XRPUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/XRPUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-300x172.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/XRPUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/XRPUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-768x439.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/XRPUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-1536x879.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/XRPUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-2048x1171.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/XRPUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-264505" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>XRP/BTC Daily Chart</strong></p>
<p>Against BTC, XRP&#8217;s price has been decisively rejected to the downside by the 2,800 SAT resistance level. The cryptocurrency is currently on a steep downtrend towards the 2,200 SAT area.</p>
<p>In case the level holds, XRP is likely to attempt the 2,800 SAT area again in the next few weeks. Conversely, a breakout below the mentioned level would result in a deeper pullback, with the 50-day moving average being the probable short-term target.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[That's right - SHIB is the only well-performing altcoin for the past seven days in a market that's otherwise completely stuck for the time being.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To say that the price action within the cryptocurrency market this week was underwhelming would be the understatement of the year. Most of the top altcoins are charting losses as Bitcoin&#8217;s price remains completely flat for the past seven days.</p>
<p>In fact, Bitcoin&#8217;s volatility has been so insignificant that on a 10-day average, it&#8217;s about to become less than that of stocks and even gold. That&#8217;s right &#8211; the &#8220;highly volatile&#8221; Bitcoin that&#8217;s unpredictable and &#8220;risky&#8221; has seen less action than &#8230; gold. But it is what it is, and BTC has absolutely failed to produce any substantial movement in the past week, losing a slight 0.2%.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the altcoins are bleeding out. XRP is down 7%, ADA is down 5%, SOL &#8211; 5.4%, TRON &#8211; 7.3%, MATIC &#8211; 5.6%, and so forth. This has helped Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance. To those unaware, this is the metric which tracks its share relative to that of the rest of the market. It increased by 0.5% in the past seven days, which highlights exactly how weak altcoins are at the moment.</p>
<p>But not all altcoins are made equal, and it turns out that SHIB is the only one from the majors that performed well. The cryptocurrency is up some 5% on the week in a sea of red. It&#8217;s not without a good reason. Binance, the world&#8217;s leading cryptocurrency exchange, just announced that it will now start accepting SHIB as collateral. This is big news, and it&#8217;s the primary catalyst for the altcoin&#8217;s surge in value.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Coinbase is moving to dismiss the case against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The exchange has cited the ruling in Ripple&#8217;s case against the Commission, where Judge Analisa Torres determined secondary sales of XRP to NOT constitute an investment contract. It&#8217;s very interesting to see how the legal spat will turn out, as that ruling offers a pivotal moment.</p>
<p>All in all, it&#8217;s also worth noting that the ongoing bear market is turning out to be the longest in crypto&#8217;s relatively nascent history. It&#8217;s been going on for more than two years now, and we have yet to see when it will end.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Coinbase said crypto assets fall outside the SEC's delegated authority as set by Congress.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>America&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has submitted a motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>The motion, <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/7eaTxSOvCLrGR2frvCqS3Q/b98f952657b7bc821b218d1f601b9161/CoinbasevSEC12_c_Motion.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">filed</a> with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, argues that crypto assets are neither investment contracts nor securities and so fall outside the SEC&#8217;s delegated authority as set by Congress.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Seeks to Dismiss SEC Lawsuit</h2>
<p>Recall that the SEC <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-sec-files-a-lawsuit-against-coinbase-day-after-suing-binance/" data-wpel-link="internal">sued</a> Coinbase on June 6, a day after unveiling a slew of charges against Binance, the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange. The agency accused Coinbase of failing to register as a national securities exchange, clearing agency, and broker, despite functioning as all three.</p>
<p>The U.S. regulator also alleged that Coinbase violated securities laws by <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-was-aware-it-violated-us-securities-laws-claims-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">availing</a> unregistered assets that passed the Howey test on its platform for trade while claiming to be legally compliant. The agency named 12 crypto assets, including <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-does-ripples-victory-over-sec-mean-for-sol-ada-and-other-alleged-security-tokens/" data-wpel-link="internal">ADA, Matic, and SOL</a>, as securities in the lawsuit.</p>
<p>In addition, the SEC accused the crypto exchange of failing to register its staking-as-a-service product, which is also a security, thereby denying investors crucial information about the program.</p>
<p>In defense, Coinbase argued that the SEC violated due process, abused its discretion, and abandoned its own earlier interpretations of the securities laws in the lawsuit by ignoring the true definition and application of the Howey Test.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Says it Does Not Offer Investment Contracts</h2>
<p>Coinbase insisted that the SEC can pursue enforcement action only if transactions on its platform constitute investment contracts and, therefore, securities. Citing the SEC&#8217;s case against Ripple Labs, and several others, the exchange asserted that none of them are <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-wanted-coinbase-to-delist-all-crypto-assets-except-bitcoin-before-lawsuit-ft/" data-wpel-link="internal">securities</a> in accordance with relevant laws; hence the agency&#8217;s claims must be dismissed.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The SEC does not and cannot allege that transactions in the 12 tokens identified in the Complaint that take place on Coinbase&#8217;s secondary market spot exchange, or on other secondary market exchanges through Coinbase Prime, carry such rights. They are asset sales, with the obligations of buyer and seller discharged at the point of sale,&#8221; the crypto exchange said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Coinbase further insisted that it does not operate as a broker just because it offers free wallet software that allows users to store and access their digital assets on their devices.</p>
