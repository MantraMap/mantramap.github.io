The coin price bounced at least twice from the pattern’s key barriers indicating the market participants are actively responding to this chart structure. Here’s how interested traders may use this pattern to find entry opportunities in traders.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A falling wedge pattern governs the currency correction phase in the Dogecoin price</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from the pattern’s resistance trendline is needed to initiate a fresh recovery rally</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Dogecoin coin is $314.5 Million, indicating a 52% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/c/cz8cKEUV.png" alt="Dogecoin Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1105" />Source-Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the increasing sell-off in the market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/dogecoin/">Dogecoin price</a> gave a bearish breakdown from the weekly support of $0.0777. This breakdown accelerates the selling pressure and tumbles this memecoin 4.5% down to currently trade at the $0.0742 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the supply momentum persists, the DOGE price is likely to fall another 5% and meet the combined support of $0.071 and the pattern’s support trendline. In an ideal condition, a retest to the lower support trendline usually recuperates the bullish momentum and triggers a price reversal.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/best-cryptos-private-sale/">Best Cryptos Private Sale For 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the Dogecoin price is more likely to witness a temporary recovery which may surge the memecoin nearly 8% higher to hit the overhead trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the buyers would need a decisive breakout above the resistance trendline to trigger a fresh recovery rally.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicators</span></h2>
<p><b>Moving Average Convergence Divergence: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The downsloping <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) and signal(orange) below the neutral line project strong bearish momentum.</span></p>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">the flattish <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMAs</a>(50, 100, and 200) reflect the dogecoin price is witnessing a sideways trend. However, the falling is offering dynamic resistance to the current short-term downfall.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogecoin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.0742</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $0.077 and $0.0838</span></li>

The frog-themed meme coin PEPE recorded a massive 4000% rally in a month and over 500% in a week. However, it now continues its downfall after hitting a high of $0.000004354 on May 5.</p>
<h2>PEPE Meme Coin Still Has Upside Momentum?</h2>
<p>Michael van de Poppe in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1655511860836220930" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> on May 8 said trading in PEPE coin remains high despite the recent decline in prices. PEPE gave a 35% bounce from $0.00000230, which is actually great. The PEPE price started falling again on Sunday and is likely to continue falling for the next 3 days.</p>
<p>PEPE coin could recover 50-80% again after falling for several days this week. He suggests taking longs below $0.00000230, but should remain cautious of volatility.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fvl_ZzqWcAAA2fE?format=png&amp;name=4096x4096" alt="Image" width="696" height="374" /></p>
<p>The support levels are at $0.00000168 and $0.00000148. He shared that meme coins don&#8217;t belong in his long-term investment portfolio. However, meme coins such as PEPE are great for trading due to high trading volume and liquidity. He is currently accumulating Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Chainlink (LINK).</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/binance-suspends-market-order-functions-for-shib-floki-pepe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance listing and announcements</a> related to PEPE led the meme coins to claim a $1.5 billion market cap. Several whales are continuously buying and selling PEPE. Thus, retail investors must remain away from trading in such tokens. Binance accounts for over 30% of trading volume, followed by OKX at 25%.</p>

<h2>PEPE Price Tumbles</h2>
<p>PEPE price fell 27% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $0.00000207. The 24-hour low and high are $0.00000204 and $0.00000288, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has increased in the last 24 hours, indicating an interest among traders.</p>
<p>Some whales bought Shiba Inu (SHIB) and PEPE before the rally and made millions. People can <a href="https://coingape.com/missed-pepe-and-shiba-inu-shib-track-these-whales-investing-early-in-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">follow these whales</a> and invest early in projects to make profits.</p>

This congestion resulted in skyrocketing gas fees that forced some exchanges to </span><a href="https://coingape.com/binance-mulls-using-lightning-network-amid-sudden-spike-in-bitcoin-gas-fee/"><span style="font-weight: 400">halt BTC transactions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> over the weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Commenting on the event, top crypto market analyst, Willy Woo </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1655557150847172608"><span style="font-weight: 400">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> there are notable pros and cons to the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals-and-how-do-they-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ordinals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> induced high gas fees on the Bitcoin network recorded over the past few days. The analyst told his more than 1 million followers that the high gas is good for the security of the network, but not ideal for nodes and decentralization.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">High fees as a consequence of ordinals has pros and cons. It&#39;s great for the security budget, but bad for nodes and decentralisation.</p>
<p>One day BTC block rewards will go to zero and the network will fail unless fees become huge to pay for security.</p>
<p>IMO decentralisation is more…</p>
<p>&mdash; Willy Woo (@woonomic) <a href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1655557150847172608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In justifying his position, the Bitcoin rewards will likely tend to zero someday and the only incentive investors will lean on to get security on the protocol is by paying the necessary gas fees to miners or validators. Willy Woo’s comment is directly linked to the integral cause of the network fee surge which are Bitcoin ordinals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Noting that decentralization is key at the moment, Woo noted that he “would have preferred the impact of ordinals to have been a lot later when the security budget becomes more pressing, it would be at a time when decentralization is already anchored.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Hope for Bitcoin Moving Forward</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The inconvenience brought about by the high gas fees in the Bitcoin network is considered an attack by the growth of Ordinals which many refer to as distinguished shitcoins. While the network has no apparent coordinator, there is a likelihood that we are bound to see more of these ordinals in the near term. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Assuming the pros highlighted by Woo are worth focusing on, this might be good, however, block reward will not be reduced to zero until after many years and as such, the inconvenience can harm the protocol more than can be imagined at this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The hope for Bitcoin will be the emergence of Layer-2 solutions to help Lightning Network </span><a href="https://coingape.com/binance-settles-pending-bitcoin-withdrawal-transactions/"><span style="font-weight: 400">cushion the impact</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of soaring transactions on the protocol. When Binance experienced the congestion, it had to integrate the Lightning Network to ease the clog, and related solutions can notably help reboot the outlook of the network.</span></p>

The coin price bounced back twice from both aforementioned levels accentuating the traders’ respect for these levels and therefore it will also have a significant implant on the near future move.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supply pressure at the overhead resistance trendline of the Stacks price could continue to resonate in a narrow range for a few more sessions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 20-and-50-day EMA offers additional resistance against rising STX prices.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the STX is $331.7 Million, indicating a 696% gain</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/2/2hhgN8fx.png" alt="Stacks Price Analysis" width="1814" height="778" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Stacks coin price resonating between the downsloping trendline and $0.67 support over a month has created a narrow range in the daily chart. Moreover, the mentioned levels converging to a single point indicates altcoin&#8217;s price action will narrow shorter before giving an actual decisive breakout. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the Stacks coin price trades at the $0.76 mark and shows a long-wick rejection near the overhead trendline. This rejection reflects the trades are aggressively selling at this trendline indicating correction remains intact.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/top-web-3-phones-and-their-specifications/">Top Web 3 Phones And Their Specifications</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, if the supply momentum rises, a daily candle closing below the $0.67 support will offer sellers a new resistance level to pressurize the price for further downfall. The potential downfall may tumble the price 22% down to hit $0.525.</span></p>

Earlier, CoinGape <a href="https://coingape.com/coinbase-news-launches-derivatives-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that top US based <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchange</a> Coinbase was launching an international crypto derivatives exchange, in a attempt to expand its wings beyond the United States. Meanwhile, Ripple, the company behind the popular crypto lawsuit XRP Vs SEC, made an important comment on finding the next big crypto hub.</p>

<p>In a latest, it was reported that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong acknowledged the potential for the UAE to become a strategic hub for Coinbase. Armstrong said the UAE deserves credit for being forward thinking on the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a>.</p>
<h2>Ripple CEO Picks Dubai</h2>
<p>On Monday, Ripple chief executive officer Brad Garlinghouse made crucial comments on finding the next big global crypto hub. He <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1655563716795170818" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> an excerpt of his comments from the Dubai Fintech Summit.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As I just shared on stage at DubaiFintechSummit, Ripple is expanding in Dubai. With 20% of our customers based in MENA and clear regulatory regimes being developed, it’s no surprise that Dubai is emerging as a key global financial hub for crypto innovation to thrive.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Judge Analisa Torres, who is overseeing the XRP lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is yet to reveal the Summary Judgement.</p>

The Ripple CEO disclosed this information during a fireside chat at the Dubai Fintech Summit while talking about the United States and cryptocurrency regulation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Per a statement by Garlinghouse, the U.S. is lagging compared to other countries in terms of crypto regulation. In addition, he claimed that the United States government is placing politics above policy. On the other hand, he applauded the progress which the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the European Union (EU) have achieved in relation to their cryptocurrency regulatory framework.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation for Europe is already going through due processes to </span><a href="https://coingape.com/eu-debates-mica-crypto-law-before-vote-heres-timeline-for-implementation/"><span style="font-weight: 400">facilitate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> its official launch. The MiCA bill seems to be the most sophisticated and comprehensive crypto market set of rules at this present time, according to CoinGape. As it stands, the law is yet to come into effect for crypto businesses and it is not yet certain when it eventually will.</span></p>
<h2><b>Ripple CEO Urges the U.S. to Define Crypto Regulation</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He attested to the fact that whenever he is approached by crypto entrepreneurs seeking advice, he tells them not to start from the United States. While this is his sentiment, he believes that several other U.S-based firm and public companies would share the same stance. Before now, Garlinghouse had spoken extensively on the need for crypto regulation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos which was held early this year, Ripple&#8217;s CEO </span><a href="https://coingape.com/ripple-xrp-news-ceo-crypto-regulation-davos/"><span style="font-weight: 400">emphasized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the need to find the right balance when it comes to crypto. Again, he has explained that a significant number of people involved in crypto-related businesses are good people who are interested in aligning with regulation. However, they do not know how to do so because the rules are not defined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ripple&#8217;s lawsuit with the SEC is still ongoing with a final verdict expected between the next three to six months. Already, it looks like the odds are in favour of Ripple with several new information emerging.</span></p>

On the flip side, uncertainty in the broader markets is reflecting on the brighter side for the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a>. A common phenomenon in the last few months of bank crisis has been the rise in Bitcoin price every time the US bank stocks dipped due to the serial bank collapses.</p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-adds-additional-functionalities-for-pepe-floki" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Binance Adds Additional Functionalities for PEPE, FLOKI</strong></a></p>
<p>To start the week, US regional bank stocks showed some recovery in premarket hours, leading to renewed hopes of an end to the banking crisis. Meanwhile, <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin price</a> dipped as <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchange</a> Binance halted Bitcoin withdrawals.</p>
<h2>Christopher Whalen: More Banks Could Fail</h2>
<p>Popular analyst and author Christopher Whalen said the massive losses in balance sheets of the major banks could pose a big problem. He said an impending banking fallout could be avoided if the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Federal Reserve</a> takes a shift from its current monetary policy stance. Hence, this could be a likely scenario for a Bitcoin price jump in the months to come, if the banking crisis drags on.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Unless the Fed is willing to walk back their current policy and give the banks some more breathing room, I don&#8217;t think we will get out of the woods. I think you will see more banks fail.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, when asked about the expectation that the losses in commercial real estate emerge by the end of 2024 or the first quarter of 2024, Whalen <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/squawkcnbc/status/1655523918566891521?s=46&amp;t=LJZ65zkV7cCAMoM2MpSqBQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> all the banks that have been lending to commercial real estate could be exposed to uncertainty. Overall, by the inverse correlation between bank stocks and Bitcoin price, the crypto market could be well placed for a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bull-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bull run</a> in the next few quarters.</p>

However, it&#8217;s unclear whether Binance or Binance.US is in the SEC&#8217;s crosshair.</p>
<p>After a series of attacks against crypto exchanges Coinbase, <a href="https://coingape.com/sec-charges-bittrex-over-operating-unregistered-securities-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bittrex</a>, Kraken, and other entities related to crypto, the securities regulator has set eyes to bring action against Binance or Binance.US.</p>
<h2>Binance In the US SEC Crosshairs</h2>
<p>Crypto exchange Binance has been under heightened scrutiny since the collapse of FTX. In March, the <a href="https://coingape.com/us-cftc-sues-binance-cz-sued-for-regulatory-violations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. CFTC filed an enforcement action</a> against Binance and CEO Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao in March for violating commodities laws and operating an illegal derivatives exchange. The DOJ is also probing Binance for several matters, including violating sanctions against Russia.</p>
<p>Andrew in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/AP_Abacus/status/1655546961968103425" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> on May 8 said the SEC is almost close to taking action against Binance.US or Binance. The SEC may also bring changes against Binance CEO &#8220;CZ&#8221; for violating securities laws and failing to comply with the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-money laundering</a> (AML) rule.</p>
<p>He warned that the US Dept. of Justice (DOJ) could also be part of investigations against Binance after the SEC brings an enforcement action.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">UPDATE: Two sources have made it clear that the SEC is **very** close to moving on actions against Binance/Binance US, as well as CZ personally. </p>
<p>**source: “…he has to hope that it is JUST the SEC, and not the DOJ as well, unregistered securities versus money laundering.”</p>
<p>&mdash; Andrew (@AP_Abacus) <a href="https://twitter.com/AP_Abacus/status/1655546961968103425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2023</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Recently, the <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-and-crypto-market-tank-over-secs-action-on-coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC sent a Wells notice to Coinbase</a> warning an enforcement action against the exchange for listing securities and staking services. Coinbase said the SEC action will have no impact as the exchange doesn&#8217;t list securities and blasted SEC for lack of clarity over digital asset regulations.</p>
<p>Coinbase followed a complaint seeking a response from the US SEC on questions sent last year regarding how government agencies use securities law for regulating digital assets. It also failed to provide clear guidelines and rules on crypto trading, listing, and staking.</p>
<p>A court has now ordered the SEC to respond to Coinbase’s writ of mandamus within 10 days. Coinbase may file a reply to the commission’s response within 7 days of the filing.</p>

The spike in pending transactions and fees caused exchanges to delay or pause withdrawals.</p>
<p>Binance moved <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-fud-actual-bitcoin-outflow-from-binance-far-lower-than-190k-btc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC worth nearly $5 billion</a> to manage the current situation. The exchange revealed the outflows are actually movements between Binance hot and cold wallets due to the BTC address adjustments. The SEC could also take the point in its action against Binance.</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakdown below the support trendline of the flag pattern will invalidate the bullish thesis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Solana coin is $480 Million, indicating a 95.4% gain.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/solana/#:~:text=Solana%20is%20spotted%20trading%20at,in%20the%20last%2024%20hours.">Solana price</a> trades at the $21.26 mark, and with an intraday loss of 2% it retest the support trendline of a flag pattern. The lower price rejection observed in the daily candle reflects the buyers’ continued to defend this support which reflects a possibility of a bullish reversal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This reversal may trigger a bull cycle within the pattern which encourages a rally to the overhead trendline. Thus, if the buying momentum persists, the Solana price may be nearly 20% of the flag pattern’s resistance trendline.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, until both the aforementioned trendlines are intact the coin holders may witness a sideways. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the most common outcome of the flag pattern is a continuation of the prevailing trendline, and therefore interested traders must for a resistance trendline breakout to witness a sustained rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential target from the flag pattern completion could be the $40 mark.</span></p>

<p><b>Exponential Moving Average:: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 200-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> slope wavering around the pattern’s resistance trendline increases the resistance power near this level.</span></p>

However, the ongoing correction recently breached the 50% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">Fibonacci retracement level</a> indicating that the Pepecoin is likely to witness a longer correction.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakdown below the 0.5 FIB threatens Pepecoin with a 20% downfall</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The breached 20 EMA slope will flip into potential resistance and assist sellers in further extending the retracement fall.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the PEPE is $937.2 Million, indicating a 19% fall.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/k/KcO0UyLG.png" alt="PEPE Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After experiencing an aggressive rally earlier this month, <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/pepe-price-prediction-healthy-retracement-prepare-pepecoin-for-further-rally/">Pepecoin price</a> is going through a correction phase meant to check price stability at higher levels and recuperate the bullish momentum. With a 16% intraday fall, the Pepe coin shows a breakdown below the 50% FIB level at $0.00000236 which is usually a key support to replenish the buying pressure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 4-hour time frame chart, the memecoin is retesting the $0.00000236 as potential resistance, validating where the correction phase can extend lower. If the sellers show sustainability below the aforementioned level, the coin price may tumble another 20% to retest the combined support of $0.00000185 at 61.8% FIB. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the supply pressure persists, $0.00000185 and $0.0000015 are two crucial levels that can assist buyers to reboot a bullish rally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a breakdown below 50% FIB has started reflecting weakness in the overall bullish trend.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Directional Movement Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DI+ and DI- slope nearing a bearish crossover will accelerate the selling momentum in the market.</span></p>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 50 <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> slope wavering near the 61.8% FIB at $0.00000185 increases the support strength of this level.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">PEPE Intraday Price Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.00000228</span></li>

This development brings a lot of excitement to crypto enthusiasts who have been eagerly waiting for Binance’s next move for these tokens after a very erratic trading weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">PEPE and FLOKI are new to Binance and the broader crypto market, but they already have a significant following due to the hype surrounding them and their community. Notably, these two cryptocurrencies represent a new wave of digital assets that are taking the financial world by storm, and Binance’s move to add new functionalities for them will undoubtedly add more value to the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The new functionality is their inclusion in Binance Convert, enabling users to easily flip the tokens through the Binance platform at 0 fees.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Binance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Binance</a> Convert adds <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FLOKI&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$FLOKI</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PEPE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$PEPE</a>.<a href="https://t.co/1c1GsOoKD4">https://t.co/1c1GsOoKD4</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Binance (@binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1655463123908714496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2><b>Boosting the PEPE and FLOKI Influence</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the main benefits of the new functionalities added by Binance is that they will increase the usability and flexibility of both coins. This means that users can now perform more transactions with these coins, thereby making them more popular and valuable. Additionally, the new feature will also enhance the security and efficiency of these coins, which is crucial in ensuring their longevity and continued adoption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another key advantage of the exchange’s move is that it will stimulate more interest and investment in the crypto market. As more functionalities are added to PEPE and FLOKI coins, more individuals may be interested in buying and holding them, which will drive up their value. This, in turn, will attract more investors to the crypto market, resulting in increased liquidity and growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Interestingly, Binance’s decision to add more functionalities for PEPE and FLOKI coins is a significant development in the memecoin ecosystem.</span></p>
<h2><b>PEPE and FLOKI Rises After Binance Listing</b></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="676" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/28120749/Bitcoin7.jpeg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="Bitcoin Price" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 8th, the Bitcoin price witnessed a sudden sell-off recording a 2% intraday loss. The selling pressure could be triggered when Binance world’s largest crypto exchange <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-mulls-using-lightning-network-amid-sudden-spike-in-bitcoin-gas-fee/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall">paused Bitcoin withdrawals</a> twice since yesterday amid a spike in gas fees. With this price drop, the sellers breached the support trendline of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/symmetrical-triangle-pattern/">symmetrical triangle pattern</a> reflecting a high possibility of prolonged correction.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bitcoin price ends two weeks of consolidation on a bearish note hints an upcoming downfall</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakdown below the pattern’s support trendline accelerates the selling pressure on the Bitcoin price</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $15.2 Billion, indicating a 21% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/q/QTSDNJC2.png" alt="Bitcoin price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">Bitcoin price</a> traded at $28035 and shows a bearish breakdown from the support trendline of the triangle pattern. The coin price resonated within this triangle for the past three weeks, projecting an uncertain sentiment among market participants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this breakdown tilts the favor on the sellers&#8217; side and offers them additional resistance to pressurize buyers. A daily candle closing below the trendline can provide a short entry opportunity to traders and extend the current retracement phase.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/top-web-3-phones-and-their-specifications/">Top Web 3 Phones And Their Specifications</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential downfall may drive the prices 3.6% down to hit $27000, or 10% to hit $25000 in bearish market sentiment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In case, the daily chart shows a long lower price rejection to raise above the trendline, the bearish thesis will get invalidated.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the recent drop, the Bitcoin price retested the support of the 50-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> slope. A breakdown below this slope will increase the possibility of a significant correction.</span></p>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A downtick in the daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> plunge below the mean line reflects aggressive selling pressure in the market.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Price Intraday Levels </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $2808</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $31200 and $34600</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $27000 and $25000</span></li>

<p>Armstrong and Murugesan admit the potential for the UAE to become a strategic hub for Coinbase. The UAE continues to expand its crypto and Web3 narrative with the first dedicated crypto regulator, clear regulations, and strong investor and customer protection.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Seeks Further Opportunities in the UAE</h2>
<p><strong>Nana Murugesan</strong>, VP of International &amp; Business Development at Coinbase, on May 8 <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/NanaMurugesan/status/1655493311161851904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the executive team, including CEO Brian Armstrong, are in the UAE for further strategic developments in the region.</p>
<p>Coinbase is working with <strong>Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM)</strong> regulators for licensing and availability for Coinbase International Exchange after it <a href="https://coingape.com/coinbase-news-launches-derivatives-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched the derivatives exchange in Bermuda last week</a>. The exchange is also seeking additional licenses and partnerships as <strong>Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA)</strong> builds a retail framework with virtual assets.</p>
<p>Coinbase will engage with policymakers, regulators, partners, web3 and crypto founders, and clients amid the rapid adoption of crypto and Web3 in the country. The UAE is also a key hub in the Middle East, Africa, and India region with over 11% of the population owning cryptocurrency.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<h2>Offshore Plans Amid Lack of Clarity in the US</h2>
<p>Amid the lack of clarity on crypto regulations in the U.S. and spat with the US SEC, Coinbase CEO <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-news-coinbase-coin-price-drops-3-as-ceo-hints-moving-offshore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Armstrong warns</a> to move offshore. However, Armstrong said to remain committed to the U.S. after recent quarterly results. He also believes that people have started moving to crypto due to the ongoing banking crisis.</p>
<p>The exchange has filed a lawsuit against the SEC to seek answers to questions including how the SEC applies securities laws on digital assets. A court has ordered the SEC to respond to Coinbase&#8217;s complaint in 10 days.</p>
<p>Coinbase chief legal officer <strong>Paul Grewal</strong> <a href="https://coingape.com/coinbase-legal-chief-takes-pre-emptive-strike-against-us-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently said</a> the Petition Clause protects the right of individuals to appeal to courts and other forums established by the government for the resolution of legal disputes. He cites the court’s precedents in <span class="r-36ujnk">Borough of Duryea v. Guarnieri</span>, 564 U.S. 379 (2011) case, urging US SEC Chair <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/gary-gensler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gary Gensler</a> to comply and respond to the complaints.</p>
