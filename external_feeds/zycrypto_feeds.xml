<p>Shiba Inu, the renowned meme-based cryptocurrency, experienced an astounding 1900% burn rate surge within 24 hours. This remarkable spike came on the heels of the Shibarium testnet, Puppynet, reaching a significant milestone of 25 million total transactions, generating immense excitement and anticipation for the imminent mainnet release.</p>



<p>PuppyScan, the dedicated blockchain explorer for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-gathers-pace-with-big-metaverse-updates-amid-rocket-pond-reveal-as-0-001-shib-price-beckons/">Shiba Inu</a>, reported that the Shibarium beta testnet had surpassed the impressive mark of 25 million transactions at a staggering 25,507,335. Moreover, 17,001,839 wallet addresses have actively participated in Shiba Inu transactions, highlighting the widespread engagement and interest in this captivating cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>The testnet has processed over 1,483,165 blocks, boasting an impressive average block time of 7.5 seconds. These impressive statistics showcase the efficiency and scalability of the testnet and contribute to the growing optimism surrounding Shiba Inu and the expanding possibilities within its ecosystem.</p>



<p>The excitement further intensified when Shytoshi Kusama, the esteemed lead developer of SHIB, took to Twitter to share a compelling 19-second video clip accompanied by an image featuring the iconic dog-headed SHIB logo. While the video contained minimal captions, it offered a tantalizing glimpse into the project&#8217;s plans. The dynamic motion lettering within the video alluded to an imminent revelation, with the cryptic message, &#8220;Something is coming. Actually, we are going somewhere.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-unlocks-remarkable-price-trajectory-amid-exciting-ecosystem-updates-for-shibarium/">Shibarium</a>, a cutting-edge Layer 2 blockchain platform, is poised to empower the development of Decentralized Applications (DApps). As the launch of the mainnet approaches, Shiba Inu enthusiasts eagerly anticipate the boundless opportunities and prospects that this innovative platform will unlock.</p>



<p>Regarding price action, Shiba Inu was observed trading at $0.000007722, registering a notable 3% increase in the past 24 hours. While volatility is inherent in the cryptocurrency market, the recent surge in burn rate and the significant milestone achieved by the Shibarium testnet undoubtedly contribute to the prevailing positive sentiment surrounding Shiba Inu amid calls for a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shib-price-beckons-as-shiba-inus-shibarium-public-beta-finally-set-to-go-live-this-week/">$0.001 SHIB price</a>.</p>



<p>As the cryptocurrency community eagerly awaits further updates and announcements from the dedicated team behind Shiba Inu, the resounding success of the Shibarium testnet and the growing engagement with Shiba Inu transactions establish a solid foundation for the project&#8217;s future growth and widespread adoption.</p>

<p>Jack Dorsey, the founder and former CEO of Twitter, has urged the current leadership to integrate censorship-resistant protocols to help alleviate the burden of restrictions. This comes just months after billionaire Elon Musk acquired the social media giant and embarked on a journey to transform the platform.</p>



<p>Dorsey <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1675280187704086528">tweeted</a> early Sunday, acknowledging the challenges of running Twitter and expressing hope for the platform&#8217;s success. He further emphasized the importance of building on open protocols like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-refusal-to-approve-a-spot-bitcoin-etf-makes-it-a-failed-regulator-says-geminis-cameron-winklevoss/">Bitcoin</a> and NOSTR to preserve the open internet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_XwRZf2kieCN-aye4y5GTJFiZpQCkvgl6-5jMWXQx1ypNgutXGbtzBWeXASWDaDAGEKj_rWCpr5rQ6-jZz2kjmOxF_3qQpyKeaavCHe_LXlSSShsrDIF4Tj5gesJU3Hn7ijLpd7WcjtQ8437p_yxLg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>NOSTR is a protocol designed to create a censorship-resistant global social network using simple and flexible event objects and standard elliptic-curve cryptography for keys and signing.</p>



<p>The timing of Dorsey&#8217;s tweet was notable, as it came just minutes before Elon Musk, the new owner of Twitter, announced temporary limits on account activities to address issues of data scraping and system manipulation.</p>



<p>Musk&#8217;s tweet sparked speculation about the platform&#8217;s future direction under his leadership, with various users reporting temporary restrictions to views. In a later tweet, the Tesla boss stated that implementing the rate limit on Twitter was a last resort to prevent competitors from accessing Twitter&#8217;s data. While acknowledging that it is a temporary measure, he assured users that normal Twitter functionality would be restored.</p>



<p>Elon Musk&#8217;s acquisition of Twitter last year was met with anticipation and concern. The $44 billion deal marked a significant moment for the social media service but also raised questions about the platform&#8217;s direction under Musk&#8217;s ownership.</p>



<p>Musk, known for his strong views on free speech, expressed his intention to create a more freewheeling platform, reverse the permanent ban on former President Donald J. Trump and integrate cryptocurrencies such as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/elon-musk-hints-at-integrating-dogecoin-for-millions-of-users-if-he-buys-twitter-or-creates-own-platform/">Dogecoin</a> for payments. Musk&#8217;s ownership of Twitter also promised sweeping changes for the platform, including pledging new leadership, job cuts, and innovative strategies to monetize the service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Critics, however, have been voicing concerns about the potential for increased toxic content and misinformation on Twitter, with the public Square being sued for various alleged violations, including a $250 million copyright case last week by 17 music publishers.</p>



<p>That said, as Elon Musk addresses the challenges faced by Twitter, Dorsey&#8217;s proposition on the integration of Bitcoin and NOSTR holds the potential to revolutionize the platform into a more decentralized and censorship-resistant space, according to some. At press time, however, Musk was yet to respond to the proposition.</p>

<p>In a scathing critique of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, has condemned the regulatory body for its decade-long <a href="https://zycrypto.com/a-non-futures-etf-structure-is-the-superior-approach-says-vaneck-ceo-as-sec-refuses-to-approve-a-bitcoin-spot-fund/">refusal to approve</a> a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).</p>



<p>In a Sunday tweet, the crypto guru claimed that the SEC&#8217;s actions have been detrimental to U.S. investors and demonstrated its failure as a regulator. Winklevoss&#8217;s statement came on the 10th anniversary of his initial filing for the first <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-gains-fidelity-re-files-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-amongst-many-is-demand-driving-btc-price/">spot Bitcoin ETF</a>.</p>



<p>Over the years, the SEC has repeatedly rejected proposals for spot Bitcoin ETFs, denying investors the opportunity to access one of the best-performing assets of the last decade. Winklevoss argued that this refusal had had significant negative consequences, forcing investors into alternative avenues that offer suboptimal options. Specifically, he highlighted the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as a prime example.</p>



<p>According to him, the SEC is a failed regulator because it <em>“‘protected’ investors from the best-performing asset of the last decade -pushed investors into toxic products like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which trades at a massive discount to NAV and charges astronomical fees.”</em></p>



<p>Moreover, Winklevoss pointed out that the SEC&#8217;s refusal to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs had pushed spot Bitcoin activity offshore, diverting it to unlicensed and unregulated venues. This trend poses potential risks for investors who seek exposure to cryptocurrency but are forced to operate in a less secure environment.</p>



<p>Winklevoss accused the SEC of indirectly leading investors into the arms of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/house-committee-requests-information-on-gary-genslers-interaction-with-sam-bankman-fried-and-ftx/">FTX</a>. This cryptocurrency exchange was embroiled in one of the largest financial frauds in modern history. In his view, by failing to provide a regulated avenue for investors to access Bitcoin through spot ETFs, the SEC inadvertently directed them to less trustworthy platforms, exposing them to more significant risks.</p>



<p>Calling for a reassessment of the SEC&#8217;s approach, Winklevoss suggested that the regulatory body should focus on its core responsibilities of investor protection, fostering fair and orderly markets, and facilitating capital formation. By doing so, the SEC could have achieved far better outcomes for U.S. investors.</p>



<p>This critique from Winklevoss comes in the wake of recent statements by the SEC that ETF filings by BlackRock and others were &#8220;inadequate&#8221;. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has expressed concerns over investor protection, market manipulation, and the need for robust regulatory oversight before greenlighting such products, stating last month that &#8220;<em>There’s nothing about the crypto securities markets that suggests that investors and issuers are less deserving of the protections of our securities laws.”</em></p>



<p>However, Gensler’s assertions have been heavily criticized, with industry players accusing him of overreaching his mandate under U.S. securities laws. Notably, in the past few weeks, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pro-crypto-lawmakers-officially-introduce-legislation-to-oust-sec-chair-gary-gensler/">calls for his sacking have increased</a>, with pro-crypto congressman Warren Davidson filing a bill last month to reform the SEC and remove the “tyrannical Chairman” Gary Gensler.</p>

<p>In a recent Video for CryptoLawUS, John Deaton, the well-known lawyer and representative of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-could-soar-10x-to-hit-300000-reckons-xrp-holders-lawyer-heres-how/">XRP holders</a> in the SEC vs Ripple lawsuit, discusses the unease of waiting for a final ruling. Deaton recognises that people are making assumptions and expressing annoyance at how long the case has strung.</p>



<p>Drawing on his own experience, Deaton states, “Well, today I was working on a case that was filed in 2018 by me; there&#8217;s like three of these cases. That&#8217;s 2018. It was five years ago. And so, this delay is normal to me <em>because it&#8217;s the civil justice system.”</em></p>



<p>Deaton emphasized the situation&#8217;s complexity by highlighting that Ripple and the SEC made multiple moves for summary judgment in the case&#8217;s reply briefs and objections to one another&#8217;s motions. Additionally, the case is complex and involves hundreds of pages of arguments for the judge to go through.</p>



<p>Six months ago, the response briefs were due; on March 6th, a Daubert motion was also submitted, dealing with expert witnesses&#8217; admissibility. It was highlighted that the judge&#8217;s summary judgment rulings had occurred anywhere from the same day as the Daubert decision to six months subsequently, based on earlier rulings she issued in related instances.</p>



<p>To dispel the myth that this case is taking much longer than her prior ones, it was anticipated that the decision, in this case, could be made by September 6th. The judge is probably taking the time to thoroughly consider her ruling, given the significance of this case and the scrutiny it will receive from numerous parties, including appellate courts.</p>



<p>Regarding the length of the case, the famous lawyer argues that this case, which fills a regulatory gap, is a first impression case because no other cases have addressed secondary sales in this way. Fifteen amicus briefs have also been submitted, underlining the case&#8217;s importance for international trade, finance, and U.S. economic policy.</p>



<p>It should be noted, according to Deaton, that Judge Torres has a wide range of duties and objectives while managing over 500 outstanding cases, including 44 criminal cases. Despite some claims to the contrary, it is critical to acknowledge the importance of each case on the docket, even those involving defendants who face harsh penalties.</p>



<p>Deaton dismisses the idea of anything nefarious occurring in this case as absolute nonsense. While some have argued Judge Torres is on the SEC payroll and that she is doing an inside job, Deaton strongly questions why the Judge would have ruled against the SEC at all then, for example, by ordering them to release the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-references-hinman-emails-in-xrp-case-as-exchange-seeks-dismissal-of-secs-lawsuit/">Hinman emails</a>.</p>



<p><em>“OK, so if she was corrupt and on the SEC&#8217;s payroll, she would have never released the Hinman emails that they fought so desperately to keep private.” </em>He said on the matter.</p>



<p>While Deaton pointed out that he was happy with the appointment of Judge Netburn and Torres, he said that he did not have to agree with every decision they made but that they were fair overall. He cited the exclusion of an SEC witness who claimed to speak for XRP holders yet had never even spoken to one.</p>



<p>He said: <em>“Are you really going to sit there and say oh she just did that to give an appearance that she&#8217;s fair. Come on like let&#8217;s join reality. Get out of the metaverse and let&#8217;s get back into reality. Please. It&#8217;s not.”</em></p>



<p>Finally, Deaton concluded that if the decision is in Ripple&#8217;s favour, the SEC may submit a notice of appeal; if it is in the SEC&#8217;s favour, the SEC may still decide to appeal or negotiate with Ripple.</p>



<p>Given the importance of the case and the likelihood that it will go to the US Supreme Court, the judge would take the much-needed time before making a final ruling, aware that the Second Circuit and other high-ranking judges will be closely examining it.</p>

<p>In a successful operation against cryptocurrency crime, Australian authorities have apprehended two individuals and recovered high-end cars and valuable timepieces following a thorough investigation by the Financial Crimes Squad detectives. </p>



<p>According to a June 22 statement by the New Wales Police, the investigation, conducted by the State Crime Command&#8217;s Financial Crimes Squad, focused on a cryptocurrency hoax that defrauded two companies of over $5.5 million.</p>



<p>Notably, the cryptocurrency scam is reported to have occurred in 2021, prompting the creation of Strike Force Scotland in March 2023. The diligent efforts of the strike force culminated on Friday, June 16, 2023, when detectives intercepted a vehicle on Orlando Road in Cromer, successfully apprehending the 39-year-old driver who was the sole occupant.</p>



<p>Following the arrest, three search warrants were executed at a residence and warehouse in Cromer linked to the suspect, yielding significant findings. These included the seizure of six luxury and classic cars, 11 motorcycles, seven luxury watches, cryptocurrency wallets, and relevant documents associated with the ongoing investigation. The total estimated value of the confiscated vehicles is approximately $2.7 million.</p>



<p>The apprehended individual was charged with dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage through deception and knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime to conceal. On Saturday, June 21, 2023, police discovered and seized a red Ferrari valued at $600,000 from a car dealership in Marrickville, strengthening the case against the accused. They also apprehended a 67-year-old man on the same day and charged him with dealing with the proceeds of crime exceeding $100,000.</p>



<p>As per the statement, the police plan to &#8220;<em>allege in court the younger man allegedly defrauded the companies using a cryptocurrency scam, whilst the older man authorized the funds and arranged the disposal of the Ferrari on behalf of the younger man to avoid police detection.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Confirming the arrests, Detective Superintendent Gordon Arbinja, Commander of the State Crime Command&#8217;s Financial Crimes Squad, issued a timely reminder to exercise caution and due diligence when engaging in cryptocurrency transactions.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Cryptocurrency isn&#8217;t illegal, but it is imperative that it&#8217;s handled responsibly to avoid being scammed</em>,&#8221; said Arbinja&nbsp;</p>



<p>Arbinja further recommended using AUSTRAC-approved digital currency exchanges and thoroughly scrutinizing transaction details during cryptocurrency buying or selling. He also urged individuals who suspect a scam has targeted them to contact ScamWatch and local law enforcement for assistance promptly.</p>



<p>This is not the first time Australian authorities have conducted successful arrests and recovery of assets in prominent cryptocurrency fraud cases. Last December, police apprehended four individuals following a $100 million scam involving fraudulent cryptocurrency and forex investment investments.</p>



<p>That said, the prevalence of investment scams is a global concern, and Australia has not been spared. Recent data compiled by Scamwatch reveals that Australians lost over AU$ 113 million within the initial five months of 2022.</p>

<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing director has recognized the role that Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) could play in increasing financial inclusion and making cross-border payments and remittances cheaper and quicker.</p>



<p>These remarks were made by Kristalina Georgieva, IMF Managing Director, on June 19, 2023, at the High-level Policy Roundtable on Central Bank Digital Currencies while discussing ‘The Role of the Public Sector in Money and Payments – A New Vision’ in Rabat, Morocco.</p>



<p>Georgieva said that though CBDCs could increase efficiencies in cross-border payments, foster competition, and enhance transparency, they could lead to financial stability risks, data privacy, and legal challenges, if poorly designed.</p>



<p>Georgieva further cautioned that easy access to foreign CBDCs could lead to risks of currency substitution and capital flow volatility.</p>



<p>According to Tobias Adrian, Financial Counsellor and Director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department at the IMF, new technologies, and new legal and regulatory environments will be a hurdle to some but a springboard to others. Adrian said that CBDC platforms would need to be backed by strong legal and regulatory frameworks.</p>



<p>Adrian made the above remarks at the joint IMF—Bank Al-Maghrib High-Level Policy Roundtable on Central Bank Digital Currencies that was discussing Exploring Cross-Border and Domestic Payment and Contracting Platforms, in Rabat, Morocco on June 19, 2023.</p>



<p>Adrian said that CBDC platforms are worth investigating and that individual countries will base on preferences, needs, and policy objectives to decide which CBDC direction to take. Adrian said that several central banks have begun experiments on CBDCs and they are following their work with great interest.</p>



<p>According to the Deputy Managing Director, Bo Li, by the end of February 2023, over 40 countries had approached the IMF to request technical assistance on CBDCs and the IMF had already engaged with almost 30 of the countries.</p>



<p>Li made these remarks at the panel on the IMF Approach to Central Bank Digital Currency Capacity Development on April 12, 2023. Li said CBDCs are likely to have profound implications for monetary policy and financial stability.</p>



<p>Li further said that the IMF will monitor and advise on digital money developments, including CBDCs, for its members. Li said that the IMF’s approach to capacity development on CBDCs aims to help member countries make well-informed decisions when considering designing and issuing CBDCs.</p>



<p>According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) CBDC survey of 2021, nine out of 10 central banks were exploring CBDCs. Half of the central banks in the BIS survey were developing or running concrete experiments on CBDCs.</p>

<p>Polygon has responded to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) claim that its token is a security governed by the Securities laws. According to a June 11, 2023 tweet, Polygon has advised that its token was developed and deployed outside the United States (U.S.) and never targeted the U.S. market at any time.</p>



<p>In its recent cases against Binance and Coinbase, the SEC named the following cryptocurrencies as securities: BNB, Binance USD, Solana, Cardano, Polygon, ATOM, SAND, MANA, AXS, COTI, Chiliz (CHZ), FLOW, Internet Computer (ICP), NEAR, Voyager Token (VGX), and NEXO.</p>



<p>The SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, has reiterated his earlier position on crypto tokens. According to Gensler, many problems in the crypto markets arise from wide-ranging non-compliance, as witnessed before the federal securities laws were put in place in the 1920s.</p>



<p>Gensler made the remarks before the Piper Sandler Global Exchange &amp; Fintech Conference in Washington, D.C., on June 8, 2023. He further said that most crypto tokens meet the investment contract test, and crypto security issuers must register the offer and sale of their investment contracts with the SEC or seek an exemption.</p>



<p>Gensler further referenced the guidance the SEC has provided market participants on what does or does not constitute a crypto asset security. Gensler pointed out that intermediaries and promoters offer lending or staking-as-a-service programs that promise returns in exchange for investors’ crypto tokens.</p>



<p>However, Gensler says that additional utility does not remove crypto asset security from an investment contract, even when promoters say tokens have functions beyond an investment vehicle.</p>



<p>Gensler said that most crypto tokens are subject to securities laws and that it is immaterial whether the enterprise is speculative or non-speculative or whether there is a sale of property with or without intrinsic value.</p>



<p>In its complaint last week, the SEC alleged that Binance attempted to evade U.S. securities laws to keep high-value U.S. customers on their platforms. Gensler advised crypto intermediaries to separate business lines and properly segregate customer funds to protect investors.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen what next steps the SEC will take against those crypto tokens it has deemed as securities.</p>

<ul>
<li>A newly resurfaced video from 2018 shows Gary Gensler saying&nbsp; BTC, ETH, and LTC are not securities.</li>



<li>Crypto users sharply contrast Gensler’s pro and anti-crypto stance, highlighting significant swings over the years.</li>



<li>In a related development, some United States lawmakers are preparing a bill to reform the SEC and fire Gensler.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has received criticisms over his sudden ideological shift since becoming the Commission’s boss in 2020.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1668328519334780928?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">video</a> from 2018 featuring Gary Gensler has resurfaced on social media showing him stating clearly that Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash are not securities. Several pro-crypto accounts have shared the video describing Gensler as “<em>unstable” </em>in his views as he waged war against digital assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gensler was addressing institutional investors at an event hosted by Bloomberg and went on to say “<em>Over 70% of the crypto market is Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash. Why did I name those four? They’re not securities.” </em>At the time, Gensler was notably pro-crypto and was a Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he held lectures on blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two years down the line, he was appointed as the SEC boss with several industry executives and enthusiasts lauding the appointment as the turning point for the industry as inflows began trickling in from institutional investors in 2020. Over the years, the once-sweet experience has turned sour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The video resurfaced on social media after Gensler launched a new offensive against Binance US and Coinbase with lawsuits making several allegations including fraud and offering its services to unregistered securities. This is not the first of Gensler’s pro-crypto speeches to be circulated accusing him of bias as he now works with the SEC.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-is-not-our-gensler">This is not our Gensler&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The new Gary Gensler is not lenient towards digital assets as he was about four years ago. In his defence, many have said as a regulator, he needs to protect investors with everything although they also concede to the fact that his approach is wrong since there’s no clarity of regulation in the market. </p>



<p>Before his appointment to the top job at the SEC, Gensler noted that ETH was not a security but post his appointment, he <a href="https://zycrypto.com/post-merge-concerns-heres-why-eth-could-be-viewed-as-a-security/">suggested</a> that all cryptocurrencies other than BTC could be securities. As SEC chair, he failed to directly answer whether ETH constitutes securities while grilled by Congress leading to more uncertainty.</p>



<p>In a similar video in 2018, Gensler claimed that two-thirds of digital assets are “<em>non-securities</em>&#8216;, but the Commission under his leadership has labelled about 68 digital assets as securities with lawsuits slapped on Binance and Coinbase. In 2019, Gensler referred to Algorand (<em>A</em>LGO) as a “<em>great technology” </em>Forward to 2023, the SEC claims ALGO is a security, a move that has significantly impacted the price of the assets. </p>



<p>The digital asset community remains in shock at the transformation of Gensler, with some calling him a “<em>hypocrite” </em>while pushing for his exit from the SEC.</p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said Tuesday it had not decided whether it will reply to Coinbase’s rulemaking petition. The Wall Street regulator said it anticipates requiring four months to respond potentially and that the lawsuit against the San Francisco-based exchange is not inconsistent with any decision on rulemaking.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sec-requests-for-more-time-to-respond-to-coinbase-s-rulemaking-request"><strong>SEC Requests For More Time To Respond To Coinbase’s Rulemaking Request</strong></h2>



<p>The U.S. SEC has said it needs 120 days to respond to Coinbase’s request that it adopt new rules and clarify which crypto assets should be regarded as securities.</p>



<p>In a June 13 filing, the Commission said it “has not decided what action to take on Coinbase’s rulemaking petition.”</p>



<p>This comes after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit’s judge Cheryl Ann Krause — who noted the SEC&#8217;s complaint filed last week — ordered the SEC to clarify its position on the rulemaking petition from Coinbase. Judge Cheryl ordered the SEC to explain within 7 days if it intends to decline Coinbase’s request, the reasons for such a decision, or a timeline of when it expects to come to a decision.</p>



<p>The SEC claimed Coinbase’s “extraordinary request” for a writ of mandamus has “no merit”. The securities regulator maintained that the mandamus petition should be rejected, but it thinks it will make a recommendation “within the next 120 days.” It has offered to provide the court with a status report by Oct. 11, 2023.</p>



<p>“Regardless of whether the Commission determines to undertake the rulemaking sought by Coinbase, a decision the Commission has yet to make, Coinbase — like everyone else — is bound by existing law,&#8221; the SEC filing stated. &#8220;And Coinbase is free to vigorously assert its position that it has not violated that law in the current enforcement action.&#8221;</p>



<p>Earlier last week, the SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/this-is-an-opportunity-to-get-rule-clarity-in-court-coinbase-stresses-on-the-positive-amid-sec-lawsuit/">hit </a>America’s largest digital asset exchange with a suit, alleging that it operated as an unregistered securities exchange for years and “elevated its interest in increasing its profits over investors’ interests.”</p>



<p>Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase, <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1668742688689070083">slammed </a>the SEC’s response in a tweet, saying the agency “ignore[d] the clear statements of the Chair that confirm they have no intent to issue new rules, and instead conflate the evidence of a decision those statements provide with an argument that the statements are themselves a decision,&#8221; adding that “they refuse to commit to any deadline despite the Court&#8217;s explicit order.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s Coming Next?</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC’s legal battle with Coinbase is only part of a wider clampdown on the fast-growing crypto sector, steered by Chair Gary Gensler, who has on multiple occasions stated that all digital assets — excluding bitcoin — are securities.</p>



<p>A day before <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">taking enforcement action</a> against Coinbase, the regulator had <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">struck </a>Binance, its U.S. arm Binance.US, and CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao with 13 charges.</p>



<p>With the SEC’s response to Coinbase’s rulemaking petition not providing any clarity on the agency’s current stance, the crypto industry will continue to operate in an environment of legal uncertainty. This likely means a years-long litigation battle for Coinbase and Binance and an uncertain future for token projects mentioned in the two lawsuits.</p>

<p>A few days ago, Mihailo Bjelic, the Co-founder of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polygons-co-founder-pushes-for-gaming-revolution-as-cryptos-largest-scale-opportunity/">Polygon</a> and the Polygon Labs technical team, released a proposal to convert Polygon PoS to a zkEVM validium, a decentralized L2 that is the first of its type and secured by ZK proofs. This would be a significant achievement for the Polygon ecosystem since it will make Polygon PoS a more reliable, efficient, and integral part of the Polygon 2.0 ecosystem.</p>



<p>By processing transactions outside of the Ethereum Mainnet, zkEVM validium is a scaling solution that seeks to increase transaction throughput. It takes advantage of off-chain data availability and processing, much like the validium used by other scaling solutions. Zero-knowledge proofs are published by validium, such as the zkEVM validium, to validate off-chain Ethereum transactions.</p>



<p>These zero-knowledge proofs, like ZK-SNARKs and ZK-STARKs, work as &#8220;validity proofs&#8221; that verify the accuracy of off-chain transactions and strengthen the security guarantees of the validium chain. Users&#8217; funds in zkEVM Validium are managed by an Ethereum smart contract. Almost immediate withdrawals are enabled as soon as a withdrawal request&#8217;s validity proof has been confirmed on the Ethereum Mainnet.</p>



<p>In the last 18 months, Polygon Labs has launched the only mainnet EVM-equivalent zkEVM and the quickest ZK proving system in the market. Despite being popular and widely used across the ecosystem, some issues raise questions regarding the Polygon PoS architecture&#8217;s long-term relevancy and dependability. It implies that these problems must be resolved to guarantee the platform&#8217;s long-term viability and user pleasure.</p>



<p>With its 100 validators and sizable staked value, Polygon PoS delivers a respectable amount of decentralization and economic security. However, by ultimately inheriting Ethereum&#8217;s security, powerful Layer 2 (L2) technologies like Polygon&#8217;s zkEVM can offer even higher security.</p>



<p>The Polygon PoS tech stack uses forks of the Cosmos SDK and Geth. Given the labour involved and the availability of more sophisticated L2 technologies like Polygon&#8217;s zkEVM, maintaining these forks may not be the best option.</p>



<p>Deep chain reorganizations occasionally occur in the probabilistic consensus process utilized by Polygon PoS, which can negatively impact the user experience and dependability. Additionally, the quick block times may cause errors in gas estimation, resulting in sporadic increases in gas prices.</p>



<p>Overall, the improvement is thought to be feasible, simple, and advantageous and would offer several advantages. The modification would result in enhanced Transaction Data Availability, Viability, and Simplicity, Higher Scalability, Lower Fees, and Increased Security.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the proposal views the switch to a zkEVM validium as a workable, simple, and advantageous solution to the problems Polygon PoS faces, enabling cheaper costs, more scalability, and utilizing the decentralization and design of Polygon PoS already in place.</p>

<p>Eswar Prasad, Indian-American economist and Tolani Senior Professor of International Trade Policy at Cornell University, recently spoke at the 2023 Summer Davos about the fact that Retail Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) have been the subject of tests in several nations, including China, Sweden, India, Brazil, and Japan. Engaging in this context is that these nations already have effective domestic retail payment systems in place. According to Prasad, as the private sector discovered more effective ways to handle payment transactions and advance financial inclusion, such as India&#8217;s Unified Payments Interface (UPI), the use case for retail CBDCs has been weaker over the past few years.</p>



<p>In a report called ‘The Future of CBDCs’, Ripple highlights that the real-time value transfer between various Central Bank Digital Currencies can be seamless and cost-effective using a neutral bridge asset, such as the digital asset XRP. It makes trade-less liquid CBDC pairs possible, boosts competitiveness globally by lowering obstacles to entry for smaller market players, and optimizes payments for speed, scalability, affordability, and security.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-launches-a-novel-platform-for-governments-central-banks-developing-cbdcs/">Ripple announced its CBDC Platform</a>, enabling governments and central banks to expand access to the unbanked population globally and promote digitising their financial services.</p>



<p>David Schwartz, Ripple CTO, mentioned in a Tweet that <em>“The CBDC Platform reaffirms the significance of the XRP Ledger as it’s built with the same core ledger technology. It has the ability to interact with XRPL and use XRP as a bridge currency for cross-currency and cross-border payments.”</em></p>



<p>Professor Prasad said that despite some countries possibly not needing a CBDC, central bankers continue to have some reasons for introducing CBDCs. A CBDC could promote payment system interoperability in China, for example, where well-known payment platforms like Alipay and WeChat Pay lack direct contact. By offering a public payment option, a second goal is to ensure the robustness of the payment system. Furthermore, when talking about CBDCs, many central bankers stress the idea of monetary sovereignty.</p>



<p>Prasad draws attention to the fact that conventional cross-border payments are expensive, cumbersome, and difficult to track in real time. However, cross-border transactions may be done more quickly and easily thanks to technological developments spurred by the Crypto revolution. This has made it easier for economic migrants to settle almost immediately, lessen the need for hedging, and streamline remittances. According to Prasad, the integration of wholesale CBDCs by central banks worldwide has the potential to enhance international payments.</p>



<p>Prasad expressed sincere doubts about whether the US Dollar will be replaced anytime soon. But he stressed that the current financial system may not be perfect or balanced, with one dominating currency influencing global markets.</p>



<p>Prasad concluded: <em>“I want to make the case that even if there were to be a digital renminbi well before there ever is a digital dollar, is it going to fundamentally alter the dynamics of international finance? If you think about international payments, practically all of them are digital already.”</em></p>



<p>While he was not directly speaking about <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-references-hinman-emails-in-xrp-case-as-exchange-seeks-dismissal-of-secs-lawsuit/">XRP</a>, the digital asset, amongst others such as Stellar, has often been heralded as a bridge currency and perhaps even a true stablecoin. If central banks resolve to use XRP for cross-border payments will have to be seen. Still, it is a hotly debated topic amongst the XRP Community in particular and the wider Crypto Community.</p>

<p>Statistician Willy Woo, the creator of data resource Woobull, has predicted that the price of the flagship cryptocurrency has the potential to reach $310,000 heights if some specific market conditions come into play.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-310k-btc-possible-if-institutions-allocate-5-of-aum-to-bitcoin"><strong>$310K BTC Possible If Institutions Allocate 5% Of AUM To Bitcoin</strong></h2>



<p>Analyst Willy Woo thinks Bitcoin could skyrocket to unprecedented values if institutional giants put just 5% of their AUM into BTC.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1674010721225691136">tweet</a>, Woo suggested that if big players the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon, Invesco, and Bank of America decide converted 5% of their assets under management to bitcoin, the preeminent crypto asset could easily hit $310,000. For Woo, the potential mega growth in Bitcoin&#8217;s market cap, accompanied by the increase in its realized cap, would lead to such an upsurge in price.</p>



<p>The statistician also noted that BTC’s price trajectory would also be affected by the timing of these institutional-grade investments. &#8220;The estimate of $310,000 per Bitcoin really depends on whether these institutional players deploy their investments during a bearish or bullish phase of the market,&#8221; said Woo. He expects BTC to plunge to roughly $128,000 in bearish conditions, but for a bullish phase, the flagship crypto should climb to around $400,000.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What would price do if these guys put 5% of AUM into BTC?<br><br>My calculations estimate around ~$310k per coin. <a href="https://t.co/XHfYxETVWY">https://t.co/XHfYxETVWY</a> <a href="https://t.co/anyym07XUQ">pic.twitter.com/anyym07XUQ</a></p>&mdash; Willy Woo (@woonomic) <a href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1674010721225691136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Some Twitter users, however, were not convinced by Woo’s estimations, mainly regarding the assumption that these high-profile financial institutions could simply choose to redirect a certain percentage of their AUM toward BTC. This is because these institutions manage their clients’ funds and what to invest the money into is ultimately the customers&#8217; decision. </p>



<p>In response to these concerns, Woo explained that his Bitcoin estimation was merely hypothetical based on a question he had been asked. He further noted that wealth management can be divided into two different classes: those operated by investor decisions and those that rely on the decision of the wealth manager. As such, any substantial investment in BTC would probably require consent from these institutions’ customers.</p>



<p>The largest cryptocurrency was trading at about $30,572.91 at press time, up 1.6% over the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What&#8217;s the likelihood of all these institutions allocating only 5% of their AUM during the next bull cycle?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has expressed sympathy for “bluechip” crypto tokens like Solana that have been directly targeted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its recent aggressive legal actions against Binance and Coinbase.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-buterin-s-thoughts-on-ethereum-emerging-as-winner"><strong>Buterin’s Thoughts On Ethereum Emerging As Winner</strong></h2>



<p>Vitalik Buterin has made a compassionate remark regarding Solana (SOL) and the other major crypto assets that were dragged into court battles by the Security and Exchange Commission.</p>



<p>Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang asked Buterin on Twitter how he feels about the U.S. policy approach to cryptocurrencies amid the regulatory turmoil. The Ethereum founder wasted no time <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1674644137847451649">saying </a>he felt bad that SOL and the other tokens are being hit this way by the SEC.</p>



<p>The top U.S. regulator memorably filed lawsuits against crypto exchanges <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">Binance </a>and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">Coinbase </a>earlier this month, charging the exchanges with trading crypto asset securities, including SOL, Cardano’s ADA, Polygon&#8217;s MATIC, and Algorand&#8217;s ALGO.</p>



<p>“They don&#8217;t deserve it, and if Ethereum ends up &#8216;winning&#8217; through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that&#8217;s not an honorable way to win, and in the long term, probably isn&#8217;t even a victory,” Buterin posited.</p>



<p>For Buterin, Ethereum&#8217;s real competition is not other chains in the crypto space but &#8220;the rapidly expanding centralized world that is imposing itself on us as we speak.&#8221; Meanwhile, he wished for all “honorable projects” to get a fair outcome amid the regulatory storm.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crypto Projects Hit Back At SEC’s Allegations</strong></h2>



<p>SOL, ADA, MATIC, and the other tokens saw their prices plummet after they were labelled securities by the SEC, and as if that weren’t enough, prominent companies like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/robinhood-ceases-support-for-cardano-solana-and-polygon-after-sec-calls-them-securities/">Robinhood</a>, eToro, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/digital-asset-platform-bakkt-follows-robinhood-in-delisting-cardano-polygon-solana-after-sec-lawsuits/">Bakkt</a>, and Revolut all have announced ADA, MATIC, and SOL delistings in response to the regulator’s action.</p>



<p>The development companies behind these tokens separately <a href="https://zycrypto.com/far-from-securities-solana-polygon-and-cardano-issue-solid-statements-against-sec-claims/">released </a>statements recently that fought against the SEC’s claims. The Solana Foundation disputed the SEC’s classification and maintained that it welcomes continued cooperation with lawmakers to reach regulatory clarity.</p>



<p>Cardano developer IOG also rejected the Commission’s claims that ADA, the blockchain&#8217;s native token, can be regarded as a security. IOG observed that the SEC&#8217;s suit contained “numerous factual inaccuracies” and that “under no circumstances was ADA a security.”</p>



<p>Notably, the prices of SOL, ADA, and MATIC have <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-solana-polygon-prices-make-comeback-rally-as-foundations-fire-back-against-secs-security-label/">stabilized and recouped some losses</a> amid a BlackRock-fuelled rally, which started after the financial services giant’s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">application </a>for a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 15, driving the benchmark cryptocurrency <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-surges-past-31k-now-up-80-this-year-as-wall-street-eyes-digital-gold/">past $31,000</a> for the first time in months — raising the tide for the majority of tokens in the market.</p>

<p>Vodafone and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-highlights-cardanos-growing-adoption-amidst-lots-of-noise-in-crypto/">Cardano</a> may seem like an unlikely match on the surface, but there may be more to it than meets the eye. It all started with a Tweet by Vodafone Germany asking if Cardano had NFTs.</p>



<p>“Does Cardano have NFTs ? Moving the chains,” the mysterious tweet read.</p>



<p>This was followed up a day later on an official Vodafone Germany social media Discord channel.</p>



<p>Vodafone representative Luca wrote: <em>“Yes, we are planning to release an NFT collection this year, and we want to utilize the Cardano chain for this. The reason we chose this particular chain comes down to community, sustainability as well as cross-chain possibilities.”</em></p>



<p>Vodafone&#8217;s choice to use the Cardano network for minting NFTs has increased Cardano&#8217;s visibility and likelihood of widespread adoption. Vodafone&#8217;s cooperation, coming from a significant international company, illustrates the potential and capabilities of the Cardano blockchain for hosting large-scale projects. Cardano adoption may increase due to this exposure among other companies and developers who may be motivated to learn more about the capabilities and advantages of the platform.</p>



<p>By selecting Cardano as the NFT minting platform, Vodafone expresses confidence in the network&#8217;s technical capabilities and infrastructure. This can bolster the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-sees-surging-adoption-in-the-u-s-fueling-super-bullish-ecosystem-growth-for-ada/">Cardano ecosystem</a> and support its long-term expansion and sustainability.</p>



<p>Additionally, ADA is the native coin of the Cardano blockchain. The value and demand for ADA may benefit from increased Cardano network adoption and usage, pushed by major corporations like Vodafone. Increased transactions, staking of ADA, and involvement in the management of the Cardano blockchain may occur when more companies and individuals interact with the Cardano ecosystem. These activities can increase interest in ADA and raise prices.</p>



<p>Cardano enthusiasts and ADA holders alike will be pleased with the development as Cardano is gaining real-life use cases on top of a solid foundation. As one Twitter user Dave, noted, Cardanos&#8217; uptime has just passed 2100 days.</p>



<p>And Patrick Tobler, the founder of NMKR, the platform that will help mint Vodafone NFTs on Cardano, targeted a tweet at Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson stating, “Real-World Enterprise Adoption, what do you say?</p>



<p>While Hoskinson did not directly comment on the development or respond to the tweet, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-highlights-cardanos-growing-adoption-amidst-lots-of-noise-in-crypto/">he said</a>, “Lots of noise in crypto. Look for the signal. Cardano is getting real adoption and growing as an ecosystem under the harshest conditions our industry knows. Like Bitcoin, this is being done in a completely decentralized way.&#8221;</p>
