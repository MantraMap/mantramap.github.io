<p class="s3">Bitcoin (BTC) and its hard forks are captivating the market, with Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) soaring. However, amidst this frenzy, InQubeta, an AI altcoin, has piqued the curiosity of investors and is being selected as the go-to investment.</p>
<p class="s3">In this article, we will explain what makes InQubeta stand out in the crypto landscape. Join us as we delve into Bitcoin hard forks and explore why smart investors are doubling down on the AI token InQubeta.</p>
InQubeta (QUBE): The token not to miss out on
<p class="s3">Defying all expectations, smart investors are doubling down on InQubeta, despite the surge in the price of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV). The commitment to investment in its utility token, QUBE, is largely responsible for it being an AI altcoin and for its revolutionary idea of solving a critical problem in the industry.</p>
<p class="s3">InQubeta is the world's first crowdfunding platform built for AI businesses to raise capital as well as for investors to acquire interests in promising projects. Its marketplace will allow investors to invest in AI startups by purchasing fractionalized investment opportunities.</p>
<p class="s3">Its fractional investment model reinforced investors' commitment towards investment as its innovative idea allows ownership of fractions of AI startups and eliminates investment limits. In addition, the gains that come from being an investor and holder further bolster confidence in the project. For instance, as one of the fastest-growing industries, investors stand to gain ridiculously high profits by investing early in promising AI projects. Additionally, the coin is expected to benefit from the increasing adoption of AI, which means it will soar in the coming months, making it a more compelling investment.</p>

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) experiences a significant surge during Bitcoin&rsquo;s rally
<p class="s3">Bitcoin Cash (BCH) came about from a hard fork in the blockchain, aimed at increasing the block size limit to make it more scalable by enabling cheaper and faster transactions. Bitcoin Cash&rsquo;s (BCH) price movement has been largely unimpressive this year, as it hovered for the most part below $146. </p>
<p class="s3">However, a price upturn on June 21 saw Bitcoin Cash trade above $200, although it has been experiencing a slight decline in price. Its rally came during Bitcoin&rsquo;s (BTC) rally, showing its dependency. However, despite Bitcoin Cash&rsquo;s uptrends, investors are still keen on investing in or diversifying parts of their investments in InQubeta because of its immense growth potential.</p>
Bitcoin SV (BSV) trades in tandem with Bitcoin (BTC) as it rallies alongside
<p class="s3">Bitcoin SV (BSV) emerged after a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash blockchain, making it one of Bitcoin&rsquo;s hard forks even if not directly. Bitcoin SV, which stands for &ldquo;Bitcoin Satoshi Vision,&rdquo; sought to restore what is considered the original vision of Bitcoin as outlined by its creator.</p>
<p class="s3">As Bitcoin&rsquo;s hard fork, Bitcoin SV often mirrors its price movement, which is currently on a rally. After Bitcoin SV&rsquo;s bearish descent from mid-May to the middle of June, Bitcoin SV regained bullish momentum and has been on a price swing. Despite its upswing, investors are still doubling down on InQubeta.</p>
Conclusion
<p class="s3">Despite the surge of Bitcoin&rsquo;s hard forks like Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin Cash, InQubeta has emerged as a shining star and captured the attention of investors. Its trailblazing idea that combines AI with the limitless potential of blockchain technology, as well as exponential returns on investment, has led investors to double down. As a worthwhile investment, it has been experiencing huge presale participation, which will increase further in the coming week. To participate in the presale, click on the link below.</p>
