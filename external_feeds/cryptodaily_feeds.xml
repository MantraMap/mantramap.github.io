			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Central Bank of Kazakhstan announced that it will work on deploying its in-house central bank digital currency (CBDC) available as early as 2023 and will expand on the project until the end of 2025. </p>
<p>The National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) has found it to be feasible to launch its in-house CBDC &ndash; the digital tenge. The NBK revealed its findings after it completed the second phase of testing. The results of the second round of testing of the platform and the need for a digital version of its currency have been presented in a whitepaper published by the regulator. In October, Binance CEO Changpeng &ldquo;CZ&rdquo; Zhao announced that the country&rsquo;s CBDC would be integrated with its BNB Chain &ndash; the blockchain built by Binance.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan has been primarily driven to conduct feasibility studies for a CBDC given its potential to improve financial inclusion, promote competition and innovation in the payment industry and increase the country&rsquo;s global competitiveness according to reports by Cointelegraph. A loose translation of the white paper says:</p>

<p>Taking into account the need for technological improvements, infrastructure preparation, development of an operating model and a regulatory framework, it is recommended to ensure a phased implementation over three years.</p>

<p>The third phase of implementation and testing of the CBDC will commence in January and continue through 2023. During this time, developers plan to introduce a solution for the commercial application of the CBDC. A fourth phase, scheduled to end in December 2025 will see the NBK invite more participants to the platform and will launch additional services.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Voyager Digital today announced that Binance.US won a second bidding process following FTX&rsquo;s bankruptcy filing to buy the bankrupt firm&rsquo;s assets for $1.022 billion. </p>
<p>Bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Voyager Digital today announced in a press release that Binance.US has agreed to acquire its assets for $1.022 billion. Binance&rsquo;s bid is a fair market value of Voyager&rsquo;s portfolio which at a current market value stands at around $1 billion. The newly announced deal comes only weeks after a planned FTX-Voyager acquisition fell through as a result of the implosion of FTX and the arrest of its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. Voyager said in its statement:</p>

<p>The Binance.US bid aims to return crypto to customers in kind, in accordance with court-approved disbursements and platform capabilities.</p>

<p>Voyager was one of the earlier firms to file for bankruptcy protection in July 2022 after defunct cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) defaulted on a significant loan extended to Voyager per reports by CNBC. When Voyager filed for bankruptcy protection, it had approximately $1.3 billion in assets but was owed over $650 million by 3AC. This amount is a far cry from the $5.8 billion worth of assets Voyager had at the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Voyager said in its press release that Binance.US&rsquo;s offer represented &ldquo;the highest and best bid for its assets after a review of strategic options with the core objective of maximizing the value returned to customers and other creditors on an expedited timeframe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The collapse of Voyager left more than 1.7 million users in the dark as to what would happen to their cryptocurrencies. The initial deal with FTX meant that users would receive an account credit as well as custody of certain cryptos supported by FTX. However, when the issues with FTX&rsquo;s balance sheet came to light it forced the exchange into bankruptcy have left many who had pending deals with FTX completely in the lurch.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Former FTX CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, has reportedly reconsidered his decision to contest extraction to the United States after spending just four days in Fox Hill Prison in the Bahamas. </p>
<p>According to reports by Reuters, SBF will reconsider his earlier decision to contest extradition to the U.S. and is set to appear in court in the Bahamas on Monday. By agreeing to extradition, SBF would be able to appear in a United States court to face charges that have been laid against him. Bankman-Fried faces charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud on lenders and customers, securities fraud, commodities fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. If Bankman-Fried is charged, he faces 115 years in prison. SBF was denied bail on December 13 after prosecutors argued that he is a flight risk and should remain in custody given the enormous amounts of money involved in the matter and the unclear location of many of those funds. Bankman-Fried was remanded to prison after Chief Magistrate JoyAnn Ferguson-Pratt rejected his request to be remanded to his home while awaiting the hearing on his extradition.</p>
SBF Not Receiving Any Special Treatment
<p>Bankman-Fried is known for following a strict vegan diet and outlined these requirements in his unsuccessful bail application but is unable to have vegan meals delivered to him due to COVID restrictions that still forbid visitors. According to reports by Decrypt, Bahamian officials said that SBF is not received any special treatment at the government&rsquo;s only prison, which has a designed capacity of 1,000 inmates, but which is frequently exceeded.</p>
<p>SBF is being held at Fox Hill prison which has been described as harsh due to &ldquo;overcrowding poor nutrition, inadequate sanitation, and inadequate medical care,&rdquo; according to a human-rights evaluation by the U.S. State Department in 2021. In his four-day stint at Fox Hill, Bankman-Fried has been housed in the prison sick bay for evaluation.</p>

<p>According to the mainstream media, social media, and just about any other outlet, bitcoin is dying and will probably sink to new depths and might never recover.</p>
<p>However, according to behaviour analyst platform Santiment, bitcoin is possibly reaching a bottom - perhaps not in price yet, but at least as far as accumulation by whales is concerned.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">🤯 Breaking: #Bitcoin's addresses holding between 100 to 10,000 $BTC have bought $726m in $BTC the past 9 days.

<p>There are 159 new addresses in only the last 3 weeks that hold between 100 to 10,000 BTC, and it is stated that this is the fastest growth in this particular address amount in the last 10 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Santiment also reports that stablecoins such as USDT, BUSD, and DAI are being bought up. &ldquo;Massive jumps&rdquo; in the USDT and BUSD wallets that contain from $100k to $10m have been seen.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s8">Consumer loyalty is the one thing brands fight for regardless of industry, target audience, or location &ndash; and with good&nbsp; reason. Studies show that 56% of customers are ready to pay more even when cheaper options are available, and 77% have stayed with their favorite brands for over 10 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s8">Despite a clear link between consumer loyalty and profit, the state of traditional loyalty programs is far from ideal. Centralized management, expiration dates, and inability to transfer or sell rewards to interested users are just a few of the problems experienced by loyalty holders of today. To add to that, being part of a brand's loyalty program today, requires users to track rewards via individual websites or applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s8">The idea of adding blockchain to a centralized loyalty program is not new but MetaFlyers, a rising blockchain-based loyalty ecosystem, has everything in the making to disrupt the decentralized rewards world with their one-stop platform for brands and consumers (NFT project holders).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s8">How MetaFlyers revolutionizes the idea of loyalty programs&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s8">MetaFlyers tackles the most important issue with loyalty programs of today: ownership. After earning the rewards, the users can own, gift, redeem or sell them to others with little to no limitations. To claim the rewards, members have to hold $FEWL - a utility-based token that fuels the MetaFlyers platform. The only way to get $FEWL at the moment is by minting an NFT from the MetaFlyers&rsquo; collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s8">The MetaFlyers marketplace doesn&rsquo;t only benefit the consumers. It is the first-of-its-kind loyalty infrastructure for the Metaverse that leverages NFT technology and provides value for consumer brands, NFT project founders, and retail users all at once. By allowing brands to offer consumers (NFT project holders) unique offers on the MetaFlyers platform, Web2 businesses instantly gain access to blockchain users with high purchasing power and can save costs on managing customer rewards themselves. At the same time, NFT project founders no longer have to depend on secondary drops to provide returns to investors. By leveraging the real-world value mechanics of consumer brand partnerships, they can keep community engagement at an all time high.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s8">The MetaFlyers team is most certainly something worth mentioning: the three founders bring a unique mix of experience in software &amp; product development, loyalty management, finance, design &amp; content creation, and extensive knowledge in the Web3 space.. The project has been created by Jeff Sherwoord (ex-Rakuten &amp; LuxuryCard), Sam Snyder (ex-ESPN &amp; Disney),and Doug Lorenzen (ex-partner at Moore Venture Partners).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s8">What does the future hold for MetaFlyers?</p>
<p class="s8">The MetaFlyers NFT mint will take place on December 20th, with ambitious plans ahead: a marketplace beta to go live in early Q2, will include a white-labeling solution for brands to independently provide offerings to their consumers direct.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto users who leave their Christmas shopping to the last minute might be interested to know that Fluidity&rsquo;s spend-to-earn protocol is launching on Ethereum on December 19.</p>
<p>Described as an &ldquo;avant-garde DeFi yield primitive,&rdquo; Fluidity reimagines the yield-generation model by rewarding users simply for wrapping stablecoins on the platform and subsequently using the 1:1 assets. As such, users have the prospect of receiving a windfall every time they spend Fluid Asset or conduct trading activities.</p>
<p>To date, Fluidity has been operating on the Solana devnet beta and Ethereum testnets, and 50,000 users have already explored what it has to offer. After the protocol debuts on Ethereum, it is expected to branch out to other chains including Solana, Arbitrum and Polygon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
A Risk-Free Way to Earn
<p>Although alarm bells may ring at the notion that any protocol in the entire crypto landscape is risk-free, Fluidity is quite different from the yield farms that have traditionally made such claims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The general principle is simple: users in possession of stablecoins exchange them for wrapped counterparts on Fluidity: for example, USDT would be exchanged for fUSDT. Thereafter, holders of wrapped assets earn rewards by using and utilizing them on-chain &ndash; through trading, sending, receiving, and swapping.</p>
<p>Yields are paid on a random basis, with Fluidity founder Shahmeer Chaudhry saying 50-70% of all transactions qualify for rewards that are split on an 80:20 basis between senders and receivers. What&rsquo;s more, such pay-outs can range from mere cents to millions. Consequently, participants in Fluidity&rsquo;s ecosystem have a major incentive to swap their stablecoins and interact using the wrapped version &ndash; which can be converted into the underlying asset at any time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four or five years ago, everybody said DeFi could be the use-case that brings in a billion users to crypto &ndash; but it actually turned out to be NFTs and GameFi,&rdquo; says Chaudhry, whose experience encompasses game design and blockchain acceleration. &ldquo;At Fluidity, we want to gamify how people think about spending money, and our long-term goal is to re-shape how people approach spending.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although a relatively new project, Fluidity has quite a bit of pedigree. Last year, the venture came fifth out of 6,000 participants in Solana&rsquo;s IGNITE hackathon. In a subsequent funding round it also welcomed capital from a slew of VC heavy hitters, from Multicoin Capital and Solana to Circle and Lemniscap. The protocol&rsquo;s smart contracts have also been audited by no less than three firms: Bramah Systems, Verilog Solutions and Hashlock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Challenging the Liquidity Mine Monopoly
<p>The brain trust at Fluidity believes that liquidity mining programs are inherently unsustainable, as rewards revert to mean over time, causing users to vanish in search of better interest rates. Fluidity, on the other hand, rewards users for common endeavors such as paying for goods or services or swapping one crypto-asset for another. The protocol can also be leveraged by arbitrage traders to optimize profits.</p>
<p>Genuine users &ndash; those who display certain intended behaviors &ndash; not only earn TRF (Transfer Reward Function) rewards but also governance tokens that let them have a say in how the protocol operates. Merchants, meanwhile, can earn a cut of rewards simply by accepting Fluid tokens as a medium of exchange.</p>
<p>The annual commercial blitz that is Christmas will give Fluidity an opportunity to establish itself as a viable rewards system. The big question, of course, is whether the protocol can win the hearts and minds of seasoned liquidity miners who continue to chase high APY on their staked assets.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Awaits Technical Guidance:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 20 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) awaited fresh technical guidance early in the Asian session as the pair continued to tightly orbit the 16880.44 area, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460.&nbsp;&nbsp; A brief rally to the 16875 level represented a test of the 16882 area, a downside price objective related to selling pressure that commenced around the 52100 level.&nbsp; &nbsp;Strong selling pressure around the 18385 and 17525 areas could result in tests of additional downside price objectives around the 16375, 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD is able to reclaim some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16813.93 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16728.72.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bearishly below MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>According to reports by a local Nigerian news outlet, the Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Capital Market, and Institutions of Nigeria, said the country will soon pass a law legalizing the use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>A local newspaper reported that Babangida Ibrahim, the Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Capital Markets and Institutions of Nigeria indicated that Nigeria will soon pass a law making the use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies legal. The bill, if passed, would amend the 2007 Investments and Securities Act, and would further recognize Bitcoin as legal capital for investment purposes.</p>
Nigeria Backtracks on Its Bitcoin Ban
<p>Bitcoin has had a very large presence in Nigeria even though in February 2021, the country effectively banned the use of the currency with a letter prohibiting regulated financial businesses from &ldquo;dealing&rdquo; with Bitcoin and crypto.</p>
<p>The report further describes how Ibrahim referred to the country as being behind regarding regulating the nascent industry. Ibrahim said:</p>

<p>Like I said earlier during the second reading, we need an efficient and vibrant capital market in Nigeria. For us to do that, we have to be up to date global practices.</p>

<p>Per reports by Bitcoin Magazine, should the proposed bill be passed, it would address Nigeria&rsquo;s growing Bitcoin usage and could serve as a major catalyst for the country. Despite the current ban on cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin holds a strong presence in Nigeria with the construction of a Bitcoin village, philanthropic work from Bitcoin-related companies, Nigerian Bitcoiners actively participating in a vast development in the country, as well as the fact that Bitcoin mining is very active in the country.</p>
The eNaira and Nigeria&rsquo;s Hopes for a Cashless Society
<p>Nigeria launched its own central bank digital currency (CBDC) called the eNaira in 2021. Along with the launch of its digital currency, the country also announced limits on the amount of cash citizens can withdraw in an attempt to increase the adoption of alternative payment methods according to reports by Crypto Potato. The Central Bank limited over-the-counter cash withdrawals to $225 per week for individuals and $1,123 for businesses. Nigeria&rsquo;s attempt to go cashless also meant capping ATM cashouts at $45 per day, with only $0.45 notes and smaller denominations being available for withdrawals at ATMs. Customers can however still withdraw larger sums in certain instances but will be subject to a processing fee of between 5% and 10%.</p>

<p>The report further describes how Ibrahim referred to the country as being behind regarding regulating the nascent industry. Ibrahim said:</p>

<p>Like I said earlier during the second reading, we need an efficient and vibrant capital market in Nigeria. For us to do that, we have to be up to date global practices.</p>

<p>Per reports by Bitcoin Magazine, should the proposed bill be passed, it would address Nigeria&rsquo;s growing Bitcoin usage and could serve as a major catalyst for the country. Despite the current ban on cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin holds a strong presence in Nigeria with the construction of a Bitcoin village, philanthropic work from Bitcoin-related companies, Nigerian Bitcoiners actively participating in a vast development in the country, as well as the fact that Bitcoin mining is very active in the country.</p>
The eNaira and Nigeria&rsquo;s Hopes for a Cashless Society
<p>Nigeria launched its own central bank digital currency (CBDC) called the eNaira in 2021. Along with the launch of its digital currency, the country also announced limits on the amount of cash citizens can withdraw in an attempt to increase the adoption of alternative payment methods according to reports by Crypto Potato. The Central Bank limited over-the-counter cash withdrawals to $225 per week for individuals and $1,123 for businesses. Nigeria&rsquo;s attempt to go cashless also meant capping ATM cashouts at $45 per day, with only $0.45 notes and smaller denominations being available for withdrawals at ATMs. Customers can however still withdraw larger sums in certain instances but will be subject to a processing fee of between 5% and 10%.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The crypto winter drags on and on and bitcoin is either preparing itself for a further drop, or it is building a platform from which to start climbing higher.</p>
Things to get grimmer?
<p>In what has now become the longest crypto bear market, albeit in bitcoin&rsquo;s brief 14-year history, the question is: How much longer can it last?</p>
<p>If we look at the economic environment, things look grim, and it could very likely be argued that things are going to get a huge amount grimmer, as the Federal Reserve continues on its path of rate increases, and economies around the world are beginning to scream.</p>
<p>The rate hikes are sucking liquidity out of the markets and it's becoming increasingly difficult for investors to know where they can put their wealth where it&rsquo;s not going to decrease in a dramatic fashion.</p>
Crypto is high risk
<p>Given that crypto is considered by the market a high risk asset, many investors have already been shaken out and have sold at a loss. Those thinking to buy a dip have had to think again, and again, as prices continue to remain depressed.</p>
<p>The total crypto market cap is sat on the support provided by the 2017/18 bull market top at around $760 billion. A bad drop from here could take the entire market down to nearly half this value at $400 billion.</p>
Bitcoin the relative safe harbour
<p>Bitcoin is as always the only relatively safe crypto asset in this environment. Even ethereum is breaking down against bitcoin and this is leading to bitcoin making higher highs in the dominance chart.</p>
<p>Many accusations are levelled at cryptocurrencies in general, particularly at their perceived intrinsic value, and for many cryptocurrencies, this is probably true, at least up to now.</p>
<p>However, for those looking to take their wealth out of what could become a terrifyingly unstable fiat financial system, bitcoin might not be such a bad bet.</p>
<p>Many of those wishing to sell, or having to sell, would probably have done so by now, and those investors that are left are holding on tight, waiting for that moment when it dawns on the market that a digital asset outside of the monetary system that can&rsquo;t be controlled by governments, might be a very attractive place to be.</p>
<p>The downside for bitcoin has to be reasonably limited. A price under $10,000 isn&rsquo;t out of the question, but that isn&rsquo;t such a huge drop from here. The upside though could possibly be far in excess of this, as it becomes realised that code and smart contracts are vastly superior to human economic decisions.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>US Banking Committee chairman Senator Sherrod Brown has touted the possibility of banning crypto, but believes that this could force it offshore.</p>
<p>In an interview with NBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Meet the press&rdquo;, Senator Brown commented that the SEC and the CFTC should consider banning all cryptocurrencies, but then added that he thought this would be difficult and that it would end up going offshore and out of the jurisdiction of the enforcement agencies. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want them to do what they need to do at the same time, maybe banning it, although banning it is very difficult because it would go offshore, and who knows how that would work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already gone to the Treasury and the Secretary and asked for a government-wide assessment through all the various regulatory agencies [....] The SEC has been particularly aggressive, and we need to move forward that way and legislatively if it comes to that,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Senator was scathing of cryptocurrencies, saying that they were &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo;, and &ldquo;a threat to national security&rdquo;, giving the example of how North Korea had implemented illicit cyber activity and how terrorism financing was taking place.</p>
Opinion
<p>Many in the US Senate will no doubt hold similar opinions to Senator Brown and it makes little difference if blockchain data platforms such as Chainalysis prove that illicit activity on the Bitcoin blockchain is fairly negligible.</p>
<p>Far more US dollars will be used every day by terrorists, drug traffickers, money launderers, and every type of fraudster worldwide, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that US financial enforcement agencies are going to ban its use.</p>
<p>Senator Brown is quite right when he said that cryptocurrencies would move offshore if banned in the US, but if they are so niche and make up such a miniscule fraction of wealth worldwide, what is there to worry about?</p>
<p>It may be that the Senator can guess that other countries might well make use of the innovations that cryptocurrencies bring to the table. He might also not like the fact that they can be used to bypass the dollar and can be freely exchanged between anyone without any third parties needing to touch the transaction.</p>
<p>The time is already here when the danger of holding a fiat currency in the bank means a significant yearly loss to inflation on the one hand, and the distinct possibility of losing it all, if the financial system should come crashing down.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>December has historically been a good month for crypto, but given the macroeconomic conditions and the recent collapse of FTX, the market is extremely volatile.&nbsp; Dogecoin (DOGE) and Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) are among the few coins that have shown positive price action, whilst most other cryptos are currently trading sideways or downwards. Notably, Orbeon Protocol is now in its third phase of presale, and has already seen a 655% price increase in a matter of weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Why is Dogecoin outperforming the market?</p>
<p>Like most cryptocurrencies, DOGE got hit in the summer and was trading at around $0.06 that is until the now somewhat infamous sale of Twitter to Elon Musk went through. Speculation that Musk will integrate Dogecoin with Twitter caused the price to skyrocket to $0.14 on the 2nd November. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The subsequent collapse of FTX erased some of the gains but as of writing Dogecoin is trading at $0.09, which is still a very healthy increase from its summer lows. Another factor is that whilst famous tech leaker Jane Wong tweeted that Twitter was working on a crypto wallet, just prior to Musk&rsquo;s acquisition, a few days later Casey Newton reported that plans at Twitter for a crypto wallet integration have been put on hold.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Musk has added fuel to the fire that Dogecoin may be integrated with Twitter with various leaks and tweets, and by saying &ldquo;It is kind of a no-brainer for Twitter to have payments, both fiat and crypto.&rdquo; on a recent Twitter spaces session.&nbsp; Since you can buy merch using Dogecoin from Tesla and Space,. Twitter has been alive with DOGE fans buying dog whistles for 1000 Doge, with some noting that the payment system is not as well built as it could be, but eventually it works.</p>
<p>As Dogecoin is a fork of litecoin, it does not have the capability to interact with smart contracts so it may well be that Musk creates a &lsquo;Twitter Coin&rsquo; as well, to increase functionality. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps trying to capitalise on the news, a team of developers have now created an EVM compatible blockchain for DOGE, however, due to the above technical limitations, this chain actually uses a wrapped form of DOGE and will require bridging. The team plans to airdrop wrapped Dogecoin to Dogecoin holders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Investors can&rsquo;t get enough of Orbeon Protocol</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol allows anyone to easily invest in vetted startups at their early stages. Aiming to democratize the previously exclusive VC industry, Orbeon Protocol functions as a decentralized investment platform that allows startups to raise money more efficiently and quickly, while everyday investors get the chance to support them.</p>
<p>The platform uses equity-based NFTs as a form of investment. These fractionalized NFTs are available from as low as $1, and their value changes in real time to reflect the success of the startup that issued them.</p>
<p>ORBN, the project&rsquo;s native token, has seen immense demand during presale as the transactional token of this successful project. With benefits like staking bonuses and transaction fee discounts for holders, ORBN is set to launch at the end of January and experts are predicting as high as a 6000% price increase, as the price has already risen from $0.004 to $0.030.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Musk has added fuel to the fire that Dogecoin may be integrated with Twitter with various leaks and tweets, and by saying &ldquo;It is kind of a no-brainer for Twitter to have payments, both fiat and crypto.&rdquo; on a recent Twitter spaces session.&nbsp; Since you can buy merch using Dogecoin from Tesla and Space,. Twitter has been alive with DOGE fans buying dog whistles for 1000 Doge, with some noting that the payment system is not as well built as it could be, but eventually it works.</p>
<p>As Dogecoin is a fork of litecoin, it does not have the capability to interact with smart contracts so it may well be that Musk creates a &lsquo;Twitter Coin&rsquo; as well, to increase functionality. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps trying to capitalise on the news, a team of developers have now created an EVM compatible blockchain for DOGE, however, due to the above technical limitations, this chain actually uses a wrapped form of DOGE and will require bridging. The team plans to airdrop wrapped Dogecoin to Dogecoin holders.</p>

<p>Investors can&rsquo;t get enough of Orbeon Protocol</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol allows anyone to easily invest in vetted startups at their early stages. Aiming to democratize the previously exclusive VC industry, Orbeon Protocol functions as a decentralized investment platform that allows startups to raise money more efficiently and quickly, while everyday investors get the chance to support them.</p>
<p>The platform uses equity-based NFTs as a form of investment. These fractionalized NFTs are available from as low as $1, and their value changes in real time to reflect the success of the startup that issued them.</p>
<p>ORBN, the project&rsquo;s native token, has seen immense demand during presale as the transactional token of this successful project. With benefits like staking bonuses and transaction fee discounts for holders, ORBN is set to launch at the end of January and experts are predicting as high as a 6000% price increase, as the price has already risen from $0.004 to $0.030.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The year 2022 has been a major source of stress for cryptocurrency investors, notably holders of Hex Coin (HEX) and Solana (SOL). The recent downward price movements of Hex Coin (HEX) and Solana (SOL)&nbsp; have unnerved investors who purchased these currencies. Both currencies had a good start, but things don't seem good for the future. Flasko, a new rival currency, is emerging as a cryptocurrency with great potential in the coming days.</p>
<p>Flasko (FLSK) Presale Draws Attention From Hex Coin (HEX)</p>
<p>Hex Coin (HEX) is a game-changing digital asset that promotes itself as a premier blockchain CD. Hex Coin (HEX) was first launched on the Ethereum network, and its price has climbed dramatically since its creation, with an annual percentage return of almost 40%.</p>
<p>The Hex Coin (HEX) cryptocurrency uses a hybrid consensus process based on the Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW) algorithms. Despite a market valuation of $7.56 billion, the average daily trading volume is around $5.46 million. This indicates a dramatic decline in the number of investors. Hex Coin (HEX) is trading at only $0.03, which isn't appealing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solana (SOL) Investors Are Worried</p>
<p>Solana is another cryptocurrency that is having trouble right now (SOL). Solana (SOL) intended to develop a smart contract operating at the layer one level. It was also looking forward to establishing a scalable and quicker blockchain, which might give a superior throughput compared to the present Bitcoin (BTC) network.</p>
<p>Despite the merits of the Solana (SOL) concept, it was trapped in a market downturn. As a result, the cost of one Solana (SOL) token keeps falling. At the time of writing, one Solana (SOL) token is worth $13.69. In 2021, that same token was worth about $260.</p>
<p>Flasko (FLSK) Will See Incredible Growth In 2023</p>
<p>Flasko, an upcoming NFT platform, will allow users to invest in luxury beverages, including champagne, wine, and whiskey bottles backed by fractionalized NFTs secured by the underlying physical assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flasko will not only be convenient for people who are unable to afford luxury wines and spirits but will also play a pivotal role in helping up-and-coming brands to launch their products on their platform and get exposure through the Flasko platform.</p>
<p>Regarding figures, Flasko is currently in its second stage of the presale and costs only $0.125 per presale token, with predictions of hitting $5 by February 2023 by crypto experts. Flasko is set to become the fastest-growing cryptocurrency of 2023 as whales flooded to purchase Flasko tokens as the presale began.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Many famous cryptocurrencies suffered huge declines in 2021 and 2022, making investors nervous about choosing their crypto investments. This demonstrates the need to consider a cryptocurrency's practical applications and underlying infrastructure before committing capital to it.</p>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) and Fantom (FTM) are promising cryptocurrencies with solid foundations. Analysts, however, recommend Flasko as a viable alternative investment option with skyrocketing returns.</p>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) Had A Good Run</p>
<p>The Shiba Inu is the mascot for the cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE), inspired by the viral internet joke "doge." Many other tokens have followed Dogecoin (DOGE)'s lead since its meteoric rise in value and popularity a few years ago.</p>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE)'s proof-of-work mechanism, based on Scrypt technology, is one of the numerous ways it varies from Bitcoin's. Dogecoin (DOGE) rose to fame only because famous personalities started tweeting about it, and it became a sensation on Reddit. Unfortunately for Dogecoin (DOGE) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors, that fame was short-lived when Dogecoin (DOGE) finally plummeted. It is now trading at $0.10 per coin.</p>
<p>Consistent Drop in Fantom (FTM)&nbsp;</p>
<p>After announcing many partnerships, Fantom (FTM) saw record-breaking sales and earnings last month. As time has passed, prices have dropped to the $0.2 range. There was a 14% drop in Fantom (FTM) from the previous month. The coin is presently valued at $0.24.</p>
<p>As Fantom (FTM) is consistently declining daily, there has been a significant sell-off. It might be more beneficial to shift your focus to something with more development potential. However, Fantom (FTM) investors are selling their Fantom (FTM) coins for Flasko presale coins.</p>
<p>Flasko (FLSK) Will Become The Fastest-Growing Crypto In 2023</p>
<p>NFTs backed by lucrative real-life assets are the future of the crypto trading industry, which is why Flasko has recently gained a lot of popularity. Flasko is an upcoming platform allowing investors to purchase fractionalized NFTs of wine, whiskey, and champagne bottles.</p>
<p>The Flasko team is working daily to reassure investors that their funds are safe on the NFT platform. This includes completing the audit with Solid Proof with flying colors and locking liquidity for 33 years, assuring there will be no rug pull to risk investments.</p>
<p>By January 2023, experts think Flasko will be worth $4.50 per coin. At its current price of only $0.125, it would be an opportunity missed not to purchase Flasko presale tokens right now.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With the year ending, investors are keen to boost their portfolios with cryptocurrencies that would provide immense gains. Due to the market decline, Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Elrond (EGLD) investors must look for alternatives since these tokens are currently struggling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, market analysts predict Sparklo to provide gains for investors in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bitcoin SV (BSV): Analysts Unsure Of Gains In The Long Term</p>
<p>The Bitcoin SV (BSV) token was introduced to the open market in November 2018. After it entered the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin SV (BSV) token hit an all-time high of over $200 before dropping to an all-time low of $36.87 on November 23. By 2019, the price fluctuated and traded between $20 to $80. Going further, by January 2020, the price of the Bitcoin SV (BSV) token rose to above $400 before it dipped. But it spent the rest of the year trading around $150 and $200.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2021, Bitcoin SV (BSV) token, like most cryptocurrencies, achieved a meteoric price rise. This saw the Bitcoin SV (BSV) token reach an all-time high of $489.75 on April 16, 2021. The Bitcoin SV (BSV) token declined in price after it achieved its all-time high. 2022 hasn't been all sunshine for Bitcoin SV (BSV) token, as the Bitcoin SV (BSV) token struggled to regain its former glory. Currently, this token trades at $39.94, which is a 91.8% price decrease over the past year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bitcoin SV (BSV) token currently has a total supply of 21,000,00 and a circulating supply of 19.2 million. Its market cap stands at over $768 million and ranks as the #53 cryptocurrency. Analysts aren't sure if Bitcoin SV (BSV) tokens can provide gains for investors in the short term. They suggest investors look to alternatives like Sparklo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elrond (EGLD) Might Not Provide Profits Anytime Soon</p>
<p>Elrond (EGLD) token had an all-time high of $545.64 on November 23, 2021. Like most cryptocurrencies during the period, the Elrond (EGLD) token amassed enormous gains for investors. But, this gain couldn't continue as the price dropped shortly after. CoinMarketCap data shows that Elrond (EGLD) token lost 26% of its value over the last 30 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, in the past 14 days, Elrond (EGLD) token tried to make some gains by increasing 1.5% and 0.5% over the past seven days. Elrond (EGLD) token costs $42.65 after a 3.2% price increase over the last 24 hours, but analysts don't think this growth can be sustainable in the long term.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical data shows that investors in Elrond (EGLD) tokens can only make gains in a short rally. This leads investors to look for alternative investments that can provide short-term and long-term gains, like Spaklo.</p>
<p>Sparklo (SPRK): Top Alternative Investment Choice For 2023</p>
<p>Sparklo creates a unique proposition for the alternative industry. Sparklo aims to be the first alternative investment platform that allows users and investors to invest in NFTs pegged to real-world assets in gold, silver, and platinum. Sparklo is well on its way to becoming a top investment choice for the coming year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sparklo will partner with jewelry stores to bring the products to the market while letting investors get first access and discount. Sparklo is priced at only $0.013 and is still in its first presale stage will allow investors to invest early in a project with high growth potential and can be a future blue-chip cryptocurrency. It also passed its audit from Interfi Network, and its liquidity will be locked for 100 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained on the defensive early in the Asian session as the pair remained vulnerable around the 17000 figure after trading as low as the 16529.53 level, an area that represented a test of the 61.8% retracement of the appreciating range from 15460 to 18385.36. &nbsp;Technical demand emerged around the 16650.14 level during the pullback, a test of the 50% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 16529.53 to 16775.52.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stops were recently elected below the 16849.58 area during the ongoing depreciation, a downside price objective related to selling pressure that intensified below the 17525 area.&nbsp; Strong selling pressure around the 18385 and 17525 areas could result in tests of additional downside price objectives around the 16375, 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD is able to reclaim some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 17260.77 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 17009.83.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bearishly below MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Even amidst the current chaos and collapses that are permeating the cryptocurrency industry, Jay Clayton, former chair of the SEC, says that crypto can still contribute to improvements in traditional finance.</p>
Negative press
<p>Crypto has found an unlikely ally in the former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Jay Clayton. While crypto is being scorned and maligned to the heavens over the sequence of large exchange collapses, Clayton recently remarked in an interview that &ldquo;the promise of distributed ledger technology is remarkable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clayton is receiving some quite negative press over his remarks, and a pro-blockchain op-ed of his that was published in the Wall Street Journal was also deplored by several commentators.</p>
Clayton tenure not kind to crypto
<p>However, despite this, history tells us that the ex SEC chair has not been kind to crypto in the past. Just like the current SEC chair Gary Gensler, Clayton refused to approve any exchange traded funds (ETFs), and it was during his tenure that the SEC originally took Ripple Labs to court over violation of securities laws.</p>
Supportive of SEC Gensler
<p>According to an article in Business Insider, Jay Clayton is also on the record as being supportive of Gensler in that he believes that all crypto intermediaries can be regulated, drawn from rules that are already in place.</p>
<p>In addition, he is of the opinion that the SEC should &ldquo;vigorously crack down&rdquo; on crypto platforms that are seen as trading securities, and should continue to do so.</p>
<p>Stablecoin compliance is one other area where Clayton is of the view that there is much risk of counterparty and credit risk. He feels that bank regulators could lead in this area.</p>
Clayton now a crypto insider?
<p>So why is Jay Clayton talking up crypto right now?</p>
<p>Since leaving office in 2020, Clayton has held a number of roles in the crypto industry. Therefore he could now be seen as having quite a lot more knowledge on the industry.</p>
<p>He is currently a senior policy advisor for Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, a law firm that has a lot of business with crypto firms. He is on the board of crypto infrastructure provider Fireblocks, and he has advisory roles at One River Digital Asset Management, and also Apollo Global Management, which is an investor in blockchain.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com has received a Payment Institution License (EMI) from the Brazilian central bank. </p>
<p>Crypto exchange Crypto.com (CRO) has obtained an EMI license from the Central Bank of Brazil according to an announcement made by the company. The license will allow the exchange to continue offering regulated fiat wallet services to users in Brazil &ndash; one of the most active Latin American countries in the crypto space. The license also makes Crypto.com the first licensed cryptocurrency exchange in Brazil. Crypto.com has been present and active in the country since November 2021 when it first introduced its Visa card to customers to make purchases with local fiat and their digital assets.</p>
<p>Crypto.com CEO, Kris Marszalek, commented on obtaining the EMI license, saying:</p>

<p>Brazil and the entire LATAM market is a significant region in the pursuit of our vision of cryptocurrency in every wallet. We are incredibly proud to secure the license in Brazil, allowing us to lead as a safe, secure and compliant platform. We look forward to continuing working with regulators and authorities throughout the region in advancing cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.</p>

<p>Marcos Jarne, General Manager and Head of Legal, LATAM of Crypto.com added:</p>

<p>Latin America is a major driver in crypto adoption and regulators have also been playing a key role to foster this. This is an exciting step in our journey in Brazil and LATAM, with much more to come.</p>

<p>Crypto.com&rsquo;s announcement also details how far the exchange has come in terms of global regulatory approval recently:</p>

<p>In recent months, Crypto.com has received in-principle approval of its Major Payment Institution (MPI) license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), regulatory approval as a Digital Asset Service Provider by the Autorit&eacute; des march&eacute;s financiers (AMF) in France, registration approval as a cryptoasset business from the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), provisional approval of its Virtual Asset License from the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), Electronic Financial Transaction Act and Virtual Asset Service Provider registration in South Korea, a pre-registration undertaking with the Ontario Securities Administration in Canada, among others.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>United States Senator Pat Toomey this week spoke at the Senate Banking Committee hearing on the collapse of FTX in which he explained that the illegal actions by FTX must be separated &ldquo;from perfectly lawful and innovative cryptocurrencies.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) emphasized that &ldquo;The collapse of FTX is not an indictment of crypto,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;cryptocurrency cannot be stopped&rdquo; and &ldquo;the technology would simply migrate offshore&rdquo; if Congress tried to do something untoward against the industry. Toomey described the events:</p>

<p>There was unauthorized lending of customer assets to an affiliated entity, and there were fraudulent promises to investors and customers about FTX&rsquo;s operations. These are outrageous and completely unacceptable.</p>

<p>He further emphasized:</p>

<p>I want to underscore a bigger issue here: The wrongful behaviour that occurred here is not specific to the underlying asset. What appears to have happened here is a complete breakdown in the handling of those assets.</p>

<p>Senator Toomey made a crucial statement that Congress and regulators need to keep in mind:</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are actually software. What we should all understand here is one simple thing: The code committed no crime. FTX and cryptocurrencies are not the same thing. FTX was opaque, centralized, and dishonest. Cryptocurrencies are open-source, decentralized, and transparent.</p>

The fallout from FTX Does Not Justify and Ban on Crypto
<p>Toomey also addressed suggestions that have been put forward which sat crypto should be banned:</p>

<p>To those who think that this episode justifies banning crypto, I&rsquo;d ask you to think about several examples. The 2008 financial crisis involved the misuse of products related to mortgages. Did we decide to ban mortgages? Of course not. A commodity brokerage firm run by former New Jersey Senator John Corzine collapsed after customer funds &mdash; including U.S. dollars &mdash; were misappropriated to fill a shortfall from the firm&rsquo;s trading losses. Nobody suggested that the problem was the U.S. dollar and that we should ban it. With FTX, the problem is not the instruments that were used. The problem was the misuse of customer funds, gross mismanagement, and likely illegal behaviour.</p>

<p>To his colleagues who have suggested that crypto should be paused before addressing it, he had the following to say:</p>

<p>Some of my colleagues have suggested pausing cryptocurrencies before we can address it. This is profoundly misguided, not to mention impossible. Short of enacting draconian, authoritarian policies, cryptocurrency cannot be stopped. If we tried, the technology would simply migrate offshore.</p>

<p>He further opined:</p>

<p>Are we going to decide to pause our Constitution to stop crypto? This is exactly the kind of mindset that has driven this activity to the dark and less regulated parts of the world.</p>

Would it Be Wise for Congress Not to Regulate the industry?
<p>Toomey further said in his statements:</p>

<p>Others have suggested we refrain from addressing cryptocurrency at all, so as to not legitimize its use. This is not only misguided, it&rsquo;s irresponsible.</p>

<p>He stressed:</p>

<p>Individuals can also be tremendously empowered when they use cryptocurrencies. They can protect against inflation when governments irresponsibly manage their own currencies. They can provide useful services without the need for a company or middleman. And they can let individuals preserve the freedom to transact privately.</p>
