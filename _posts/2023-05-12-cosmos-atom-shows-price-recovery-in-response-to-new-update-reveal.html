Over the past few days, Cosmos Hub (ATOM) has demonstrated remarkable strength and resilience in its price fluctuations, despite significant downturns across the broader cryptocurrency markets due to shifts in trader sentiment. For three consecutive days, ATOM bulls have managed to bounce back and maintain the native token&#8217;s price, despite Bitcoin&#8217;s bearish momentum that has caused most altcoins to plummet. Cosmos&#8217; (ATOM) renewed strength and price stamina in the crypto markets may be linked to the fresh updates announced by the team behind the project.

On the daily timeframe, bulls pushed ATOM&#8217;s price above the key resistance at $10.90 and moved further to an $11.27 high before retracing. The previous resistance turned support level on the daily price chart is a good area for bulls to build momentum and push ATOM&#8217;s price to the upside. Although the 50 and 200 Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) are an immediate resistance level, bulls must contend with them to confirm further upside movements. To the downside, a break above the newfound support at $10.90 will signal further bearish movements for the asset.
