<p class="s7">Mimo Exchange, one of Web3&rsquo;s fastest, cheapest and most secure decentralized crypto exchanges, is excited to announce the launch of its transformative NFT trading platform enabling more accessible, faster, cheaper transactions and a more user-friendly interface than any other similar marketplace.</p>
<p class="s7">Mimo's NFT marketplace will provide a seamless and secure platform for buying and selling NFTs. But better yet, thanks to IoTeX's high-performing blockchain, the Mimo NFT trading platform solves the current challenges in the sector, enabling lower transaction fees, faster transaction times, and an enhanced user-friendly interface.</p>
<p class="s7">The Mimo NFT marketplace will revolutionize the NFT industry by offering more efficient NFT trading, its low handling fee of only 1.5% of the transaction price, as well as with its exciting launch activities. Mimo is the ideal platform for NFT enthusiasts to buy, sell, and trade digital assets.</p>
<p class="s7">The Mimo NFT marketplace also addresses the non-fungible token industry's current issues, such as high transaction fees, slow transaction times, and security.</p>
<p class="s7">One of the critical barriers to mainstream adoption is the user interface. To this point, Mimo provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for experienced and novice users to discover and collect NFTs. We've designed our intuitive interface to provide a seamless user </p>
<p class="s7">The Mimo NFT Marketplace has integrated ioPay, IoTeX's official multi-chain and cross-chain crypto wallet, and all other Web3 wallets, including Metamask.</p>
<p class="s7">People who use IoPay, one of Web3&rsquo;s most unique, secure, and versatile crypto wallets that also has multichain support, for example, can directly buy and sell their NFTs on the Mimo NFT marketplace from within this crypto wallet without additional wallets or exchanges. </p>
<p class="s7">Mimo now supports purchasing cryptocurrencies with a credit card, providing even more convenience for using the Mimo NFT marketplace.</p>
<p class="s7"></p>
<p class="s7">An exciting aspect of the Mimo NFT marketplace is that it supports projects leveraging W3bstream, which means Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) startups or projects can issue their NFTs and list them directly on the Mimo NFT marketplace. It provides a new and unique way to interact and expand audiences.</p>
<p class="s7">Mimo has partnered with well-known NFT and blockchain projects to create a joint marketing campaign. This joint marketing campaign will offer users exciting opportunities and rewards for participating in Mimo's NFT marketplace.</p>
<p class="s7">To celebrate the launch, Mimo is offering 90% off on the entire transaction fee throughout July, encouraging affordable transactions for all. This limited-time offer enables users to join the Mimo community and experience the benefits of faster, cheaper, and more user-friendly NFT trading.</p>
<p class="s7"></p>
<p class="s7">Users can also look forward to several activities and giveaways during the launch event, including limited edition NFTs, exclusive access to pre-released NFTs, and competitions. The Mimo community will also have the chance to engage with our team through live AMAs, Q&amp;A sessions, and beta testing opportunities.</p>
<p class="s7">With the rise of NFTs as a new asset class, there is a need for a dedicated NFT marketplace on IoTeX to support the growing demand for NFTs in several Web3 sectors, such as art, gaming, music and for the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) sector, which is today the most promising crypto category in the entire blockchain space. </p>
