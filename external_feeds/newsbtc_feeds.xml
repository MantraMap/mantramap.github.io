					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin market is experiencing a seismic shift, with recent data revealing fascinating trends that shed light on the evolving dynamics. From a significant decline in Bitcoin inflows to a historic drop in supply on exchanges, coupled with a surge in institutional fund accumulation, these developments highlight a maturing market and changing investor sentiment. Unprecedented Decline In Bitcoin Inflows and Supply The on-chain analytics service CryptoQuant has today published extremely interesting data on the behavior and cohorts of Bitcoin hodlers via Twitter. Over the past 612 days, Bitcoin has witnessed an 80% decline in the number of addresses recording inflows, which can be interpreted as selling activity. This decline reaches an even higher figure of 84% when measured from the peak in May 2021. These numbers even surpass the previous record set during the 2017 parabolic top, demonstrating the magnitude of the current trend. Both narrowly beat the second highest decline in addresses associated with inflows between the 2017 parabolic top into 2018 bear, at 78.5%. It is important to note that these figures do not account for addresses that have moved to self-custody or differentiate between miner activity and retail investors. This suggests that the decline in addresses associated with inflows may be even more significant than the data implies, potentially indicating a shift towards long-term holding strategies or alternative custodial methods. Related Reading: Binance CEO Goes Bullish On Bitcoin – What’s The Inside Scoop? In a parallel trend, the overall supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has been steadily shrinking since March 2020, marking a period of consistent decline that had not been witnessed before in Bitcoin&#8217;s history. This decline is not only significant in its duration but also in its depth, as Bitcoin reserves on exchanges have dropped by over 30%. CryptoQuant’s experts further note: March 2020 was the highest ever supply recorded on exchanges, and preceded by consistent ten years of supply growth. The 1200 days since, are the first period of consistent decline in Bitcoin&#8217;s history. [&#8230;] Retail traders and institutions are holding more Bitcoin than ever. This also indicates a major potential shift from active trading and speculative behavior towards long-term holding strategies. Institutional Fund Accumulation Signals Confidence As the decline in inflows and supply unfolds, another intriguing trend emerges: institutional fund accumulation, as observed by CryptoQuant. Institutional investors, including hedge funds, investment firms, and cryptocurrency private funds, are currently actively increasing their holdings of Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Takes A Hit As SEC Deems Spot ETF Filings ‘Inadequate’ This exponential increase in fund holdings demonstrates a strong interest in acquiring Bitcoin, even at its current price level. Institutional investors often take a more patient and long-term approach compared to short-term traders who closely monitor price fluctuations. By closely monitoring fund holdings, investors can gain valuable insights into market sentiment and the confidence that institutional investors have in Bitcoin as a long-term asset. And the following chart by CryptoQuant is showing just that, an ultra bullish stance by institutions. The positive evolution of Bitcoin&#8217;s perception is probably further reinforced by recent developments in the regulatory landscape and the introduction of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Regulatory frameworks, especially those being implemented by countries in the European Union with MiCA, are beneficial for the institutional Bitcoin adoption. Moreover, the filings and re-filings of Bitcoin spot ETFs by major financial institutions, including BlackRock and Fidelity, indicate a growing recognition of Bitcoin&#8217;s potential as a legitimate investment. These ETFs provide a more accessible and regulated way for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, potentially driving further institutional adoption and market growth. At press time, the BTC price stood at $30,716, remaining in its range between $29,800 and $31,000. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Conflux (CFX) has had a positive run so far in 2023, placing itself amongst the best-performing altcoins in the first half of the year. However, the “Chinese Ethereum” has been trading in the red in the past few days. According to data from CoinGecko, CFX lost nearly 16% of its value in the past week.  Related Reading: Compound (COMP) Grows 33% In 7 Days As Whale Activities Soar DWF Labs Acquires $18 Million Worth Of CFX Tokens This CFX price fall comes despite the acquisition made by DWF Labs in the past week.

In a tweet, the head of DWF labs, Andrei Grachev, emphasized how the network is an excellent technology and his firm’s willingness to increase its CFX holdings.  @Conflux_Network is a bright example how a great team, technology, BD, GR and PR should perform.

Long East, Long HK, Long Web3 LFG! pic.twitter.com/hSzb3VYjfP — Andrei Grachev (@ag_dwf) June 28, 2023 Conflux has built a reputation as a cutting-edge technology thanks to its “Tree-Graph” consensus algorithm, which enables the blockchain to achieve a high transaction throughput (tps) of up to 6,000 transactions. As inferred earlier, the Conflux ecosystem has been experiencing steady growth since the turn of the year. Recently, the blockchain disclosed a partnership with dappOS, which promises mutual benefits for both entities. Conflux So Far In 2023 &#8211; Price Overview The price of CFX has been on an upward trajectory for most of the year, recording an 825% increase in the past six months. This price rally is consistent with the expansion and increased adoption of the Conflux ecosystem. During the peak of this rally, Conflux announced several strategic partnerships with some of China’s biggest companies. Notably, the tree-graph consensus algorithm Layer-1 network announced a partnership with China Telecom to develop a blockchain SIM (BSIM) card in February. However, we’ve watched the token’s price trend downward from its height earlier in the year. Since reaching its yearly peak of $0.4613 on March 20, the CFX token has lost more than 55% of its value, trading as low as $0.176 in mid-June. As of this writing, CFX changes hands at $0.204467, according to CoinGecko data. This represents a 1% increase in the last 24 hours. That said, the token&#8217;s price has declined in recent weeks, shedding more than 28% in the past month. CFXUSD trading at $0.205142 &#124; Source: CFXUSD chart from TradingView The Conflux token has a daily trading volume of $44.4 million, representing a 62.6% decline from the past day. A decrease in 24-hour trading volume signals a recent fall in market activity.

<p>Conflux has built a reputation as a cutting-edge technology thanks to its “Tree-Graph” consensus algorithm, which enables the blockchain to achieve a high transaction throughput (tps) of up to 6,000 transactions.</p>
<p>As inferred earlier, the Conflux ecosystem has been experiencing steady growth since the turn of the year. Recently, the blockchain disclosed <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/conflux-price-climbs-46/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">a partnership with dappOS</a>, which promises mutual benefits for both entities.</p>
<h2><strong>Conflux So Far In 2023 &#8211; Price Overview</strong></h2>
<p>The price of CFX has been on an upward trajectory for most of the year, recording an 825% increase in the past six months. This price rally is consistent with the expansion and increased adoption of the Conflux ecosystem.</p>
<p>During the peak of this rally, Conflux announced several strategic partnerships with some of China’s biggest companies. Notably, the tree-graph consensus algorithm Layer-1 network announced a partnership with China Telecom to develop a blockchain SIM (BSIM) card in February.</p>
<p>However, we’ve watched the token’s price trend downward from its height earlier in the year. Since reaching its yearly peak of $0.4613 on March 20, the CFX token has lost more than 55% of its value, trading as low as $0.176 in mid-June.</p>
<p>As of this writing, CFX changes hands at $0.204467, according to<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/conflux" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> CoinGecko data</a>. This represents a 1% increase in the last 24 hours. That said, the token&#8217;s price has declined in recent weeks, shedding more than 28% in the past month.</p>

<p>The Conflux token has a daily trading volume of $44.4 million, representing a 62.6% decline from the past day. A decrease in 24-hour trading volume signals a recent fall in market activity.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Compound (COMP), the governance token of the Compound protocol, has experienced a remarkable surge in value over the past week, positioning itself as one of the top gainers in the cryptocurrency market. The token&#8217;s price has risen by an impressive 33% within a span of just seven days.  Whale Activity Behind Price Increase The recent surge in COMP&#8217;s price can be attributed to several factors. One significant catalyst is the presence of whale activity and potential institutional investors. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain shed some light on this phenomenon, revealing that a notable wallet identified as &#8216;0x0D5&#8217; has been involved in substantial transactions involving COMP.  Related reading: ENS Rises 10% As Ethereum Name Service Considers Expanding To Layer-2 The wallet transferred 3 million USDT to Binance and extracted 50,000 COMP, equivalent to around $2.26 million, just two days ago. Shortly after, the same entity withdrew an additional 120,000 COMP, valued at approximately $5.53 million, from Binance. This also followed the activities of other whales who moved significant volumes of COMP during this period. These significant transfers often indicate bullish behavior and can have an impact on the token&#8217;s supply and demand dynamics, thus influencing its price. COMP Current Price And Future Prospects The recent price surge and increased trading activity indicate growing investor interest in COMP. The token has surpassed multiple resistance levels and is currently trading above $54.68, boasting a market capitalization of $424 million.  Moreover, COMP has added over $200 million to its market cap in recent weeks, surging from less than $200 million to its current valuation. The token&#8217;s daily trading volume has also witnessed a significant surge, indicating heightened market participation. Over the past two weeks, COMP has exhibited a substantial growth pattern, recording a 70% gain. Starting last month at a low of $25 per token, COMP now commands a price of $55.01.

					<description><![CDATA[In a recent community call, the team behind the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) revealed plans to adopt a Layer-2 platform in light of increasing gas fees on the mainnet. In response to this planned move, ENS prices climbed roughly 10%, floating higher with increasing trading volumes, evident in the daily chart. The Ethereum Name Service ENS is a decentralized naming system on Ethereum. It provides an easy-to-use and human-readable naming system that allows users to rename mainnet addresses, smart contracts, and other resources. This system permits users to create and employ memorable domain names instead of complicated addresses. Related Reading: Stellar (XLM) Takes Investors By Surprise With 23% Rally The team behind the ENS believes their solution makes it easier for everyone to interact with the pioneer smart contracting platform, and is handy, especially in sending and receiving transactions. In this arrangement, the platform maps a user’s domain, the human-readable address, with their original address or deployed smart contract on the Ethereum mainnet.  However, since ENS maps all addresses on the Ethereum mainnet, transaction fees apply, a concern considering the fluctuating gas fees on Ethereum. In Ethereum, all transactions, including transfers or smart contract deployment, must be paid for. The amount paid depends on the level of demand in the network, and the value tends to be volatile. Over the past few weeks, Ethereum gas fees have been rising.  Fluctuating Gas Fees  According to YCharts data on June 30, the average gas fee for sending a transaction stood at $34.62, down from $42.77 recorded on June 5. As of May 12, it stood at $77.88. The only time gas fees on Ethereum fell was on June 25, when it was at $16.58. At this level, the gas fee is relatively high compared to other networks. For example, the average transaction fee in Bitcoin was $2.383 on June 30, down from $9.018 on May 12. Meanwhile, in layer-2 platforms, transaction fees and smart contract deployment costs are relatively lower, according to trackers. As an illustration, gas fees on Optimism, a popular Ethereum layer-2, is $0.03 as of July 2. Related Reading: Polygon 2.0 Upgrade – Potential Bullish Implications For MATIC Price? Considering the high gas fees on Ethereum, ENS, via two improvement proposals, ENSIP-10 and EIP-3668, will further expand to a Layer-2 platform as a relief for users sensitive to high gas fees on Ethereum as part enhancing interoperability. During the call, the team said this would scale the platform and open the service to more people. In response, ENS prices are up 10% on the last trading day, changing hands at $9.42 at the back of increasing trading volumes. Still, it remains to be seen whether prices will continue edging higher once the platform migrates to a Layer-2 platform. For now, ENS has registered over 2.73 million names owned by more than 697,000 entities. Featured image from Canva, chart from TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It appears that the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, doesn’t trust the security of infrastructure allowing ETH staking. Consequently, in a recent interview, Buterin stated that he would only stake a limited amount of coins to ensure the network is distributed and remain robust against malicious agents who might try to take over the platform, reversing transactions. Vitalik Buterin Has Doubts On Ethereum Staking Buterin has raised concerns about the potential risks of ETH staking through third-party infrastructure, specifically regarding the exposure of private keys and the danger it poses to his entire stake. He believes that implementing a multi-signature system could provide better protection. However, the current process is more difficult to set up, leading to his increased caution. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Up 55% Following BlackRock’s ETF Application, EDX Markets Launch In a multi-sig system, users have their private key to sign transactions. A specific number of signatures must be provided to approve a transaction, which varies based on the Ethereum wallet&#8217;s configuration. This setup boosts security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access to funds. During the Bankless Podcast, the co-founder explains: Probably the biggest reason why I personally am not just staking all of my ETH, that I’m instead staking a fairly small portion, is because if you stake your ETH, it has to be all out, like the keys that access it have to be public on some system that’s online, and for safety, it has to be a multi-sig, and multi-sigs for staking are still fairly difficult to set up, and it gets complicated in a bunch of ways. ETH Prices Stable Below $2,000 His remarks have generated a lot of discussion. Most critics are concerned about the entire security framework of Ethereum. After shifting from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake system, Ethereum relies on a network of validators who have to stake at least 32 ETH for a chance to approve a block of transactions and earn block rewards and transaction fees. These validators are also needed to secure the network; without them, the blockchain will be susceptible to attacks. Related Reading: Binance CEO Goes Bullish On Bitcoin – What’s The Inside Scoop? According to on-chain data, there are over 643,000 validators spread across the globe who have staked over 20.5 million ETH. On average, each validator has staked 32.17 ETH. Notably, the validator count has steadily risen over the years, and the number of ETH staked has sharply increased despite the recent upgrade permitting stakers to unlock their coins. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano and one of the original co-founders of Ethereum, said he was “lost for words,” clarifying that all their ADA is staked as expected in a “properly designed proof-of-stake system.” At the time of writing, ETH prices remain firm and weren’t affected by Buterin’s comments. However, the coin is yet to breach $2,000 and trends below April 2023 highs in early July 2023. Featured image from Canva, chart from TradingView]]></description>
