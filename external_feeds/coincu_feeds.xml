<p>Previously, the SEC said on December 22, 2020, that it had filed a lawsuit against <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156951-new-ripple-scam-was-warns-by-xrp/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/156951-new-ripple-scam-was-warns-by-xrp/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple </a>Labs Inc. and two of its executives, both of whom are also substantial security holders, <strong>charging that they raised over $1.3 billion through an unregistered, continuing digital asset securities offering.</strong></p>



<p>Despite the aforementioned fact, on December 30, Jeremy Hogan, a partner at the American legal firm Hogan &amp; Hogan said <strong>he owns XRP because Ripple can&#8217;t be sued again.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I own XRP because I know Ripple can&#39;t be sued again.<br><br>I own ALGORAND because the Algorand Foundation won&#39;t be sued at all: <a href="https://t.co/b3x7ENCU9t" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/b3x7ENCU9t</a></p>&mdash; Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) <a href="https://twitter.com/attorneyjeremy1/status/1608695337325330433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 30, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Hogan said that <strong>the CFTC would essentially have to allege some kind of fraud and, even the SEC couldn’t come up with fraud allegations</strong> when asked what keeps the CFTC from prosecuting Ripple next.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The CFTC would essentially have to allege some kind of fraud and, even the SEC couldn&#39;t come up with fraud allegations.</p>&mdash; Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) <a href="https://twitter.com/attorneyjeremy1/status/1608886986483564544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 30, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Hogan continued by saying that, among the top 20 crypto assets, only <strong>Bitcoin, in his opinion, is safe from the SEC</strong> (perhaps as a result of prior remarks made by Gary Gensler, the current chair of the SEC, and Jay Clayton before him).</p>



<p>A few days ago, Entrepreneur David Gokhshtein, who founded and now serves as chairman of the crypto-focused media company Gokhshtein Media, discussed his intentions to increase his holdings of $XRP, the native coin of the XRP Ledger, on December 27, 2022. (XRPL).</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Alright — first thing I’m going to make sure to do in the next few days is to have my #crypto assets in order. Going back to focusing on $BTC and $ETH as my top dawgs. Then, adding more bags of $LTC and $XRP. I’ll still go into meme tokens — risk play but it’s money I can afford to lose.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At the time of writing, XRP is trading at<strong> $0.3283</strong>, seeing a decrease of 3.52% in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>CryptoPunk NFTs, like Bored Apes, are quite valuable. Since its inception in 2017, the project has evolved into one of the most sought-after Ethereum NFT projects on the globe. <strong>There are already over 10,000 CryptoPunks, each with distinct qualities that range in rarity.</strong></p>



<p>The project&#8217;s worth has risen rapidly over the years, with one <strong>CryptoPunk fetching an eye-watering $532 million.</strong></p>



<p>Similarly, during the previous several months, the project has been dethroned as the most valuable NFT collection by Bored Ape Yacht Club, with the Apes turning Cryptopunk.</p>



<p>It will be fascinating to see if CrytoPunks can outperform Bored Ape in 2023. As a result, you should keep a watch on CryptoPunks this year.</p>

<p>Ethermore is a blockchain role-playing game and &#8220;developing fantasy realm built on the Ethereum network,&#8221; as described earlier on HackerNoon. <strong>Ethermore is a text adventure game where character NFTs are employed as player characters</strong>, however additional game development is in the pipeline.</p>



<p>Users may access a quest library by connecting their Metamask wallet, which stores their Ethermore character tokens, and choosing which character to use as their &#8220;primary.&#8221;</p>



<p>Every quest option is irreversible, and every significant choice a player makes in-game affects the metadata of their NFT character.</p>

<p>The Sandbox is arguably the most well-known virtual reality experience and online game created on the Blockchain. It is a virtual Metaverse that is supported by a community and that enables Blockchain gaming and asset monetization for producers.</p>



<p><strong>The Sandbox lets you buy virtual properties known as LAND through LAND sales and has its own coinage called SAND</strong>. Similar to that, The Sandbox features its own NFT market where you can purchase NFTs and utilize them in-game.</p>



<p>Owners of the highly sought-after virtual asset LAND can utilize it as they choose. They can utilize it for a variety of purposes, including hosting games and product advertising. <strong>Even businesses are on the LAND buying bandwagon</strong>. With more players adopting The Sandbox, its NFTs, and its LAND owners, 2023, therefore, seems to be a significant year for the Metaverse game.</p>

<p>*<em>(Continued in the section characteristics and advantages of DeFi)</em></p>



<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Modern infrastructure, improved market efficiency, and robustness</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Ideally, capital should flow as seamlessly as information in the internet age. In particular, the settlement should be instant, transaction costs should be minimal, and service should be available <strong>24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year</strong>. And our global financial system only operates <strong>from 9 to 5</strong> (except weekends and holidays), which is not efficient.</p>



<p>There is a clear underlying demand for modern settlement infrastructure, as <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157148-ethereum-gets-negative-figures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a> settled<strong> $1.5 trillion</strong> last quarter, up from <strong>$31 billion</strong> in Q1 2019. We&#8217;ve also recently seen potential market dislocation due to lack of instant settlement: online brokerage <strong>Robinhood</strong> was at one point forced to suspend <strong>GameStop (GME)</strong> buy orders due to difficulty meeting capital needs, which itself was <strong>T+2 settlement</strong> (T+2 settlement is an industry-standard, and transactions typically take two days to clear).</p>



<p>Efficient markets also require robust infrastructure. The distributed nature of blockchains makes them incredibly resilient: in the 6 years since Ethereum launched, the network (and the applications built on it) have had <strong>100% uptime</strong>. But that’s not the case with centralized analogs. Even when centralized, established, and/or regulated, these centralized entities (whether exchanges or payment networks) can exhibit unreliability, especially during times of high volatility.</p>



<p>The impact on users is very real. Take Robinhood&#8217;s sudden suspension of GME stock trading in March 2020 as an example, which caused some users to suffer losses and sue Robinhood for this.</p>



<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Global access, unified market</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>In essence, the international market has a larger liquidity pool, which can greatly reduce the transaction costs of all market participants.</p>



<p>Today, <strong>decentralized exchanges (DEXs)</strong> can offer better exchange rates for certain assets than siled centralized exchanges or service providers. In the stock market, financial instruments like <strong>American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)</strong> provide a bridge into the foreign exchange market but often suffer from large premiums and thin liquidity.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-96-1024x619.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="619" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-96-1024x619.png" alt="DeFi - A Promising Piece Of The Crypto Market (Part 2)" class="wp-image-157336" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-96-1024x619.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-96-300x181.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-96-768x465.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-96-1536x929.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-96-2048x1239.png 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-96-750x454.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-96-1140x690.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="DeFi - A Promising Piece Of The Crypto Market (Part 2) 23"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">   </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>It can also lead to greater financial equity when the market is accessible globally. Currently, some developing countries are often excluded from financial services due to the high cost of establishing a local business relative to demand, lack of infrastructure, etc. But decentralized financial services can serve marginalized populations, offering insurance, international payments, and dollar-denominated savings accounts and credit.</p>



<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Real-time data</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>One of the benefits of building financial services on a transparent shared database, the distributed ledger of the blockchain, is that all relevant transaction data is publicly available in real-time. </p>



<p>For example, in the Uniswap protocol, yields generated by<strong> Liquidity Providers (LPs)</strong> can be tracked at a per-second granularity. Investors can use this data to decide how to allocate funds, providing more efficient price discovery and resource allocation, while regulators can monitor real-time transaction data to identify rogue user activity.</p>



<p>This is very different from traditional capital markets. Traditional capital markets keep investors in the dark until companies release quarterly earnings reports. The situation is even worse in the private market, where companies routinely falsify their accounting metrics (if they decide to publish them). </p>



<p>It&#8217;s hard to imagine investors making rational decisions when faced with out-of-date data! Regulators are also struggling with the current system and can wait years to discover wrongdoing, often too late, as the bankruptcy of Greensill Capital and the fake accounts at Wirecard are just two recent examples. Research.</p>



<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Eliminate counterparty/credit risk and reduce compliance fees</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>By definition,<strong> DeFi platforms are</strong> <strong>&#8220;self-custodial&#8221;</strong>: users never trust their assets to a centralized operator. While DeFi may seem daunting to some at first, the self-custodial nature of DeFi helps eliminate counterparty and credit risk, which in traditional finance is associated with a party in a financial transaction defaulting or failing to meet its transaction or loan obligations. </p>



<p>Analysts estimate that since 2011, more than <strong>$7 billion</strong> in total cryptocurrency value has been lost through centralized exchanges (CEXs), from hacks to operators deliberately absconding with user funds. <strong>DeFi is a paradigm shift from &#8220;don&#8217;t be evil&#8221; to &#8220;can&#8217;t be evil.&#8221;</strong></p>



<p>Self-custody is also beneficial to DeFi application operators, who can avoid unnecessary liabilities and compliance management fees: for example, the cryptocurrency guidelines issued by the <strong>US FinCen (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network)</strong> require companies that host user funds to obtain a currency transfer license, This is often a difficult process, and those DeFi applications that interact with self-custodial wallets can operate without a license.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Centralized Finance vs. Decentralized Finance</h2>



<p><strong>DeFi</strong> is distinct from typical centralized banking and financial organizations.</p>



<h3><strong>Centralized Finance</strong></h3>



<p>In centralized finance, banks and other third parties hold the funds and enable the transfer of funds between parties; each party charges a fee for its use. An acquiring bank receives the card information from the merchant and passes it on to the credit card network to complete the credit card transaction.</p>



<p>The network authorizes the charge and asks the bank for payment. Because retailers typically have to pay for the usage of credit and debit cards, each link in the chain is paid for the services it provides.</p>



<p>Centralized finance oversees all financial activities, including loan applications and local bank services.</p>

<h3><strong>Decentralized Finance</strong></h3>



<p>By enabling individuals, businesses, and merchants to perform financial transactions through new technologies, decentralized finance eliminates middlemen. DeFi makes use of the connection, software, hardware, security protocols, and peer-to-peer financial networks.</p>



<p>People can lend, trade, and borrow using software that logs and validates financial transactions in distributed financial databases from anywhere there is an internet connection. A distributed database collects and aggregates data from all users and utilizes a consensus process to verify it, making it available from different locations.</p>



<p>By enabling anyone to utilize financial services wherever they are, regardless of who they are or where they are located, decentralized finance eliminates the necessity for a centralized finance model. Through individual-focused trade services and personal wallets, DeFi applications provide consumers with more control over their finances.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Early skeptics had said that no one would use Bitcoin or think it had value; yet in just over a decade, it has become a <strong>$1 trillion asset</strong>, rivaling gold, and the balance sheets of several public companies are held. </p>



<p>Likewise, critics argued that<strong> Ethereum wouldn’t work and was too slow and expensive</strong>; today, Ethereum powers thousands of permissionless applications, complete trillions of dollars worth of transactions, provides the infrastructure for traditional financial giants, and makes great contributions to cutting-edge cryptography research. </p>

<p>Even when the <strong>ICO</strong> craze failed, many token sales funded very important technological developments, including decentralized storage (the longtime holy grail of computing), network interoperability, manipulation-resistant data feeds, and decentralization calculations.</p>



<p>DeFi won’t spell the end of existing financial services, as some hardcore believers might think (just as the internet didn’t kill print entirely). However, for traditional financial services and other companies, the DeFi opportunity will <strong>allow them to focus on their core structural strengths</strong>—custodial products, prime brokerage, fiat on-ramp, customer service, and more—while gaining direct access to decentralized acquire liquidity and products in the protocol.</p>



<p>As with any evolving new technology, DeFi has its challenges. It’s not unlike the early days of the internet when slow connections and expensive hardware limited even the brightest innovators to supporting the images or videos that are now widely used in online socializing.</p>



<p>DeFi exists and will always exist. Some skeptics see it as <strong>an idealistic movement doomed forever to be cast in the shadow of the internet. </strong></p>



<p>But because of its innovations around settlement efficiency, risk management, and accessibility, DeFi is likely to become a core part of financial infrastructure, not just for cryptocurrencies, but probably for all other categories of markets: in the near future, people will be using DeFi protocols to sell tickets, <strong>Apple</strong> shares, pork futures, socks, etc., most likely through portals that provide access to this infrastructure, with separate governance regimes and business activities.</p>

<p>Although <strong>DeFi</strong> is still in its infancy (only a few years old), its associated economy is already very large and important: <strong>Ethereum</strong>, the back-end infrastructure of DeFi, settled about <strong>$1.5 trillion in transactions</strong> last quarter, accounting for <strong>$1.5 trillion</strong> in <strong>Visa</strong> <strong>transactions</strong>. <strong>50%</strong> of the total payment volume; decentralized money markets (such as <strong>Compound</strong>, <strong>Aave</strong>, etc.) issue loans worth billions of dollars every month; individuals and businesses use platforms such as the <strong>Uniswap</strong> protocol to account for about <strong>30% of Coinbase&#8217;s transaction volume</strong>.</p>



<p>Since entrepreneurs, business leaders, policy makers, and institutions large and small are all very interested in this trend, I will try to explain the characteristics of <strong>DeFi</strong> and the benefits it brings, outline some of the challenges ahead, and consider how DeFi can lead to The path to mainstream acceptance and adoption.</p>



<p>But first, what makes all this possible?</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is DeFi? Where does it come from?</h2>



<p><strong>DeFi</strong> builds on three major waves of blockchain innovation over the past decade, each of which started with deep skepticism and progressed to acceptance and adoption.</p>



<p>The first wave was defined by <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157152-bitcoin-sets-new-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin </a>(invented in 2009), which gave us distributed ledgers (aka blockchains) designed to facilitate peer-to-peer transfers of non-sovereign digital assets. </p>



<p>The second wave is defined by <strong>Ethereum</strong>, which is also rooted (as Bitcoin) in the same underlying distributed, censorship-resistant architecture: unlike Bitcoin, however, Ethereum&#8217;s native programming language (Solidity) can be written in to create any application imaginable, which in turn turns Ethereum into a globally accessible supercomputer. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-89-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-89-1024x576.png" alt="DeFi - A Promising Piece Of The Crypto Market (Part 1)" class="wp-image-157325" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-89-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-89-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-89-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-89-1536x864.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-89-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-89-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-89.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="DeFi - A Promising Piece Of The Crypto Market (Part 1) 29"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">   </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The third wave was the <strong>initial coin offering (ICO)</strong> boom of 2017, which funded a range of projects, some of which have begun to deliver on their promise of creating a decentralized financial ecosystem.</p>



<p><strong>DeFi is the fourth wave, built on a combination of these innovations above.</strong></p>



<p>With DeFi, anyone in the world can use an easy-to-download wallet to borrow, lend, send, or trade blockchain-based assets without using a bank or broker. If they wish, they can also explore more advanced (blockchain asset-based) financial activities such as leveraged trading, structured products, synthetic assets, insurance underwriting, market making, and more, all while maintaining full control over their assets.</p>



<p>DeFi protocols adhere to some key standards (notably permissionlessness and transparency) that reflect Ethereum&#8217;s values. Ethereum is an open-source, decentralized software platform that provides the infrastructure for most <strong>decentralized applications (dApps)</strong>.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Permissionless</strong> for both end users and developers: DeFi applications can serve anyone with an Internet connection in the world, regardless of race, gender, age, wealth, or political affiliation. Additionally, any developer can build on top of these platforms with peace of mind, knowing that no central authority will be able to revoke their access in the future.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Transparent</strong> refers to the inherent suitability of DeFi platforms: because DeFi software is always source code available or open source, all underlying code is always available for review, and all associated funds are auditable. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, which makes it easy to vet specific transactions or set up data analytics businesses for investment (or even survey) purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What are the characteristics and advantages of DeFi?</h2>



<p>Two fundamental properties of DeFi &#8211; <strong>permissionless</strong> and <strong>transparent</strong> &#8211; translate into multiple powerful use cases.</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Lower entry barriers, reduce switching costs, and provide optionality</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>The permissionless nature of Ethereum-based applications enables<strong> free and seamless “forking”</strong> (i.e., copying and adaptation) of the code base of these applications, reducing the barrier to entry for entrepreneurs to zero. End users are the main beneficiaries of this innovative environment: since all applications share the same database (Ethereum blockchain), moving funds between platforms is easy. This forces projects to compete relentlessly on fees and user experience.</p>



<p>A relevant example here is the rise of <strong>&#8220;exchange aggregator&#8221; applications</strong>: using public <strong>APIs</strong>, these aggregators leverage multiple liquidity venues, split orders across platforms, and offer the best possible exchange rates to end users. In just a few months, these aggregators have accelerated DeFi’s progress towards optimal price execution, a standard that previously required formal regulation for early electronic trading venues.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-92.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-92-1024x683.png" alt="DeFi - A Promising Piece Of The Crypto Market (Part 1)" class="wp-image-157328" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-92-1024x683.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-92-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-92-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-92-750x500.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-92-1140x760.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-92.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="DeFi - A Promising Piece Of The Crypto Market (Part 1) 31"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">   </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Contrast the competitive market for DeFi with personal banking as it exists today, where it can take three days to open and close an account, or DeFi with brokerage, where transferring securities between platforms takes up to six jobs Day and many calls. </p>



<p>Combined with other onerous terms, <strong>these</strong> <strong>&#8220;switching costs&#8221; discourage consumers from taking their business elsewhere</strong>, even with the pain of poor service. In fact, to the detriment of individual consumers, traditional finance is moving in the exact opposite direction, with the number of banking licenses declining at a rate of <strong>3.6% per year</strong> since 1990, limiting consumer choice.</p>



<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Transparent accounting and rigorous risk assessment</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>The auditability of capital reserves in DeFi means that rigorous risk assessment and risk management can be achieved. For decentralized money markets and credit facilities (which allow users to take out peer-to-peer, secured loans), users can check the quality of the collateral portfolio and the degree of leverage in the system at any given time.</p>



<p>This stands in stark contrast to the opaque nature of the current financial system. It wasn&#8217;t until after the global financial crisis of 2007-2008 that analysts and regulators began to realize that the U.S. loan-to-deposit ratio had reached <strong>3.5</strong>, twice that of <strong>Russia</strong>, the next most leveraged banking system.</p>



<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Coordinate the incentive mechanism to solve the principal-agent problem</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>The use of trustless, programmable escrow accounts (commonly referred to as “smart contracts”) allows DeFi protocols to be secured at the protocol level.</p>



<p>For example, in the <strong>MakerDAO</strong> system (a decentralized credit facility), MKR token holders earn interest paid by borrowers. However, in the event of (system) insolvency or (borrower) default, they will be the main backstop: MKR will automatically be minted and sold to the market to cover losses (pay off bad debts).</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-90.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-90-1024x576.png" alt="DeFi - A Promising Piece Of The Crypto Market (Part 1)" class="wp-image-157326" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-90-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-90-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-90-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-90-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-90-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-90.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="DeFi - A Promising Piece Of The Crypto Market (Part 1) 32"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">   </figcaption></figure></div>


<p> </p>



<p>This procedural enforcement creates very strict accountability, forcing MKR holders to set reasonable collateral and liquidation risk parameters, as lax risk management practices would place MKR holders at risk of MKR dilution middle.</p>



<p>In traditional finance, by contrast, shareholders suffer direct losses when management makes mistakes. The recent bankruptcy of hedge fund <strong>Archego</strong> is the latest example: <strong>Credit Suisse lost about $4.7 billion due to its dealings with Archegos</strong>, costing the bank&#8217;s investors a lot, although several of the bank&#8217;s executives left the bank, but they are not personally responsible for these losses. And in DeFi, direct accountability will translate into better risk management.</p>

<h5><strong>You know, the crypto market is always the riskiest market for investors. The value of the coin you buy can drop to just scrap paper. So is NFT, and the special thing is that there are celebrities who used to spend millions of dollars to buy NFT now into a few thousand or a few hundred dollars, or maybe worse. Let&#8217;s take a look at Coincu&#8217;s NFTs that have been bought by celebrities and their current value!</strong></h5>

<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Snoop Dogg &#8211; Bored ApeYacht Club #6723</h2>



<p><strong>Snoop</strong> <strong>Dogg</strong> has been in the crypto industry for a while. In December 2021, he bought a bunch of NFTs with a total value of<strong> $366,324</strong>, the most important of which was. <strong>BAYC #6723</strong>. At the time of writing,<strong> $84,514.16 </strong>is the price of <strong>BAYC #6723</strong>.</p>



<p>Other NFTs include two <strong>Mutant Apes</strong> and a <strong>Bored Ape Kennel Club NFT</strong>, and those familiar with Snoop Dogg should know that he likes the traits of cheetahs &#8211; Leopard.</p>



<p>Today, Snoop is not only a collector but also an NFT creator. The collectibles he&#8217;s showing on Opensea currently number around <strong>3,100</strong>, and while most are the same NFT with a different token ID, which seems a bit out of the ordinary, at least he&#8217;s serious about the NFT space.</p>

<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Neymar Jr &#8211; Bored Ape Yacht Club #5269, #6633</h2>



<p>The Brazilian soccer star fueled the NFT craze back then by buying <strong>BAYC #5269</strong> for a whoppin<strong>g $569,531 </strong>in January 2022, and it is currently worth<strong> $121,992,</strong> so Neymar lost <strong>$447,539</strong>. Love it, but it doesn&#8217;t seem like this was just a hype buy.</p>



<p>Neymar actually bought quite a few NFTs in 2022, as his gallery on Opensea showcases <strong>63 NFTs</strong>. He also owns <strong>BAYC #6633</strong>, which cost him another <strong>$480,359</strong> in January 2022, but this NFT is currently only worth <strong>$88,742</strong>, so he lost another <strong>$391,617</strong>.</p>



<p>Another important piece in his collection is the BAYC variant <strong>MAYC #10953</strong>, for which Neymar paid <strong>$170,639</strong> in April 2022 and is currently only worth<strong> $25,007</strong>, thus losing <strong>$145,632</strong>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-79.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="577" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-79-1024x577.png" alt="Celebrities Bought NFT, And Did They Lose Big Money?" class="wp-image-157307" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-79-1024x577.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-79-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-79-768x433.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-79-1536x865.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-79-2048x1154.png 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-79-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-79-1140x642.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Celebrities Bought NFT, And Did They Lose Big Money? 37"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">   </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The other NFTs in Neymar&#8217;s collection seem a bit out of place, and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they were given to him as freebies for some reason.</p>



<p>So, at the time of writing, he has spent <strong>$1,220,529 </strong>on three premium NFTs currently worth a combined <strong>$235,741</strong>, for a loss of <strong>$984,788</strong>. Neymar owns so many NFTs, is fully into the NFT space, and is not just one of those celebs who spend a ton of money on monkeys alone.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Eminem &#8211; Bored Ape Yacht Club #9055</h2>



<p><strong>Eminem</strong>, one of the greatest rappers of all time, also jumped on the NFT train, buying <strong>BAYC #9055 </strong>for <strong>$453,776 </strong>on New Years&#8217; Eve 2021. It’s currently only worth <strong>$88,746</strong>, so Eminem lost<strong> $365,030</strong> on it, or about <strong>$1,000 per day</strong> as of writing.</p>



<p>Like Neymar, <strong>Eminem</strong> is fully into the space as he showcased <strong>109 NFTs</strong> on Opensea. There&#8217;s nothing fancy about his BAYC, but there&#8217;s some cool stuff there. However, his profile sucks because he didn&#8217;t put in any effort.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-80.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="579" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-80.png" alt="Celebrities Bought NFT, And Did They Lose Big Money?" class="wp-image-157308" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-80.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-80-300x170.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-80-768x434.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-80-750x424.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Celebrities Bought NFT, And Did They Lose Big Money? 38"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">   </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Spending nearly half a million dollars for a photo of a monkey is crazy for the average person but a piece of cake for a celebrity like <strong>Eminem</strong>. He took advantage of the BAYC he bought because he used their monkey in the music video with another rapper, Snoop Dogg, and it was pretty cool.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Justin Bieber &#8211; Bored Ape Yacht Club #3001</h2>



<p><strong>Justin Bieber</strong> bought one of the most boring monkeys ever seen, and he paid a whopping<strong> $1,301,550</strong> for it. It&#8217;s currently only worth <strong>$86,613</strong>, so a loss of <strong>$1,214,937 </strong>is a staggering loss, but luckily, he&#8217;s one of the best-selling singers of all time, so he can afford to lose over $1 million without Will blink.</p>



<p>Justin&#8217;s Opensea NFT profile is also underwhelming, but he&#8217;s been collecting and currently holds about <strong>1,900 NFTs</strong>, so he&#8217;s buying the hype just because other celebrities are spending money on NFTs.</p>

<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Paris Hilton &#8211; Bored Ape Yacht Club #1294</h2>



<p><strong>Paris Hilton</strong>, another big celebrity, bought a monkey in January 2022 for<strong> $287,055</strong> and is now worth <strong>$86,653,</strong> so she currently has a loss of <strong>$200,402</strong>.</p>



<p>Paris has been in the crypto industry for a long time, so it&#8217;s only fair to her that she didn&#8217;t see a huge loss because she saw the value in NFTs and the future they hold. Her Opensea collection contains approximately <strong>1,500 NFTs</strong>, and she has created nearly <strong>26,000 NFTs</strong> so far.</p>



<p>Now let’s discuss other types of NFTs, but before that, other celebrities who have purchased monkeys include <strong>Jimmy Fallon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Timbaland,</strong> and <strong>Steve Aoki</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Next came CryptoPunks, what&#8217;s so attractive about these pixelated pictures?</strong></p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Serena Williams &#8211; CryptoPunk #2950</h2>



<p>Back in June 2021, the great tennis player<strong> Serena Williams </strong>paid <strong>$177,123</strong> for an NFT of this pixelated villain, it looks like a tennis player, so she bought it. It&#8217;s not currently available in any market, so it&#8217;s hard to value. But if she still kept the <strong>85 ETH</strong> she paid for the NFT, she would only be able to exchange about<strong> $102,876 </strong>today, which would be a loss of <strong>$74,247</strong>.</p>



<p>She has<strong> 66 NFTs</strong> in her unnamed profile on <strong>Opensea</strong>, and it looks like she&#8217;s spending more money on many small projects.</p>

<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Gary Vaynerchuk &#8211; CryptoPunk #2140</h2>



<p>Entrepreneur and Internet personality<strong> Gary Vaynerchuk</strong> bought <strong>CryptoPunk #2140</strong> at the cost of <strong>$3,953,216 (1,600 ETH)</strong>, you can only imagine him being an ETH whale because if you&#8217;re spending <strong>2%</strong> of your net worth on an NFT, then you&#8217;d need a reason too.</p>



<p>Likewise, <strong>CryptoPunk #2140 </strong>is hard to value, but if he still kept the <strong>1,600 ETH </strong>he paid for the NFT, it would be<strong> $1,934,367 </strong>at today&#8217;s prices, so he would have to take a <strong>$2 million loss.</strong></p>

<p>He&#8217;s a real NFT collector as his Opensea profile says he has <strong>6,800 NFTs</strong>, and some of them have wasted his money, but when you have a net worth of<strong> $200 million</strong>, it really doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Logan Paul &#8211; Bumble Bee</h2>



<p>Influencer <strong>Logan Paul</strong> paid a whopping <strong>$667,000</strong> for it in <strong>December 2021</strong>, and it&#8217;s currently worth about<strong> $2,000</strong>, a loss of <strong>$665,000</strong>.</p>



<p>Additionally, Rogan is also the owner of five<strong> CryptoPunks (#2294, #6762, #5569, #7861, #4484)</strong>. The most expensive of these is <strong>CryptoPunk #2294</strong>, which he bought for <strong>110 ETH ($163,003)</strong> on Feb 25, 2021. However, he has publicly announced many times that he will hold these NFTs for a long time and has no short-term plans to sell them.</p>

<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Regardless, it&#8217;s fun exploring the celebrities who own these super-expensive NFTs.</p>



<p>However, we know that the cryptocurrency market operates in cycles, and there is no doubt that the NFT market will rebound sharply during the next bull run.</p>



<p>Will these NFTs reach the heights that celebrities paid for them again? Considering the money a celebrity earns, it&#8217;s just consumption to them, and they probably don&#8217;t bother with their losses at all. And these NFTs are owned by celebrities, they can add more value during the next bull run.</p>

<p>There was news on the Internet that Kraken was deploying the NFT market earlier this year. The public beta version was launched around Christmas, which is a bit unexpected and somewhat expected news.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/155613-kraken-launched-nft-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kraken NFT marketplace</a> was only available to a private tester group, and now everyone can officially access it. This shows that Kraken is still working tirelessly to accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrencies in the cold winter of the exchange.</p>



<p>Let us start with the NFT trading market today and have a deeper understanding of the characteristics and what this market has to offer as well as the benefits that Kraken NFT brings.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is the NFT marketplace?</h2>



<p><strong>NFT</strong> <strong>marketplace</strong> is a digital platform for buying and selling NFTs. These platforms allow people to store and display their NFTs and sell them to others in the form of cryptocurrency or money. Some NFT marketplaces also allow users to mint their NFTs on the platform itself.</p>



<p>The marketplace handles the transfer of NFTs from one party to another by earning users money. Each NFT market has its own operating system. Available NFT types, fees, payment options, allowed blockchains, and other rules would depend on which one you use.</p>



<h3 class="has-black-color has-text-color"><strong>Two common types of NFT marketplaces</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Do-It-Yourself NFT Marketplace:</strong> Allows anyone to create NFTs of any kind. You can create image-based NFTs, video-based NFTs, audio NFTs, and more. Most self-service marketplaces allow you to manually set royalties, linking royalties to NFTs. For example, the opensea we use most often.</p>



<p><strong>Featured Curated NFT Marketplace:</strong> Here, you need approval from the marketplace management to create and list your NFTs. The reason curated marketplaces exist is to ensure that only the highest quality NFTs are listed on them.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-76.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="577" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-76-1024x577.png" alt="What&#039;s So Great About Kraken NFT With Zero Gas Fees?" class="wp-image-157301" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-76-1024x577.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-76-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-76-768x433.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-76-1536x866.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-76-750x423.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-76-1140x643.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-76.png 1916w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="What&#039;s So Great About Kraken NFT With Zero Gas Fees? 47"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">   </figcaption></figure></div>


<h3 class="has-black-color has-text-color"><strong>How does the NFT marketplace work?</strong></h3>



<p>When you create an account on an NFT marketplace, you can browse all of their available selling options. You can also add payment methods, some require you to link a cryptocurrency wallet and pay in cryptocurrency, while others allow you to use a credit card.</p>



<p>Some sites let you buy NFTs directly for a fixed price, while others use an auction method. If you complete the transaction, the NFT marketplace will record it on its blockchain, showing the change in ownership.</p>



<h3 class="has-black-color has-text-color"><strong>What is mint?</strong></h3>



<p>Everyone is familiar with the term mint. In the NFT world, mint refers to the process of creating new NFTs on the blockchain, the most common being Ethereum. When you mint an NFT, you record the data that makes up the new NFT in a new block, which is then added to the blockchain.</p>



<p>There is usually a fee to mint an NFT. For NFT systems using the <strong>Ethereum</strong> blockchain, this fee is paid in gas, an encrypted token used to perform functions on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>



<p>More and more NFT marketplaces are getting creative with how, when, and who to charge minting fees.</p>



<p>Knowing the above, let&#8217;s take a look at how the Kraken NFT market, which was launched on Christmas and released after a month of user testing, works.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Kraken exchange</h2>



<p>Kraken is one of the oldest digital asset platforms in the world. Globally, Kraken clients can trade over <strong>200 digital assets </strong>and <strong>8 different national currencies</strong>, including <strong>GBP, EUR, USD, CAD, JPY, CHF, AUD </strong>and<strong> AUD.</strong></p>



<p>Founded in 2011, Kraken currently has more than <strong>2,000 employees</strong> and is one of the first exchanges to provide spot trading with margin, parachain auctions, pledges, regulated derivatives, and index services. </p>

<p>In 2022, Kraken launched a custodial NFT marketplace. Kraken is trusted by more than <strong>9 million traders</strong> and institutions worldwide and offers professional, 24/7 online support. Kraken was the first company to conduct a <strong>Proof of Reserves</strong> audit and has since committed to regular Proof of Reserves publications.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Kraken NFT marketplace</h2>



<p>At launch, <strong>Kraken NFT</strong> will offer collections of over <strong>110 of the highest-traded NFTs</strong> on the market today. Currently, this only includes series on the <strong>Ethereum</strong> and <strong>Solana</strong> blockchains. This includes series such as<strong> BAYC, Crypto Punks, Doodles, Moonbirds, </strong>and <strong>y00ts</strong>. The marketplace also reviews all collectibles before they are added, and this applies to future collectibles as well. </p>



<p>Currently, Kraken-backed collections go through a thorough and comprehensive vetting process, and new collections are added regularly. Users can also access the NFT Screener tool on <strong>Cryptowatch</strong> to track real-time NFT market data, average sale prices, and in-depth statistics on hundreds of different collections.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-74.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="517" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-74-1024x517.png" alt="What&#039;s So Great About Kraken NFT With Zero Gas Fees?" class="wp-image-157299" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-74-1024x517.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-74-300x152.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-74-768x388.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-74-1536x776.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-74-2048x1035.png 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-74-750x379.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-74-1140x576.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="What&#039;s So Great About Kraken NFT With Zero Gas Fees? 49"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">   </figcaption></figure></div>


<h3><strong>Main features &#8211; zero gas fee</strong></h3>



<p>Collectors can buy and sell NFTs held on <strong>Kraken</strong>, and similar to <strong>Blur</strong>, the <strong>Kraken</strong> <strong>NFT</strong> marketplace does not include gas fees. In other words, instead of requiring you to pay additional transaction fees when buying or trading NFTs, the fees will be enforced when users transfer their NFTs to other platforms. </p>



<p>Additionally, Kraken NFT users will be able to use one wallet to buy, sell and trade digital assets while participating in multiple blockchains. Collectors can easily trade on the market even during periods of peak network activity.</p>



<h3><strong>Creator Income</strong></h3>



<p>The recent debate over creator royalties has been a contentious topic in the NFT community. Nevertheless, Kraken NFT has already given an excellent answer to this question, and NFT creators in the market will automatically receive part of the sales revenue generated by their digital creations.</p>



<h3><strong>Rarity rank</strong></h3>



<p>All supported collectibles have an accompanying rarity ranking, users can easily keep track of each NFT, and can conveniently see the score on the upper right of the listed NFT. Therefore, users can better assess the rarity of individual NFTs and provide references for potential bids or offers.</p>



<h3><strong>200+ funding options:</strong></h3>



<p>Users can bid on their favorite NFTs with cash or any of the over <strong>200 cryptocurrencies</strong> supported by <strong>Kraken</strong>. Buyers can bid using a variety of payment methods, including popular cryptocurrency options such as <strong>Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Dogecoin</strong>, and many more. And all it takes is a wallet.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>In addition to <strong>OpenSea</strong>, which we use the most, the main trading markets on the market include <strong>Rarible, Mintable, Nifty Gateway</strong>, etc. Among them, <strong>Mintable</strong> also features<strong> &#8220;no gas fee&#8221;</strong> like <strong>Kraken</strong> <strong>NFT</strong>.</p>



<p>The whitelist for Kraken NFTs will start with those built on <strong>Ethereum</strong> and <strong>Solana</strong>. Support for other blockchains will be added in the near future. We expect Kraken NFT to be at the forefront of this exciting space, and the growing number of related products also reflects its long-term commitment to the construction of the NFT ecosystem.</p>



<p>This crypto winter, when the exchange has been hit hard, users are looking forward to the Kraken NFT market bringing some new vitality to itself and the entire NFT market. Will you use the Kraken NFT market?</p>

<p><strong>DeGods</strong> is a blue-chip project of <strong>Solana</strong> <strong>NFT</strong>. Its innovative mechanism of gameplay has brought it more than ten times the increase, and it has also made <a href="https://news.coincu.com/155392-solana-degods-will-move-to-ethereum-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeGods</a> one of the strongest communities in the entire <strong>Solana NFT ecosystem</strong>. </p>



<p>However, due to the close relationship between the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156939-solana-has-lost-over-50-billion-in-value/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solana</a> ecosystem and <strong>FTX</strong>, the entire Solana ecology is now affected, and DeGods has not been spared. Since the FTX incident, its floor price has dropped by more than <strong>70%</strong>, and<strong> &#8220;escape&#8221; from Solana to other public chains has become an important step in its planning.</strong></p>

<p>Regardless of the number of users, transaction volume, or liquidity, <strong>Ethereum</strong> has always occupied a dominant advantage, and it is also the first choice for NFT developers. Therefore, it is not surprising that DeGods migrated to <strong>Ethereum</strong>.</p>



<p>However, its second-generation project <strong>y00ts</strong> did not follow in the footsteps of <strong>DeGods</strong>, but chose <strong>Polygon</strong>, which is somewhat unexpected. Because compared to <strong>Ethereum</strong>, <strong>Polygon</strong> <strong>does not have a really strong NFT ecosystem</strong>, and its security is not as mature as <strong>Ethereum</strong>. Why did <strong>y00ts</strong> make such a decision?</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Polygon&#8217;s approach to NFT layout</h2>



<p>In terms of laying out NFT, <strong>Polygon</strong> is quite farsighted.</p>



<p>First, it became one of the first integrated public chains of <strong>Opensea</strong> besides <strong>Ethereum</strong>. With its cheap cost and fast transaction experience, it attracted many NFT users. The transaction volume once approached or even surpassed <strong>Ethereum</strong> and became the second-largest number of NFT users. ecology.</p>



<p>Later, <strong>Polygon</strong> <strong>Studios</strong> was established, determined to expand the chain game and NFT territory. So far, more than<strong> 36 projects </strong>have been invested. These projects are almost always deployed on the Polygon chain.</p>

<p>Although in the bear market, Polygon&#8217;s data in all aspects fell, and the NFT market was not so active. But Polygon also sees new breakthroughs, and hastened partnerships with Web 2 and traditional businesses. In the past few months, Polygon has attracted a large number of well-known brands and has already cooperated with top brands such as <strong>Coca-Cola, Starbucks, Draftkings, Meta,</strong> and so on.</p>



<p>Among them, Reddit&#8217;s NFT series <strong>Reddit Collectible Avatar</strong> issued by Polygon ushered in a peak transaction volume in a short period of time and once reached <strong>25% of the entire mainstream market transaction volume</strong>. At present, the total number of <strong>Reddit Collectible Avatars </strong>has exceeded 7 million, and the total number of holding addresses exceeds<strong> 5 million.</strong></p>



<p>As a major Web2 online site, Reddit has more than <strong>1.5 billion registered users</strong>, <strong>430 million monthly active users,</strong> and<strong> 52 million daily active users</strong>. Although the number of addresses held by <strong>Reddit NFT </strong>is small compared to its daily active users, this attempt will not only allow many Web 2 companies that are holding a wait-and-see attitude towards NFT to follow suit, creating new narratives about NFT but also for <strong>Polygon </strong>expand user scale and improve liquidity. </p>



<p>Vora, the founder of DeGods, also said that Polygon&#8217;s active cooperation with well-known brands is one of the reasons for their choice.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Beyond that, Polygon captures star power</h2>



<p>In the last round of NFT bull market, we witnessed the power of the star effect not only brought real traffic to NFT but also profoundly affected the price of NFT. Since NFT has its own cultural and entertainment attributes, star effects are mostly concentrated in its celebrities in entertainment media and other fields. This time, Polygon launched a collection of NFTs of former <strong>US President Trump</strong>. </p>



<p>It is not without precedent to cooperate with political and business celebrities to deploy NFT, such as Twitter founder <strong>Jack Dorsey’s tweet NFT</strong>,<strong> Musk’s ELONGATE, </strong>etc. Although the sales of these NFTs are not entirely ideal. </p>



<p>However, the <strong>Trump NFT</strong> <strong>was sold out within 6 hours </strong>of its release and once topped the Opensea 24-hour trading list. According to Nansen data, more than 332,000 users minted NFT on Polygon in the week of the NFT launch, or driven by this, the average daily transaction volume of Polygon has surpassed that of BNB Chain.</p>



<p>Polygon took advantage of exactly these advantages, gaining traction in the early hype cycles. Data shows that the number of transactions on the Polygon chain has exceeded <strong>960 million</strong>, and <strong>234,000 contract creators </strong>have deployed <strong>778,000 smart contracts</strong>. As of December 26, the number of unique addresses on the Polygon blockchain exceeds <strong>202 million.</strong></p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Major projects on Solana announce Support for Polygon</h2>



<p>Prior to <strong>y00ts</strong>, major projects in the Solana ecosystem had announced support for <strong>Polygon</strong>. For example, <strong>Phantom</strong>, a single-chain wallet originally dedicated to Solana, announced support for Ethereum and Polygon to expand its service scope and officially upgraded from a single-chain wallet to a multi-chain wallet.</p>



<p>In addition, <strong>Magic</strong> <strong>Eden</strong>, the largest NFT market in the Solana ecosystem, also announced that it will integrate with Polygon and will first launch Launchpad and Marketplace on Polygon to provide support for the ecosystem of game developers and creators on the Polygon chain.</p>

<p>These announcements were all made a month ago, which makes us feel like y00ts had been planning for at least a month. Going from wallets accepting Polygon NFTs to integrating Polygon&#8217;s NFT marketplace seems to be paving the way for the y00ts to migrate.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Is Polygon the best choice?</h2>



<p>Although Polygon has performed well recently, <strong>y00ts</strong> still faces many doubts about migrating to Polygon.</p>



<p>First of all, Polygon is facing technical problems, such as the<strong> 11-hour network interruption</strong> due to node failure in March and the loss of user funds due to loopholes in the Polygon PoS creation contract. </p>



<p>Whether it is an ideal bottom layer in terms of security. However, the final stage of the<strong> Polygon zkEVM </strong>public test network launched by Polygon in October this year has also been launched. According to the official statement, this technology can significantly increase the transaction volume per second of Polygon, and the main network will be launched soon. It can also be regarded as a technical breakthrough for Polygon.</p>



<p>Second, there are rumors that <strong>y00ts</strong> decided to move to Polygon because they <a href="https://news.coincu.com/155804-the-degods-team-asked-for-5-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked</a> for <strong>$5 million</strong> from the <strong>Solana Foundation</strong>, which was rejected, and therefore accepted funding from Polygon. Polygon is paying with a grant from its partners&#8217;<strong> </strong>fund, which is expected to last for a year. But Degod founder <strong>Frank III has denied claims of asking for funds.</strong></p>

<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">The fall of Terra and 3AC</h2>



<p>Referring to 2022, the first known name is <strong>Terra</strong>.</p>



<p>Terra is the second-largest TVL ecosystem in crypto. With a market capitalization of up to $33 billion and owning Stablecoin-UST <strong>ranked 3rd in capitalization </strong>at the beginning of 2022. Most of the locked assets are in Anchor on Terra, with over 14 billion UST for profit. In addition, other projects are on track. However, a <strong>&#8220;black swan&#8221; </strong>event happened to this large ecosystem and completely caused the <strong>Terra</strong> network to collapse in just one week.</p>



<p>In maybe 24 hours, Terra went from being a star blockchain to being ridiculed by everyone. It failed at the same time as <strong>Three Arrows Capital</strong>, the biggest VC firm and investor in the sector. Money was lost by a lot of people when <strong>Terra</strong> and <strong>3AC</strong> failed. And it appears that their creators have intentions to support it.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">The Ethereum Merge</h2>



<p>Finally, one of the biggest events in Ethereum history took place in 2022. <a href="https://news.coincu.com/124946-the-merge-successful-started-using-pos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Merge</a> took place very successfully in the expectation of the entire crypto community. The Ethereum network officially switched from <strong>Proof-of-Work</strong> to <strong>Proof-of-Stake</strong>.</p>



<p>After <strong>The Merge</strong>, Ethereum will become a <strong>less energy-intensive blockchain </strong>because the consensus mechanism will no longer need miners as before.</p>



<p>Because it uses less energy, the rewards for validators on the <strong>PoS</strong> blockchain will also be lower than the rewards for miners on the <strong>PoW</strong> blockchain, thereby helping to create deflationary pressure on <strong>ETH.</strong></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-58.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="541" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-58-1024x541.png" alt="Top Important Crypto Events Of 2022" class="wp-image-157275" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-58-1024x541.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-58-300x158.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-58-768x405.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-58-750x396.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-58-1140x602.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-58.png 1254w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Top Important Crypto Events Of 2022 60"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">   </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In addition, mining money no longer also helps the world&#8217;s second-largest blockchain cut power consumption by more than <strong>99%</strong>. However, after The Merge, <strong>gas fees on Ethereum will not decrease</strong>, and the transaction speed will not be faster.</p>



<p>Ethereum is also freed by the smooth, successful switch from <strong>PoW</strong> to <strong>PoS</strong>. Layer 2 is thriving thanks to significant funding. But as Ethereum gained strength, regulatory pressure grew significantly. In the DeFi industry, regulation has become more contentious.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Russia-Ukraine War</h2>



<p>Not just a political hot spot, the conflict between <strong>Russia</strong> and <strong>Ukraine</strong> has sent financial markets reeling. And, of course, the crypto market is also among them. </p>



<p>The war between <strong>Russia</strong> and <strong>Ukraine</strong> is the biggest event in the globe this year. With Vitalik at the helm, the cryptocurrency community once made up half of the donations made to Ukraine. On top of that, international regulatory bodies started putting penalties on Russia in cryptocurrency-related fields. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine also brought attention to the convergence between the cryptosphere and the real world, for better or worse.</p>

<p>In addition, the US government has stepped up enforcement of sanctions that make it possible for Russian armed extremist organizations to use crypto as a method of cross-border money transfers.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">StepN Move-to-Earn or &#8220;move out&#8221;?</h2>



<p><strong>StepN</strong> is the first <strong>Move-to-Earn</strong> mobile NFT game powered by <strong>Solana</strong>, where players can walk, jog or run outdoors with an NFT Sneaker to earn tokens. StepN aims to inspire millions to engage in healthier lifestyles by bringing them into the <strong>Web3</strong> world while contributing positively to carbon neutrality.</p>



<p>The main killer of every Ponzi is slowing new capital inflows, as every Ponzi is fueled by new capital inflows. If a <strong>Ponzi</strong> runs out of new capital inflows, it will collapse.</p>

<p>After Axie, <strong>StepN</strong>, built by a Chinese team, became a phenomenal application, bringing a new paradigm to <strong>GameFi</strong>. At one time, domestic WEB2 entrepreneurs entered the game. But due to the influence of the team itself and the external environment, <strong>StepN</strong> did not get out of the Ponzi cycle and finally became short-lived. But more entrepreneurs improved on its model and launched new projects.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Fed rate hiking</h2>



<p>In June 2022, the <strong>Federal Open Market Committee</strong> announced raising interest rates to <strong>75 basis points</strong>, thereby marking the Fed&#8217;s rate hike cycle.</p>



<p>The connection between cryptocurrencies and the Nasdaq and the Fed keeps expanding. This year&#8217;s market has experienced a significant downturn as a result of the Fed&#8217;s rate hike. The <strong>Fed</strong> may pivot in the middle of next year, as is commonly anticipated. With the halving of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies were mostly cyclical in the past. However, it will be interesting to see if it will continue to resonate with Nasdaq and Fed policies next year as the volume grows and institutional holdings rise.</p>

<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Tornado Faces US Sanctions</h2>



<p>The most notable development in U.S. legislation in <strong>2022</strong> was the imposition of sanctions against the cryptocurrency mixer <a href="https://news.coincu.com/116599-tornado-cash-volume-soars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tornado</a>, whose developer was even detained in the Netherlands.</p>



<p>The government agency added the popular <strong>Ethereum</strong> <strong>mixing</strong> <strong>tool</strong> to its sanctioned list in August. It’s the first time the U.S. has sanctioned a DeFi protocol on-chain. The action demonstrates the determination of American authorities to pursue various crypto supply chain nodes that are exploited for illicit purposes.</p>

<p>Many platforms have denied involvement with Tornado Cash. Specifically, Circle was ordered to freeze the <strong>75,000 USDC </strong>contained in the sanctioned wallet addresses.</p>



<p>Additionally, the U.S. detained <strong>Coinbase</strong> employees who were allegedly engaged in insider trading, and the industry was rocked by the detention of Bitfinex&#8217;s multibillion-dollar hackers.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Massive crypto company layoffs</h2>



<p>In this year&#8217;s bear market, the crypto industry has laid off more than <strong>10,000 people</strong>. Companies or exchanges in the industry have had to reduce their human resources to withstand the harsh conditions of the crypto winter. Names that can be mentioned in this list are <strong>Crypto.com, Gemini, BlockFi, Genesis, Coinbase,…</strong></p>

<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s Empire</h2>



<p>The crash of FTX could be the biggest event in recent years. Going after <strong>Terra</strong>, but the consequences left by <strong>FTX</strong> are impossible to estimate.</p>



<p>The fall of the FTX, where <strong>SBF</strong> quickly degraded from being a constructor of a sizable ecosystem and a star favorite in the eyes of regulators and traditional capital into a demented, dishonest, and even drug-addled criminal, is the most significant event for the industry in 2022. Fortunately, it was discovered before it deceived any more people.</p>

<p>In early November, within days of declaring bankruptcy, crypto companies had to go public with their exposure to FTX.</p>



<p>SBF, with its<strong> $250 million bail</strong>, went free. However, US authorities are still actively investigating other matters involving him and even the assets of the exchange he once led are now controlled by the Bahamas authorities.</p>

<p>An <strong>IOU</strong> <strong>token</strong> is a type of digital asset that is used to represent debt between two parties. <strong>IOU</strong> stands for <strong>“I owe you”</strong> and is a contract that acknowledges a certain amount of debt owed. </p>



<p>These tokens can be used to facilitate transactions, such as transferring money, goods, or services between two parties. With the advent of blockchain technology, IOU tokens have become a popular way to facilitate transactions in a secure and efficient manner.</p>



<p><strong>Babel</strong> <strong>Finance</strong> previously <a href="https://news.coincu.com/112932-babel-finance-lost-280m-proprietary-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> losing <strong>$280 million</strong> on proprietary trading. <strong>Genesis Zipmex </strong>and a few private investors from Chinese-speaking areas are among its biggest debtors.</p>



<p><strong>Babel</strong> <strong>Finance</strong> lost more than<strong> $280 million</strong> in <strong>Ether (ETH)</strong> and <strong>Bitcoin (BTC)</strong> as a result of its private trading failure. In particular, it suffered losses of almost <strong>8,000 BTC</strong> and <strong>56,000 ETH</strong> in <strong>June</strong> after being forced to liquidate because of a severe market decline.</p>

<p>The lending and trading divisions of Babel were unable to satisfy counterparties&#8217; margin requests as a result of these significant losses.</p>



<p>According to the Babel proprietary trading team, their orders were not supported by any term sheets and were not recorded in the system as such. The company&#8217;s wallet managers also dispersed an unlimited amount of money to trading accounts managed by its proprietary trading team.</p>
