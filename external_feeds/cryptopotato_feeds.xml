			            <description><![CDATA[Some of the most significant losers today include XLM, OP, SOL, and others.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price performance took a sharp turn for the worse in the past several hours, dropping to a 6-week low of under $28,800.</p>
<p>As it usually happens, the altcoins are also in the red, and the total crypto market cap has declined by over $20 billion.</p>
<h2>BTC Under $29K</h2>
<p>Bitcoin doesn&#8217;t tend to stay silent for long, which could have prepared the community for what happened in the past 24 hours. This is because the cryptocurrency was trading quietly in a range between $29,000 and $29,000 for roughly a week, and even the US Fed&#8217;s interest rate hike on Wednesday didn&#8217;t change the landscape all that much.</p>
<p>Then came the weekend, typically a less eventful part of the week by nature, and BTC <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoinsv-bsv-soars-11-daily-bitcoin-btc-bounces-off-29k-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">remained</a> just under $29,500.</p>
<p>However, all of that changed during the early hours of the Asian trading session today when the bears took control and pushed BTC south hard. As a result, the asset <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-slumps-to-6-week-low-leaving-nearly-100-million-in-liquidations/" data-wpel-link="internal">fell</a> to its lowest price position since June 21 at $28,750 (on Bitstamp).</p>
<p>It has managed to recover a few hundred dollars since then but still stands under $29,000. Its market capitalization has retraced to $562 billion, and its dominance over the alts sits at 48.3% on CMC.</p>
<figure id="attachment_263580" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-263580" style="width: 1835px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSD-1.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-263580" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/BTCUSD-1.png" alt="BTCUSD.

Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Alts See Red</h2>
<p>When BTC heads south, so do most altcoins. This has been the case in the past 24 hours as well. ETH was unable to overcome $1,900 for several consecutive days and a 1.5% decline has now pushed the second-largest crypto to under $1,850. Ripple, Dogecoin, Cardano, Polkadot, Shiba Inu, Tron, and Uniswap are also slightly in the red.</p>
<p>More losses come from the likes of Polygon, Solana, and Litecoin, all of which have dropped by up to 4% daily.</p>
<p>The landscape with Stellar and Optimism is even worse, as XLM is down by 5.5%, while OP has plummeted by 8%.</p>
<p>In total, the crypto market cap has seen $20 billion evaporate from yesterday&#8217;s peak and is down to $1.160 trillion on CMC.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Richard Heart supposedly promised to make investors rich, which using their funds to make several luxury purchases. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sued the controversial crypto entrepreneur Richard Schueler, popularly known within the crypto community as Richard Heart, along with three of his entities, for allegedly engaging in unregistered securities sales and fraudulent activities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Heart purportedly used investors&#8217; money to create a luxury lifestyle for himself, buying expensive items, including the purchase of the world&#8217;s largest polished black diamond.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Heart Asked Investors to &#8220;Sacrifice&#8221; Their Crypto?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/LXgg43D/hex-complaint-pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">court document</a> on Monday (July 31, 2023), the SEC claimed that Richard Heart conducted an unregistered sale of cryptocurrency securities that raised more than $1 billion. The regulator also listed three entities under Heart&#8217;s control — Hex, PulseChain, and PulseX — in the lawsuit while labeling them crypto asset securities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the complaint, Heart marketed Hex as the &#8220;first high-yield Blockchain Certificate of Deposit&#8221; on the Ethereum network. The SEC also referred to Heart&#8217;s numerous YouTube live streams where he talked about the Hex staking program, which he claimed could give investors an annual return of 38% in more HEX tokens.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The securities regulator further claimed that Heart offered several incentives to get investors to make more investments, promising that they would become rich. The tactic seemed successful, as the crypto entrepreneur received more than 2.3 million ETH deposits during the Hex offering.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Heart further asked participants to invest their crypto assets in PulseChain offering, which he referred to as &#8220;sacrificing,&#8221; in exchange for PLS tokens to be delivered in the future. The venture raised $354 million worth of cryptocurrency, with the SEC stating that Heart did not register the PulseChain offering with the regulatory watchdog.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the SEC alleged that Heart misused funds generated through the PulseChain offering, supposedly sending $217 million from the proceeds to a private wallet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also, Heart and PulseChain misappropriated &#8220;at least $12.1 million of PulseChain investor funds,&#8221; which he used to buy luxury items such as expensive watches and automobiles, and a 555-carat diamond called &#8220;The Enigma,&#8221; the world&#8217;s largest polished black diamond.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Crypto Community Applauds SEC&#8217;s Action</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The agency is charging Heart and PulseChain with &#8220;fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of a security,&#8221; &#8220;fraud in the offer of a sale or security,&#8221; and &#8220;securities registration violation&#8221; against Heart, Hex, PulseChain, and PulseX.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-143" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">statement</a> from the SEC Fort Worth regional office Eric Werner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Heart called on investors to buy crypto asset securities in offerings that he failed to register. He then defrauded those investors by spending some of their crypto assets on exorbitant luxury goods. This action seeks to protect the investing public and hold Heart accountable for his actions.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, unlike other lawsuits by the SEC against cryptocurrency companies and individuals, the majority of the community seems to applaud the regulator&#8217;s actions, with some stating that the lawsuit is coming <a href="https://twitter.com/lopp/status/1686021426279493635?t=qaObrrFrmkRYoVwllc_DPA&amp;s=19" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">late</a> for Hex investors.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Most alternative coins are also well in the red on a daily scale.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After several days of trading sideways, bitcoin finally made a move but not a positive one for the bulls.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency slumped below $29,000 to chart its lowest price tag in a month and a half, leaving almost $100 million in liquidations.</p>
<ul>
<li>As <em>CryptoPotato</em> <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoinsv-bsv-soars-11-daily-bitcoin-btc-bounces-off-29k-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> yesterday, bitcoin, and for that matter the rest of the market, had remained calm for several consecutive days, something rather untypical for the volatile crypto space.</li>
<li>The primary cryptocurrency stood in a tight range between $29,000 and $29,500, and the former served as its resistance line.</li>
<li>However, the landscape changed during the early Asian trading session on Tuesday. Bitcoin slumped by almost a grand from well above $29,000 to $28,750 (on Bitstamp). This became its lowest price tag since June 21.</li>
<li>Despite recovering a few hundred dollars since then, BTC is still well in the red now. Likewise, most altcoins have also suffered.</li>
<li>Dogecoin, Solana, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Avalanche, Polygon, and Stellar have all declined by somewhere between 3-5% in a day.</li>
<li>Somewhat expectedly, this volatility has harmed over-leveraged traders, especially those with long positions.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Data</a> from CoinGlass shows that the total value of liquidations for the past 24 hours has risen to just shy of $100 million. Naturally, long positions are responsible for the lion&#8217;s share (85%) of that amount.</li>
<li>In total, more than 35,000 traders have been liquidated, and the single largest order took place on Bybit and was worth over $1 million.</li>
</ul>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority of Germany (better known by its abbreviation BaFin) launched an investigation against the cryptocurrency platform Bitcoin Bank Breaker. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The watchdog believes there are several red flags surrounding the firm, suspecting it of functioning without the necessary authorization.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BaFin </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/DE/Verbrauchermitteilung/unerlaubte/2023/meldung_2023_07_31_bitcoin_bank-breaker.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">warned</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> German consumers to be extra careful when dealing with the cryptocurrency trading platform Bitcoin Bank Breaker, claiming its operators have not disclosed a full company name, legal form, or place of business on the website.</span></li>
<li>The regulator also cast doubts that the team behind the platform provides investment and financial services without permission.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Anyone who offers banking, financial, or securities services in Germany requires permission from Bafin,&#8221; it reminded.</span></p></blockquote>

<li>Subsequently, the watchdog advised consumers to be highly cautious when investing on the Internet and conduct proper due diligence to identify any fraud before it is too late.</li>
<li>Bitcoin Bank Breaker presents itself as a trading platform that delivers &#8220;a fresh and accessible experience to beginners and advanced traders&#8221; willing to enter the BTC ecosystem.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[The DOJ said SBF's actions have shown that no set of pretrial release conditions can assure the safety of witnesses.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has requested that the bail bond of Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the founder and former CEO of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, be revoked and that the court impose a detention order against him due to his attempts to tamper with witnesses.</p>
<p>According to a letter <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.184.0.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">submitted</a> to Judge Lewis Kaplan of the U.S. Court for the Southern District of New York, SBF&#8217;s attempts to tamper with witnesses in his fraud case would interfere with the government&#8217;s and public&#8217;s right to a fair trial and the administration of justice.</p>
<h2>SBF&#8217;s Witness Tampering Attempts</h2>
<p>The DOJ disclosed that after SBF was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/heres-who-co-signed-sam-bankman-frieds-250-million-bail-bond/" data-wpel-link="internal">released</a> on a bail bond in December, he reached out to the current general counsel of FTX.US in January through emails and Signal, an encrypted messaging application. Among other things, SBF expressed his desire to reconnect with the counsel and build a &#8220;constructive relationship&#8221; that would entail using each other as resources when possible.</p>
<p>The Justice Department pointed out that SBF had a history of using Signal for obstructive purposes in the years that led to his firm&#8217;s bankruptcy. The court eventually modified his bail conditions, prohibiting contact with FTX and Alameda Research employees and using encrypted or ephemeral messaging applications.</p>
<p>The New York Times recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/caroline-ellison-felt-unsuited-to-run-alameda-amid-sbf-relationship-drama/" data-wpel-link="internal">published</a> an article on the private writings and psychology of Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda and SBF&#8217;s ex-girlfriend, in the months leading up to FTX&#8217;s implosion. After several investigations, the DOJ found that SBF had released the writings to reporters.</p>
<p>A deeper probe showed that in the past few months, SBF had sent more than 100 emails and been on over 1,000 phone calls with media members. He also had over 100 phone calls with one of the authors of the New York Times Ellison article, with several lasting for roughly 20 minutes. In addition, the FTX founder used virtual private networks to conceal his online activities.</p>
<h2>DOJ Wants SBF Detained Ahead of Trial</h2>
<p>SBF&#8217;s actions have shown that no pretrial release conditions can assure the safety of witnesses and that he is unlikely to abide by his bail conditions, according to the DOJ.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have already sought a gag order, which SBF <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sbf-agrees-to-gag-order-requests-one-for-rivals-too/" data-wpel-link="internal">accepted</a> last week, to prevent further witness tampering actions.

			            <description><![CDATA[The issuance of the operational MVP license permits Binance to operate two licensed activities. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid regulatory turmoil elsewhere, Binance&#8217;s Dubai affiliate, Binance FZE, managed to score an Operational Minimum Viable Product license from the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA).</p>
<p>Binance has now become the first crypto trading platform to receive Dubai&#8217;s Operational MVP license enabling it to offer services such as exchange and broker-dealer services. The company is permitted to serve only institutional and qualified retail investors for now.</p>
<h2>Binance&#8217;s Dubai Expansion</h2>
<p>Eligible users in Dubai will be allowed to access authorized services such as converting digital assets to fiat under VARA-designated standards compliant with Intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force (FATF).</p>
<p>In an official <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-is-the-first-virtual-asset-exchange-to-receive-an-operational-mvp-license-in-dubai-7342057061995039467" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">statement</a>, Binance&#8217;s Head of Regional Markets, Richard Teng, said the priority is to operate this first fully regulated exchange in and from the city in an ecosystem that&#8217;s compliant with the FATF while focussing on global scalability.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are honored to be the first exchange to be granted an operational Minimum Viable Product License by VARA &#8211; a result of over a year of due diligence, collaboration, and consistent demonstration of responsible intent &#8211; that now allows us to be able to leverage the potential of a progressive regulatory framework, enabling innovation while furthering user protection.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The latest development comes after Binance <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-awarded-limited-crypto-asset-license-in-dubai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">obtained</a> a provisional MVP license in March 2022, followed by a preparatory MVP <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-secures-another-crypto-license-in-dubai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">license</a> five months later.</p>
<p>Binance has so far completed three out of four stages of Dubai&#8217;s licensing procedure.</p>
<p>The fourth phase involves obtaining Full Market Product (FMP) license, until which the virtual asset service provider is not permitted to cater services to mass retail investors.</p>
<h2>Crypto Hotbed: Dubai</h2>
<p>In recent years, Dubai has emerged as a hotbed for crypto activity owing to the emirate&#8217;s strategic policies. The establishment of VARA was a major turning point for the region, which has, so far, proved instrumental in providing clarity to several crypto firms distressed by the US&#8217;s approach to regulating the industry.</p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/dubai-forbids-operations-with-monero-zcash-and-other-privacy-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">prohibiting</a> involvement with privacy-centric coins under the new regulatory regime, the city has opened arms to several crypto exchanges, including OKX, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bybit-scores-preparatory-license-by-dubais-virtual-assets-regulatory-authority/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bybit</a>, and more.</p>
<p>A recent study published by Recap <a href="https://recap.io/blog/the-rise-of-crypto-hubs-which-cities-are-leading-the-way-in-cryptocurrency" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">revealed</a> that Dubai hosts nearly 800 crypto-based companies as of January 2023 for residents to choose from when it comes to finding a career in the sector. Its 0% tax regime also makes it a favorable venue for crypto investors.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Tether enjoyed another quarter of immense profit, most of which is being used to reinforce its stablecoin reserves.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, released an assurance report on Monday covering its financials as of June 30.</p>
<p>The Q2 attestation showed that the issuer now holds over $3.3 billion in excess reserves to back its USDT tokens.</p>
<h2>Tether’s Massive Surplus</h2>
<p>As explained by Tether in an accompanying <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-excess-reserves-increase-by-850m-to-reach-3-3b-as-leading-stablecoin-reveals-72-5b-overall-exposure-in-us-t-bills-and-unveils-energy-related-investments/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">blog post</a>, the issuer’s excess reserves stem from the profits generated by its existing reserves. These profits are not distributed to shareholders and are instead solely used as insurance to back its tokens.</p>
<p>USDT is designed to maintain parity with the U.S. dollar and is always convertible 1:1 for dollars within the company’s reserves.</p>
<p>“Tether is again demonstrating its commitment to transparency by disclosing its direct, indirect exposure (via Money Market Funds) to US Treasury bills as well as the Treasuries collateralizing the Overnight Repo,” the company stated. “By aggregating them together, the amount of Treasuries backing Tether’s stablecoins is about $72.5B.”</p>
<p>Tether generated $1.5 billion in net profit in Q1, followed by over $1 billion between April and June. From its Q2 profit, $115 million was spent on share buybacks, while the remainder went toward the company’s excess reserves.</p>
<p>Tether’s consolidated total assets amounted to $86.5 billion as of June 30, versus $83.2 billion in liabilities, of which $83.17 billion “relate to digital tokens issued.” This leaves Tether with a near 4% surplus, combatting previous criticisms that the firm’s reserves once drew dangerously close to leaving it insolvent.</p>
<p>According to Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino, Tether wants its reliable reserves to act as a <a href="https://twitter.com/paoloardoino/status/1685993811774738432" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">“counterbalance”</a> to recent bank failures, caused by fractional reserve lending and duration mismatches.</p>
<h2>Any Bitcoin?</h2>
<p>In Q1, Tether <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/tether-generated-1-5b-in-profits-in-q1-2023-holds-2-bitcoin-in-total-reserves/" data-wpel-link="internal">disclosed</a> that 2% of its reserves were being held in Bitcoin (BTC), breaking a prior trend of stablecoin issuers only profiting through U.S. government debt.</p>
<p>Alongside Tether, rival company Circle – the issuer of USDC) – only generates profit using government debt, with the remainder of its reserves being in cash.</p>
<p>Tether’s latest report stated that 85% of its assets are in “cash and cash equivalents,” leaving its reserves “extremely liquid.”</p>
<p>While not providing updates on the company’s Bitcoin allocation, Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino clarified that a relatively small portion of Tether’s profits are <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/tether-joins-1-billion-bitcoin-mining-initiative-in-el-salvador/" data-wpel-link="internal">invested</a> in the Bitcoin mining industry.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[There are still tens of thousands of ETH left to claim for old registrants of Ethereum domain names.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An early user of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) just reclaimed tens of thousands of Ether (ETH) that he’d locked up in the old ENS registrar over 4 years ago.</p>
<p>Having appreciated substantially since that time, the value of those 39,712 ETH is now worth roughly $74 million.</p>
<h2>Reclaiming Old Funds</h2>
<p>According to blockchain analysts at <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1685935783612764160" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Lookonchain</a>, darkmarket.eth was responsible for reclaiming the funds – the largest owner of locked Ether within the old registrar until now.</p>
<p>After reclaiming his funds, the user sent 63,734 ETH ($119 million) to a new wallet.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">After 2.7 years of dormancy, darkmarket.eth reclaimed 39,712 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">$ETH</a> ($74.17M) locked in the ENS auction just now.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-ens-ethereum-name-service/" data-wpel-link="internal">ENS</a> allows crypto users to assign human-readable names to cryptocurrency addresses, which are otherwise presented as long and complex strings of letters and numbers.</p>
<p>When first launched in 2017, the Ethereum Foundation held an auction in which users could bid their ETH to secure these unique domain names for themselves. This was to incentivize claimants not to immediately try selling their domains for exorbitant prices after claiming them, and instead demonstrate a commitment to the domain they had bought.</p>
<p>That ETH was locked within the original ENS smart contract and would remain that way until users either gave up their domains or the contract itself was updated.</p>
<h2>The Old ENS Treasure Trove</h2>
<p>The latter occurred in July 2019, allowing users to reclaim their locked ETH without forfeiting their domain. Under the new system, users were only required to pay a small yearly fee to keep their names.</p>
<p>Yet after the upgrade, many of the old registrants had still not claimed their former funds. According to lead ENS developer <a href="https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson/status/1685958239278575616" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Nick Johnson</a>, there are still over 100k domains for which deeds remain unclaimed, holding “tens of thousands of ETH.”</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Basically, they bid on (and won) a bunch of names back in ~2016/2017, and when we switched to the new system in 2019, they never released the deeds to claim their locked funds back,&#8221; ENS lead developer Nick Johnson told The Block.</p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[Kiyosaki believes the stock market is rising because of the removal of the U.S. debt ceiling.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert Kiyosaki, an American businessman and author of the best-selling book Rich Dad, Poor Dad, believes the United States is broke as the country&#8217;s debt keeps increasing, countering claims that the world&#8217;s largest economy is strong.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1685824108087623680" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">tweet</a>, Kiyosaki called the media agency Wall Street Journal (WSJ) &#8220;numb nuts&#8221; because it failed to decipher whether the stock market was up due to President Joe Biden raising America&#8217;s debt ceiling.</p>
<h2>America is Broke: Kiyosaki</h2>
<p>Kiyosaki&#8217;s comments were in response to a recent <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/us-gdp-report-economic-growth-92482437" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a> by WSJ, which claimed that the U.S. was steering clear of recession due to several factors, including a 2.4% economic growth in Q2 and a similar increase in the country&#8217;s gross domestic product, significantly faster than experts&#8217; predictions.</p>
<p>With a decline in customer spending, the records defied expectations of a downturn starting in the middle of the year due to higher interest rates. WSJ stated that a more robust labor market would add to the prospect of &#8220;a soft landing,&#8221; where inflation falls close to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s 2% target without a recession.</p>
<p>However, Kiyosaki thinks the opposite. As <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/this-is-why-robert-kiyosaki-sticks-with-real-assets-like-bitcoin-and-gold/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> earlier this month, he believes the stock market is rising because of the U.S. debt ceiling removal.</p>
<p>Recall that in June, Biden signed a bill suspending the U.S. government&#8217;s $31.4 trillion <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-rallies-4-on-us-debt-limit-suspension-deal/" data-wpel-link="internal">debt ceiling</a> till January 2025, avoiding the nation&#8217;s first-ever default. The suspension calmed the economic crisis that threatened to disrupt financial markets and trigger a recession. Since then, large U.S. stock market indexes like the S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq have recorded notable gains, sparking claims of a stronger economy.</p>
<p>The renowned author said the national debt is rising alongside the financial market; hence, WSJ&#8217;s claims that America&#8217;s economy is strong are wrong because the country is broke.</p>
<h2>Kiyosaki Prefers Bitcoin, Gold, and Silver</h2>
<p>While America&#8217;s economy dwindles, Kiyosaki reiterated his support and preference for bitcoin (BTC), gold, and silver, which he frequently refers to as real assets and real money. He <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-will-explode-to-120k-in-2024-the-us-dollar-will-die-rober-kiyosaki/" data-wpel-link="internal">believes</a> the U.S. dollar will die while the largest cryptocurrency and precious metals will thrive and act as protection measures.</p>
<p>As a BTC proponent, the Rich Dad, Poor Dad author believes the asset could soar to $120,000 in 2024 and hit $500,000 by 2025.</p>

<p>The estimated loss of the attack was initially set at over $40 million, whereas in the following hours, that number might have <a href="https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1685789453556846592?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">risen</a> to approximately $70 million.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Expectedly, the USD valuation of Curve DAO (CRV) &#8211; the utility token of the DeFi protocol &#8211; headed south as a consequence of the event. It currently trades at around $0.64 (per GoinGeko&#8217;s data), or 12% less than yesterday&#8217;s figure.<br />
