<p><strong>Key Points: </strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>More than 1 million FTX customers have organized class action lawsuits for access to their assets.</em></li>



<li><em>The client group also wants the court to specifically determine that the property held at Alameda that the customer can trace is not Alameda&#8217;s property.</em></li>



<li><em>The lawsuit is the latest legal attempt to bring a claim against FTX&#8217;s dwindling assets.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>On December 28, FTX customers filed a class-action lawsuit against crypto exchange FTX and its former executives (including SBF), asking the court to declare that the assets digital assets held by the company belong to the customer, according to<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N33I00C" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Reuters</a>.</strong></h5>

<p><strong>The lawsuit seeks to represent more than 1 million FTX customers in the United States and abroad</strong>. The lawsuit asks the court to declare that funds are held in FTX US accounts for US customers, funds are held in FTX Trading accounts for non-US customers, or <strong>other traceable customer assets are not the property of FTX.</strong></p>



<p>According to the complaint filed with the Delaware Bankruptcy Court, the customer also <strong>wants the court to clearly establish that the property held in Alameda that is traceable to the customer is not Alameda&#8217;s property</strong>. If the court determines that it is the property of FTX, then <strong>the customer will ask for a ruling that they have priority over other creditors.</strong></p>

<p>If the court determines that it is the property of FTX, then the customer will ask for a judgment that they have priority over other creditors.</p>



<p>The lawsuit is the latest legal attempt to claim the dwindling <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156032-sbf-borrow-546m-alameda-buy-robinhood-share/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assets of FTX</a>, which has been up against liquidators in the Bahamas and Antigua and the bankrupt assets of another failed crypto firm, Blockfi, the report said.</p>

<p>Previously, FTX committed to segregation of customer accounts and instead allowed them to be misappropriated and as a result, customers must be reimbursed first, according to a lawsuit filed with the Delaware Bankruptcy Court in the United States.</p>

<p>ProtonMail, which also provides a number of other services, <strong>holds Bitcoin and has done so for at least five years</strong>. After a long period of sporadic integration, <strong>Proton formally started taking Bitcoin payments in 2017</strong>. The business acknowledged in 2019 that it had been keeping Bitcoin that had been sent to them by clients.</p>



<p>Yen said today that Proton has always kept some of its reserves in Bitcoin, but added that <strong>this is not a guarantee. </strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">There’s an internal debate: I don’t have the answer to that yet. I’m not sure if we continue to hold Bitcoin or not hold Bitcoin.</p>
<cite>Yen stated</cite></blockquote>



<p>Yen also discussed his thoughts on Bitcoin. <strong>He expressed a sense of concern about fraud, scams, and passing fads like the current NFT bubble and 2017&#8217;s ICO craze.</strong> He further said that cyclical, short-term interest in cryptocurrency causes recurring market surges and collapses that &#8220;lay waste&#8221; the crypto industry every three to four years.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">People are not going to have faith and confidence and trust in an asset class if it is frequently having 80% crash cycles. We need the crash cycles to be less and less severe over time and that’s just not happening.</p>
<cite>Yen said during the interview</cite></blockquote>



<p>To address the issue, Yen advocated for greater moderation and self-regulation within the crypto sector. He also emphasized his hostility to <strong>legislative regulation</strong>.</p>



<p>Yen&#8217;s reservations about Bitcoin as a holding asset <strong>do not imply that the firm would cease accepting Bitcoin transactions</strong>. Proton presently takes Bitcoin as payment for its services, and according to a Forbes story <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerhuang/2022/12/27/andy-yen-ceo-of-proton-on-the-tech-giants-that-dominate-the-internet-the-webs-future-and-bitcoin/?sh=75c7b0cb4075" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerhuang/2022/12/27/andy-yen-ceo-of-proton-on-the-tech-giants-that-dominate-the-internet-the-webs-future-and-bitcoin/?sh=75c7b0cb4075" rel="noreferrer noopener">published </a>today, <strong>the firm is in the process of integrating Lightning Network payments.</strong><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/author/mike-dalton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>

<h5><strong>According to a <a href="https://blog.midas.investments/midas-closure-reasons-and-pivot-to-cedefi/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://blog.midas.investments/midas-closure-reasons-and-pivot-to-cedefi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog </a>post on December 27 by CEO and founder Iakov &#8220;Trevor&#8221; Levin, Midas Investments, an investment business focusing on DeFi yields, is closing down its platform following huge losses in 2022.</strong></h5>

<p>Levin stated that the <strong>Midas DeFi portfolio lost $50 million, or 20% of its $250 million in assets under management (AUM)</strong> and that after the collapse of Celsius and FTX, its platform had over 60% of AUM removed.</p>



<p>In particular, Levin shared the situation that over the past eight months, the Midas team has been focused on identifying and capitalizing on opportunities to balance their assets and liabilities including launching CeDeFi strategies. However,<strong> the extensive withdrawals due to the insolvency of Celcius and FTX, coupled with reduced yield opportunities on the market, made it impossible for the firm to cover daily payouts to users due to the assets deficit.</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Based on this situation and current CeFi market conditions, we have reached the difficult decision to close the platform.</p>
<cite>Levin wrote</cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Only Midas C-level employees were aware of the asset deficit</strong>. The community team, marketing team, support team, IT team, and platform team were not aware of this issue.</p>

<p>According to Levin, <strong>the business will now focus on a new project that aligns with its goal for centralized decentralized finance (CeDeFi)</strong>, in which the project will be fully transparent, on-chain, and built with the goal of offering a new and improved investment experience. </p>



<p>Beginning on Tuesday, <strong>Midas disabled deposits, swaps, and withdrawals</strong> for a period of time as it made precautions and balance adjustments. <strong>It aims to remove 55% of user balances in bitcoin, ether, and stablecoins</strong>, with the difference paid for in MIDAS tokens, which may be exchanged for tokens in its new project.</p>

<p>On October 13, Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/133218-mango-markets-attacker-identity-revealed/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/133218-mango-markets-attacker-identity-revealed/" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported </a><strong>an investigative article about the $114 million hack from the Defi Mango Markets platform built on Solana is being shared widely, revealing the identity of the alleged perpetrator of the hack named Avraham Eisenberg</strong></p>



<p>Since the Mango Markets attacker’s portrait was <a href="https://news.coincu.com/134037-mango-markets-hacker-revealed-action-legal/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/134037-mango-markets-hacker-revealed-action-legal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a>, <strong> Avraham Eisenberg, after which he called the exploit a “profitable trading strategy” and said his actions were legal</strong>. He has returned the funds, in accordance with the governance vote.</p>



<p>A week after the hacker was revealed, <strong>DeFi platform Mango <a href="https://news.coincu.com/135514-mango-v3-compensation-redemption/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/135514-mango-v3-compensation-redemption/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued </a>a document stating that the Mango v3 compensation and redemption website has been launched</strong>. Affected users can claim compensation based on the calculation results of the previously approved DAO proposal.</p>



<p>On December 27, <strong>the exploiter Avraham Eisenberg (Avi) was arrested in Puerto Rico </strong>and charged with market manipulation offenses.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>According to the lawsuit,<strong> Eisenberg was accused of commodities fraud and commodities manipulation.</strong></p>



<p>Overall, Eisenberg oversaw a team that exploited Mango Markets in October for<strong> $114 million by inflating the value of MNGO</strong>, the exchange&#8217;s native cryptocurrency. By taking a sizable position in MNGO and <strong>driving up its price by 1,300%</strong>, Eisenberg was able to use the same platform to borrow additional tokens with bigger market caps and more stable values without having to pay them back.</p>

<p><strong>Since the value of MNGO dropped, Eisenberg no longer had enough value to satisfy the debts</strong> he had incurred in those other tokens. At the time, he identified himself as the user responsible for the enormous price increase in MNGO, claiming that he was &#8220;sing the protocol as designed, even if the development team did not fully anticipate all the consequences of setting parameters the way they are.&#8221; Following that, <strong>Mango users voted to let him keep $47 million of his bounty while returning the remaining $67 million.</strong></p>



<p>Despite the aforementioned fact, there has been no indication of whether the rest of his team faces criminal prosecution.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points: </strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>56 million Robinhood shares, which might be worth more than $440 million, are being in a race to claim including Crypto lender BlockFi, FTX Group, and Sam Bankman-Fried.</em></li>



<li><em>Bankman-Fried and FTX co-founder Gary Wang borrowed over $546 million from Alameda via promissory notes to capitalize Emergent Fidelity Technologies Ltd. that in May bought a&nbsp;7.6% stake in Robinhood.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>According to court <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njb.1094107/gov.uscourts.njb.1094107.19.7.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njb.1094107/gov.uscourts.njb.1094107.19.7.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">documents</a>, former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) borrowed hundreds of millions of dollars from Alameda Research to purchase Robinhood shares (HOOD).</strong></h5>

<p>According to the details from the affidavit provided to a Caribbean court, <strong>Bankman-Fried stated that he and FTX co-founder Gary Wang borrowed $546 million from Alameda using promissory notes in April and May</strong>. They used that money to fund <strong>Emergent Fidelity Technologies Ltd</strong>., the shell business that purchased a <strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/88513-robinhood-shares-spike-30/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/88513-robinhood-shares-spike-30/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7.6% share</a> in Robinhood</strong> in May.</p>



<p>The affidavit throws a fresh twist on a fight for the <strong>56 million Robinhood shares</strong>. BlockFi, the lender that avoided bankruptcy earlier this year while FTX was in good financial standing, FTX Group, and Bankman-Fried himself have all tried to claim the shares, <strong>which might be worth more than $440 million.</strong></p>

<p>It should be made known that since the bankruptcy began on November 11, FTX’s bankruptcy asset managers asked ED&amp;F Man Capital Markets to freeze the 56 million brokerage shares owned by Emergent Fidelity Technologies.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/147201-blockfi-sue-sbf-after-filing-for-bankruptcy/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/147201-blockfi-sue-sbf-after-filing-for-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported </a>on November 29, <strong>Sam Bankman-Fried has been sued by BlockFi over his ownership of Robinhood</strong>. The statement was released right after BlockFi filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, in which&nbsp;<strong>BlockFi’s complaint seeks Robinhood’s shares because SBF allegedly maintained them as collateral.</strong></p>



<p>BlockFi has filed for bankruptcy, claiming in a court statement that it was entitled to the rights to the Robinhood shares as a result of an agreement signed by Bankman-Fried in early November. According to the filing on Tuesday, <strong>the shares were pledged as security against a loan taken out by Alameda Research</strong>, the same entity whose funds were used to acquire the shares in the first place.</p>

<p>This tactical choice demonstrates TradeDog Group&#8217;s dedication to Web3 technology and blockchain-based applications. It creates a pathway for supporting <strong>Web3</strong> activities with the goal of improving and expanding the reach of web-based services powered by blockchain.</p>



<p>A portion of <strong>TD</strong> <strong>VC</strong>, a multi-strategy fund, is devoted to the flagship strategy of <strong>&#8220;special situations investment.&#8221;</strong> By doing this, <strong>TD</strong> <strong>VC</strong> will give cryptocurrency businesses customized financial infusions based on the needs of the token.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We aim to be a catalyst for innovation and believe our funding models will empower creators and disruptors in the Web3 space to revolutionize the existing multi-layered blockchain ecosystem.”</p>

<p>The CEO apologized to the users who were impacted by the situation. Furthermore, he states that<a href="https://news.coincu.com/155725-bitkeep-exploiter-entice-phishing-website/"> BitKeep </a>has<strong> frozen a portion of the amount of hackers</strong>, and that the rest of the users&#8217; lost work are being retrieved. Hackers hijacked and replaced the <strong>APK 7.2.9 installation package</strong>, therefore some users installed the application package that had been implanted by hackers, resulting in the exposure of private keys.</p>



<p>Since the theft in the <strong>early hours of yesterday</strong>, the team has aggressively <strong>investigated countermeasures</strong> and made several efforts, such as swiftly <strong>contacting the security team</strong>, <strong>SlowMist</strong>, and other partners to monitor the funds, and doing everything possible to lock and<strong> freeze the stolen cash of users</strong>. The site, on the other hand, aggressively gathers information regarding user asset theft, tracing the source of the stolen currency process and timing, and gathering all evidence that hackers hacked<strong> version 729 using different software</strong>. The team will continue to update the public on its progress via Twitter.</p>

<p>The BitKeep team is currently<strong> highly steady</strong>, and he and other core members will go to great lengths to recover user assets. Following that, they will thoroughly<strong> remodel and modernize</strong> the technical solutions, putting security at the forefront of our entire operation. Users who lose coins should not be concerned, the team will provide <strong>a satisfactory explanation</strong>.</p>



<p>The CEO emphasized unequivocally that the team&#8217;s <strong>commitment to do a good job</strong> will not waver, and that the team&#8217;s aim to make <strong>BitKeep the highest quality and safest wallet</strong> will not change. Nothing will alter the goal of making BitKeep users the most secure crypto users.</p>



<p>The site is currently under attack by hackers, with a loss of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/155628-oklink-bitkeep-hack-total-loss/"><strong>$31 million</strong></a>.</p>

<p>The Meteora Plan&#8217;s three-pronged strategy of launching a new technical platform, a new <strong>Meteora</strong> token, and a redesigned <strong>Meteora</strong> <strong>brand</strong> seeks to accomplish this.</p>



<p>Additionally, the team is introducing <strong>Meteora&#8217;s dynamic vaults</strong> and <strong>AMMs</strong>. While keeping customer funds accessible and aggregating and optimizing yield every minute, these vaults make funds by charging performance fees.</p>

<p><strong>MER</strong> will also transition to a new <strong>Meteora</strong> <strong>token</strong>. There will be <strong>100 million Meteora tokens</strong>, of which<strong> 20% will be fully liquid and in circulation</strong>, and <strong>80% will be managed by the DAO</strong>. Up until the DAO gives its approval, neither the circulating supply nor emissions will increase.</p>
