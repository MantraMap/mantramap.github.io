			  <description><![CDATA[<p>NFT art gallery Bright Moments held its live minting event at the Gotham store, one of New York City's "luxury" cannabis dispensaries.&nbsp;</p>
Where Art Is Born
<p>Bright Moments is a digital art gallery which started as a group of volunteers in Venice Beach, California, and is now promoting its generative art experiences all over the world. The company is currently on their ten city tour around the world with the aim to mint 10k NFTs of their CryptoCitizens collection in different parts of the planet. Bright Moments has already held their live IRL minting events in Berlin, London, Mexico City, Tokyo, among other cities on the list. &ldquo;Where Art Is Born&rdquo; is the slogan of the DAO.</p>
Premium Cannabis and Digital Art at New York&rsquo;s Gotham
<p>Last year, the state of New York legalized the sale of cannabis for recreational use. Gotham is considered one of the first and most luxury cannabis dispensaries open in New York City. Apart from marijuana, the store sells lifestyle products in the areas of beauty and fashion. Gotham&rsquo;s mezzanine space is used for hosting events including karaoke nights, LGBTQ pride parties, and the live NFT minting events.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, July 25, Bright Moments&rsquo; artist-in-residence, Jimena Buena Vida, showcased pieces of her Ethereum project called &ldquo;Epiphanies&rdquo; in the form of generative art experience at Gotham. The attendees had the opportunity to both claim NFTs and purchase some of the store&rsquo;s high-end goods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gotham&rsquo;s Chief Creative Officer Billy Richards commented on the collaboration, &ldquo;We align with the idea of bringing different experiences, art forms, and people together. Both our teams are constantly on the forefront of new ideas and ways to engage our consumers.&rdquo;</p>

What Do Crypto and Cannabis Have in Common?&nbsp;
<p>Unfortunately, the Bright Moments exhibit in New York drew only less than a dozen guests. One of the attendees, Omkar Lewis, suggested that people now have less interest in purchasing NFTs due to high interest rates. Besides, he also mentioned that NFTs are highly criticized and not socially acceptable yet, just like cannabis was some years ago. Lewis then drew comparison between the two:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They're both on the edge of something that wasn't culturally accepted,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;NFTs are not quite socially acceptable yet, but in 20 years they will be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the second time Bright Moments held their physical art minting event at Gotham. An artist and software engineer called Ngozi also presented their 'Dream Logic' NFT collection at the NYC dispensary last month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies in California and Canada have already attempted to use the blockchain technology to track growth of the medicinal plants. Some artists have also created cannabis-themed NFT collections. One of the latest examples is Crypto Cannabis Club.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) are two of the biggest losers in crypto markets right now. Both are dropping by double digits in a matter of days. However, Tradecurve (TCRV) is one of the few coins bucking the trend. They are also setting new highs during a presale event. Let's jump into why these three coins are behaving so differently in the market.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Tradecurve (TCRV): Surging to New Highs Amidst Market Turmoil
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) is a groundbreaking trading platform that successfully combines the best features of both centralized and decentralized exchanges. Here, users can conveniently trade an array of assets &mdash; such as cryptocurrencies, stocks, forex, and commodities &mdash; all within a single account.</p>
<p>Commencing trading on Tradecurve is simple: create an account using an email address, select a cryptocurrency for a deposit, and then leverage your crypto balance to trade across the various asset classes. There are ZERO KYC or AML requirements, giving you complete privacy and anonymity when trading.</p>
<p>TCRV is the proprietary token of the Tradecurve platform. Owners of this cryptocurrency gain access to multiple benefits, including reduced fees, earning passive income through liquidity provision, and discounted fees on AI tools.</p>
<p>Presently, TCRV can be bought at a discounted price of $0.025 during the fourth stage of the platform's presale. Analysts recognize that Tradecurve brings an innovative product to a trillion-dollar industry, and it's no surprise that investors are rushing to get their hands on TCRV before the presale ends.</p>
Litecoin (LTC): Analyzing the Factors Behind its Recent Dumping
<p>Litecoin (LTC), launched in 2011, is one of the earliest and most recognized cryptocurrencies, often referred to as the "light" version of Bitcoin. It has a proven track record, with its value exceeding $400 twice, in 2017 and 2021.</p>
<p>Litecoin has had a strong Q2 2023, with prices recently pumping from $69 to over $114 in just two weeks. This Litecoin price surge was triggered by the upcoming halving event that traditionally causes a surge in demand and higher prices.</p>
<p>However, despite its excellent performance over Q2 2023, Litecoin has recently experienced some selling pressure and fallen back below the $100 support/resistance zone. Litecoin traders were perplexed by this as it was not in line with previous trends.</p>
<p>It seems that the market impact of Litecoin has not been as strongly felt around the world. It was not felt as it had been in previous years. Analysts are commentating that the bullish narrative around this event is now over. Also, Litecoin holders may be looking to move their funds into alternatives. This is with the Litecoin halving less than one month away,</p>
Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Understanding the Reasons for its Price Decline
<p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is another popular cryptocurrency and was created as a hard fork of Bitcoin in 2017. It has had some impressive performance over Q2 2023, recently pumping by over 200% from $104 to $328 in just 10 days.</p>
<p>This Bitcoin Cash pump seemed to come from nowhere. This is as Bitcoin Cash has been moving within a tight range since early 2022. Analysts note that Bitcoin Cash broke out of Descending Triangle pattern. This happened on the daily chart and this created a strong buying signal.</p>
<p>But the real bullish trigger for Bitcoin Cash was the listing of Bitcoin Cash EDX Markets &mdash; a new crypto exchange backed by Wall Street. However, Bitcoin Cash has recently fallen back below its $300 support/resistance zone and is currently trading at just $273.</p>
<p>Traders are still cautious about holding Bitcoin Cash in the long term given its volatile history. So it is likely that some holders are taking their profits and shifting to more reliable options, like Tradecurve.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance officially withdrew its application for a crypto license in Germany after regulators denied the exchange&rsquo;s application in June. </p>
<p>Crypto exchange Binance confirmed it has &ldquo;proactively withdrawn&rdquo; its application for a crypto license in Germany.</p>
German Regulators Deny Binance&rsquo;s Application
<p>Reports indicate that Binance officially withdrew its BaFin application. Reuters cites a spokesperson for the exchange who said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Binance confirms it has proactively withdrawn its BaFin (Germany&rsquo;s financial regulator) application. The situation, both in the global market and regulation, has changed significantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adding,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Binance still intends to apply for appropriate licensing in Germany, but it is essential that our submission accurately reflects these changes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crypto news website CoinDesk first reported Binance&rsquo;s application withdrawal.</p>
<p>German-based Finance Fwd website reported last month that Germany&rsquo;s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) either officially denied Binance crypto custody licence application or verbally informed the exchange of its decision. A spokesperson for the exchange said at the time:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if we cannot share details of our discussions with the regulators, we will continue to work to meet Bafin&rsquo;s requirements. It is an ongoing process.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adding,</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are confident that we have the right team and the appropriate measures to continue our discussions with the regulatory authorities in Germany.&rdquo;</p>

Regulatory Pressure Catches Up
<p>Binance has been met with regulatory challenges after the US SEC sued the exchange and its CEO, Changpeng &lsquo;CZ&rsquo; Zhao, alleging it violated US securities laws and operated a &ldquo;web of deception.&rdquo; The exchange and its CEO vehemently deny the SEC allegations.</p>
<p>The exchange is facing further difficulties as it exits the Netherlands after failing to meet the requirements to obtain a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license.</p>
<p>Binance is also under investigation by French financial regulators and has been since 2022. The investigation reported centres around &ldquo;acts of illegal exercise of the function of service provider on digital assets (PSAN), and acts of aggravated money laundering.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Reports by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reveal venture capital giants Sequoia Capital reduced its crypto fund by over 65%. </p>
<p>Venture capital firm, Sequoia Capital, has cut its cryptocurrency fund by over 65% from $585 million to $200 million, the WSJ reports citing persons familiar with the matter.</p>
Sequoia Capital Downsizes Two Funds
<p>According to the WSJ, which cites persons familiar with the matter, the venture capital firm reduced the size of two of its funds, including its Sequoia Crypto Fund. The Silicon Valley-based tech-focused venture capital firm informed investors it would reduce its crypto and ecosystem fund.</p>
<p>According to the firm, the adjustments reflect a changed market, with the crypto fund now more focused on investing in newer startups after the market slump reduced its chances to invest in larger projects. The VC firm had invested a sizeable $150 million in the now-collapsed FTX exchange.</p>
<p>The WSJ report indicates the Sequoia Crypto Fund has been reduced from $585 million to $200 million.</p>
<p>The WSJ also reports Sequoia&rsquo;s ecosystem fund was reduced from $900 million to $450 million. The firm&rsquo;s ecosystem fund, reduced by 50%, invests in other smaller venture funds and solo investors.</p>
<p>A further report by the Financial Times (FT) states Sequoia returned over &ldquo;$15 billion to its investors over the past three years.&rdquo; According to the FT, the firm said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We made these changes to sharpen our focus on seed-stage opportunities and to provide liquidity to our limited partners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sequoia first announced its crypto fund in February 2022 and said it was looking to raise around a $500-600 million crypto fund which invests exclusively in the crypto space.</p>
<p>Sequoia Capital India was also the majority investor in a Polygon funding round which saw the Ethereum scaling platform raise a total of $450 million.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency exchange, Crypto.com announced today that it had been approved for registration with the Dutch central bank.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We're excited to share that https://t.co/vCNztATSCO has been approved for registration in the Netherlands🇳🇱 as a provider of crypto services.

<p>

</p>
Crypto.com Expands European Reach
<p>The exchange&rsquo;s registration comes after a &ldquo;comprehensive review&rdquo; of its business and compliance under the Netherlands&rsquo; Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Prevention) Act, also known as Wwft.</p>
<p>According to its public register, the Dutch central bank has approved 36 crypto exchanges to offer their services in the country.</p>
<p>Kris Marszalek, Crypto.com&rsquo;s CEO, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Collaborating with regulators to responsibly advance the crypto and blockchain industry is of paramount importance to Crypto.com.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adding,</p>

<p>&ldquo;This registration approval from De Nederlandsche Bank is a significant milestone for our business and the latest testament to our commitment to compliance. We look forward to continuing to work with DNB and other regulators around the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crypto.com&rsquo;s most recent registration furthers its regulatory approval momentum. The exchange received registration as a Virtual Asset Services Provider (VASP) from the Bank of Spain. VASP registration allows the exchange to offer its products and services to customers in Spain.</p>
<p>The exchange has been authorised to offer its services in several other regions, including Singapore- its home base, France, the United Kingdom, Dubai, South Korea, Australia, Italy, and Greece, among others.</p>
<p>Following the fallout from the SEC&rsquo;s regulatory enforcement against Binance and Coinbase, Crypto.com decided to shut down its institutional exchange services for its US customers.</p>
Binance Exits The Dutch Market
<p>Crypto.com&rsquo;s registration in the Netherlands comes soon after its rival exchange, Binance, left the Netherlands after failing to secure registration.</p>
<p>The exchange announced it was leaving the Dutch market immediately and said it would no longer accept new users from the Netherlands after July 17.</p>
<p>Binance said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Existing Dutch resident users are being sent an email with comprehensive information about what this means for their accounts and any assets they currently have on the Binance platform, alongside any steps they will need to take.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) was confined to a relatively tight range early in the Asian session as the pair ceded gains after reaching the 29320.14 level, representing another test of the upside price objective related to buying pressure around the 28850 and 28981.16 levels.&nbsp; Traders are monitoring the recent depreciating range from 31862.21 to 28850 with upside retracement levels around the 30000, 30356, 30711, 31151, and 31217 areas.&nbsp; Stops were recently elected above the 29462.90 area, an upside price objective associated with buying pressure around the 28850 and 28981 levels. &nbsp;&nbsp;Above the market, upside price objectives include the 30526, 30611, 30762, and 31145 areas.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to other levels of buying pressure include the 32125 and 33569 areas, and Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 32043, 34531, 34658, and 35912 areas.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In a letter addressed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Grayscale Investments has appealed for the equal treatment of all spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).&nbsp;</p>
Call For Equal Treatment
<p>Joseph A. Hall from the law firm Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell, representing Grayscale Investments, has penned a letter directly addressing the SEC Secretary Vanessa Countryman. In the letter, Mr. Hall, who is acting as spokesperson for the investment firm, has expressed concerns about the SEC's differential treatment towards commodity-based exchange-traded products (ETPs) that hold Bitcoin while requesting the regulatory body to reconsider its stance on spot Bitcoin ETPs.</p>
<p>In June 2022, the SEC disapproved a proposed rule change by NYSE Arca to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Grayscale has since sought a review of the SEC's decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</p>
Call For Investor Protection
<p>Grayscale had discussed the viability of surveillance-sharing agreements with the SEC in 2019. The company contends that the SEC already possesses the means to approve spot Bitcoin ETPs based on its previously articulated standard.</p>
<p>(Spot Bitcoin ETPs and Bitcoin futures ETPs are the two categories of commodity-based ETPs designed to hold Bitcoin. The former holds actual Bitcoin, while the latter involves Bitcoin futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.)</p>
<p>Although the SEC has approved Rule 19b-4 filings for Bitcoin futures ETPs, it has not done the same for spot Bitcoin ETPs. The former is attributed to their surveillance-sharing agreements with the CME.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An excerpt from the letter reads,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An approval that promotes investor protection and fairness for issuers should therefore be made simultaneously with approval of all proposed spot bitcoin ETPs, including those such as the Trust whose Rule 19b-4 filings were previously disapproved after lengthy Commission consideration,&rdquo;</p>

Grayscale-SEC Legal Saga
<p>Grayscale argues that approving only specific spot Bitcoin ETP proposals would grant an unfair first-mover advantage and implies discriminatory treatment. The investment firm insists that the approval process should prioritize the interests of all investors and simultaneously approve all proposed spot Bitcoin ETPs.</p>
<p>With over $18 billion in assets, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) provides investors with exposure to the original cryptocurrency. However, the firm has encountered multiple rejections from the SEC regarding its efforts to transform its flagship Bitcoin fund into a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>A spot Bitcoin ETF is highly anticipated within the crypto community as it would allow institutions to gain Bitcoin exposure without the need to actually possess the digital asset. Such an ETF is considered a significant milestone in the path toward widespread Bitcoin adoption and would validate cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bitget, top crypto derivatives and copy trading platform, is delighted to announce the listing of its native token BGB on the renowned cryptocurrency exchange MEXC. This strategic move is expected to further boost liquidity, accessibility, and the overall value and utility of the BGB token. Traders can now engage in seamless BGB/USDT trading on MEXC, accessing a broader range of opportunities and privileges.</p>
<p>With a circulating supply of 1,400,000,000 BGB and a total supply of 2,000,000,000, BGB plays a pivotal role in Bitget's ecosystem. The token offers users exclusive privileges and a variety of rights on the Bitget exchange, encompassing fee discounts, access to high-quality tokens through Launchpad and Launchpool participation, the ability to Super Airdrop, and much more.</p>
<p>The decision to list BGB on MEXC came along with the surging demand for the token in the market, where it has already amassed over 300,000 holders and achieved a total trading volume of more than two billion USD since the beginning of the year.&nbsp; BGB experienced significant price growth, reaching an all-time high of over 0.51 USDT in February and was the best-performing exchange token in H1 2023, outpacing BTC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This remarkable surge in BGB&rsquo;s value can be attributed to Bitget&rsquo;s successful and steady growth. With a rising share in both the spot and derivatives trading markets and a reputation for high financial security, Bitget has garnered significant traction. Additionally, Bitget's impressive track record of listing over 180 coins in 2023 and boasting the best Launchpad performance, with an ATH average ROI of 41.9x, have strengthened the use cases and attractiveness for BGB.</p>
<p>The updated BGB whitepaper, released in April, revealed exciting new features in development, including the BGB lottery, trial fund for futures trading, and exclusive earning services. Additionally, the team is actively considering a BGB buyback and burn mechanism, aimed at reducing the token's circulating supply and bolstering its overall value. In May, Bitget introduced yet another innovative feature called "Super Airdrop" for its platform token, BGB. This feature offers eligible BGB holders the opportunity to receive airdrops of any new crypto assets listed on the Bitget platform.</p>
<p>In addition to the developments of BGB functionalities, Bitget's continuous growth and influence in the cryptocurrency market also serve as key drivers for the demand and price performance of BGB. According to TokenInsight's Crypto Exchange Report Q2 2023, Bitget ranks the fourth in trading volume among all CEXs, and its market share increased by 1.81% to 8.7%, the second-highest increase among the Top5 CEXs. Bitget experienced a significant increase in market share in both the spot market and open interest, solidifying its position as a leading player in the industry.</p>
<p>Gracy Chen, Managing Director of Bitget, commented on the listing:</p>

<p>&nbsp;"The listing of BGB on MEXC is a testament to the recognition and achievements of Bitget in the dynamic crypto space. As we continue to expand our ecosystem in both the CeFi and DeFi realms, enhancing BGB's visibility and utility remains one of our top priorities. We are excited to unlock new possibilities and reach a broader audience through this strategic collaboration with MEXC."</p>

<p>BGB is now available for public exchange and trade on MEXC, along with Bitfinex and Bitget, with a total daily trading volume of $10 million. The Bitget team is continuing to explore future listing opportunities for BGB in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The United States Senate has passed an $886 billion military spending bill with strict anti-money laundering provisions for cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>
U.S. Senate Takes a Stand on Crypto&nbsp;
<p>On Thursday, the U.S. Senate made a significant move by passing the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a $886 billion military spending bill that contains a provision that will significantly affect the crypto industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spearheaded by senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Cynthia Lummis, Elizabeth Warren, and Roger Marshall, the amendment aims to tighten oversight of financial institutions involved in crypto trading and clamp down on the use of crypto mixers and "anonymity-enhancing" assets. The senators hailed it as a substantial step in regulating crypto assets.</p>
Merging Existing Acts
<p>The amendment draws from two existing acts already presented earlier to the Senate. Elements from the 2023 Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act and portions of Senator Warren&rsquo;s and Senator Marshall&rsquo;s Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act, introduced in 2022, have been integrated into the bill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These additions mandate the Secretary of the Treasury to establish examination standards for crypto assets, helping with risk assessment and ensuring compliance with money laundering and sanctions laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Treasury Department will be required to conduct a study on countering anonymous crypto transactions, specifically targeting the use of mixers to obscure fund origins.</p>
Customary Approach To Legislation
<p>The inclusion of crypto-related provisions in a military bill may raise eyebrows. However, the practice of adding non-defense-related amendments to military bills is not uncommon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the senators have defended this move by highlighting the importance of combating illicit finance within the crypto industry. Senator Lummis emphasizes that this measure is crucial for identifying and rooting out bad actors in the sector.</p>
<p>Additionally, the bill aims to address concerns related to national security, ensuring that crypto assets are not exploited to evade sanctions or fund terrorist activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the House has already passed its version of the NDAA, both chambers will now enter negotiations to reconcile differences and reach a consensus on the final version of the bill. This process is essential for the legislation's passage and enactment.</p>
Broader Regulatory Initiatives
<p>In conjunction with the NDAA, other congressional committees have also taken steps to address the regulatory challenges posed by the crypto industry. The House Agriculture Committee recently advanced the Financial Innovation Technology for the 21st Century Act to establish a federal regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the United States.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The House Financial Services Committee passed its version a day earlier, focusing on establishing clear criteria for classifying crypto assets as securities or commodities.</p>
<p>As the House and Senate continue their negotiations, the outcome will determine the extent of regulatory measures imposed on the crypto sector and its impact on financial institutions and traders alike.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Democrat Congressman Brad Sherman said on Wednesday during a key congressional committee that only the US government has the right to print money out of thin air.</p>

<p>Yes it is true the United States also makes money by printing money. That benefit goes to the American people when we provide services, or when we tax them less, and the attempt of the billionaire bros in crypto is to appropriate for themselves that literal money-making machine.</p>

<p>Congressman Sherman is talking here of the &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; that the US government has to print money out of thin air, and he is saying that this money out of thin air is for better services and lower taxes for the people. He was not asked what the better services were or when and by how much taxes were lowered for the American people.</p>
<p>The congressman has accused &lsquo;crypto bros&rsquo; in the past of the same thing, saying that they have printed more than $1 trillion from thin air, adding:</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ll accuse the US government of making money out of thin air - maybe we do - we&rsquo;re the US government.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sherman had a lot more to say about crypto in general, and he singled out Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, for special treatment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are told that cryptocurrency is very innovative. Look at the incredible financial innovation of Enron and WorldCom, and reflect on the fact that I don&rsquo;t believe that Saratoshi Nagamoto was innovative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fact that the congressman couldn&rsquo;t even get the Bitcoin creator&rsquo;s name right says much about him not doing any investigation at all into the history of this technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, to pick on Bitcoin, the first technology to solve the double spend problem and possibly the most innovative technology of a generation, rather than a crypto scam coin, does not bode well for his chances of successfully arguing any proposed anti-crypto legislation.</p>
<p>Brad Sherman is a relic of the past. He has a biassed view which does not take the other side into account. He has obviously carried out no investigation into a technology that has been described as extremely innovative, even by leaders of global financial bodies and heads of global financial companies.</p>
<p>It is hoped that Sherman and others like him in Congress will be brought to their senses soon, not to pass laws for crypto scammers to be able to make hay at the expense of investors, but to put together thoughtful and constructive laws that will encourage innovation at the same time as protecting those who would use this technology or invest in it.</p>

<p>Sherman had a lot more to say about crypto in general, and he singled out Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, for special treatment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are told that cryptocurrency is very innovative. Look at the incredible financial innovation of Enron and WorldCom, and reflect on the fact that I don&rsquo;t believe that Saratoshi Nagamoto was innovative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fact that the congressman couldn&rsquo;t even get the Bitcoin creator&rsquo;s name right says much about him not doing any investigation at all into the history of this technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, to pick on Bitcoin, the first technology to solve the double spend problem and possibly the most innovative technology of a generation, rather than a crypto scam coin, does not bode well for his chances of successfully arguing any proposed anti-crypto legislation.</p>
<p>Brad Sherman is a relic of the past. He has a biassed view which does not take the other side into account. He has obviously carried out no investigation into a technology that has been described as extremely innovative, even by leaders of global financial bodies and heads of global financial companies.</p>
<p>It is hoped that Sherman and others like him in Congress will be brought to their senses soon, not to pass laws for crypto scammers to be able to make hay at the expense of investors, but to put together thoughtful and constructive laws that will encourage innovation at the same time as protecting those who would use this technology or invest in it.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>DeFi protocol Parrot Finance will begin implementing an activist investor-led plan to phase out the platform&rsquo;s PRT token, with redemptions set to begin as early as Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The redemption is the result of a highly contentious vote that returns a portion of Parrot Finance&rsquo;s treasury to token holders.&nbsp;</p>
A Controversial Vote&nbsp;
<p>Two years ago, Parrot Finance had raised over $80 million during the public token sale of its PRT tokens. Cut to 2023, and the DeFi protocol is holding a controversial vote to buy its investors out. The proposal in question calls for the end of Parrot&rsquo;s governance token through a redemption program which will see $50 million from its treasury be divided among PRT token holders, priced at $0.0045 each. If passed, the vote would be catastrophic to Parrot&rsquo;s earliest investors, who shared the protocol&rsquo;s vision of building a powerful stablecoin and lending market.</p>
<p>Early investors would end up recouping only one-tenth of their initial investment, despite the fact that Parrot&rsquo;s treasury would retain around $73 million. The proposal has angered investors who argue that the DeFi protocol&rsquo;s team could walk away with millions of dollars, despite never following up on their promise of giving PRT token holders more control over the protocol and often being absent from the protocol entirely. According to early investors, the Parrot team had promised them a protocol that they would be able to govern. Instead, they are being asked to leave for pennies on the dollar.&nbsp;</p>
Going Ahead With Token Buyback&nbsp;
<p>According to multiple posts on its Discord server, Parrot Finance is moving ahead with its plan to purchase its PRT tokens from sellers at a price of $0.0045 each. The purchase will be carried out through a stablecoin market set up on the OpenBook decentralized exchange. According to the company, the redemption period will last for eight weeks, concluding with the sunsetting of the PRT token.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The greenlighting of the plan comes after the results of a community vote to return a chunk of the DeFi protocol&rsquo;s treasury to token holders came out. The vote passed with 99% voting in favor but faced significant backlash from smaller investors who accused the Parrot team of keeping a major chunk of the treasury for themselves. According to pseudo-anonymous on-chain sleuth Ashpool, the vote was a premeditated sham, pointing to the &ldquo;dress rehearsal&rdquo; vote, which was held a week prior to the final proposal. According to a thread by crypto reporter Danny Nelson, the Parrot team, along with activist investors, are likely to make millions in future payroll, a huge share of the treasury, and complete ownership of the protocol.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;gopartyparrot raised nearly $90 million during the height of Solana&rsquo;s 2021 bull market. But its plans to build new kinds of crypto lending markets never caught fire. After nearly a year of pressure from activist investors, the protocol held a contentious vote to buy out all PRT holders. The now-passed plan earmarks just a slice of Parrot&rsquo;s remaining treasury for normal investors.&rdquo;</p>

Original Investors Obliterated&nbsp;
<p>Nelson called the Parrot team the real winners of the exercise, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Parrot&rsquo;s developer team walks away with millions of dollars in future payroll runway and a massive share of the treasury, not to mention full ownership of the protocol. They&rsquo;re almost certainly the big winners here. Activist investors will also likely make a bundle. Some of them have likely been buying the token for months at prices well below the buyback rate in preparation for the redemption program.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nelson stated that the original investors in the project would be obliterated. As things stand, the original investors in Parrot and its PRT token can expect to recover only about a tenth of their actual investments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the original retail investors in Parrot are getting absolutely obliterated. Anyone who bought Parrot&rsquo;s IDO and stuck it out to the end will recoup around 1/10 of their capital.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in Argentina have launched a murder investigation after a group of children discovered the dismembered body parts of missing crypto influencer Fernando Perez Algaba.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The influencer had been reported missing since the 18th of July.&nbsp;</p>
Murder Investigation Launched&nbsp;
<p>The remains of the influencer were discovered by children playing near a stream in the country of Argentina. According to the authorities, the children found a red suitcase while playing by a stream near the city of Ingeniero Budge in the Buenos Aires Province. The parents notified the relevant authorities, who, upon investigating the suitcase, discovered the missing influencer&rsquo;s legs and forearm inside. They also discovered another arm floating in the stream. Later, the police also found Algaba&rsquo;s head and torso.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authorities were able to establish the identity of Algaba thanks to his fingerprints and the numerous tattoos on his body. A subsequent autopsy suggested that the victim was shot at least three times before the body was cut into pieces. Furthermore, the body parts were cleanly cut, suggesting the murder was a professional hit job.&nbsp;</p>
An Extravagant Lifestyle&nbsp;
<p>According to the authorities, Algaba had accumulated millions by renting luxury vehicles and selling cryptocurrency, making sure that he advertised his extravagant lifestyle to his over 900,000 followers on Instagram. Algaba was based in Barcelona but had been staying in Argentina since a week prior to his alleged murder. He had also rented an apartment for himself and was supposed to return the keys to the landlord on the 19th of July. However, the property owner stated that he failed to show up on the scheduled date or answer any phone calls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The murder marks a tragic end for the influencer, known as Lechuga (Lettuce), to his friends. According to friends, Algaba had started working from the age of 14, selling sandwiches on his bicycle and working his way to purchasing vehicles, repairing, and then reselling them. The influencer&rsquo;s hard work and dedication seemed to have paid off, as by the time he turned 24, he had a warehouse filled with high-end cars, motorcycles, and jet skis. He also founded a luxury car and jet ski rental firm in Miami before moving to Barcelona earlier in the year, and also opened a cryptocurrency trading office in Argentina, employing 25 people.</p>
Everything Not As It Seems&nbsp;
<p>However, the influencer&rsquo;s rise to riches was not all that it was made out to be. Authorities in Argentina have already made one arrest in connection with the murder. While the motive is yet to be established, police believe that Algaba was murdered thanks to his numerous debts. According to Argentina&rsquo;s tax agency, Algaba had racked up irrecoverable debts, and his company, Motors Lettuce SRL, was also in considerable debt and began bouncing cheques just a year after its 2018 opening. Algaba&rsquo;s phone also had notes that revealed he had lost significant money on his crypto investments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the influencer had also reportedly upset the Barra Bravas, a violent Argentinean gang that is heavily involved in the country&rsquo;s burgeoning football scene. The gang had reportedly been demanding that Algaba pay them a $40,000 loan. He had already warned his friends in a message, stating that if anything happened to me, everyone is already warned.&nbsp;</p>
Not Involved With Criminals&nbsp;
<p>The deceased influencer&rsquo;s brother, Rodolfo Perez Algaba, denied that his sibling was involved with or had anything to do with criminal rings. He added that he was not a scammer as many claimed and was just a simple car salesman who did not do well with his Bitcoin investments. Rodolfo also stated that their father died when he was 17 and had left him an inheritance which Algaba used to start his business empire, suggesting that the influencer&rsquo;s rags-to-riches story was not as it seemed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two brothers had not seen each other for months following an argument, with Rodolfo claiming that Algaba was under psychiatric treatment for an anxiety disorder. He also appealed to the authorities to apprehend the individuals involved in his brother&rsquo;s murder, stating in an interview with local media agencies,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been here for three days and hardly sleep, thinking, breaking my head, how could this happen. But I&rsquo;m not going to sit still. I&rsquo;m not going to do justice with my own hands, but I hope that justice will be done.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have a great future. They haven't reached their full potential yet, but they definitely will. I draw such conclusions not only from the current situation in the markets or from the systematic growth in demand for crypto, which is indeed observed. But also, by observing the positive changes in the attitude of the world's elites towards it. </p>
<p class="s3">Both financial, which already regularly report new projects like the launch of a national bitcoin exchange in Indonesia in July-2023 (confirmed by the local regulator) or the receipt of a licence to provide cryptocurrency services by a division of the French Societe Generale (SG Forge) from the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF), which cannot but please. But also, political ones, because it is on them that legislative and regulatory decisions depend, which will allow the development of the crypto industry.</p>
<p class="s3">The speech of Democratic Party member and US presidential candidate Robert Francis Kennedy Jr. (nephew of the legendary 35th U.S. President John Kennedy) at an event organised by Heal-the-Divide PAC was highly inspiring. The politician openly stated that he was willing to take steps to back the U.S. national currency with Bitcoin, and this would support the dollar's status as an international reserve currency.</p>
<p class="s3">Kennedy called Bitcoin a hard currency and put it on par with silver, gold, platinum, emphasising that such an approach would help "restore the strength of the dollar, rein in inflation and usher in a new era of financial stability, peace and prosperity for the country". This will provide at least some of the U.S. debt obligations (treasuries) with hard assets, increasing confidence in them.</p>
<p class="s3">Not only has the Democrat recognised the power of bitcoin and publicly reiterated the thesis of many crypto-activists, but he has also made it clear that he is ready to make crypto-assets a tool of public policy. This is a serious acknowledgement, which could translate into a large-scale project centered on the U.S. and the world's key currency, the dollar. </p>
<p class="s3">The second important thesis of Robert F. Kennedy concerns taxation. He announced that his administration would "exempt the conversion of Bitcoins to the U.S. dollars from capital gains taxes." In May, the American authorities had already abandoned the idea of imposing an additional 30% tax on industrial mining of cryptocurrencies, and now they are ready to liberalise the capital gains part. That will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the market, which in the U.S. is now on the brink and is very much hoping for positive changes. It is known that many have even considered the option of migration from the U.S. And so now Kennedy's statement will be received very well.</p>
<p class="s3">By the way, the presidential candidate does not just throw promises, but justifies them. It can be seen that the politician follows the situation in the industry and sentiments. Since he says that tax breaks will allow the development of jobs in the U.S. and not in Singapore, Switzerland, Germany and Portugal. He is aware about the negative sentiment in cryptocurrency circles.</p>
<p class="s3">At the moment, there are few options left in the United States that minimise taxation and do not violate current legislation. The most common are transactions through people's retirement accounts and working through the Puerto Rico, where corporations can enjoy a favourable tax rate of 4% and ordinary investors can work as qualified residents and receive a tax exemption. However, these options are not suitable for everyone. Therefore, crypto investors are increasingly looking at the possibility of working in Singapore, Portugal, Malta, and in some cases Hong Kong. There, the issue of taxation is solved more easily. </p>
<p class="s3">Robert F. Kennedy repeated his old thesis that cryptocurrencies give people freedom, freedom of choice and will. Something he spoke about at the conference in Miami (USA) in May 2023, when he recalled the story of truckers' strikes in Canada. People weren't breaking local laws, but the authorities pressed on by blocking their personal bank accounts to subjugate them - they were deprived of the ability to support their families and pay their mortgages. In fact, these are financial repressions that were applied at the state level.This is essentially financial repression that was applied at the state level. What could not have been realised with the adequate development of cryptocurrencies that can protect citizens and their freedom.</p>
<p class="s3">Freedom of money is also freedom of speech and expression of will. And these are cryptocurrencies that can provide all this, but not fiat currencies, total financial monitoring and requirements for classical financial institutions.</p>
<p class="s3">All of this has been talked about many times at crypto conferences and conventions. It is encouraging that this has finally been heard and realised by politicians at the highest level, and, most importantly, that they are not just talking, but are ready to act decisively.</p>

<p class="s3">All of this has been talked about many times at crypto conferences and conventions. It is encouraging that this has finally been heard and realised by politicians at the highest level, and, most importantly, that they are not just talking, but are ready to act decisively.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The US Department of Justice announced that it had dropped the charges of illegal campaign finance activity against the FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
<p>According to a filing of July 26, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) agreed to drop one of the charges related to illegal campaign finance activity against the disgraced FTX Democrats megadonor and FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;</p>
The Crypto Robinhood Uncovered
<p>After months of investigation, it was estimated that Sam Bankman-Fried donated $93 million worth of stolen customer funds to the US politicians. The FTX founder is known as one of the largest Democratic Party donors. Some of Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s illegal contributions include donations to the 2020 Presidential campaign, as well as campaigns of the U.S. Senators and U.S. House representatives. Prosecutors suggested that the crypto mogul had made these contributions to influence the policies that could potentially benefit the crypto industry.</p>
<p>Following the sudden collapse of the Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s crypto exchange FTX due to its inability to repay the clients, it was also revealed that the company&rsquo;s former CEO had authorized the diversion of $2 billion from customers' funds to cover loans and expenses for the firm.</p>
One of the Eight Charges Dropped
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried was originally indicted on eight charges in December. One of these charges is now dropped thanks to the extradition treaty between the United States and the Bahamas. Apparently, the Bahamas submitted a filing to New York federal judge Lewis Kaplan that dropped the charges of campaign finance fraud.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice letter said, &ldquo;The Government has been informed that The Bahamas notified the United States earlier today that The Bahamas did not intend to extradite the defendant on the campaign contributions count. Accordingly, in keeping with its treaty obligations to The Bahamas, the Government does not intend to proceed to trial on the campaign contributions count.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The FTX founder will still be charged with the other seven counts present in the DOJ&rsquo;s original indictment. Those include charges regarding wire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering.&nbsp;</p>
What&rsquo;s Next for Sam Bankman-Fried?
<p>After being released on $250 million bail back in December, the bail status of Sam Bankman-Fried is now in jeopardy due to his latest interview with the New York TImes. The persecutors accused the former FTX CEO of discrediting their witness, Caroline Ellison. As a result, Bankman-Fried has agreed to an interim gag order that prevents him from publicly discussing the case. The terms of his bail now depend on federal prosecutors and attorneys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am certainly very mindful of his First Amendment rights, and I am very mindful of the government&rsquo;s interest here, which I take very seriously. And I say to the defendant, Mr. Bankman-Fried: You better take it seriously, too.&rdquo; commented Judge Kaplan.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Gofaizen &amp; Sherle has launched the new product for obtaining crypto licenses in El Salvador, expecting it to become one of the key business destinations on the crypto map. In this article, we have discussed all the necessary details that will help you launch an effective business in El Salvador quickly and easily.</p>
<p>El Salvador is rapidly emerging as a sought-after destination in the world of cryptocurrencies, particularly due to increased regulatory scrutiny in the EU and US. As these major economies tighten their regulations, businesses are exploring alternative jurisdictions, and El Salvador has become a prime choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Known for recognizing Bitcoin as legal tender and even launching cryptocurrency mining on a volcano, El Salvador has quickly gained attention in the crypto industry. The country's diverse economy, with a focus on coffee production, construction, and industrial manufacturing, has shown positive GDP growth and relatively low inflation and unemployment rates.</p>
<p>El Salvador's government actively supports the crypto industry and aims to attract foreign companies and investors. They have implemented a favorable tax system, exempting digital asset-related income and profits from taxation. Additionally, technology companies engaged in AI, app development, and digital products can enjoy a 15-year tax exemption.</p>
<p>The National Commission of Digital Assets of El Salvador (NCDA) issues licenses to virtual asset service providers (VASPs), offering a transparent and secure framework for crypto businesses. This supportive regulatory environment makes El Salvador a promising hub for the crypto community.</p>
<p>The Key Advantages of El Salvador</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Unique Taxation System Benefits VASPs: No payments required for operations with digital assets, and transactions can be conducted using Bitcoin. The nominal value, yields, and income from digital assets are tax-exempt. Capital gains and ordinary income from buying, selling, or transferring digital assets are also tax-exempt. Issuers, certifiers, and service providers of registered digital assets enjoy these tax benefits for their related activities without any obligation for tax withholding;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The jurisdiction offers notably low state fees, which is highly beneficial for business activities;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">El Salvador has crypto-friendly banks, making it one of the most crucial and convenient options. This is almost a unique opportunity for a crypto project;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender and crypto regulation create a favorable environment for cryptocurrency businesses. This attracts cryptocurrency exchanges, wallet providers, payment processors, and blockchain startups. Obtaining a crypto license allows companies to enter this market, offer services to the local population as well as worldwide;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Operating within a regulated framework offers companies clarity and guidelines to navigate the cryptocurrency landscape in El Salvador. With a crypto license, companies ensure compliance with legal requirements, including know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. This boosts trust and credibility among customers and partners.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obtaining the Crypto License</p>
<p>The overall process is relatively straightforward, but it does require some patience. Starting a business in El Salvador can take 3 to 5 months in total. The crucial steps involve collecting the necessary documents for authorities and obtaining the license. In the final stage, you can choose a bank or EMI (Electronic Money Institution) and commence operations in the country and worldwide.</p>
<p>However, there are a couple of essential details you should know before launching a project in El Salvador. Firstly, you must have a minimum of two shareholders, and it is imperative to establish an effective business plan. Additionally, you should be prepared to work closely with local regulators and provide reports when necessary. Overall, these rules provide a simple and clear framework for operating a business.</p>
<p>If you're considering launching a crypto exchange operator, El Salvador stands as an excellent choice. Moreover, the country offers various other opportunities for crypto projects in El Salvador. These include setting up companies for:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Custody services</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Payment processing</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Digital asset and derivatives trading</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Issuing tokens, stable coins, or other types of tokens</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Engaging in DeFi activities</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if you possess an innovative solution or a complex idea based on AI or other advanced technologies, El Salvador becomes the jurisdiction of your dreams. It shines as a startup incubator with a strong focus on financial democracy.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BlackRock and India&rsquo;s Jio Financial Services will soon enter a joint venture to launch a &ldquo;digital-first offering&rdquo; in India. </p>
<p>Today, the world&rsquo;s largest asset manager, BlackRock, announced it would join Jio Financial Services (JFS) in a 50:50 joint venture to launch asset management services in India. Joi Financial Services is part of Indian tycoon Mukesh Ambani&rsquo;s Reliance Industries.</p>
<p>The venture, named &ldquo;Joi BlackRock,&rdquo; will see each company invest $150 million in the project and aims to offer &ldquo;tech-enabled&rdquo; access to &ldquo;affordable, innovative investment solutions&rdquo; to millions of Indian investors.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s press release said the project would combine BlackRock&rsquo;s &ldquo;scale and investment expertise with Joi Financial Services&rsquo; knowledge and resources&rdquo; to transform India&rsquo;s asset management industry through a digital-first offering.</p>
<p>Hitesh Sethia, President and CEO of JFS, commented:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is an exciting partnership between JFS and BlackRock, one of the largest and most respected asset management companies globally. The partnership will leverage BlackRock&rsquo;s deep expertise in investment and risk management along with the technology capability and deep market expertise of JFS to drive digital delivery of products.</p>
<p>Jio BlackRock will be a truly transformational, customer centric and digital-first enterprise with the vision to democratise access to financial investment solutions and deliver financial well-being to the doorstep of every Indian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rachel Lord, Chair and Head of APAC for BlackRock, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;India represents an enormously important opportunity. The convergence of rising affluence, favourable demographics, and digital transformation across industries is reshaping the market in incredible ways.</p>
<p>We are very excited to be partnering with JFS to revolutionise India&rsquo;s asset management industry and transform financial futures. Jio BlackRock will place the combined strength and scale of both of our companies in the hands of millions of investors in India.&rdquo;</p>

BlackRock Makes Waves
<p>The assets manager recently made headlines when it announced it had applied to a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). If the SEC approves it, BlackRock&rsquo;s iShares ETF will become the first crypto spot ETF in the US. The firm is, however, facing obstacles in the form of the SEC, and was forced to refile its application after the securities agency took issue with it.</p>

<p>The venture, named &ldquo;Joi BlackRock,&rdquo; will see each company invest $150 million in the project and aims to offer &ldquo;tech-enabled&rdquo; access to &ldquo;affordable, innovative investment solutions&rdquo; to millions of Indian investors.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s press release said the project would combine BlackRock&rsquo;s &ldquo;scale and investment expertise with Joi Financial Services&rsquo; knowledge and resources&rdquo; to transform India&rsquo;s asset management industry through a digital-first offering.</p>
<p>Hitesh Sethia, President and CEO of JFS, commented:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is an exciting partnership between JFS and BlackRock, one of the largest and most respected asset management companies globally. The partnership will leverage BlackRock&rsquo;s deep expertise in investment and risk management along with the technology capability and deep market expertise of JFS to drive digital delivery of products.</p>
<p>Jio BlackRock will be a truly transformational, customer centric and digital-first enterprise with the vision to democratise access to financial investment solutions and deliver financial well-being to the doorstep of every Indian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rachel Lord, Chair and Head of APAC for BlackRock, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;India represents an enormously important opportunity. The convergence of rising affluence, favourable demographics, and digital transformation across industries is reshaping the market in incredible ways.</p>
<p>We are very excited to be partnering with JFS to revolutionise India&rsquo;s asset management industry and transform financial futures. Jio BlackRock will place the combined strength and scale of both of our companies in the hands of millions of investors in India.&rdquo;</p>

BlackRock Makes Waves
<p>The assets manager recently made headlines when it announced it had applied to a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). If the SEC approves it, BlackRock&rsquo;s iShares ETF will become the first crypto spot ETF in the US. The firm is, however, facing obstacles in the form of the SEC, and was forced to refile its application after the securities agency took issue with it.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Following the viral US Congress Hearing about UFOs, over 50 alien-themed tokens have emerged on the crypto market.</p>
The US Government Blamed for Covering up Alien Activity
<p>On July 26, the House Oversight Subcommittee on National Security held a highly-anticipated hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), commonly known as unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Three former military officials accused the US government of concealing important extraterrestrial findings.</p>
<p>According to the whistleblower David Grusch, who is a former Air Force intelligence officer, the Pentagon is covering up a &ldquo;multidecade&rdquo; UAP program which aims at collecting and restoring crashed extraterrestrial crafts. Grusch testified under oath that he is aware of an alien spacecraft in possession of the US government and the &ldquo;non-human&rdquo; biological remains that were found on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryan Graves and David Fravor, retired US Navy commanders, also claimed to have seen UAP findings while serving in the military. While speakers said they couldn&rsquo;t share too much information due to it being classified, they raised concerns over the US government hiding too much regarding the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If UAP are foreign drones, it is an urgent national security problem. If it is something else, it is an issue for science. In either case, unidentified objects are a concern for flight safety,&rdquo; said Ryan Graves.</p>

The Crypto Market Reacts to the Buzz
<p>The &ldquo;exciting&rdquo; hearing quickly went viral and became trending on Twitter and Google searches. Crypto traders couldn&rsquo;t miss the chance to capitalize on the new trend and launched over 50 alien-themed coins just over the span of 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tickers like &ldquo;ALIENX,&rdquo; &ldquo;UFO&rdquo;, and &ldquo;ALIEN&rdquo; have invaded the crypto market. However, most of these tokens haven&rsquo;t seen much trading activity so far. Only the larger and more established alien-themed coins have managed to improve their performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, the native token of the popular blockchain game Alien Worlds, known as TLM, grew by 3.5% within 24 hours after the news broke. Among other UFO memecoins that have slightly climbed during the last day are the UFO Gaming Token (UFO) which gained 2.4% and the AlienFi token (ALIEN) which surged by 5.9%.</p>
<p>Memecoins are known to quickly emerge in the midst of a growing trend. However, many of them could potentially be scams that try to take advantage of the hype. So, traders should be very careful when choosing an asset for investment.&nbsp;</p>
