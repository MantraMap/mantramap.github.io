<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Balancer would plunder its own trading pools first before other arbitrageurs could.</em></li>



<li><em>Inverse Finance has about bb-e-usd worth around $300,000 in liquid value remaining retained in bb-e-USD.</em></li>



<li><em>This BIP is an action plan for unplugging the pools early and running the arbitrage.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a forum post from Balancer&#8217;s governance head, a proposal revealed Tuesday would see the automated market maker Balancer conduct a permissioned arbitrage of its bb-e-USD pool before anybody else can access it.</strong></h5>

<p>Inverse Finance is attempting to resurrect the fund that was frozen during 2023&#8217;s largest cyberattack.</p>



<p>They have around $300,000 in bb-e-usd representing approximately $300,000 in liquid value still held in bb-e-usd and lawfully owned by surviving bb-e-usd holders. The inverse bb-e-usd is bound by a contract that prevents them from withdrawing using the ways now available. The team is <a href="https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-permissioned-arbitrage-to-recover-remaining-funds-in-bb-e-usd/4783" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concerned</a> that arbitrageurs are preparing to seize the stash when it unfreezes on June 8.</p>



<p>Balancer had frozen the pool on an emergency basis in mid-March after the borrow and lending platform Euler Finance was hacked and the money was eventually recovered.</p>



<p>The Balancer Maxis have spent time working with TempleDAO, Euler, and Inverse to guarantee that the necessary criteria for the arbitrage are satisfied on-chain. Temple transferred eTokens to the Balancer DAO Multisig after Euler fixed a contract.</p>



<p>The concept is currently being discussed, and it requires permission from Balancer&#8217;s community members since the DeFi protocol&#8217;s mechanics would have to be modified. After the arbitrage is completed, organizers want to have a second vote on distributing the recovered tokens.</p>



<p>If this BIP is accepted, the associated payload will be run as soon as feasible. The Pause window is currently in a grace period, thus, the pools cannot be repaused. Upon the execution of BIP bb-e-usdc, bb-e-dai will be unpaused.</p>



<p>As part of the launch process, new Balancer pool types and contracts often contain a 90-day Pause time. If Pause is invoked during this time, a 90-day grace period begins, after which the pool unpauses automatically. The Euler linear pools had been implemented less than 90 days prior to the Euler vulnerability, which enabled the pause. The pool can no longer be paused when the pause window has expired.</p>



<p>The months-long endeavor to retrieve Inverse&#8217;s cryptocurrency was not without its hurdles, not the least of which was the fussy arbitrage smart contract itself. Add to it the fact that Inverse has already been abused, making any prospect of recovery crucial.</p>

<p>The Milady memecoin has created many &#8220;millionaires&#8221; since its launch last week. The top 10 whale accounts are accumulating profits of more than $20 million.</p>



<p>According to an analysis by The Block Research based on data from Nansen and Lookonchain, the top 10 LADYS whale accounts collectively accumulate profits, with a total value exceeding $20 million. Despite taking partial profits, they still hold more than 176,000 billion tokens, equivalent to about 20% of the total token supply.</p>

<p>6/10 whales are profitable, more than 1 million USD per account. However, there are three whales that have been blacklisted and may never be withdrawn. The cause is unknown, but according to Lookonchain, it may be related to insider trading.</p>



<p>The project website states that it is a meme with no intrinsic value or financial return, nor an official team or roadmap. This token is completely useless and is intended only for entertainment purposes.</p>



<p>Despite such a warning, the crypto community is still interested and actively trading this memecoin. The total supply of LADYS is over 888 trillion tokens, with 1% being airdropped to PEPE and Milady NFT holders.</p>



<p>The reality is that there are many memecoins on the market, and not all of them are trustworthy. To avoid risks, readers should only use the amount of capital that can be lost to trade this coin. Moreover, staying alert and avoiding FOMO (fear of missing opportunities) is necessary when investing.</p>



<p>Currently, the token has recorded a 16% drop in the last 24h and is trading at $0.0000000959.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bitcoin users can now solve the bottleneck by minting new assets on the blockchain following the Lightning Labs&#8217; invite update.</em></li>



<li><em>Taproot Assets, as it has been called, would enable users to create assets such as stablecoins on the Bitcoin network.</em></li>



<li><em>The upgrade is already live on a test network, with main network support coming shortly.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>After the introduction of an upgraded version of Lightning Labs&#8217; newly renamed Taproot Assets Protocol, Bitcoin users now have a potentially more efficient means to mint new assets on the blockchain.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-767.png"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="675" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-767.png" alt="Lightning Labs Solves BRC-20 Congestion With New Solution" class="wp-image-187946" title="Lightning Labs Solves BRC-20 Congestion With New Solution 9"></a></figure></div>


<p>Tari Labs, a blockchain software development startup, filed a contested trademark infringement lawsuit in December.</p>



<p>The complaint resulted in an injunction that barred the project from moving forward. Nevertheless, with the renaming, Lightning Labs has restarted development on the core software for implementing the Taproot Assets protocol, which will enable users to create assets such as stablecoins on the Bitcoin network.</p>



<p>Lighting Network infrastructure provider Lighting Labs attacked the existing techniques for inscribing assets on the Bitcoin blockchain in a May 16 blog post, calling them inefficient and pointing to burdensome protocols that record asset information directly into block space.</p>



<p>The Taproot Assets Protocol is <a href="https://lightning.engineering/posts/2023-05-16-taproot-assets-v0.2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intended</a> to function entirely off-chain in order to avoid the network congestion that has been an undesirable feature of the Bitcoin network with the March 8 introduction of the BRC-20 token standard by anonymous developer &#8220;Domo.&#8221;</p>



<p>Taproot Assets is presently accessible on a test network, with main network support expected soon.</p>



<p>Domo previously said that the Taproot Assets Protocol is a significantly superior option for minting new assets on Bitcoin than current techniques such as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) since it enables users to simply move to the Lightning network for&#8221;fast and inexpensive transactions.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-768.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-768.png" alt="Lightning Labs Solves BRC-20 Congestion With New Solution" class="wp-image-187947" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-768.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-768-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-768-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-768-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Lightning Labs Solves BRC-20 Congestion With New Solution 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>To install token contracts, manufacture tokens, and transfer them, the vast majority of BRC-20 tokens generated so far use Ordinal inscriptions of JSON data.</p>



<p>This strategy has sparked extensive criticism from developers, who say it costs four times as much in transaction fees as using binary alone.</p>



<p>The Taproot Assets Protocol is a rebranded version of the &#8220;Taro&#8221; protocol. Lightning Labs was compelled to modify the name of its software after a frivolous trademark infringement complaint was brought against them on December 8, last year, by blockchain development startup Tari Labs.</p>



<p>According to Lightning Labs, the company&#8217;s next step will be to submit finalized protocol specifications to the Bitcoin community via Bitcoin improvement proposals (BIPs) and Bitcoin Lightning improvement proposals (bLIPs), with the ultimate goal of enabling Bitcoin-based asset transfers over the Lightning Network.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will soon bring an enforcement action against Coinbase (COIN), similar to Bittrex and Kraken.</em></li>



<li><em>The SEC will likely be suing soon, targeting something like staking and USDC interest income.</em></li>



<li><em>Short-selling Coinbase stock is too risky, Berenberg said, as about 23% of its free-floating shares have been shorted.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Coindesk, a report on Monday by Berenberg suggests that the SEC will soon take action against <a href="https://news.coincu.com/187925-coinbase-expands-singapore-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a>, similar to what it did with Bittrex and Kraken.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-764.png"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="800" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-764.png" alt="Coinbase May Face Strong Actions From The SEC" class="wp-image-187938" title="Coinbase May Face Strong Actions From The SEC 13"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In mid-February, Kraken Crypto Exchange &#8220;immediately&#8221; terminated its crypto staking service platform for US customers and paid $30 million fees to SEC, to which they offered unregistered securities.</p>



<p>In mid-April, the SEC charged crypto asset trading platform Bittrex, Inc. and co-founder and former CEO William Shihara for running an unregistered national stock exchange, brokerage, and clearing agency. The SEC also charged Bittrex, Inc.&#8217;s foreign arm, Bittrex Global GmbH, for failing to register as a national stock exchange in connection with operating a single common order book alongside Bittrex. On May 8, the exchange declared bankruptcy following the SEC&#8217;s allegation.</p>



<p>Coinbase (COIN) will soon be the target of enforcement action from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which may reflect the regulator&#8217;s activities against cryptocurrency exchanges. Bittrex and Kraken are electronic competitors, according to Berenberg&#8217;s research study from Monday.</p>



<p>Berenberg estimates that at least 37% of Coinbase&#8217;s $736 million in first-quarter net revenue came from transaction fees and spreads posted by trading crypto tokens other than bitcoin (BTC) and fees from its staking services.</p>

<p>Analysts expect the SEC to be suing soon, targeting these revenue streams and things like staking, USDC interest income, and custody.</p>



<p>Successfully pivoting away from the US would be a tall order for the crypto exchange, as about 86% of net revenue that Coinbase generated in the 12 months ended March 31 came from its US operations, the note said.</p>



<p>Short-selling Berenberg claimed that Coinbase stock is extremely hazardous, particularly given that around 23% of its freely floating shares have been traded short. Selling short is a wager that the price will decline. In the hopes that the price would drop, an investor borrows a security and sells it. The securities are then repurchased and given back to the lender. If the borrower is correct, they can keep the difference; if they are incorrect, they can keep it.</p>



<p>Coinbase said today that it has expanded its services to Singapore amid tightening US crypto regulations and increased scrutiny by regulators.</p>

<p>Coinbase is adding new USDC-related and staking services for Singapore customers. The move comes as Coinbase is taking steps to strengthen its international presence in direct<a href="https://news.coincu.com/187671-sec-response-coinbase-petition-clear-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> response</a> to a crackdown by regulators in the United States, where the company is headquartered.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The message here is the world is sort of moving on with or without the US, and we are very committed as a global company to keep moving forward on international expansion,&#8221;</p>
<cite>Hassan Ahmed, country director for Singapore at Coinbase said.</cite></blockquote>

<p>At the end of last year, the Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Ravi Menon said that the lion island nation wants to become a global hub for digital assets rather than just a place to trade and cryptocurrency speculation.</p>



<p>Accordingly, MAS has introduced many &#8220;strict regulations&#8221; to ensure businesses meet the right requirements and solve many possible risks in cryptocurrency transactions. This approach has helped Singapore attract many crypto firms, such as Binance Holdings and Gemini, to locate here.</p>



<p>According to experts, Singapore has many opportunities for the cryptocurrency market, as the island nation is known as one of the global financial centers.</p>

<li><em>The next Litecoin Halving is scheduled for August 3, 2023.</em></li>



<li><em>Cryptocurrency experts have revealed that LTC is actively recovering ahead of the halving.</em></li>

<p>Litecoin has seen significant growth over the past 30 days. Although currently on a downtrend, the project has gained almost 20% in the monthly rankings. This cryptocurrency strongly correlates with Bitcoin, which explains its recent growth.</p>



<p>Litecoin will soon have a few upgrades to the network. According to an official post, LTC upgrades include Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT), P2P support for Light Client, Viewing Key, Payment Proof, and Descriptor Wallet.</p>



<p>While the upcoming upgrades are all critical, the vital development around LTC is the halving that will occur on August 3, 2023. The halving is a networking event that happens every four years.</p>



<p>Most investors expect the Litecoin price to increase after the halving event, as the number of rewards will decrease, thus increasing demand. LTC price has recorded a gain of more than 6% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $93.0.</p>

<p>Litecoin $LTCUSD has surged above LMACD 1 million, while BTC and ETH are lagging behind. This is indicative of a more extensive timeframe momentum shift. Notice specifically when the histogram turns from red to green and vice versa.</p>

<p>Although Litecoin has recovered before Halving, to confirm the next bull run, many other factors need to be evaluated.</p>



<p>Historically, halvings have resulted in prices skyrocketing as supply decreases, leading to deflation. Since its introduction in October 2011, Litecoin&#8217;s supply has been cut in half twice. Its block reward was cut from 50 LTC to 25 LTC during the first halving, which took place in August 2015. In the second case, which occurred in August 2019, the 25 LTC reward was reduced to 12.5 LTC.</p>



<p>Each LTC price halving is usually very chaotic. This includes a significant price pump, a corresponding correction, a price low, and a local rally to the top.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The European Council has agreed on new regulations that expand tax reporting obligations to encompass crypto asset trades.</em></li>



<li><em>This ensures that funds are open on crypto exchanges with digital assets and offers a robust framework for the EU.</em></li>



<li><em>According to the report, tax authorities in the EU presently lack the information needed to monitor revenues from crypto assets, which are freely exchanged across borders.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Authorities throughout the globe are becoming concerned about the digital currency sector&#8217;s lack of regulation, although the European Union has already made efforts to safeguard investors.</strong></h5>

<p>The laws&#8217; scope was broadened to encompass crypto asset transfers on May 16 after the Council concluded it was time for an update to the rules controlling the information that must accompany currency transactions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We welcome the political agreement reached by EU Finance Ministers today on new tax transparency rules on the crypto-asset sector.<br><br>The Directive will improve EU countries&#39; ability to detect and counter tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance.<br><br>More info ↓</p>&mdash; European Commission (@EU_Commission) <a href="https://twitter.com/EU_Commission/status/1658445756410331136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 16, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The European Council has <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_2725" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agreed</a> on new regulations that expand tax reporting obligations to encompass crypto asset trades. The Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC) is the seventh iteration of a set of rules for automated information exchange between European governments for tax reasons.</p>



<p>This ensures that funds are available for crypto exchanges with digital assets and provides the EU with a solid framework that complies with the most stringent worldwide regulations for the exchange of digital currencies, ensuring that they are not used illegally. Sweden&#8217;s Finance Minister, Elisabeth Svantesson, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Today’s decision is bad news for those who have misused crypto-assets for their illegal activities, to circumvent EU sanctions, or to finance terrorism and war. Doing so will no longer be possible in Europe without exposure – it is an important step forward in the fight against money laundering.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since it is dependent on definitions specified in that law, DAC8 was suggested in December and authorized on May 16 after the passing of Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA). The new DAC follows the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) and revisions to reporting criteria announced in October by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) under a G20 mandate.</p>



<p>The parliament of the 27-member EU passed the world&#8217;s first complete laws governing crypto assets, which include cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as tradable tokens whose value is safeguarded using blockchain technology, such as NFTs, last month.</p>



<p>Regardless of the overall amount of the cryptocurrency assets being exchanged, crypto asset service providers must now comply with new requirements that compel them to collect and make accessible particular information on the sender and receiver of all cryptocurrency asset transactions that they assist.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, EU economics and finance ministers agreed on regulations to pursue people who hide their money in places where tax authorities have no monitoring.</p>



<p>According to Svantesson, the laws would tighten loopholes that enable individuals to avoid paying taxes on their income by utilizing crypto assets.</p>



<p>This implies that crypto transfers may be traced, increasing the ability to detect potentially questionable transactions and preventing them from happening.</p>



<p>On July 20, 2021, the European Commission proposed this rule as part of a broader legislative package aimed at tightening anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CFT) policies in the European Union.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>According to Justin Sun, Li Wei, the younger brother of Huobi founder Li Lin, should never have gotten millions of HT tokens for free, much alone profiting from them.</em></li>



<li><em>Sun went on to say that Wei has made no contributions to the HT community.</em></li>



<li><em>The value of HT tokens has plummeted in the last month.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Justin Sun, the inventor of Tron (TRX) and a Huobi shareholder, has <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1658413236360998913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a series of allegations against Li Wei, the brother of Huobi founder Li Lin, stating that he obtained Huobi&#8217;s native token (HT) abnormally at no cost and sold it for large sums of cash.</strong></h5>

<p>Sun stated today that Wei got the token when it was first released and that he has been consistently selling off and cashing out since April.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Li Wei has been consistently selling off these HT tokens and cashing out. Now, the HT DAO committee is stepping in to rectify this issue,&#8221; Sun said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sun indicates that Huobi intends to work with Wei to negotiate a reimbursement and arrange for the destruction of his remaining HT tokens. Not only will this move be a question of justice, but it will also serve the best interests of everyone in the HT DAO community, according to him.</p>



<p>Sun added that Wei should refund the USDT and that he should never have been awarded any HT. He went on to say that Wei has made no contributions to the HT community and that he is willing to reward individuals who have really contributed to the growth and development of the HT DAO.</p>



<p>Sun said that Wei began selling HT tokens last month and has sold 2.37 million HT for 7.45 million USDT, citing Huobi exchange statistics. When asked how many tokens Wei owns in total, Sun answered he didn&#8217;t know since it was a long time ago, but it was probably a few million HT.</p>



<p>Coincidentally, Huobi recently announced its stake sale, stating that the company&#8217;s controlling shareholder has decided to sell its stock to the M&amp;A fund of Hong Kong-based investment firm About Capital Management.</p>



<p>Although Huobi did not identify the controlling shareholder, the announcement came amid rumors that Lin was looking for a buyer for his over 60% ownership in the firm and was asking for at least $1 billion. The parameters of the arrangement with About Capital Management were not disclosed by Huobi.</p>



<p>The HT token has lost more than 40% of its value in the last seven days, but has rebounded by 1.23% as a result of Sun&#8217;s tweets.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>

<li><em>After the successful testing of the V2 functionality, Lido users have begun to increase their withdrawal requests.</em></li>



<li><em>Celsius began taking ETH valued at hundreds of millions of dollars from the platform.</em></li>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-752.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="523" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-752-1024x523.png" alt="Lido Witnessing Huge stETH Withdrawal Since Upgrading To V2" class="wp-image-187900" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-752-1024x523.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-752-300x153.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-752-768x392.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-752-750x383.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-752-1140x582.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-752.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Lido Witnessing Huge stETH Withdrawal Since Upgrading To V2 33"></a></figure></div>


<p>The Dune Analytics dashboard <a href="https://dune.com/queries/2475283/4071939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> 130 withdrawal requests totaling 441,887 stETH. This sum is projected to rise dramatically, particularly after major organizations invested in Lido begin processing withdrawals.</p>



<p>According to a separate <a href="https://dune.com/queries/2478659/4077881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dune Analytics</a> dashboard, the protocols successfully handled 19 withdrawals totaling 339 ETH.</p>



<p>Celsius has also begun removing ETH worth hundreds of millions of dollars from Lido Finance.</p>



<p>The revelations occurred only hours after the insolvent company transferred approximately $800 million in stETH and after the platform upgraded to facilitate such transfers. Celsius will get the underlying ETH in return for the stETH tokens once the funds are withdrawn.</p>



<p>According to blockchain statistics, Celsius has <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x4A87EcDfb459eb36d25226D9CCd7Ec4f684AB3Fc#tokentxns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> withdrawal requests for 240,000 stETH. Nevertheless, the corporation has not made any significant withdrawal demands from Lido.</p>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/187577-lido-finance-v2-allowing-withdrawal-ether/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lido</a> is mainly a platform for Ethereum liquid staking. It allows users to pool their assets to become Ethereum validators, avoiding the network&#8217;s requirement of depositing at least 32 ETH.</p>



<p>In April, Ethereum launched Shapella, a network improvement that allows for reward withdrawals from its staking contract. As a consequence, the PoS contract saw days when ETH withdrawals outpaced deposits.</p>



<p>The Ethereum PoS contract has over 20 million ETH as of May 16, highlighting the rising need for liquid staking service providers like Lido. The story most certainly boosted the price of its governance token, LDO.</p>



<p>In the days running up to the Lido v2 launch, its whales have also backed LDO&#8217;s upward trend. According to the data site Lookonchain, this might imply that the &#8220;buy the rumor&#8221; scenario led to the LDO price surge.</p>



<p>With redemptions now open, numerous experts believe the lender will be able to swap its stETH for ETH and utilize it to fund its restructuring strategy.</p>

<p>Cetus Protocol is a decentralized exchange (AMM DEX) using the Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker (CLMM) mechanism built on the Sui and Aptos ecosystems. Cetus is a permissionless DEX that allows any user to have access, create liquidity, and trade.</p>



<p>Users can experience the project by connecting e-wallets through Sui Chain or Aptos Chain.</p>



<p>Suia is a social network dApp that aims to build a distinct community based on openness, empowerment, and user interaction. Those with the same assets may engage with one another, participate in events, acquire artists&#8217; artwork, and explore the Suia ecosystem together, reinforcing the feeling of community.</p>



<p>Suia&#8217;s NFT Recommendations function, which uses wallet data to recommend NFTs to users based on their unique interests, is one of its most notable features. It works in the same way as TikTok&#8217;s algorithm, so if you like dancing, for example, you&#8217;ll be shown an increasing number of dance-related stuff. This will assist you in identifying NFTs that are more likely to pique your interest than others.</p>



<p>Suia&#8217;s main utility token is SUIA. SUIA tokens are primarily used for governance, allowing holders to vote on ideas on the project&#8217;s future and development, as well as giving them a say in airdrop prizes, the number of grants to distribute to development and strategic alliances, and adjusting the ecosystem&#8217;s parameters.</p>
