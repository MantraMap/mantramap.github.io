<p>It&rsquo;s evident that the current dip the crypto ecosystem is going through is one of the worst ever, second only to the crash that happened a few years ago. Tokens like Polkadot (DOT) and Litecoin (LTC) that showed promise just a few months ago have all but fallen to their all-time lows. Due to this, investors have set their sights on the young upstart, Degrain (DGRN). This article examines why so many are bullish on the new token, even at the expense of OG coins like Polkadot (DOT) and Litecoin (LTC).</p>
<p>Polkadot (DOT) may not get to $100 until 2028</p>
<p>Polkadot (DOT) defines itself as an open-source sharded multichain protocol that connects and secures a network of specialized blockchains, facilitating the cross-chain transfer of tokens and other assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this way, Polkadot (DOT) enables different blockchains to be interoperable with each other, which is why it is called the internet of blockchains, i.e, Web3. Polkadot (DOT) has fallen more than 82% lower than its all-time high, but analysts have said that it may rally to $20 and above later this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compared to the Polkadot (DOT) token&rsquo;s all-time high of $55, $20 seems barely enough. That price will reportedly go to $100 in a couple of years, but investors may not be willing to wait that long.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) investors may be diverting liquidity to Uwerx (WERX) presale</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) has been active in the ecosystem for nine years and has remained relevant. Litecoin (LTC ) is the native token of the blockchain, and at the moment, it is ranked among the top tokens as far as the market cap is concerned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, there have been complaints that Litecoin (LTC) is losing its grip because it lacks many of what new projects have - a strong brand, influential connection, or quirkiness. Litecoin (LTC) can only boast about its strong technical foundation, but analysts think the token value and market cap will rise in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all investors can afford to tie up liquidity when there&rsquo;s a potential better play out there. Right now, there&rsquo;s a buzz about a new token named Degrain (DGRN), and Litecoin (LTC) investors are jumping ship.</p>
<p>Uwerx (WERX) A Star Contender for Blue-Chip Crypto Status</p>
<p>Uwerx aims to launch the first decentralized freelance marketplace - the project&rsquo;s goal is to connect employers and freelancers without the high fees charged by industry leaders such as Upwork and Fiverr.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx is expected to attract millions of workers - industry experts predict that Uwerx could become a cornerstone of the freelance in 2024. In addition to the lower fees that blockchain brings about, Uwerx will play host to numerous other features such as a incentive-based rewards system, a premium feature system where tokens can be used to unlock premium features and the opportunity for users to earn tokens by staking their existing tokens on the platform. The WERX token will also act as the medium by which goods and services are exchanged which will foster active participation on the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx is poised to take a large bite out of an industry that is predicted to be worth close to $500 billion. Investors have shown great interest and confidence in the project and the presale is running strong. With liquidity locked in for 25 years after and audit approval already being granted, Uwerx is most likely to be the hottest contender for a cryptocurrency that will see the most growth within the next year. Get in now at $0.0315 as Uwerx is on it&rsquo;s final stage; most likely at this point, the purchase bonus of 20% will also see a decrease.&nbsp;</p>
