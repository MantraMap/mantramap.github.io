Binance finds itself entangled in a lawsuit filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), dealing a heavy blow to BNB, the token issued by Binance. The allegations leveled against the crypto exchange suggest its involvement in unlawful activities, specifically multiple violations of securities laws. Consequently, the impact of these allegations manifested as substantial outflows from the exchange, prompting Changpeng Zhao, the CEO, to disclose an astonishing figure of over $392 million in net outflows in the last 24 hours. It&#8217;s worth noting that Binance has dealt with significant outflows before, indicating a history of navigating such challenges.

The SEC: What‚Äôs The Gist?¬† According to the official SEC press release, the company and 13 other entities are being sued for the operation of an unregistered exchange and the commingling of customer funds through companies related to Binance. The regulatory body also alleges that Binance had knowledge of the regulations regarding exchanges and securities but chose to ignore those laws, putting investor funds at risk just to maximize profits.¬† They also highlighted the sale of unregistered securities. The SEC targets the company‚Äôs ‚ÄúSimple Earn‚Äù and ‚ÄúBNB Vault‚Äù crypto-lending products. These products are part of Binance‚Äôs staking service and, with the recent crackdown on staking services by the SEC, are considered securities by the regulatory body.

The SEC also remarked that Binance misled customers through ‚Äústrategic and targeted wash trading‚Äù.¬† Related Reading: MATIC Faces Long-Term Struggle For Growth As SEC Claims It‚Äôs A Security BNB Yet To Make A Comeback Since then, BNB is the only altcoin that has not rebounded since the general market downturn. However, analysts are still somewhat bullish in the short-term capacity of the coin despite the market‚Äôs recent slippage.¬† Source - Coingecko At the token‚Äôs current price point of $235, BNB bulls should defend the $234 support level to target higher highs in the short term as long as no bearish news hits the market. But at the moment, it seems that the weight of the bears will defeat any attempt for a bullish breakout.¬† However, if the bulls are able to defend this support level, a return to the $300 price point might be possible. Despite the optimism in the market, developments in the lawsuit will surely affect BNB in the long term.¬† Featured image from¬†Protos
