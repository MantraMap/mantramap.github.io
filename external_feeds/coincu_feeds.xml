										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Key Points:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Namibia&#8217;s National Assembly approves measures to regulate digital assets and service providers.</em></li>



<li><em>The legislation focuses on licensing, consumer protection, and risk mitigation.</em></li>



<li><em>The Bank of Namibia maintains cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in the country.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Namibia&#8217;s National Assembly has <a href="https://www.parliament.na/b12-2023-virtual-assets-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adopted</a> a bill to regulate domestic digital assets, cryptocurrencies, and digital asset service providers.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-418.png"><img decoding="async" width="716" height="425" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-418.png" alt="Namibia Now Legalizes Crypto And Digital Asset" class="wp-image-200694" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-418.png 716w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-418-300x178.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 716px) 100vw, 716px" title="Namibia Now Legalizes Crypto And Digital Asset 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>The legislation&#8217;s goal is to provide a framework for licensing and regulating virtual asset service providers (VASPs). It also intends to appoint a regulator to regulate these providers and their actions. Important goals include consumer protection, limiting market misuse, and lowering the danger of money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation in the virtual asset market. Before it can be implemented, the measure must first be officially published.</p>



<p>Importantly, the Bank of Namibia (BON) maintains that cryptocurrencies are not legal cash in the nation.</p>



<p>The measure is now awaiting formal publication before going into effect. Namibia&#8217;s Minister of Finance and Public Enterprises, Iipumbu Shiimi, indicated in his report the formation of a regulatory agency to regulate and give licenses to VASPs in the nation.</p>

<p>Noncompliant providers might face fines of up to ten million Namibian dollars and a ten-year jail sentence.</p>



<p>Kazembire Zemburuka, the BON&#8217;s director of strategic communications and international relations, stated the bank&#8217;s position in the report, indicating that once the associated risks of innovations like virtual assets are better managed, the bank will assess and decide whether to accept them into the financial system.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-420.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="728" height="479" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-420.png" alt="Namibia Now Legalizes Crypto And Digital Asset" class="wp-image-200696" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-420.png 728w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-420-300x197.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" title="Namibia Now Legalizes Crypto And Digital Asset 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>The execution of a bill to legitimize digital assets by the parliament seems to contradict the BON&#8217;s declaration at the end of 2022. BON, in particular, feels that cryptocurrencies are not recognized as legal money in this nation. On the other hand, the bank has said that it would not prohibit companies and merchants from taking cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Although the bill&#8217;s approval by the Namibian parliament was lauded as a move in the right direction, other experts emphasized that its implementation should not create needless barriers to innovation.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bakkt CEO Gavin Michael reveals plans to expand the digital asset platform to Hong Kong, the UK, and the EU, targeting regions with more regulatory clarity and faster progress in crypto markets.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bakkt, aims to expand to Hong Kong, the UK, and the EU to benefit on cryptocurrency regulatory certainty.&nbsp;</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bakkt_bitcoin.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="533" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bakkt_bitcoin.jpeg" alt="Bakkt&#039;s Ambitious Plans For Global Growth In 3 Promising Crypto Markets" class="wp-image-200679" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bakkt_bitcoin.jpeg 800w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bakkt_bitcoin-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bakkt_bitcoin-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bakkt_bitcoin-750x500.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="Bakkt&#039;s Ambitious Plans For Global Growth In 3 Promising Crypto Markets 4"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Bakkt, the digital asset platform, has revealed plans to expand its operations to Hong Kong, the United Kingdom (UK), and the European Union (EU) in an effort to capitalize on regions with more regulatory clarity in the cryptocurrency space. According to Bakkt CEO Gavin Michael, the lack of a clear regulatory framework in the United States has prompted the company to focus on international expansion.</p>



<p>The decision to target Hong Kong, UK, and EU stems from the fact that these regions have made significant progress in establishing cryptocurrency regulations, surpassing the regulatory developments in the US. Michael highlighted the UK&#8217;s commitment to clear crypto regulations, Hong Kong&#8217;s allowance of trading in select cryptocurrencies, and the EU&#8217;s passage of the MiCA framework for crypto regulation.</p>

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/187027-bakkt-delists-25-tokens-including-aave-link/">Bakkt</a> is keen on leveraging Bitcoin&#8217;s Layer 2 Lightning Network for custody and settlement services, particularly in the realm of cross-border payments. Exploring the potential of this technology opens up opportunities for Bakkt to offer efficient and secure financial services.</p>



<p>The company believes that there is more traction and momentum in the crypto markets outside the US, attributing it to the faster pace of regulatory clarity in these regions. As a result, Bakkt aims to tap into these markets to drive the growth of its platform and better serve its international customer base.</p>



<p>By expanding its operations to Hong Kong, UK, and EU, the company hopes to navigate the regulatory landscape more effectively and capitalize on the growing demand for digital asset services in these regions. With a focus on jurisdictions that offer clearer guidelines, Bakkt aims to position itself as a leader in the global digital asset market.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>FTX accuses BlockFi of abusing bankruptcy rules, while Three Arrows Capital and the SEC oppose BlockFi&#8217;s proposed plan.</em></li>



<li><em>Disputed transactions worth billions of dollars are at stake in the legal battle.</em></li>



<li><em>The outcome will be determined in a New Jersey court hearing on July 13.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a dramatic turn of events, defunct crypto lender BlockFi is facing allegations of abusing bankruptcy rules, as stated in a legal <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/blockfi/Home-DocketInfo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filing</a> by FTX.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-414-1024x535.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="535" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-414-1024x535.png" alt="BlockFi Faces Difficulty As FTX Accuses Abuse Of Bankruptcy Rules" class="wp-image-200671" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-414-1024x535.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-414-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-414-768x401.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-414-750x392.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-414-1140x596.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-414.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BlockFi Faces Difficulty As FTX Accuses Abuse Of Bankruptcy Rules 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>With over a billion dollars of disputed transactions hanging in the balance, FTX claims that BlockFi&#8217;s proposed plans are unfair and downplay FTX&#8217;s significant claims, having bailed out BlockFi last year before facing its own bankruptcy filing.</p>



<p>FTX argues that the plan disregards procedural fairness and due process requirements. <a href="https://coincu.com/200607-ftx-postponing-sale-ftx-japan-reboot-process/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a> cites substantial repayments and collateral related to a loan with its trading arm Alameda Research, as well as collateral pledges worth $1 billion made by Emergent Fidelity, a company established by FTX&#8217;s former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, to hold shares in Robinhood.</p>



<p>The proposed plans, which are set to be discussed in a New Jersey court hearing on July 13, are also facing opposition from liquidated hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-416-1024x538.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-416-1024x538.png" alt="BlockFi Faces Difficulty As FTX Accuses Abuse Of Bankruptcy Rules" class="wp-image-200673" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-416-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-416-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-416-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-416-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-416-1140x599.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-416.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BlockFi Faces Difficulty As FTX Accuses Abuse Of Bankruptcy Rules 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>These legal filings aim to untangle complex financial transactions among crypto companies that are undergoing separate bankruptcy cases in their quest to repay customers and other creditors. BlockFi may also have claims against FTX in parallel proceedings held in Delaware, to which FTX&#8217;s lawyers anticipate objecting, according to the filing.</p>



<p>In addition to FTX&#8217;s opposition, Three Arrows Capital, owed over $220 million by BlockFi, expresses discontent with not being given an opportunity to contest fraud allegations. The <a href="https://coincu.com/197435-sec-waives-blockfi-30m-fine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a> also raises concerns over vague and broad clauses that release the crypto lender and its management.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-415.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="860" height="573" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-415.png" alt="BlockFi Faces Difficulty As FTX Accuses Abuse Of Bankruptcy Rules" class="wp-image-200672" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-415.png 860w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-415-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-415-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-415-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" title="BlockFi Faces Difficulty As FTX Accuses Abuse Of Bankruptcy Rules 8"></a></figure></div>


<p>This high-stakes legal battle showcases the challenges and complexities of the cryptocurrency industry as it grapples with bankruptcy proceedings and strives to address the needs of stakeholders. The upcoming court hearing will shed further light on the contested plans and determine the future course of action for BlockFi and its creditors.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://coincu.com/198497-blockfi-faces-dissolution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, BlockFi&#8217;s creditors submitted a petition to liquidate the firm, claiming management of fraud and misbehavior. The insolvent cryptocurrency lender was accused of delaying proceedings in order to arrange legal releases for key executives.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a recent development, Bittrex, a cryptocurrency exchange, has come under scrutiny for allegedly violating multiple state laws, as <a href="https://casedocs.omniagentsolutions.com/cmsvol2/pub_47475/a9064de6-692c-4960-9f3f-8a02b62d2563_175.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> in court filings.</strong></h5>

<p>The Florida Office of Financial Regulation (OFR) has accused <a href="https://coincu.com/193211-bittrex-is-not-allowed-to-refund/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bittrex</a> of various violations, including the failure to properly segregate customer assets and maintain a sufficient surety bond.</p>



<p>The OFR&#8217;s filing opposes Bittrex&#8217;s request for Automatic Stay, which aims to prevent certain creditors from taking action against the bankrupt estate. Assistant General Counsel Brandon Greenberg highlighted that the regulator had previously advised the exchange on resolving the charges against it.</p>



<p>The OFR collaborated with financial regulators from Texas, Maryland, and Michigan in a comprehensive examination of the exchange from October 2022 to March 2023. Following the investigation, the OFR issued a three-count complaint against the exchange platform on April 17. On the same day, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Bittrex of violating federal laws related to operating as a securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency.</p>

<p>Despite the OFR&#8217;s suggestion to engage in discussions and explore avenues for settlement, Bittrex expressed disappointment over the enforcement action. The company later surrendered its money transmitter license on April 30 and subsequently filed for bankruptcy in Delaware on May 8.</p>



<p>The allegations against Bittrex highlight the increasing regulatory scrutiny faced by cryptocurrency exchanges and the importance of compliance with state and federal regulations. The case underscores the ongoing efforts of financial regulators to ensure integrity and legal compliance within the cryptocurrency industry.</p>



<p>The exchange is also questioning the <a href="https://coincu.com/181924-sec-charges-bittrex-violated-securities-law/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a>&#8216;s (Securities and Exchange Commission) power to regulate its activities based on securities offenses.</p>

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/200332-regulatory-pressures-plague-coinbase-causing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> filed a motion to dismiss the SEC&#8217;s accusations against the company last week. Motivating their stance, the exchange accused the government of overreach, claiming that crypto assets may not even be subject to its jurisdiction.</p>



<p>Bittrex has chosen to follow in the footsteps of Coinbase. While the exchange is in court as a result of bankruptcy processes, the move for dismissal of charges relates to distinct litigation, which was brought soon after the firm chose to depart America. It had already been under investigation since 2017 and had been in futile negotiations with the SEC since 2022 at that time.</p>

<li>As policymakers begin to address the potential policy issues surrounding, it will become a more stable and secure environment for users and investors alike.</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The European Commission <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/06/eu-metaverse-strategy-set-to-examine-privacy-competition-and-rights/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/06/eu-metaverse-strategy-set-to-examine-privacy-competition-and-rights/" rel="noreferrer noopener">has delayed</a> the release of its metaverse strategy, which was originally planned for next week.</strong></h5>

<p>The metaverse, a term used to describe a collective virtual shared space, is becoming increasingly popular in the world of cryptocurrency. The European Commission&#8217;s attention to the metaverse is a sign of its growing importance.</p>



<p>As virtual worlds continue to expand and evolve, it is crucial that policymakers address the policy concerns surrounding them. While the delayed release of the  strategy may be disappointing to some, it is an indication that the European Commission is taking this issue seriously and is working on a plan to address it. </p>

</figure>



<p>One of the main policy issues that the strategy will address is privacy. As virtual worlds become more sophisticated, the potential for data breaches and other privacy concerns increases. The European Commission&#8217;s strategy will examine how privacy can be protected in virtual worlds.</p>



<p>Another issue that the strategy will address is property rights. As the value of virtual assets increases, so does the need for clear property rights. The European Commission&#8217;s strategy will examine how virtual property rights can be established and protected.</p>



<p>Finally, the strategy will also address technical standards. As virtual worlds become more complex, it becomes increasingly important to establish technical standards to ensure interoperability and user safety. The European Commission&#8217;s strategy will examine how technical standards can be established and enforced in virtual worlds.</p>



<p>The European Commission&#8217;s focus on the metaverse is a positive sign for the virtual world industry. As policymakers begin to address the potential policy issues surrounding the Metaverse, it will become a more stable and secure environment for users and investors alike.</p>

<p>Marathon revealed that they produced 979 bitcoins in June, down 21% from the previous month. The company also reported that transaction fees in June fell to about 5.1% from 11.8% in May as market conditions cooled down. As of July 1, Marathon held a total of 12,538 BTC and chose to sell 700 bitcoins in June.</p>



<p>In terms of operational updates, approximately 18,500 of Marathon’s Bitcoin miners (c. 2.5 EH/s) were energized at Applied Digital’s facilities in Ellendale, North Dakota, in June. The company&#8217;s operating fleet increased to approximately 149,900 Bitcoin miners, theoretically capable of producing approximately 17.7 EH/s, according to the manufacturer’s specifications, as of July 1, 2023. </p>



<p>Once all of Marathon’s previously purchased miners are installed, approximately 66% of the company’s hash rate is expected to be generated by S19 XPs, which are approximately 30% more energy efficient than the prior generation of mining rigs.</p>

<p>In terms of financial updates, Marathon’s total BTC holdings increased to 12,538, all of which are unrestricted. The company opted to sell 700 BTC during the month of June and intends to sell a portion of its Bitcoin holdings in future periods to support monthly operations, manage its treasury, and for general corporate purposes. The company ended the month with $113.7 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet.</p>



<p>Despite the drop in bitcoin production and transaction fees, Marathon&#8217;s operating fleet and BTC holdings continue to grow. The company&#8217;s focus on energy efficiency with the S19 XPs and the sale of bitcoin holdings for corporate purposes demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and responsible financial management. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, Marathon appears well-positioned to adapt and thrive.</p>

<p>Earlier, the Bitcoin price saw a substantial increase in <a href="https://coincu.com/197227-jerome-powell-raise-interest-rates-2-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling pressure</a> in the wake of the minutes of the United States Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in June.</p>



<p>While BTC has dropped below the $31,000 mark, the growth in demand for Bitcoin futures from institutional and professional investors remains, implying a price squeeze for the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) commodity is possible.</p>



<p>The second Bitcoin halving will take place in May 2024. A bull run is possible if the qualities identified during prior halving occurrences are maintained.</p>



<p>The largest cryptocurrency is up 1.4% to $31,200 on Friday, while the second-largest crypto, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>, has, in the last 24 hours, increased 0.75% to trade at $1,945. This can be said to be a step to create momentum for the upcoming rally of the coins with the largest market capitalization.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/199813-bitcoin-pushes-to-31000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> price is securely above the immediate support level of $30,500, with a much stronger support level of $30,000 predicted. BTC soared in June, regaining resistance above $31,000, boosted by various filings by businesses seeking to launch a spot <a href="https://coincu.com/200412-blackrock-ceo-praises-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin ETF</a>.</p>



<p>Looking at the daily chart, BTC&#8217;s price is looking to break its $31,200 resistance and move towards a further area. This is evident in the candlesticks retreating and trading higher each day.</p>

<p>More broadly, on the weekly chart, the price area where BTC could place its outlook is at $35,500, which is also its Fib %38.2 level since the drop early last year.</p>

<p>The time is now quite favorable for investors to consider as the BTC price zone breaks above $32,000 and retracements in the near term. Waiting will limit the risk and it is safer to buy at the current resistance level.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>FTX Japan has postponed its resale plan in a recent development.</em></li>



<li><em>FTX Trading, the headquarters of the major crypto exchange that went bankrupt in 2022, is now rebuilding.</em></li>



<li><em>The branch in Japan has returned 80% of fiat currency, such as Japanese yen and virtual currency, to customers.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUB2339Y0T20C23A6000000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nikkei News</a>, FTX Trading, a major crypto asset exchange that went bankrupt in 2022, is undergoing reconstruction and plans to postpone the sale of its subsidiary FTX Japan in Chiyoda, Tokyo. The company is said to have communicated its intentions to the Japan Financial Services Agency through FTX Japan.</strong></h5>

<p>If the trading system used by the predecessor QUOINE (coin) of Japan FTX works well, the Japan Financial Services Agency could allow the Japanese company to resume operations before the end of the year.</p>



<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://coincu.com/184521-ftx-japan-delays-resale-to-restart-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX Japan&#8217;s</a> customer asset return process, launched in February, is progressing smoothly. FTX Japan has returned 80% of fiat currency, such as Japanese yen and virtual currency, to customers.</p>



<p>Of all the subsidiaries of the 2nd largest crypto empire in the market, only FTX Japan has not been severely affected by its strict adherence to Japanese exchange and reserve regulations.</p>

<p>At the end of June, the new CEO of FTX, John J. Ray III, said that the company had begun attracting interested parties to reopen the crypto exchange FTX.com.</p>



<p>Many people appreciate the FTX platform on a technological level, so it makes sense to attempt to reopen the exchange. The only big obstacle is the huge debt owed to creditors, of which former customers are only a part. Some customers have refused to accept only partial refunds. They could start a new legal proceeding that could delay reopening plans quite a bit.</p>



<p>However, if they can work around this by convincing former customers to accept only partial refunds, they may be able to reopen.</p>



<p>Failed crypto exchange FTX said it would launch a portal &#8220;in the next few weeks&#8221; for customers owed to global crypto trading platform FTX.com and its affiliates to state their requirements. The exchange has stated this on claims.ftx.com, where the portal will be hosted.</p>

<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em><em><em>The BTC price chart, last week&#8217;s candle, formed a doji candle, reflecting the difficulty in deciding between buyers and sellers.</em></em></em></li>



<li><em>The RSI indicator is currently at the resistance level and moving into the 70 zone, which is a sign of support for a correction in the coming days.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>This week, the BTC price chart shows that the price has not yet returned to test the $30.5K level. However, the price is currently at the support level of $30.5K. The price may continue to move sideways in the range of $30.5K to $31.5K. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The BTC price chart weekly has two indicators that support a dump!</strong></h2>



<p>If it can break through the $31.5K price level, the BTC price chart will continue to rise vigorously to the $35K price range. It is important to note that last week&#8217;s candlestick formed a doji candlestick, reflecting the indecision of buyers and sellers. This could be an indication of an upcoming correction in the market.</p>



<p>The Stochastic indicator is currently in the overbought zone above 80, and the %Williams indicator is at 0. The two synchronized indicators show that the price is in the oversold zone, and the possibility of sideways movement in this zone is relatively high before a correction. However, if there is good news for the market from macro factors, laws, and regulations, the price can pump up more muscular.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The BTC price chart daily with an RSI indicator that also shows a signal for a dump!</strong></h2>



<p>Moving on to the daily chart, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) indicator is currently at the resistance level and moving into the 70 zone. This indicates that the market may experience a correction in the coming days. If the resistance level holds, the price may drop to the $29.5K price range. This is another indication of a possible price correction in the market.</p>



<p>A correction in the market refers to a decrease in the price of an asset after it has experienced a significant increase in value. This is a natural occurrence in financial markets and is often a result of profit-taking by investors. A correction can be seen as a healthy adjustment that helps to prevent the market from becoming overvalued. In this case, a possible price correction in the cryptocurrency market may indicate a shift in investor sentiment, as some investors may be taking profits after the recent price run-up.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Some factors can affect the BTC price chart this week!</strong></h2>



<p>Several factors are affecting the BTC price chart this week. Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, sees BTC as digital gold and a global asset that people can use as an alternative solution. This may lead to more people investing in BTC, causing a spike in the price. However, mining pools have recently sent a lot of BTC to exchanges, but that amount has quickly been absorbed into small wallet groups. The amount deposited into the wallets of these groups is equivalent to ~208% of the BTC mined. </p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance is upgrading its wallet infrastructure to enhance efficiency and fund security for users.</em></li>



<li><em>Selected deposit addresses and memos will be retired in batches, with impacted users receiving inmail notifications.</em></li>



<li><em>Users are encouraged to obtain new addresses and memos upon receiving notifications, while funds deposited into expired addresses remain safe and can be manually credited.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a bid to provide better efficiency and enhanced security measures for its users, leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance has <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/existing-deposit-addresses-to-be-retired-in-q3-july-september-2023-ffbe37cbd85f46db8fe3021ee3f85eb3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> significant upgrades to its wallet infrastructure.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-391.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-391-1024x683.png" alt="Binance Unleashes Wallet Upgrades To Enhance Efficiency And Security" class="wp-image-200609" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-391-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-391-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-391-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-391-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-391.png 1095w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Unleashes Wallet Upgrades To Enhance Efficiency And Security 24"></a></figure></div>


<p>The exchange will be retiring specific deposit addresses and memos in a phased manner across different networks, with affected users receiving inmail notifications.</p>



<p>To ensure a transition, Binance strongly advises seamless users to obtain new deposit addresses and memos (if applicable) upon receiving the official notification. It is important to note that users who have not received any notification are encouraged to continue using their current deposit addresses without any changes.</p>



<p>The retirement of old deposit addresses and memos will only affect users who receive specific notifications from Binance, and the expiry date of the old addresses will be clearly stated in the notifications. However, it is reassuring to know that funds into addresses remain safe and secure, and users can manually credit these deposits via the &#8220;Transaction History&#8221; page on the platform.</p>

<p>To obtain new deposit addresses and memos (if applicable), affected users can conveniently log into their Binance accounts on either the Binance app or website. The exchange&#8217;s ongoing commitment to enhancing user experience and security is evident in this wallet infrastructure upgrade, which aims to streamline operations and provide an even more secure environment for cryptocurrency transactions.</p>



<p>With these improvements, <a href="https://coincu.com/199795-binance-drops-spot-volume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> continues to demonstrate its dedication to maintaining the highest standards of service, providing user funds are well-protected, and upholding its position as a leading cryptocurrency exchange in the industry in the context of the exchange being subject to regulatory imposition in regions around the world.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://coincu.com/200226-binance-stops-multichain-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, from 08:00 UTC on July 7 until further notice, the exchange will halt support for the deposit and withdrawal of Multichain cross-chain bridge tokens created over the following network.</p>
