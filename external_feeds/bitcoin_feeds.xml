He said former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) told him that Binance, which owned a 20% equity stake in FTX, refused to comply with regulators&#8217; requests whenever FTX applied for a license in different jurisdictions.</strong></p>
<h2>Kevin O&#8217;Leary Shares Why He Thinks FTX Failed With U.S. Senators</h2>
<p>Shark Tank star Kevin O&#8217;Leary shared why he thinks crypto exchange FTX collapsed in a congressional hearing, titled &#8220;Crypto Crash: Why the FTX Bubble Burst and the Harm to Consumers,&#8221; before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) asked O&#8217;Leary, &#8220;Why do you believe FTX failed?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Wonderful replied, &#8220;I have an opinion. I don&#8217;t have the records.&#8221; He proceeded to convey what former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) told him after the Shark Tank star noticed that funds disappeared from his FTX accounts. O&#8217;Leary told Congress:</p>
<blockquote><p>After my accounts were stripped of all of their assets and all of the accounting and trade information, I couldn&#8217;t get answers from any of the executives in the firm, so I simply called Sam Bankman-Fried and said, &#8216;Where is the money, Sam?&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>SBF told O&#8217;Leary that he &#8220;no longer knew&#8221; as he has been &#8220;refused access to the servers.&#8221; O&#8217;Leary then told the Senate committee, &#8220;This is a simple case in my mind of &#8216;where did the money go?'&#8221;</p>
<p>During their phone conversation, the Shark Tank star asked Bankman-Fried to explain how he used the proceeds from FTX&#8217;s assets over the past 24 months. That&#8217;s when O&#8217;Leary learned about a transaction worth about $2 billion to $3 billion to repurchase FTX shares from Binance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know this at the time, but at some point, CZ [Changpeng Zhao], who runs Binance, purchased 20% ownership in Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s firm for seed stock,&#8221; O&#8217;Leary told senators. Mr. Wonderful then asked SBF why he had to buy back shares from CZ: &#8220;What would compel you to do that? Why wouldn&#8217;t you keep your assets on the balance sheet?&#8221;</p>
<p>Citing Bankman-Fried, Mr. Wonderful explained that every time FTX applied for a license in different jurisdictions, CZ and Binance &#8220;would not comply with the regulators&#8217; requests to provide the data that would clear [FTX] for a license.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Leary stressed that FTX spending about $3 billion to buy shares back from Binance &#8220;stripped [its] balance sheet of assets.&#8221; He detailed: &#8220;In my view, my personal opinion, these two behemoths that own the unrelated market together, and grew these incredible businesses in terms of growth, were at war with each other.&#8221; The Shark Tank star concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>One put the other out of business intentionally. Maybe there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that &#8230; but Binance is a massive unregulated global monopoly now. They put FTX out of business</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Now, lots of other reasons, I am sure, but that is my personal opinion,&#8221; O&#8217;Leary clarified without mentioning fraud or any other <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-securities-watchdog-charges-sam-bankman-fried-with-fraud-over-ftx-collapse/">charges</a> brought against FTX and Bankman-Fried by the U.S. government and regulators this week.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Leary recently revealed that FTX <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kevin-oleary-reveals-ftx-paid-him-15-million-to-become-a-spokesperson-for-the-exchange/">paid him $15 million</a> to become its spokesperson. Following the collapse of FTX, Mr. Wonderful has maintained that Bankman-Fried is among <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kevin-oleary-bill-ackman-slammed-for-defending-sam-bankman-fried-i-think-sbf-is-telling-the-truth/">the best traders</a> in the crypto space and he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kevin-oleary-slammed-for-saying-hed-back-former-ftx-ceo-again-insists-sbf-is-a-brilliant-crypto-trader/">would back him again</a> if he has another venture. The Shark Tank star also said he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kevin-oleary-reveals-how-he-almost-secured-8-billion-to-rescue-ftx-before-it-collapsed/">almost secured</a> $8 billion to save the troubled crypto exchange from bankruptcy. The former FTX CEO has been arrested and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sbf-to-remain-in-a-bahamian-jail-for-2-months-report-claims-ftx-execs-had-a-covert-chat-channel-called-wirefraud/">denied bail</a> in the Bahamas.</p>

The message was tied to a bitcoin address associated with block 1,018, a block reward that was minted 16 days after Satoshi Nakamoto launched the network. Upon further investigation, onchain data shows that block 1,018 is linked to a great number of block rewards ostensibly mined by Hal Finney, and the signed block is also connected to the very first bitcoin transaction that derived from block 9.</strong></p>
<h2>Block 1,018 Signed by &#x2018;Onesignature&#x2019; on Nov. 26, 2022, Is Associated With Hal Finney&#x2019;s Mined Bitcoins and the Very First Bitcoin Transaction</h2>
<p>On Nov. 26, 2022, a newly created bitcointalk.org forum account called &#x201C;<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3519384">Onesignature</a>&#x201D; shocked the crypto community when the unknown individual signed a message associated with block 1,018. Onesignature&#x2019;s <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5421158.msg61353840#msg61353840">message</a> contained a <a href="https://oxt.me/address/1E9YwDtYf9R29ekNAfbV7MvB4LNv7v3fGa">new BTC address</a> created in 2022, and the unknown person also <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3519384;sa=showPosts">signed the new address</a> as well proving the user&#x2019;s existence.</p>

<p>The signed message, according to <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/tools/verify-message/">Bitcoin.com&#x2019;s Verification Tool</a> and an Electrum wallet, is an authentic signature tied to the 2009 address &#x201C;<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1NChfewU45oy7Dgn51HwkBFSixaTnyakfj">1NChf</a>&#x201D; or block 1,018. Block 1,018 and the bitcoin address 1NChf are both linked to the first <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> transaction that saw 10 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> sent from Satoshi Nakamoto to Hal Finney and a great deal of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> blocks associated with Finney.</p>
<p>For instance, on March 25, 2014, the journalist Andy Greenberg published a story about Hal Finney&#x2019;s life and his affiliations with bitcoin. In the article, Greenberg said he was allowed to see emails sent to Finney from Nakamoto and Jason Finney, Hal&#x2019;s son, showed Greenberg his father&#x2019;s <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> wallet that shows the <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/f4184fc596403b9d638783cf57adfe4c75c605f6356fbc91338530e9831e9e16">very first bitcoin transaction</a>.</p>

<p>The first transaction was 10 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> sent on Jan. 12, 2009, and it was confirmed at block height 170. In addition to the 10 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> sent to Finney that day, Satoshi sent <a href="https://explorer.crystalblockchain.com/visualization/nPOfGn3Zzevht4VN?x=601.0532836914062&y=230.02137756347656&k=0.13651137053966522">four more transactions</a> from block 9. Two transfers for 10 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and two transactions that sent a single bitcoin each.</p>
<p>Greenberg&#x2019;s article showcases an alleged screenshot of Hal Finney&#x2019;s wallet that shows the 10 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> transaction but it also shows 12 block subsidies Finney purportedly mined. The screenshot says Finney mined a reward on Jan. 10, 2009. That was the same day Finney <a href="https://twitter.com/halfin/status/1110302988?s=20&t=NYmch3MqPdJuYySJNLf3xA">told</a> the world that he was &#x201C;running bitcoin&#x201D; on the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/while-elon-musk-plans-to-purge-1-5-billion-inactive-twitter-names-bitcoiners-beg-him-to-preserve-hal-finneys-account/">social media platform Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/7ea1d2304f1f95fae773ed8ef67b51cfd5ab33ea8b6ab0a932ee3e248b7ba74c">block 78</a> is associated with Finney&#x2019;s mined bitcoin rewards and his set of transactions. The block rewards pictured in Greenberg&#x2019;s article, alongside block 78 and the first 10 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> transaction, are all linked to the 2009 address 1NChf that Onesignature signed on Nov. 26. A deep dive into the first 1,025 mined <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> blocks indicates that Finney mined a considerable number of block rewards.</p>
<p>In fact, our parsing found that 1NChf is linked to roughly 36 block rewards that our tools could locate and every reward discovered is related to Finney&#x2019;s mining period. 1NChf is also associated with a great number of coinbase rewards that our team had not yet discovered. Further investigation revealed that 1NChf is connected to a large sum of block rewards that were sent out in batches of thousands of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> on Jun. 14, 2011, at around 5 a.m. (ET). Some of Finney&#x2019;s alleged blocks were also moved in April 2013, according to findings from our onchain research.</p>

<p>A number of <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/17jz6XcXP2LPqS8gYmT2pkNJocUDzbpQuM">consolidated transactions</a> are tied to a Bitstamp.net deposit address and some of the connected funds also were sent to a <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1JWgqCduauH2dBQZ3WE6TN5e2pFtRMGHNr">Mt Gox address</a>.

Blocks affiliated with 1NChf go all the way up to block heights <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/block/7569">7,569</a>, <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/block/7828">7,828,</a> and quite possibly even higher.</p>
<p>All of the blocks linked to Onesignature&#x2019;s 1NChf are related to blocks that are ostensibly tied to Hal Finney and none of the connected blocks match the <a href="http://satoshiblocks.info/">Patoshi block pattern</a>, which means 1NChf and <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/block/1018">block 1,018</a> is not a Satoshi block. It is well understood that Nakamoto may have mined between 700,000 to 1.1 million <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, but what&#x2019;s often misunderstood is that this stash is not consolidated.</p>
<p>While parsing the first 1,025 mined <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> blocks, the data shows that nearly every block Nakamoto mined is unspent, except for the block 9 transactions. After the five transactions from block 9, there&#x2019;s 18.43 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> in the wallet and some of the funds stem from dust transactions. It&#x2019;s not entirely clear the reason why Onesignature <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/an-unknown-individual-signed-a-message-associated-with-btc-block-1018-reward-was-minted-16-days-after-satoshi-launched-bitcoin/">shared the message</a> and signature on Nov. 26. Some people said it was a &#x201C;flex&#x201D; and some people claimed that the signature thread could have been spoofed. One user on the Bitcointalk.org post called &#x201C;franky1&#x201D; said that this was likely the case and that the signature signing &#x201C;can be &#x2018;fooled&#x2019; too.&#x201D;</p>
<p>There has also been speculation that the 1NChf and block 1,018 address could have been <a href="https://twitter.com/FatManTerra/status/1598760271723393024?s=20&t=xcrp_u6EJiTyg_g1Q6PUcw">purchased </a>by someone at a later date. It has been known that people have been seeking older addresses to purchase and these solicitations have been discovered on Reddit and bitcointalk.org. Whatever the case may be, the 1NChf and block 1,018 address is associated with some very special transactions, and mined blocks that are quite possibly connected to Finney.</p>

<p>The computer scientist, <a href="https://twitter.com/halfin">Hal Finney</a>, is revered by many in the Bitcoin community, and he passed away after suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) complications in Aug. 2014. The news follows the crypto community <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/while-elon-musk-plans-to-purge-1-5-billion-inactive-twitter-names-bitcoiners-beg-him-to-preserve-hal-finneys-account/">begging</a> Twitter&#x2019;s owner Elon Musk to preserve Finney&#x2019;s Twitter account after Musk said Twitter plans to purge 1.5 billion inactive Twitter names. While Finney denied he was Bitcoin&#x2019;s creator before he passed away, many crypto community members <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-many-facts-pointing-to-hal-finney-being-satoshi/">wholeheartedly believe</a> he was the creator. Our onchain analysis says nothing of the sort, but the onchain links and heuristics connect to the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/an-unknown-individual-signed-a-message-associated-with-btc-block-1018-reward-was-minted-16-days-after-satoshi-launched-bitcoin/">1NChf and block 1,018 address</a>, and Hal Finney&#x2019;s mined bitcoin and associated transactions.</p>

<h2>$3 Billion Pulled Out From Binance at Peak, Nansen Data Shows</h2>
<p>Binance, the world&#x2019;s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, saw net outflows reaching $3 billion on Tuesday, Nov. 13, blockchain analytics firm Nansen revealed. The news comes as Changpeng Zhao, founder and chief executive of Binance, sought to assure his team that the company is strong enough financially to survive the crypto winter.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>The coin trading platform has been dealing with the effects of a string of negative events in the sector, including the collapse of FTX, a major competitor in the exchange market which <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed</a> for bankruptcy protection in November.

<p>A report by Reuters about an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into Binance was also a factor in investors&#x2019; nervousness, according to Andrew Thurman, content lead for Nansen, who commented on the outflow for CNN. Headlines that prosecutors are considering a money laundering probe also came against a backdrop of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/amid-speculation-and-rumors-surrounding-binance-exchange-token-bnb-suffers-losses-from-the-alleged-fud/">speculation</a> about Binance&#x2019;s reserves.</p>

<h2>CZ Acknowledges Withdrawals, Seeks to Downplay Outflow and Calm Down Colleagues</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1602676998094069760" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> posted on Tuesday, Changpeng Zhao acknowledged the outflow of funds while insisting that Binance has been in similar situations before. &#x201C;Some days we have net withdrawals; some days we have net deposits. Business as usual for us,&#x201D; he said, suggesting &#x201C;it is a good idea to &#x2018;stress test withdrawals&#x2019; on each <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/research-shows-centralized-exchanges-saw-the-most-visits-this-year-from-americans-koreans-russians/">CEX</a> on a rotating basis.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the crypto executive also sought to alleviate concerns about the exchange&#x2019;s health in a memo addressed to its staff. According to a report by Bloomberg quoting the document, Zhao emphasized that the industry is going through &#x201C;a historic moment&#x201D; in which Binance is in a strong financial position and &#x201C;will survive any crypto winter.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;While we expect the next several months to be bumpy, we will get past this challenging period &#x2013; and we&#x2019;ll be stronger for having been through it,&#x201D; CZ told the Binance team. Referring to the latest developments in the space, he added that the recent collapse of FTX has led to &#x201C;a lot of extra scrutiny and tough questions&#x201D; for his exchange.</p>

The 0.5 percentage point rise follows the four consecutive three-quarters of a point increases codified during the last few months. The FOMC&#x2019;s rate hike follows the recent U.S. inflation report which indicated that consumer prices fell to 7.1%, which was lower than expectations.</strong></p>
<h2>Fed Raises Federal Funds Rate by 50bps, Central Bank Expects More Increases Going Forward</h2>
<p>Following the consumer price index (CPI) report <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf">published</a> on Tuesday, members of the U.S. Federal Reserve met on Wednesday and announced a 50bps rate hike. The December increase is smaller than the last four three-quarters of a point (75bps) rate increases.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run,&#x201D; the FOMC <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20221214a.htm">said</a>. &#x201C;In support of these goals, the committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent.&#x201D; The Fed is projecting an additional 75bps hike in the federal funds rate by the end of next year.</p>

<p>The news follows Tuesday&#x2019;s CPI data that rose less than expected as metrics show the inflation rate in November was up 7.1% from a year ago. Core CPI jumped 0.2% on the month, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) noted. &#x201C;Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 7.1 percent before seasonal adjustment,&#x201D; the BLS CPI report details. The FOMC report notes that the Fed will continue to monitor &#x201C;incoming information for the economic outlook.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x200B;&#x200B;In addition, the committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve&#x2019;s Balance Sheet that were issued in May,&#x201D; the FOMC members disclosed. &#x201C;The committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,&#x201D; the FOMC added. After the rate hike and the bank signaled more increases will be enacted, equity markets and <a href="https://www.kitco.com/market/">precious metal prices</a> tumbled.</p>

<p><a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com">Crypto prices</a> dropped too, and the price of <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> fell beneath the $18K zone after the FOMC statement. The Fed has codified a number of rate hikes this year with one half percentage point jump and four three-quarters of a point hikes, making it a grand total of five federal funds rate increases in 2022.</p>
<p>At the end of November, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/markets-spike-after-fed-chair-says-it-makes-sense-to-moderate-the-pace-of-rate-hikes-hints-easing-could-happen-in-december/">hinted</a> during a speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington that easing up on the rate hikes very well could happen in December.

The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT collection captured the most sales this week but on Wednesday afternoon, the floor value tied to Cryptopunks once again jumped above the floor value associated with the BAYC NFT collection.</strong></p>
<h2>$154 Million in NFT Sales Recorded Over the Last Week, Cryptopunks&#x2019; Floor Values Rise</h2>
<p>From last Wednesday up until today, $154.78 million in sales were recorded over the last seven days which is 27.72% higher than the week prior. The $154 million in NFT sales over the last week came from 184,248 NFT buyers and 886,605 blockchain transactions according to cryptoslam.io <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io">metrics</a>.</p>

<p>Once again Ethereum NFT sales dominate as the chain saw $129.99 million in NFT sales out of the $154 million seven-day aggregate. NFT sales from <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> jumped 37.73% higher than ETH-based NFT sales last week. Besides Ethereum, NFT sales from Solana, Immutable X, Polygon, and Cardano followed. In addition to Ethereum&#x2019;s NFT sales increase, Immutable X NFT sales rose 5.20% higher than the week prior.</p>

<p>The top collection in terms of seven-day NFT sales was BAYC as the collection captured $21.84 million in sales this past week. BAYC is followed by Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), Valhalla, Cockpunch by Tim Ferriss, and Azuki. The most expensive NFT sold this week was sold five days ago for $691K and the NFT was BAYC #441. BAYC #441 was followed by BAYC #3,756 sold for $517K and Sandbox Land #92,594 for $202K.</p>

<p>BAYC #2,596 sold for $178K around 24 hours ago and BAYC #785 sold for around $137K. While four out of the top five NFT sales this week were BAYC-related, BAYC NFTs have seen their floor values sink below the Cryptopunks NFTs once again. At the time of writing according to <a href="https://nftpricefloor.com/">metrics</a> from nftpricefloor.com, the current Cryptopunks&#x2019; floor value is higher than BAYC&#x2019;s floor by an estimated 1.5 ether at 1:00 p.m. (ET) on Dec. 14, 2022.</p>

The token rose for a second consecutive day, hitting a key price ceiling in the process. Cardano mainly consolidated on Wednesday, as prices fell from a recent high.</strong></p>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>Solana (SOL) was a notable gainer on Wednesday, as prices surged to a three-week high.</p>
<p>Following a low of $13.61 on Tuesday, SOL/USD raced to an intraday high of $14.68 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>As a result, solana moved to its strongest point since November 26, which is the last time prices were trading above a key ceiling of $14.70.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, this resistance point has yet to be broken following today&#x2019;s gains, with SOL trading at $14.67 as of writing.</p>
<p>The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also rose, and is currently tracking at 48.36, however it also failed to break out of a resistance level.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index remains below a ceiling of 49.00, which appears to be the main obstacle in place, preventing any further surges.</p>

<h2>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>)</h2>
<p>On the other hand, cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>) moved away from a recent eight-day high, as price consolidated ahead of today&#x2019;s FOMC meeting.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>/USD fell to a low of $0.3069 earlier in the day, which comes less than a day after hitting a peak at $0.3152.</p>
<p>This surge in price sent cardano to its strongest point since December 5, which is the last time price was above a ceiling of $0.3270.</p>

<p>From the chart, it can be seen that today&#x2019;s price consolidation began following a failed breakout of the 46.00 ceiling on the RSI indicator.</p>
<p>Currently, the index is tracking at 43.79, with momentum appearing to be heading for a floor at 37.60.</p>
<p>Should price strength reach this point, it is likely that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a> will be trading close to the $0.3000 support level.</p>

Toward the end of the hearing, judge Ferguson-Pratt denied SBF’s request to be released on bail and remanded Bankman-Fried to the Bahamian jail until Feb. 8, 2023.</strong></p>
<h2>Bankman-Fried’s Media Tour Comes to an End, AFR Report Claims FTX Insiders Had a Secret Signal Chat Group Called &#8216;Wirefraud&#8217;</h2>
<p>During the first week of November, the co-founder of FTX Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) world turned upside down. It all started when Coindesk published an <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet/">expose</a> on SBF’s quantitative trading firm Alameda Research and the enormous balance of FTT tokens the company held. After the report, FTX and Alameda were under the spotlight and Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-binance-dumping-all-ftx-tokens-on-its-books-ceo-cites-recent-revelations/">revealed</a> his exchange would be dumping all of its FTT tokens.</p>
<p>These two events fueled speculation that FTX and Alameda were insolvent and on Nov. 8, 2022, Binance <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cz-says-binance-intends-to-fully-acquire-ftx-sam-bankman-fried-confirms-transaction/">said</a> it would purchase FTX after doing due diligence into the company’s financials. However, the deal never panned out, and at 4:00 p.m. (ET) on Nov. 9, 2022, the world’s largest crypto asset exchange by trade volume <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-backs-out-of-ftx-deal-citing-due-diligence-reports-of-mishandled-customer-funds/">announced</a> it would be backing out of purchasing FTX.</p>

<p>At this point in time, all the digital assets from FTX’s coffers were either withdrawn by customers (many of whom were Bahamas natives) or <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/333-million-in-bitcoin-vanished-from-ftx-days-before-the-company-filed-for-bankruptcy-protection/">simply disappeared</a>. Two days after Binance backed out of the deal, SBF <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">announced</a> that FTX and Alameda had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, alongside roughly 130 associated companies.</p>
<p>SBF also revealed he had stepped down from his position as FTX’s CEO and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bankrupt-crypto-exchange-ftx-exploring-sales-of-subsidiaries-ceo-reveals/">John J. Ray III</a> took the position in order to deal with the bankruptcy and restructuring process. Since the bankruptcy filing, SBF embarked on a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/despite-the-former-ftx-ceos-media-tour-many-unanswered-questions-remain/">media tour</a> doing a large number of interviews, while a significant amount of troubling evidence was being reported by numerous media publications.</p>

<p>Prior to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bahamian-ag-and-prime-minister-announce-sam-bankman-frieds-arrest-in-the-bahamas/">SBF’s arrest</a> in The Bahamas, a report published by the Australian Financial Review (AFR) <a href="https://archive.ph/yypG9#selection-1887.19-1887.61">detailed</a> that FTX’s SBF and his inner circle used a secret chat group called “Wirefraud.” AFR’s United States correspondent Matthew Cranston said “[AFR] has [learned] that FTX founders Sam Bankman-Fried and Zixiao ‘Gary’ Wang, along with FTX engineer Nishad Singh and former Alameda Research chief executive <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-alamedas-caroline-ellison-retains-secs-former-enforcement-division-chief/">Caroline Ellison</a>, used a chat group on Signal in the hope that the information would remain hidden.”</p>
<p>24 after the AFR report was published, Bankman-Fried was arrested. The FTX co-founder was also indicted by a federal grand jury in Manhattan, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-co-founder-indicted-by-federal-grand-jury-in-manhattan-bahamian-magistrate-denies-sbfs-bail/">charged</a> with <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/kxfZltq/unsealed-indictment-in-us-v-bankman-fried-22-cr-673-abrams-as-sam-bankman-fried-of-ftx-heads-to-sdny-echoes-of-onecoin-and-un-bribery-cases-pdf">eight counts</a> of financial fraud by the Southern District of New York (SDNY) prosecutor Damian Williams. SBF was further <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-securities-watchdog-charges-sam-bankman-fried-with-fraud-over-ftx-collapse/">charged</a> by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cftc-follows-sec-by-filing-a-lawsuit-against-disgraced-ftx-co-founder-sam-bankman-fried/">sued</a> by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>
<h2>SBF&#8217;s Legal Team Attempts to Get the Co-Founder out of Jail, Bahamian Judge Denies Bail, Disgraced FTX Co-Founder Gets Escorted out of Courthouse in Handcuffs</h2>
<p>The same day, SBF appeared in court and his legal team attempted to get him released on bail. One <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inside-sam-bankman-frieds-first-193142813.html">report</a> notes that Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, SBF’s parents, attended the court hearing. SBF’s mother allegedly laughed out loud every time her son was called a “fugitive,” and his father put his fingers in his ears. His lawyer, Mark Cohen, the attorney who <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-ftx-co-founder-sbf-retains-white-collar-lawyer-who-represented-ghislaine-maxwell/">represented</a> Ghislaine Maxwell during her sex trafficking trial, attempted to get SBF released on $250,000 bail.</p>
<p>Cohen is <a href="https://twitter.com/LJMoynihan/status/1602753039638867969?s=20&amp;t=fl5UHYvZc3-Z1YYHw2LcYA">quoted</a> as saying that his client “suffered from depression, insomnia, and ADD for over a decade.” During the hearing, <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/13/sam-bankman-fried-tells-court-he-plans-to-fight-extradition/">prosecutors argued</a> that SBF was a “flight risk” due to all of his financial connections. However, judge Ferguson-Pratt did not seem swayed by the claims that said SBF suffered from alleged mental issues, and the fact that SBF had surrendered his passport.</p>
<p>Judge Ferguson-Pratt told the court that bail was denied and SBF was to remain in custody until his Feb. 8, 2023 court hearing. Following the decision, the New York Post reports that SBF lowered his head, and gave his parents a hug before being escorted out of the courthouse in handcuffs.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about SBF&#8217;s recent arrest and the accusations that say his inner circle were part of a secret chat group called &#8220;Wirefraud?&#8221; What do you think about the Bahamian judge denying SBF&#8217;s bail? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

Following the data, which saw consumer prices rise to 7.1%, many expect the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates by 50 basis points. Ethereum was also higher today, and stayed close to a five-week high.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) was trading close to the $18,000 level on Wednesday, as markets remained higher following the latest U.S. inflation report.</p>
<p>Following a low of $17,412.19 on Tuesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD surged to a peak of $17,930.09 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>As a result of this move, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> continues to trade close to its highest point since November 9, which is the last time price was above $18,000.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, this recent rise in momentum came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) raced to its highest point since early November.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at the 60.00 mark, which is marginally below a key ceiling at the 60.75 mark.</p>
<p>Should bitcoin climb beyond this point, we could see the coin once again move above the $18,000 point.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was also trading near a multi-week high in today&#x2019;s session, as traders geared up for the U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting.</p>
<p>Many expect the Fed to increase interest rates by 50 basis points, following the better-than-expected inflation report.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD hit a high of $1,341.44 on Wednesday, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a bottom of $1,289.23.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, ethereum remains close to a five-week high, with prices in the green for a third consecutive session.</p>
<p>Like with bitcoin earlier, the RSI is now hovering close to a key resistance level of 59.00, with a current reading of 58.06.</p>
<p>Market pressure could intensify should bulls force a breakout of this hurdle, potentially leading <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> towards $1,400.</p>

Power utilities are detecting their increased consumption and trying to make them pay at commercial rates. </strong></p>
<h2>Amateur Crypto Miners in Russia Under Pressure Despite Lack of Regulation for Home Mining</h2>
<p>Electricity distribution companies in Russia have started to identify improvised mining farms in residential buildings by the rising volume of energy consumption and higher loads on the grid at substations, Deputy Ministry of Energy Pavel Snikkars revealed to the Russian press.</p>
<p>The government official <a href="https://iz.ru/1437732/mariia-kolobova/stanovlenie-suda-v-rossii-nachali-vyiavliat-nezakonnykh-mainerov-v-zhilykh-domakh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> the daily Izvestia that authorities are going after the “illegal miners.” While crypto mining is yet to be regulated and such activities are not explicitly prohibited right now, utilities can prove in courts that these consumers are not using the electricity for domestic needs.</p>
<p>Lawyers interviewed by the newspaper said that in at least 10 cases so far, the suppliers have been able to oblige home miners to cover the difference between the preferential tariffs for the general population and the higher rates that businesses are required to pay.</p>
<p>When increased power consumption triggers their suspicions, the utilities would initially send an inspector to check and issue a new invoice based on the price of electricity used for commercial purposes, Snikkars explained. Eventually, they could try to prove their claims in court.</p>
<p>Irkutskenergosbyt, the electricity distributer in the energy-rich region of Irkutsk dubbed “the mining capital of Russia,” was among the first to deal with the issue in 2021. According to a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-miners-in-russias-irkutsk-region-fined-almost-1-7-million-this-year/">report</a> in August of this year, crypto miners in the Siberian oblast, where rates start at just $0.01 per kWh in rural districts, have already paid 100 million rubles in fines (almost $1.7 million at the time).</p>

<h2>Home Crypto Mining Blamed for Problems With Electricity Supplies in Some Regions</h2>
<p>Pavel Snikkars <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-expects-sizable-increase-in-crypto-miners-share-of-power-usage/">unveiled</a> last week that Russia expects a sizable increase in the share of cryptocurrency miners in its total consumption of electrical power. He also emphasized that at-home mining is a big problem in certain areas where the infrastructure is not capable of handling the loads and energy companies have been taking measures to ensure reliable supplies for other users.</p>
<p>Russian crypto mining needs about 1.7 GW of electricity, 50 &#8211; 60% of which is utilized in the industrial segment of the market, according to Oleg Ogienko, director for government relations at Bitriver, one of Russia’s largest mining farm operators.</p>
<p>Mining is one of the crypto-related activities that the Russian government wants to legalize and regulate in order to take advantage of the country’s competitive advantages for the industry such as cheap energy resources and cool climate conditions.</p>
<p>In November, a group of lawmakers <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/amendments-to-russias-digital-asset-law-aim-to-allow-mining-ban-crypto-exchange-and-ads/">filed</a> a bill with the lower house of parliament designed to regulate the minting of digital currencies like bitcoin through amendments to the country’s existing law “On Digital Financial Assets.” The legislation was backed by the Bank of Russia and expectations are that it will be adopted by the end of the year.</p>

The launch will officially commence on 14th December, 2022.

<p><b>What’s there to know?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As stated in the official disclosure, the second iteration of Dvision World will include numerous features which will be released in an unprecedented manner. This includes the long-awaited release of Meta-City Seoul, the PET system known as &#8220;Ondoll,&#8221; and even a Play-to-Earn (P2E) model attached to their LAND NFTs, ensuring their sustainability and uniqueness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was indicated that the upgraded version of Dvision’s metaverse will have significantly improved UI and UX, and it has already demonstrated certain aspects of its virtual reality (VR) by regularly uploading video fragments to their official </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Dvision_network/status/1602184220184805376"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter handle.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The outlook of the characters in the new Dvision World will additionally be updated. Users can select their character&#8217;s outlook from a variety of futuristic character designs. Moreover, Dvision users can finally purchase ‘PET NFTs’ to fight monsters in their first Meta-sustainable City&#8217;s version of P2E and experience the redesigned P2E concept within Dvision Network.</span></p>
<p><b>What is a Meta-city?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dvision established the concept of &#8216;Meta-City&#8217; as a central component of its metaverse. A Meta-City is essentially a collection of Meta-Spaces (LAND) that create in-game content for users to use on a larger scale. Meta-Space is a limited-edition NFT item that represents the digital real estate available in Dvision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the aforementioned new update, there will now be a new city as ‘Seoul’ shall be opened to the public with thousands of users being able to explore the Meta-city openly and with no restraints. Dozens of new NFTs to use in the metaverse like cars, UFOs, and more will be available as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dvision Network previously introduced a new NFT staking solution to improve the usability of digital plots, and as a result, the team has already completed three successful LAND sales across multiple platforms. Additionally, thousands of LANDs have been sold via platforms like Binance NFT, Shopify, OpenSea, and NFTb.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The LAND staking function was the first utility to be connected with the digital plots before the official launch of the &#8216;Meta-Cities,&#8217; where the LANDs were utilized to introduce content created by individuals within the Dvision Metaverse.</span></p>
