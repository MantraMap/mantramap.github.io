<ul><li>Tesla Inc.&#8217;s crypto holdings remained unchanged for the fourth consecutive quarter.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto assets on the EV giant’s balance sheet are worth $184 million as of June 30, 2023.&nbsp;</li><li>The company’s digital asset holdings were revealed in the earnings report for the second quarter of FY 2023.&nbsp;</li><li>Tesla’s last Bitcoin trade was back in Q1’2022 when it offloaded 75% of its BTC holdings.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Tesla Inc, the largest electric vehicle manufacturer in the world, has maintained the same crypto holdings for a fourth consecutive quarter. In the earnings report for the second quarter of 2023, the EV giant revealed that it held $184 million worth of digital assets on its balance sheet as of June 30, 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Tesla Stock (TSLA) Tanks 3% Ahead Of Q2 Earnings Report</strong></h2>



<p>According to the <a href="https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/TSLA-Q2-2023-Update.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">earnings report</a> released by Tesla earlier today, no crypto assets were bought or sold in the second quarter of 2023. The last sale came in the second quarter of 2022 when the EV giant sold 75% of its Bitcoin holdings for $936 million. The latest numbers indicated that the company didn’t cash in on the recent BTC rally that took its price to a 1-year high of $31,000. The company’s share price dropped nearly 3% earlier today. The stock was trading at $291 at market close. </p>



<p>Tesla’s crypto holdings have remained consistent since the last quarter of 2022. Until September 30, 2022, the carmaker held $218 million worth of digital assets on its balance sheet. The company’s first Bitcoin purchase came in early 2021 when it spent a whopping $1.5 billion on the flagship cryptocurrency. This was followed by a rally in BTC’s price after CEO Elon Musk indicated that customers could purchase his electric vehicles by paying in BTC. However, the ambitious plan was abandoned after Musk cited environmental concerns associated with BTC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tesla and Elon Musk are currently facing a class action lawsuit filed by investors of Dogecoin. The investors are accusing Musk and his EV company of manipulating the price of the meme token and netting billions at their expense. The lawsuit cited a series of crypto wallets allegedly owned by Tesla; however, the latest response by <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/elon-musk-offensive-in-dogecoin-lawsuit/">Musk</a> claimed that his EV company was not associated with the wallets listed in the complaint.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Societe Generale, the third largest bank in France, has obtained a license from the country’s top market regulator to offer crypto products and services. The regulatory approval was given to the bank’s crypto division, Societe Generale Forge (SG Forge) by the Autorité des Marchés Financiers’ (AMF), and was the first crypto license granted to a crypto entity in France.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>License Will Aid The Development of Societe Generale’s EURCV Stablecoin</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.sgforge.com/first-dasp-license-amf/" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> by SG Forge, the regulatory license approval from the AMF will allow the firm to offer services, including trading, sales, exchange, and custody of crypto assets in the country. Several mainstream crypto entities, including crypto exchange Binance, are registered with France’s top market regulator, but SG Forge is the first licensed digital asset service provider (DASP) in the country. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“With the DASP license approval, Societe Generale – FORGE confirms its pioneering role in the crypto assets ecosystem. This step will allow us to continue supporting our institutional clients wishing to benefit from services on digital assets that meet the highest standards of compliance and banking security.” </p><cite>Jean-Marc Stenger, Chief Executive Officer of Societe Generale-FORGE</cite></blockquote>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/french-investment-bank-societe-generale-withdraws-7-million-from-makerdao/">Societe Generale</a> previously registered with the AMF in September last year. As a licensed digital asset service provider, SG Forge will be required to follow local rules related to business conduct, financial disclosures, etc., in the interest of regulatory compliance and investor protection. </p>



<p>The banking giant stated that the regulatory approval would allow it to be compliant with the recently approved Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) rules, which require all crypto firms to be licensed from a European nation by 2025 to operate in the European Union. SG Forge added that the license was an important step for developing its Euro Convertible (EURCV) stablecoin, which was deployed on Ethereum in April this year.</p>

<p>Transfers from whales &#8211; the term assigned to wallets with large holdings of cryptocurrencies in on-chain addresses &#8211; are not uncommon in crypto. Observers and participants usually monitor these whales as their activity, whether buying, selling, or moving coins around, could impact token prices or market sentiment. </p>



<p>When crypto whales withdrew huge amounts of a token from an exchange, for example, some might take it as a bullish signal that large holders expect the market to run upwards. </p>



<p>Conversely, crypto whales depositing a large number of coins on an exchange could signal an incoming sell-off or bearish sentiment.</p>

<p>Do Kwon’s Terraform Labs has tapped a former executive to serve as its new Chief Executive Officer. The crypto firm behind the crypto contagion of 2022 which wiped $40 billion from the crypto market, has appointed Chris Amani as its new CEO. Amani previously served as Terraform’s Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. </p>



<h2><strong>Terraform Labs Has No Plans To Launch A New Stablecoin</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jailed-crypto-tycoon-do-kwons-company-appoints-new-ceo-d58fa058" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>, Terraform Labs promoted Chris Amani to the role of Chief Executive while co-founder and former CEO <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-4-month-montenegro-forgery/">Do Kwon</a> serves a four-month prison sentence in Montenegro. Amani stated in an interview that he had a vision to salvage the company, however, it would be a long-term commitment with considerable challenges along the way. </p>



<p>Chris Amani reportedly took over the role of CEO last year after Do Kwon disappeared following the crash of UST and LUNA. However, he stepped down from the role in March this year after Kwon was arrested in Montenegro. Terraform said in a statement to WSJ that on May 27, 2023, he also vacated the post of Company Director to focus on “personal legal affairs”.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We wish Do the best and we hope that he’s able to clear himself of all charges. But while he’s incarcerated and while he’s facing his own legal challenges, it just makes sense for us to continue on without him.” </p><cite>CEO Chris Amani on Do Kwon</cite></blockquote>



<p>The new CEO clarified that Terraform Labs had no plans to launch a new stablecoin following the dramatic crash of its TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin in May last year. Chris Amani stated that his company would instead focus on different products that would deliver “real utility” for its users. Terraform currently has about 40 employees, 15 of whom were with the firm before last year’s crash.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Constance Zhe Wang, previously recognized as Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s right-hand woman in capital raising, has resurfaced in the crypto space months after crypto exchange FTX collapsed last winter. </p>



<p>Wang, who played a significant role in FTX&#8217;s ascent, is now leading the gaming division at cryptocurrency fund Sino Global Capital after previous roles at Credit Suisse and Huobi, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/ex-ftx-chief-operating-officer-constance-wang-joins-vc-firm-sino-global-capital?sref=3REHEaVI" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/ex-ftx-chief-operating-officer-constance-wang-joins-vc-firm-sino-global-capital?sref=3REHEaVI" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a>. </p>



<p>Notably, Sino Global was founded in 2015 by Matthew Graham, another close associate of Bankman-Fried. Matthew reportedly invested in SBF&#8217;s crypto exchange and maintained close ties with the so-called &#8220;effective altruism&#8221; proponent. </p>



<p>Wang&#8217;s transition to Sino Global marks a new chapter for the former FTX executive, whose previous involvement in running Bankman-Fried&#8217;s crypto empire has not led to any legal implications.</p>



<p>Despite being subpoenaed by federal authorities in the Bankman-Fried case, Wang has not faced any criminal charges or allegations as of yet. </p>

<h2>Ex Execs Move On From FTX, 3AC, Other Crashed Crypto Businesses</h2>



<p>Following the collapse of several crypto entities in 2022, former executives have moved on to other ventures amid controversy and media attention. </p>



<p>Not only Wang but former FTX US President Brett Harrison announced a new venture after SBF&#8217;s crypto exchange blew up last November. Harrison&#8217;s software developer Architect Financial Technologies raised $5 million in seed funding from entities like Coinbase Ventures. </p>



<p>Three Arrows Capital co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies also started a new crypto exchange focused on trading bankruptcy claims. The platform called <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/opnx-ecosystem-partner-3ac-ventures/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/opnx-ecosystem-partner-3ac-ventures/" rel="noreferrer noopener">OPNX</a>, an acronym for Open Exchange pulled leaders from other embattled crypto businesses like CoinFLEX and raised $25 million in initial capital.</p>

<ul><li>The new governance model will feature an ecosystem council as part of a three-pillar framework, Polygon’s blog post noted.</li><li>The re-engineered governance also includes an improved proposal framework and a two-phase community treasury to back exciting projects.</li><li>Today&#8217;s announcement follows shortly after the team disclosed its new native token POL for multichain validation.</li></ul>



<p>The team behind Ethereum scaling protocol Polygon shared plans for a re-engineered governance system built to bootstrap improved decentralized oversight and community control in its layer 2 ecosystem.</p>



<p>According to Wednesday&#8217;s <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-2-0-governance" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-2-0-governance" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, the new governance model aims to merge Polygon&#8217;s underlying ethos with a community-centered approach to expanding the burgeoning layer 2 network based on Ethereum&#8217;s battle-hardened framework. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Polygon technology already expands Ethereum’s blockspace; the proposed governance framework seeks to extend Ethereum’s ethos and the proven model for building a flourishing community. </p></blockquote>



<p>The revamped governance is built on three pillars the team said including an overhauled Polygon Improvement Proposal (PIP) structure, an ecosystem council dedicated to smart contract upgrades, and a two-phase community treasury to back exciting native projects. </p>



<p>&#8220;The separation of powers and competencies will allow for scalable and efficient governance mechanisms that minimize and compartmentalize the overall governance process.&#8221; the team emphasized in today&#8217;s blog post. </p>



<h2>Polygon Roadmap 2.0</h2>



<p>The new &#8220;three pillar governance&#8221; framework is a part of the team&#8217;s strategy for developing a network of Layer 2 chains built on zero-knowledge or zk technology. Roadmap 2.0 is said to set Polygon apart from other layer 2 networks with features like Supernets and a new token capable of multichain validation. </p>



<p>Indeed, the team <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/polygon-transition-matic-tokens-pol/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/polygon-transition-matic-tokens-pol/" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a new coin dubbed POL that would replace its initial native token MATIC. The introduction of POL is currently under community review and users will have no less than four years to offload their old MATIC tokens if the proposal is approved. </p>

<ul><li>The Manhattan federal court has sentenced EminiFX CEO Eddy Alexandre to nine years in prison.&nbsp;</li><li>Alexandre defrauded over 25,000 investors out of $248 million through his crypto and forex platform.&nbsp;</li><li>The sentence came more than four months after the crypto fraudster pled guilty to commodities fraud.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The Manhattan federal court has handed EminiFX founder and CEO Eddy Alexandre a nine-year sentence for perpetrating a <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/crypto-leaders-ripple-xrp-sec-judgement/">crypto</a> ponzi scheme and netting hundreds of millions of dollars from thousands of investors. The sentence came more than four months after Alexandre pled guilty to commodities fraud earlier this year. </p>



<h2><strong>Over 25,000 Investors Defrauded Through Crypto &amp; Forex Platform</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-18/crypto-fund-fraudster-gets-nine-years-for-249-million-scheme" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, U.S. District Judge John Cronan sentenced Eddy Alexandre to nine years in prison for perpetrating a ponzi scheme and defrauding over 25,000 investors out of more than $248 million through his crypto and forex platform. The EminiFX CEO previously agreed to forfeit $248.8 million as part of his plea deal. </p>



<p>Alexandre managed to net over $248 million between September 2021 and May 2022. He lured more than 25,000 investors by offering attractive returns of 5% per week. However, the crypto and forex platform was operated as a multilevel marketing scheme, where old investors were encouraged to get new users for the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Most egregiously, Alexandre recruited many of his investors by exploiting his position of trust within his church and the Haitian community, even going so far as to enlist members of the church to help recruit EminiFX investors.” </p><cite>Damian Williams, the U.S Attorney for the Southern District of New York</cite></blockquote>



<p>As per a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ceo-cryptocurrency-and-forex-trading-platform-sentenced-nine-years-prison-240-million" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> by the United States Department of Justice, Eddy Alexandre invested a fraction of the money entrusted to him. However, the limited investments blew up, leading to millions of dollars in losses. He also diverted approximately $14.7 million to his personal bank account and splurged over $155,000 of customer funds to buy a BMW for himself. His lavish spending also included a $13,000 payment to Mercedes Benz. </p>

<ul><li>A Nevada court has ordered crypto custodian Prime Trust to be put into receivership.&nbsp;</li><li>The former CEO of the Bank of Nevada has been appointed as the troubled custodian’s receiver.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto custodian currently owes more than $85 million in fiat and digital assets to its clients.&nbsp;</li><li>The receivership comes amid a cash shortage and allegations of misappropriation of customer funds.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Crypto custody firm Prime Trust has been placed into receivership by a Nevada court less than a month after a state regulator ordered the troubled firm to suspend operations. The latest development comes over a year and a half after the firm reportedly lost access to some of the wallets that stored crypto assets belonging to its clients. State regulators have accused the custodian of misappropriating customer funds.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Former Bank of Nevada CEO Appointed As Prime Trust’s Receiver</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-18/troubled-crypto-firm-prime-trust-put-into-receivership-in-nevada#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada ordered Las Vegas-based Prime Trust into receivership after the Nevada Financial Institutions Division requested the appointment of a receiver citing insufficient funds to meet customer withdrawal demands. Former Bank of Nevada CEO John Guedry was appointed as the receiver of the embattled crypto custodian. </p>



<p>Guedry will oversee the day-to-day operations of Prime Trust and make decisions in the best interest of its clients. As the receiver, the former Bank of Nevada executive is not authorized to approve any expenses over $500,000 without getting the court’s approval. The next hearing for this matter has been scheduled for August 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Court, having reviewed the points and authorities along with relevant exhibits filed in support of the Petition, including the consent of Respondent, finds good cause to grant the Petition.” </p><cite>Nevada court on the petition for receivership</cite></blockquote>



<p>The receivership of Prime Trust comes less than one month after an acquisition deal with rival crypto custodian BitGo fell apart. This was followed by an <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/prime-trust-suspend-withdrawal-bitgo-deal/">order</a> from the Nevada Financial Institution Division, directing the troubled custodian to shut down operations. The crypto custodian currently owes its clients more than $85 million in fiat and digital assets. Court filings showed that the firm had less than $3 million left. </p>

<ul><li>Celsius has won court approval to settle the bankruptcy fight with its preferred shareholders.&nbsp;</li><li>The bankrupt crypto lender will pay $25 million instead of prolonging the lawsuit potentially costing it $600 million.&nbsp;</li><li>Preferred shareholders had sued the lender last year over repayment priorities following clawbacks and asset sales.&nbsp;</li><li>The settlement comes a week after Celsius settled with two large preferred shareholders over mining asset claims.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-celsius-claims-live-on-open-exchange/">Celsius</a> Network has received the bankruptcy court’s nod to proceed with a deal that will put an end to one of its longest-running legal battles in its Chapter 11 proceedings. The bankrupt crypto lender is set to settle a lawsuit filed by its preferred shareholders amid its bankruptcy case. The shareholders had sued the lender in September last year to stake their claim in its bankruptcy payouts. </p>



<h2><strong>Celsius’ CEL Token Jumps 14% After Settlement News</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-18/celsius-approved-to-pay-shareholders-25-million-in-bankruptcy?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Judge Martin Glen of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York approved Celsius’ deal to settle the case by paying $25 million to the owners of its preferred stock. Company attorney Christopher S. Koenig revealed in the court hearing earlier today that prolonging the legal battle would have added to the bankrupt crypto lender’s legal bills. He added that the lender could’ve owed as much as $600 million to the preferred shareholders in the event of a defeat. </p>



<p>The settlement deal comes more than nine months after the preferred shareholders initially sued the bankrupt crypto lender to ensure the clawbacks of their investments as well as lay claim to the proceeds of asset sales. At the time, the shareholders expressed their concerns about the Chapter 11 proceedings being heavily focused on retail customers rather than the initial investors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per the settlement deal, equity investors who wish to extract further funds from the Celsius Network are free to pursue litigation in the bankruptcy court. The $25 million payment will reportedly be made using the proceeds of one of Celsius’ crypto service businesses. The bankrupt platform’s native token CEL jumped over 14% following the news of the settlement deal.&nbsp;</p>
