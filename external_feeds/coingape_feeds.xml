										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1280" height="853" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/05231233/NYAG.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The New York Attorney General’s Office (NYAG) has introduced legislation aimed at protecting cryptocurrency investors from fraud. The proposed bill would require companies dealing in </span><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/"><span style="font-weight: 400">digital currencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to adhere to certain standards and disclose key information to their investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/NewYorkStateAG/status/1654482730313216005"><span style="font-weight: 400">update</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from the NYAG, Letitia James, the law will force cryptocurrency firms to refund victims of fraudulent activities. That means any company dealing in cryptocurrencies will reimburse customers who fall victim to scams or hacking attacks. Interestingly, this move is seen as an attempt by lawmakers to protect consumers from risks associated with investing in digital currencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the proposed legislation is built on the existing legal framework for traditional financial services, where banks and other financial institutions are required to provide a level of protection to their customers. The aim is to give investors in the cryptocurrency space the same level of protection as those in the traditional financial markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the legislation is passed, it will be a significant step forward for the crypto industry. Until now, there has been little regulation in this sector, which has allowed many </span><a href="https://coingape.com/cftc-bids-against-sec-in-a-new-crypto-fraud-case-defines-digital-assets-as-commodities/"><span style="font-weight: 400">fraudulent activities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to go unchecked. As such, the introduction of this new legislation could change all of that.</span></p>
<h2><b>Significant Benefits of the New Law</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Majorly, this new law would increase consumer confidence in the cryptocurrency market. A lot of individuals are hesitant to invest in digital currencies because of the fear of losing their money due to a lack of regulation and legal protection. However, if companies are required to offer refunds to victims of scams and thefts, this could go a long way toward reassuring potential investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, the proposed legislation would force cryptocurrency firms to take security more seriously. Many companies in the space have been relaxed about implementing adequate security measures, which has made them vulnerable to hacking attacks. If the firms know that they will be held accountable for any losses suffered by their customers, they will be more likely to prioritize security.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, the proposed legislation to force cryptocurrency firms to refund fraud victims is a welcome development for many in the industry. Recall that in January, the chief financial regulator in the state of New York </span><a href="https://coingape.com/state-takes-new-step-for-crypto-regulation/"><span style="font-weight: 400">released new guidance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that dictates that companies separate the crypto assets of their customers from their own. </span></p>

Today, the prices witnessed a 108% rally as the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-to-list-pepe-coin-amid-meme-coin-hype/?utm_source=trendingnewsslider">Binance</a> and some other famous exchanges announced their listing plans which suggest this popular coin will get a massive inflow of trades. Here’s what the future holds for PEPE as per the technical analysis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A massive growth in any asset price is usually followed by a correction to stabilize the price trend for further growth</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The higher price rejection candles at $0.000014 reflect the exhausted bullish momentum</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP is $1.42 Billion, indicating a 292.5% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/4/4UsMY9jB.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pepecoin continues to witness remarkable growth as more popular crypto exchanges are <a href="https://coingape.com/pepe-price-shoots-106-as-kucoin-crypto-com-announce-listing/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall">announcing their listing</a> for this trending meme cryptocurrency. Today, the coin showed a 108% growth and marked a new All-Time high at $0.0000014, while its current market cap reached $1.5 Billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the hourly chart shows a high wick rejection at the ATH level indicating that short-term investors are booking their profit. If the coin price formed a local top at $0.0000014, the coin holders are likely to witness a significant rally.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: U<a href="https://coingape.com/uniswap-data-on-pepe-coin-reveals-real-picture-of-memecoin-craze/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall">niswap Data On PEPE Coin Reveals Real Picture Of Memecoin Craze</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a massive growth, the correction phase is common and in fact, beneficial to check price stability at reclaimed levels. As per the Fibonacci retracement tool, the potential correction may revisit the $0.00000315, or $0.0000025 mark to meet the 23.6% and 38.2% FIB levels respectively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors should closely watch these crucial levels to grab pullback opportunities as a more direct rally is unlikely until this <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/">memecoin</a> gains some other external news.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the hourly chart, the 20-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> acts as excellent dynamic support to assist buyers during occasion pullbacks.</span></p>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overbought <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> also indicates the buying activity has overextended and the prices are likely to witness a correction phase.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">XRP Intraday Price Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.0000038</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Up</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.000004 and $0.0000045</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.00000315 and $0.0000025</span></li>

On the other side, the focus of majority crypto traders is now on memecoins like Pepe Coin, as the token continues to register huge growth since launch in the last three weeks. Meanwhile, amid rising regulatory pressure around the crypto market, the XRP token holder community still holds together in anticipation of the ruling from Judge Analisa Torres in the SEC lawsuit.</p>

<p>In recent times, the prolonged wait for the lawsuit Summary Judgement had a direct impact of the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP price</a>. Despite significant rise in crypto prices since January 1, 2023, the token did not see a proportionate increase.</p>
<h2>XRP Lawyer Confident Of Community Strength</h2>
<p>John Deaton, the attorney representing XRP token holders in the SEC lawsuit, expressed confidence that the community support will work in favor of Judge Torres&#8217; decision. He <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1654445114515771393" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made</a> the comment in context of speculation on Coinbase listing XRP and Ripple&#8217;s XRPL using the token.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I am confident (Judge) Torres recognizes the huge public interest and will act accordingly. I believe she shoots down the SEC’s crazy over broad theory but until we read the exact language no one can predict whether Coinbase or even Ripple will list XRP on their platforms immediately.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

Prosecutors have been investigating and collecting pieces of evidence related to the Terra-LUNA crisis for longer periods than the U.S. and are in the best position to bring justice to victims that lost almost $40 billion.</p>
<h2>Terra Founder Do Kwon Extradition to South Korea</h2>
<p>Dan Sung-han, director at the Seoul Southern District Prosecutor’s Office, says Terra co-founder <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Do Kwon</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> should be extradited to South Korea rather than the US, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/south-korean-prosecutor-calls-for-crypto-entrepreneur-do-kwon-to-face-charges-in-home-country-639f5515?" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> Wall Street Journal on May 5. He believes m</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">ost of the evidence and Terra affiliates are in South Korea and prosecutors are best prepared for court proceedings.</span></p>
<p>South Korean prosecutor acknowledges that the Terra-LUNA crisis helped advance discussions on the need for tighter regulation of the crypto industry.</p>
<p>South Korea and the United States are currently seeking the extradition of Do Kwon from Montenegro. He was detained in March by authorities and indicted for using fake passports and documents to board a flight to Dubai.</p>
<p>On March 29, Montenegro’s <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-news-fugitive-do-kwon-might-be-handover-to-s-korea-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minister of Justice Marko Kovac stated</a> the extradition decision will be taken in a separate court proceeding after the passport forgery case. Moreover, extradition depends on several factors, including the severity of crimes, location of committed offenses, sequence of requests, and nationality.</p>
<p>South Korean prosecutors also tried getting an arrest warrant against co-founder <strong>Daniel Shin</strong> for the second time. However, the court <a href="https://coingape.com/montenegro-court-rejects-do-kwons-appeal-terras-daniel-shin-arrest-reviewed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejected prosecutors’ request for an arrest warrant</a>, citing no risk of flight or destroying evidence.</p>
<p>Prosecutor’s Office indicted Terra co-founder Daniel Shin and seven others without detention for multiple charges including fraud, breach of duty, and embezzlement. South Korean prosecutors are tracking Terra transactions and revealed that <a href="https://coingape.com/prosecutors-terra-do-kwon-still-have-bitcoin-in-swiss-bank-indicts-daniel-shin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Do Kwon still has Bitcoin</a> worth millions in a Swiss bank.</p>

<h2>Terra (LUNA) and Terra Classic (LUNC) Price Fall</h2>
<p>Terra (LUNA) and Terra Classic (LUNC) prices are in downfall since the arrest of Do Kwon. On March 23, LUNA and LUNC prices crashed by 8% and 4%, respectively.</p>
<p>In the last 24 hours, LUNA price fell 1% to $1.21 and LUNC price tumbled 2% to $0.000103. The trading volume continues to be lower, but the projects are seeking a revival through its experienced developer teams.</p>

The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memecoin</a> craze in the last one week has been so high that it is standing put among the cryptocurrencies clocking highest transaction volumes. It hardly took the coin two weeks of time to break into the top 100 club of tokens with largest market capitalization. On Friday, PEPE crossed the $1 billion market cap, thanks to a 92% rise in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the daily trading volume for the cryptocurrency is highly impressive, overtaking some of the busiest cryptocurrencies. Also, other memecoins have also launched in quick succession after PEPE&#8217;s launch. As a result, the <a href="https://coingape.com/category/ethereum-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> gas fees went up to the 12 month high level.</p>
<h2>PEPE Coin Trades Get $10 Million Worth ETH Gas Burn</h2>
<p>According to Uniswap <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/thiccythot_/status/1654343137396142080" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data</a>, PEPE Coin traders have burned around 5,300 ETH worth $10 million in gas fee over the past 3 weeks. This was due to as many as 413,283 PEPE Uniswap transactions in the same period, which is since April 28, 2023. Meanwhile, CoinGape recently <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-to-list-pepe-coin-amid-meme-coin-hype/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that crypto exchange Binance is about to list Pepe Coin. Binance said it will list two spot trading pairs PEPE/USDT and PEPE/TUSD on May 5, 2023.</p>

The daily chart showed multiple short-body candles with long wicks indicating indecisiveness among market participants. The coin price trading at $0.46 with an insignificant significant loss of 0.02% reflects no sign of conviction from buyers or sellers. However, here is the crucial level in the technical chart that can assist the XRP price to trigger a significant rally.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the ongoing downfall, the decreasing volume activity indicates the correction phase is temporary. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakout above the overhead resistance trendline will signal an uptrend resumption.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP is $730.5 Million, indicating a 2.22% loss.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/i/IhBYDG1I.png" alt="XRP Price" width="1946" height="1104" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the ongoing uncertainty, the XRP price strictly responds to two technical levels which are $0.44 support and a downsloping trendline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $0.44 support aligned with the 50% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">Fibonacci retracement level</a> forms a strong support zone for buyers to reaccumulate this altcoin. Moreover, the retracement to the 0.5 FIB is considered healthy for an overall uptrend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side, the downsloping is carrying the ongoing correction phase in the XRP price. The coin price turned down from this overhead trendline twice indicating the sellers are recuperating the supply pressure at this resistance.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/top-crypto-margin-trading-platforms-in-australia/">Top 10 Crypto Margin Trading Platforms In Australia</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, until the two aforementioned levels are intact the XRP price may remain in a no-trading zone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case the XRP price breaks the $0.44 support, the coin holders may witness an extended downfall to the $0.4 psychological level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a breakout above the trendline will signal the end of the correction phase.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Bollinger Band: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The XRP price trading below the midline and lower band of the <a href="https://coingape.com/education/bollinger-band/">Bollinger band indicator</a> projects the market trend is currently under the seller’s control</span></p>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A downtick in the daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> reflects selling momentum is strong.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">XRP Intraday Price Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.45</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Sideways</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.485 and $0.56</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.44 and $0.4</span></li>

It will broaden the New York State Attorney General Office&#8217;s authority over crypto firms that operate in New York.</p>
<p>New York regulatory actions against the crypto industry have diminished the growth of the sector in New York. After introducing the BitLicense requirement and a two-year moratorium on new permits for proof-of-work crypto mining, New York is taking further regulatory actions to vex the cryptocurrency industry.</p>
<h2>New York Proposes Bill To Regulate Crypto</h2>
<p class="GI74Re nDgy9d">New York Attorney General Letitia James <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-05/new-york-ag-proposes-landmark-crypto-law-citing-dysfunction#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">proposes</a> the Crypto Regulation, Protection, Transparency and Oversight Act (CRPTO) bill to further tighten rules over cryptocurrency companies in the state. The bill will be submitted for consideration in the New York State Senate and Assembly legislative session starting June 8.</p>
<p>The bill will increase the New York Attorney General Office&#8217;s enforcement authority of cryptocurrency firms. In addition, codifying the New York State Department of Financial Services’ jurisdiction to license crypto firms and oversee the state’s digital asset licensing regime.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Rampant fraud and dysfunction have become the hallmarks of cryptocurrency and it is time to bring law and order to the multi-billion-dollar industry. These commonsense regulations will bring more transparency and oversight to the industry and strengthen our ability to crack down on those that don’t pay respect to the law.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Under the CRPTO Act, crypto exchanges and firms will be required to publish audited financial statements, reimburse customers in case of fraud, keep custody of customers’ funds, and lend out or borrow customers&#8217; funds. In case of violations, issue subpoenas and impose civil penalties of $10,000 per violation for each individual or $100,000 per violation for each crypto firm.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency industry is in need of regulation and oversight. However, over-regulation and burden will restrict the growth of the innovative industry. The crypto industry had criticized New York’s BitLicense and moratorium on cryptocurrency mining.</p>

This move is a significant step forward for the Cardano ecosystem as it aims to improve the performance, scalability, and security of its blockchain, as well as reinforces the potential of its transformative technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For clarity, Hydra is a layer-2 scaling solution that aims to allow Cardano to process up to 1 million transactions per second, as it pivots to become one of the fastest and most efficient blockchains in the market. Notably, this is a significant improvement over existing layer-1 solutions like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which can only handle a fraction of this volume.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the launch of Hydra is a long due development for the Cardano community, as it has been in development for several years. The protocol has undergone rigorous testing and auditing to ensure that it is resilient, secure, and scalable enough to support the growing demands of the Cardano ecosystem.</span></p>
<p>Talking about what comes next, Input Output HK said the core development &#8220;team plans to focus on driving Hydra’s adoption through various use cases, such as payments, auctions, and voting. To achieve this, IOG encourages users to start building on Hydra while welcoming user requests that will unlock new use cases that will be considered for future releases.&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2><b>Hydra&#8217;s Impact on the Future of Cardano</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Majorly, the launch shows that Cardano is committed to improving its technology and staying ahead of the curve. As other blockchains struggle with scalability. Cardano’s investment in Hydra gives it a competitive edge and positions it as a visible solution for enterprise-level applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, Hydra’s launch also highlights the growing importance of layer-2 scaling solutions in the blockchain space. As more developers and enterprises look to leverage the benefits of blockchain technology, scalability and performance become critical factors in their decision-making. Hence, solutions like Hydra offer a significant improvement in these areas, making blockchain technology more accessible and practical for real-world use cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Likewise, the launch of Hydra will boost Cardano&#8217;s usage and likely boost ADA accumulation which in turn will help </span><a href="https://coingape.com/cardano-ada-price-is-breaking-above-key-levels-will-it-hit-1-in-2023/"><span style="font-weight: 400">push the price</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> as has been projected by many. Recall that ADA </span><a href="https://coingape.com/recent-development-take-cardano-ada-price/"><span style="font-weight: 400">price jumped 6% in a day </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">shortly after Cardano launched Aiken, the programming language and toolkit for simplifying the development of smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the improved performance and scalability of Cardano’s Hydra protocol, Cardano is well-positioned to catalyze the adoption of blockchain technology and drive innovation in various industries. As we look forward to the future, we can expect more developments like Hydra that will continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with blockchain technology.</span></p>

The frog-themed meme coin PEPE hype has especially caused Ethereum gas fees to hit a yearly high.</p>
<p>The high gas fee is making transactions costly for users, while also pushing up prices amid demand for meme coins such as PEPE.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Gas Fees Reaches Yearly High</h2>
<p>According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://etherscan.io/gastracker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data</a> by Etherscan, the average gas prices reached 94 gwei and even hit a high of 184 gwei on May 5. The massive jump in Ethereum gas fees is due to the increase in demand for meme coins on the Ethereum network, making transaction costs higher.</p>
<p>The hype surrounding PEPE meme coin and profits made by investors by trading in the meme coin is causing most people to swap their crypto including other meme coins to PEPE through Uniswap. The average transaction cost on Uniswap has jumped to $32.60.</p>
<p>As per data, transactions on Uniswap alone have burned over 15,000 ETH in the last 7 days. Uniswap currently accounts for 35% of gas fees, becoming the top &#8220;Gas Guzzler&#8221; in the last few days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="800" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/13143034/bitcoin.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="BTC Price Prediction" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://coingape.com/markets/bitcoin-price-prediction/">Bitcoin Price Prediction</a>: Over the past three weeks, the Bitcoin price has been moving sideways to take a temporary break from the prevailing uptrend. Moreover, this consolidation has been strictly resonating between two converging trendlines indicating the formation of the symmetrical triangle pattern. In theory, this pattern is a continuation pattern that encourages the resumption of prior recovery upon the breakout of its overhead trendline. Here’s how you may trade this chart pattern.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bitcoin price moving within the triangle can be considered a no-trading zone</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakdown from either trendline of the triangle pattern will determine the future trend</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $16.2 Billion, indicating an 18.5% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/t/TRqrKt18.png" alt="Bitcoin Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">Bitcoin price</a> trades at the $29180 mark with an intraday gain of 0.85%. However, the daily candle shows a higher price rejection at the pattern’s resistance trendline indicating that the sellers continue to defend this level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This rejection candle increases the chances of price reversal which may tumble the prices by barely 2% and hit the lower trendline. Therefore, the Bitcoin price may continue the sideways trend until this pattern is intact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, the symmetrical triangle encourages the resumption of the prior trend, which therefore will bolster buyers to break the overhead trendline. A daily candle closing above the trendline will offer an entry opportunity and offers buyers a flipped support to raise the prices higher.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The post-breakout rally may surge the prices 8% higher to challenge the last swing high of $31170.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While things look bullish for Bitcoin price, a breakdown below the triangle’s support will invalidate the bullish thesis and trigger a longer correction.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 50-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> acts as dynamic support and assists buyers to maintain a bullish trend during occasional pullbacks.</span></p>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> wavering around the midline reflects market uncertainty and the need for a triangle breakout to trigger a direction rally.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Price Intraday Levels </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $29181</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $31200 and $34600</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $27000 and $25000</span></li>

This solution will enhance the easy purchase of cryptocurrencies for customers in the United States. Also, it is a breakthrough for Web 3.0 companies that have been having a cold start problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ordinarily, Stripe is designed to facilitate fiat acceptance globally for crypto-related companies and in turn, help them expand their offerings. It goes as far as accepting stablecoin like USDC for simple payouts. Hence, the rampant adoption of the company&#8217;s product by any crypto organization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Stripe products, crypto firms can operate a streamlined onboarding process and reduce their exposure to fraud.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today Stripe launched a crypto onramp.</p>
<p>This is low-key a HUGE deal.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve spoken with several Fortune 500s who have fully built crypto strategies but haven&#39;t launched yet because they don&#39;t have a trusted brand to handle the onramp and the wallet.</p>
<p>Stripe just solved the onramp. <a href="https://t.co/hPst39VkA5">pic.twitter.com/hPst39VkA5</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2><b>Fintech Companies Seek to Outdo Crypto Exchanges</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Stripe is joining the competition with other fintech giants like MoonPay, Transak, and Simplex which allows you to purchase cryptocurrencies exactly when you need them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Web 3.0 users can decide to buy Ethereum (ETH) for an immediate purchase of a Non-fungible token (NFT) without any delay. This is entirely different from what is obtainable on various crypto exchanges that only permit the external transfer of crypto after several working days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most times, these digital asset service providers wait for the deposit to clear, especially when one is using a linked banking method. Henceforth Web 3.0 companies have the option of either redirecting their users to purchase crypto on the Stripe-hosted onramp or customising their crypto-purchasing widget on their official website. The second option, which is sort of an embedded on-ramp, was announced in December 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Web 3.0 companies decide to redirect their users to </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://crypto.link.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">crypto.link.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, no code will be required but the embedded on-ramp requires 10 lines of code. James Mudgett, vice president of Web3.0 products at Brave said &#8220;We&#8217;re thrilled to partner with Stripe as they expand their offerings in the crypto space. We&#8217;re excited to offer a fiat payment solution that will allow us to reach new Web3 users.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fintech companies are gradually making a strategic impact in the crypto space. A few days ago, digital bank Revolut </span><a href="https://coingape.com/just-in-revolut-floats-crypto-products-in-brazil-in-first-latam-foray/"><span style="font-weight: 400">expanded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> its service to Brazil marking its first foray to the Latin America region. PayPal also recently </span><a href="https://coingape.com/paypal-crypto-push-venmo-users-transfer-crypto/"><span style="font-weight: 400">introduced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a new feature which allows users to transfer crypto between the platform and other wallets.</span></p>
