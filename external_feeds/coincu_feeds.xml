<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance temporarily adjusts STMX U-margined perpetual contract features for enhanced risk management, following significant price fluctuations of the STMX digital asset.</em></li>



<li><em>Changes include updates to leverage, margin ladder, and funding rate settlement frequency to provide users with greater control and protection during volatile market conditions.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On July 23, leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance made significant updates to its STMXUSDT U-margined perpetual contract leverage and margin ladder, aiming to bolster risk management and user protection.&nbsp;</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-1-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" width="600" height="315" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-1-1.jpeg" alt="Binance Empowers Users with Enhanced STMX Contract Features Amid Volatility" class="wp-image-205112" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-1-1.jpeg 600w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-1-1-300x158.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="Binance Empowers Users with Enhanced STMX Contract Features Amid Volatility 1"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The changes, which took effect at 15:15 on July 23 (Eastern Eighth District Time), will impact users&#8217; existing positions, prompting them to review the updated leverage and margin ladder to ensure their margins align with the new settings and avoid potential forced liquidation.</p>



<p>The move comes after STMX, a digital asset, experienced volatile price fluctuations, with a staggering 30% drop within a mere half-hour and an overall decline of approximately 45% from its recent peak. These abrupt price changes raised concerns as some users faced challenges closing their positions at market prices during contract transactions amidst the STMX price swings.</p>



<p>To address such concerns and protect traders from sudden market movements, Binance took proactive measures to adjust the STMX U-margined perpetual contract features. By optimizing the leverage and margin ladder, the exchange aims to offer users greater flexibility and control over their positions, enabling them to make informed decisions aligned with their risk appetite.</p>

<p>In addition to the leverage and margin adjustments, <a href="https://coincu.com/204647-binances-h1-2023-report-crypto-market/">Binance</a> Futures also modified the settlement frequency of the STMX U-margined perpetual contract funding rate. The funding rate settlement frequency, which was previously every eight hours, has been increased to every two hours. This alteration ensures more frequent updates and real-time adjustments, enabling traders to respond more effectively to changes in market conditions and funding rates.</p>



<p>By fine-tuning the STMX U-margined perpetual contract and introducing these updates, Binance seeks to provide a safer and more stable trading environment for its users. The exchange acknowledges the importance of risk management and strives to enhance user experience, particularly during periods of heightened market volatility.</p>



<p>Traders and investors using Binance&#8217;s platform are encouraged to stay informed about such updates and adjust their trading strategies accordingly. The exchange remains committed to ensuring transparency and open communication with its users, fostering a thriving and secure cryptocurrency trading ecosystem.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SEC-Ripple-XRP-Lawsuit-Could-Change-Crypto-1024x576-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SEC-Ripple-XRP-Lawsuit-Could-Change-Crypto-1024x576-1.jpeg" alt="Pro-XRP Lawyer Assures That SEC&#039;s Appeal Won&#039;t Affect XRP Holders" class="wp-image-205102" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SEC-Ripple-XRP-Lawsuit-Could-Change-Crypto-1024x576-1.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SEC-Ripple-XRP-Lawsuit-Could-Change-Crypto-1024x576-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SEC-Ripple-XRP-Lawsuit-Could-Change-Crypto-1024x576-1-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SEC-Ripple-XRP-Lawsuit-Could-Change-Crypto-1024x576-1-750x422.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Pro-XRP Lawyer Assures That SEC&#039;s Appeal Won&#039;t Affect XRP Holders 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This comes amid widespread rumors that an SEC appeal could have a negative influence on the cryptocurrency market. The judge&#8217;s finding that XRP should not be classified as a security raises issues about the possible legal ramifications that could follow if the SEC decides to appeal. Deaton provides additional information regarding the various possibilities and estimates that the decision regarding the appeal might take up to two years, with the Summary Judgment continuing to be in place during this time.</p>



<p>Following Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon&#8217;s aim to use it as a precedent to argue against the classification of digital assets as securities, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has indicated in its filing that they intend to reconsider the decision that was made in the Ripple dispute. Despite the fact that the outcome of the appeal is still undetermined, Deaton&#8217;s positive comments highlight the significance of the victory for XRP and those who possess it.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-3.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="315" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-3.jpeg" alt="Pro-XRP Lawyer Assures That SEC&#039;s Appeal Won&#039;t Affect XRP Holders" class="wp-image-205103" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-3.jpeg 600w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/timthumb-3-300x158.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="Pro-XRP Lawyer Assures That SEC&#039;s Appeal Won&#039;t Affect XRP Holders 4"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Ripple&#8217;s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, has weighed in on the SEC&#8217;s jurisdiction, saying that the agency&#8217;s authority is restricted to matters pertaining to securities. Tokens that are not securities, like <a href="https://coincu.com/204894-us-sec-signals-appeal-court-ripple-xrp-case/">XRP</a>, should not be subject to regulation by the SEC. Claiming jurisdiction where it does not exist is nothing more than a political power play that will have negative repercussions for everyone concerned.</p>



<p>The decision made by Judge Torres makes it quite clear that the only type of sale of the token that does not involve securities is the retail sale. This opens the door for further debate on the regulatory status of institutional sales. Deaton is still optimistic, despite the possibility of an appeal, that it will not alter the beneficial conclusion for those who possess XRP and for Ripple.</p>

<li><em>ParaSpace plans to host an event for affected users to provide clarity and remains committed to improving the platform for a user-friendly ecosystem.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>ParaSpace, a decentralized NFT lending protocol, recently <a href="https://twitter.com/ParaSpace_NFT/status/1682957087196975104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">addressed</a> an issue related to asset liquidations that <a href="https://coincu.com/199951-paraspace-temporarily-suspend-azukis-pool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">occurred</a> between July 3 and July 4.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1587.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1587-1024x538.png" alt="ParaSpace: Swift Action on Asset Liquidation, Users Reimbursed" class="wp-image-205091" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1587-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1587-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1587-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1587-1536x806.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1587-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1587-1140x598.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1587.png 1686w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="ParaSpace Navigates Asset Liquidation Crisis And Compensation To Users 5"></a></figure></div>


<p>A small number of users were affected when their assets were liquidated at prices below the floor price. The incident was a result of dutch auctions running on the backend without displaying the auctioned assets on the front end. ParaSpace promptly took action to rectify the situation and reimburse the affected users.</p>



<p>In response to the incident, ParaSpace&#8217;s team contacted each of the affected users to ensure open communication and resolve the matter promptly. The platform successfully reimbursed them for the price difference resulting from the liquidations.</p>



<p>The unexpected liquidations occurred as a consequence of successful purchases of NFTs during the dutch auctions. These successful purchases terminated the ongoing auctions, leading to prices dropping to the lower end of the auction range. Consequently, some purchases were made under the floor price, resulting in a discrepancy between the sale price and the actual floor price.</p>

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/200128-paraspace-azuki-airdrop-elementals-on-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ParaSpace</a> acknowledged the impact this event had on the affected users and prioritized their compensation.

During the space event, ParaSpace&#8217;s team will also shed light on their mission for the platform and outline their future plans.</p>



<p>ParaSpace is dedicated to creating a secure and user-friendly ecosystem for its users.

<p>Crypto exchanges and payment platforms have been prime targets for hackers, given the potential for large financial gains. The Alphapo hack highlights the need for continuous vigilance and the adoption of best security practices within the industry.</p>

<p>Stablecoins have become an essential part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, providing stability and pegging their value to fiat currencies like the US Dollar. These digital assets offer traders and investors a means to mitigate the high volatility often associated with other cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>The recent fluctuations in the circulation of stablecoins may be influenced by various factors, including market demand, user preferences, and regulatory developments.</p>



<p>The decrease in USDC circulation could be attributed to investors moving funds to other assets or platforms as market conditions evolve. As stablecoins aim to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US Dollar, the decrease may indicate a shift in investor sentiment or market dynamics.</p>

<p>Similarly, Aoki&#8217;s investment in The Cool Cat 8665 NFT, which he acquired for $123,000, has also suffered a drastic devaluation. The highest bid for this particular token now stands at a meager $4,700.</p>

<p>The 3 Moonbirds NFTs, previously acquired by Aoki for $297,000, have experienced an astonishing 97% decrease in value.</p>



<p>Additionally, the Cryptomories 1026, once purchased for $483,000, has been sold off for a mere $15,000, leaving Aoki with a staggering loss of $468,000 on this particular investment.</p>



<p>According to data from DappRadar, Aoki currently holds over 13,000 NFTs, with an approximate total value of $1.05 million. However, a few months ago, in early June, these NFTs were valued at an impressive $8.8 million, highlighting the substantial depreciation in their worth.</p>

<p>NFTs, which are unique digital assets that represent ownership of artwork, music, or other collectibles, have gained considerable popularity in recent years. The crypto art market witnessed a boom, with NFT sales reaching remarkable heights. However, the volatility of the market has also exposed investors to potential risks, as seen in Aoki&#8217;s case.</p>



<p>DJ Steve Aoki faces substantial losses as the value of his blue-chip NFTs experiences a significant decline. Herbie&#8217;s calculations reveal that NFTs once worth $1.6 million are now valued at just $33,000. The market volatility underscores the importance of careful consideration and research when investing in NFTs and the crypto art market as a whole. As the market continues to mature, investors must remain vigilant to make informed decisions in this dynamic and ever-changing industry.</p>

<p>In a recent statement, Garlinghouse criticized the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its approach to regulating cryptocurrencies and emphasized the need for legislation to provide clear rules and safeguards for retail participants.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">An important topic has come up about protecting retail. The SEC created this mess by proclaiming it was the cop on the crypto beat when it had no legal jurisdiction Where’s that gotten us? Consumers left holding the bag in bankruptcy court while the SEC holds press conferences.</p>&mdash; Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1682869087511416832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 22, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Garlinghouse pointed out that the SEC&#8217;s actions had created confusion and uncertainty in the crypto space by positioning itself as the primary regulatory authority for cryptocurrencies without clear legal jurisdiction. This uncertainty has led to legal battles and hindered innovation, making it challenging for businesses to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape.</p>



<p>The CEO stressed that the current method of &#8220;regulation by enforcement&#8221; employed by the SEC was inadequate and ineffective. Instead, he advocated for a legislative approach that would establish comprehensive and unambiguous guidelines for the industry. Such legislation would not only protect retail investors but also foster innovation and growth within the crypto sector.</p>

<p>Garlinghouse&#8217;s call for legislation echoes the sentiments of many within the blockchain and cryptocurrency community who seek a more defined framework for compliance and accountability. With clear and reasonable regulations in place, legitimate projects and companies can operate with confidence, while bad actors can be more effectively identified and dealt with.</p>



<p>The CEO&#8217;s stance comes at a time when regulatory scrutiny in the crypto space is increasing worldwide. Governments and financial watchdogs are grappling with the need to strike a balance between fostering innovation and protecting consumers from potential risks associated with digital assets.</p>

<p>Adams emphasized the need to explore new use cases rather than merely building marginal improvements on existing ones like Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and lending platforms. He believes that crypto&#8217;s superpowers can pave the way for innovative solutions that could potentially revolutionize traditional industries.</p>

<p>Adams, a prominent figure in the blockchain space, has long been an advocate for the growth and diversification of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. His vision for<a href="https://uniswap.org/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://uniswap.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener"> crypto projects</a> to challenge established Web2 applications aligns with the overarching goal of the blockchain industry to foster greater decentralization, transparency, and financial inclusion.</p>



<p>Web2 apps, referring to traditional, centralized internet platforms, have been dominant for decades, controlling user data and interactions. The emergence of Web3, powered by blockchain and cryptocurrencies, offers an alternative paradigm that aims to shift control back to users. Key features such as decentralization, trustlessness, and immutability inherent in blockchain technology provide the foundation for disruptive innovations.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1572.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="930" height="620" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1572.png" alt="image 1572" class="wp-image-205040" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1572.png 930w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1572-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1572-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1572-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" title="Uniswap Founder Advocates Crypto Projects to Disrupt Popular Web2 Apps 30"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>AMMs and lending platforms are some of the primary use cases that have gained significant traction in the DeFi space, but Adams urges developers and entrepreneurs to think beyond these applications. He argues that the real potential lies in using &#8220;crypto superpowers&#8221; to create novel solutions that can address real-world problems in diverse sectors, including finance, supply chain, healthcare, and governance, among others.</p>



<p>The term &#8220;Vampire attacking web2&#8221; coined by Adams suggests a strategic approach, wherein DeFi projects leverage the advantages of blockchain to compete with and supplant established Web2 apps. This approach not only challenges the centralized incumbents but also offers users greater privacy, security, and control over their data and assets.</p>
