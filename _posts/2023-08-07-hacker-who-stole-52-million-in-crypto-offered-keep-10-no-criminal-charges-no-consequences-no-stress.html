Why give some back if it's not enough to stop a global manhunt where you are the target?&nbsp; Especially when the offer includes keeping a few million.</p><p>But that's what happened.<br /><br />Starting August 5th the individual or group responsible for the Curve protocol hack began transferring funds back to one of the impacted pools, Alchemix Finance. This saw a return of $22 million, divided into 7,258 ethers (ETH) and 4,821 alETH.</p><p>Moreover, another operation enabled Metronome to recover $13 million, adding another layer of complexity to the unfolding events.</p><p>The JPEG'd pool, having experienced a full return of their stolen assets amounting to $11.5 million (5,495.4 Wrapped Ethers or WETH), announced they would not pursue legal action. Instead, they labeled this a “white hat ransom” and agreed to the initial offer, rewarding the hacker the promised 10%.</p><p>That left roughly $18 million still missing, so as the hacker's offer expired, Curve announced a public reward of $1.8 million (10% of the total value) for information leading to the recovery of the remaining funds.&nbsp;</p><p><b><span style="font-size: large;">If the hacker told any friends, he better hope they like him more than a $1.8 million payout...</span></b></p><p>Curve continues to provide an opportunity for the hacker to make amends if he discovers things are harder than expected for internationally pursued criminals with $2 million bounties on them - it may turn out that spending any of that stolen crypto is more stressful than fun.</p><p>So Curve says they're still willing top take their search off the table if hacker decides to return the full amount - the 'keep 10%' part is no longer a part of the deal.</p><p>Curve's primary goal now is to 'relentlessly pursue the individual or group responsible' until they are apprehended.</p><p><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333;"><br />-------&nbsp;<br /></span><i style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: small; user-select: text;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-weight: bolder; user-select: text;">Author:&nbsp;</span><span><span><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #252525;">Jules Laurent</span><br /></span></span></span></i><i style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: small; user-select: text;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;"><span><span><span><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-weight: bolder;">EU Newsroom&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></i><i style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: small; user-select: text;"><span style="color: #333333;">|&nbsp;</span><a class="keychainify-checked" href="https://www.globalcryptopress.com/" style="backface-visibility: hidden; box-sizing: border-box; color: #e51515; cursor: pointer; display: inline; margin: 0px; text-decoration-line: none; touch-action: manipulation; user-select: text;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #666666; user-select: text;">Breaking Crypto News</span></a></i><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"><img src="//feedburner.google.com/fb/images/pub/feed-icon32x32.png" alt="" style="border:0"/></a><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">Subscribe to GCP in a reader</a></div>
