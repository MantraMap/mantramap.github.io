<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao attempted to shut down Binance.US earlier this year to protect the company&#8217;s overall interests.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance.US CEO Brian Shroder is the only one who opposes this decision in customers&#8217; interests.</em></li>



<li><em>The US subsidiary was valued at $4.5 billion by investors last year, but it is running into legal troubles with regulators in the country.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to The Information, the <a href="https://coincu.com/195885-binanceus-and-sec-agreement-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance.US</a> board of directors voted on whether to liquidate the company under the push of Changpeng Zhao (CZ) but could not come to a final decision.</strong></h5>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-pushed-to-shutter-u-s-exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Information</a>, citing two people familiar with the matter, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao attempted to shut down Binance.US earlier this year to protect Binance&#8217;s mutual interests.</p>



<p>The board of directors of Binance.US, which includes Changpeng Zhao as chairman, voted on whether to liquidate the company but failed to reach a unanimous consensus.</p>



<p>Binance.US CEO Brian Shroder was the only one opposed to the decision as he feared that the sudden shutdown of the exchange could harm customers by forcing them to transfer or liquidate their cryptocurrency quickly.</p>



<p>If this is true, it would lead one to speculate that in the future, the US branch of Binance might gradually downsize its operations towards closing.</p>

<p>The company was valued at $4.5 billion by investors last year, but it&#8217;s been struggling lately. Binance US has faced many difficulties recently, from the fact that Binance US was sued by the SEC, having to stop trading crypto with USD, and the price of trading pairs on Binance US is different from reality.</p>



<p>The 13 charges, including operating a &#8220;scam website&#8221; and &#8220;calculated circumvention,&#8221; have put more pressure on the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange. At the same time, the SEC also accused Binance of violating securities regulations for many years, disregarding local laws and evading regulatory scrutiny.</p>



<p>These adverse factors have caused the market share of Binance.US to be said to have plummeted to a record. According to a report from Kaiko, the market share of Binance US dropped more than 20% to around 0.9% at the end of June 26.</p>



<p>It can be seen that although Binance has taken quick actions to deny the allegations to reassure investors, in the face of a strong opponent like the SEC, the exchange will still have to bear the loss, not small at all.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Chainflip&#8217;s Community Sale begins August 31, 2023, with 4.5 million FLIP tokens at $1.83 each.</em></li>



<li><em>FLIP tokens unlock fully at the mainnet launch, expected around October 24, 2023.</em></li>



<li><em>Chainflip&#8217;s protocol allows seamless asset exchange between different blockchains, introducing innovative JIT AMM and permissionless swapping.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Chainflip, a revolutionary decentralized cross-chain transaction protocol, is gearing up for its <a href="https://blog.coinlist.co/announcing-the-chainflip-community-sale-on-coinlist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Community Sale</a> on the popular platform CoinList. The highly anticipated sale is set to commence at 17:00 UTC on August 31, 2023.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/preview.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/preview-1024x538.png" alt="Chainflip To Launch The Expected Community Sale On CoinList On August 31" class="wp-image-207799" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/preview-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/preview-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/preview-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/preview-1536x806.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/preview-2048x1075.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/preview-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/preview-1140x599.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Chainflip To Launch The Expected Community Sale On CoinList On August 31 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>Chainflip&#8217;s innovative protocol allows users to seamlessly exchange native assets between various blockchains, including BTC, EVM, and substrate networks. Unlike traditional cross-chain bridges or centralized exchanges, Chainflip&#8217;s Just-in-Time (JIT) Automated Market Maker (AMM) taps into liquidity from connected chains and partner aggregators, enabling competitive pricing and low fees for spot trades.</p>



<p>The Community Sale will offer a total of 4.5 million FLIP tokens (ERC-20) at an attractive price of $1.83 per token. Once the Token Generation Event (TGE) occurs at the mainnet launch, which is projected around October 24, 2023, all tokens will be 100% unlocked. However, it is essential to note that this launch date is subject to change, with a possible window of up to 120 days after the conclusion of the sale.</p>



<p>During the Community Sale, participants will have the opportunity to buy FLIP tokens within the range of $100 as the minimum purchase limit and $4,000 as the maximum. Interested individuals must complete their registration by 12:00 UTC on August 28, 2023, to be eligible for the sale.</p>



<p>To participate in the Chainflip Community Sale, users must have a funded CoinList Wallet with a minimum purchase amount of $100 before the registration deadline. Moreover, they should ensure their <a href="https://coincu.com/205052-coinlist-twitter-account-suspected-of-hacking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinList</a> account is fully funded with the desired purchase amount before the sale starts.</p>

<p>Chainflip has ambitious plans to revolutionize the decentralized exchange (DEX) landscape by combining the best elements of existing cross-chain solutions and introducing unique optimizations. The protocol&#8217;s distinctive features include up to 150 validators per vault, guaranteeing redundancy, security, and anti-censorship. Leveraging Schnorr signatures and a groundbreaking signing scheme, these validators can efficiently support multiple assets without incurring excessive hardware costs.</p>



<p>The JIT AMM design of Chainflip minimizes slippage and provides precise pricing, making it ideal for conducting large trades with high liquidity. The protocol&#8217;s permissionless nature enables users to swap assets between different chains and networks effortlessly without introducing newly wrapped assets or facing prolonged confirmation times.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that ChainflipLabs had previously announced their token economic model in March, outlining a plan to airdrop 4.75 million FLIP tokens to the community. The native ERC-20 token FLIP, which is set to launch in Q2 2023, has a starting supply of 90 million and an annual inflation rate of 8%. The distribution plan allocates FLIP tokens for various purposes, including airdrops, token sales, contributors, strategic investors, the Oxen Foundation, liquidity, and reserve funds.</p>



<p>ChainflipLabs has also made significant strides in securing funding. In the past year, the cross-chain DEX project successfully <a href="https://coincu.com/87977-chainflip-labs-raises-10-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">completed</a> a financing round worth $10 million, attracting participation from notable investors like <a href="https://coincu.com/162346-asset-realitys-seed-round/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Framework Ventures</a>, <a href="https://coincu.com/206301-blockchain-capital-rebranded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blockchain Capital</a>, and <a href="https://coincu.com/180703-pantera-capital-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pantera Capital</a>. The company had been actively developing its validator network and running its blockchain.</p>



<p>While Chainflip had previously completed a $6 million financing through a private token sale in August 2021, the actual issuance of the FLIP token had not occurred at that time. However, the project had already signed relevant contracts with investors to move forward.</p>

<p>The UK-based F1 racing team is set to introduce blue-chip Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to the sport during the US Grand Prix in October, giving fans an unprecedented role in the design of their cars.</p>



<p>The collaboration will allow fans to submit their favorite NFTs through a crowdsourcing campaign and vote for the characters they wish to see adorned on the Williams Racing cars during the highly anticipated US Grand Prix. This venture marks a significant departure from traditional sponsorships in sports and aims to showcase the real-world value and versatility of NFTs beyond the digital realm.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/199312-kraken-requested-irs-for-customer-information/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kraken</a>&#8216;s strategy aims to bolster user engagement and collective ownership within its community while promoting the widespread recognition of the cryptocurrency exchange itself. Notably, this isn&#8217;t the first time Kraken has explored such innovative sponsorships. In the past, they showcased the Bitcoin white paper on Williams&#8217; race cars, transforming the high-speed machines into eye-catching mobile billboards.</p>



<p>To participate in the upcoming NFT contest, any NFT holder listed on <a href="https://coincu.com/193356-kraken-nft-now-launches-with-polygon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kraken&#8217;s NFT marketplace</a> can submit their tokens starting August 1st until the contest closes on August 18th.

<p>Winners will have the privilege of having their favorite NFTs displayed on two Williams Racing cars during the US Grand Prix. Additionally, team drivers Alex Albon and Logan Sargeant will each select one NFT to feature on the cars, adding a personal touch to the visual spectacle.</p>



<p>This exciting collaboration extends beyond just a one-time event, showcasing the long-term vision of both Kraken and Williams Racing. Kraken has consistently sought to connect with its community, hosting fan meet-ups at various racing events and creating a unique platform for crypto enthusiasts and racing aficionados to engage in discussions about cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>The integration of NFTs into Formula One cars marks an innovative step towards global blockchain-based literacy.

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Gnosis Chain activates Shapella upgrade on the Ethereum side chain with strong coordination.</em></li>



<li><em>Cross-chain functionality suspended for OmniBridge and xDAI to implement Shapeella hard fork.</em></li>



<li><em>Gnosis Chain&#8217;s compatibility with Ethereum and user-friendly staking offer reduced congestion.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gnosis Chain, the Ethereum side chain, has successfully <a href="https://twitter.com/gnosischain/status/1686342590784843776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">activated</a> the highly anticipated Shapella upgrade, marking another milestone in its journey toward increased efficiency and compatibility with Ethereum.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-83.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-83-1024x576.png" alt="Gnosis Chain Now Activates Shapella On Ethereum Side Chain, Boosting User Staking" class="wp-image-207785" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-83-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-83-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-83-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-83-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-83.png 1110w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Gnosis Chain Now Activates Shapella On Ethereum Side Chain, Boosting User Staking 8"></a></figure></div>


<p>In an official tweet, Gnosis Chain announced that the upgrade had been implemented with great coordination, despite a slight drop in participation from 96% to 90%.</p>



<p>Prior to this upgrade, it had officially announced a temporary suspension of the cross-chain functionality of OmniBridge and xDAI, paving the way for the smooth execution of the <a href="https://coincu.com/204702-ethereum-shapella-upgrade-spurs-26-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shapeella</a> hard fork.</p>



<p>Gnosis Chain (GC) operates as an <a href="https://coincu.com/195846-monad-fastest-cheapest-secure-layer-1-evm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</a> compatible chain, which allows smart contracts and decentralized applications deployed on Ethereum to be seamlessly transferred to Gnosis Chain without significant code modifications. This feature enables developers to build or migrate DApps from Ethereum to Gnosis Chain, reducing costs and alleviating network congestion.</p>



<p>With its Beacon Chain architecture, <a href="https://coincu.com/82446-gnosis-chain-upgraded-its-network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gnosis Chain</a> ensures compatibility with <a href="https://coincu.com/207287-ethereum-ico-investor-emerges-after-8-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>, making it possible to implement all future Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) on the platform. Furthermore, these upgrades can also be integrated back into Ethereum if they prove valuable to the broader blockchain ecosystem.</p>



<p>The development team behind Gnosis Chain consistently pushes upgrades from the Ethereum mainnet onto their platform. Notably, the recently implemented Shanghai and Capella upgrades mirror the Ethereum roadmap, enhancing the platform&#8217;s capabilities and usability.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-85-1024x694.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="694" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-85-1024x694.png" alt="image 85" class="wp-image-207787" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-85-1024x694.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-85-300x203.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-85-768x520.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-85-750x508.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-85.png 1051w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Gnosis Chain Now Activates Shapella On Ethereum Side Chain, Boosting User Staking 9"></a></figure></div>


<p>The Shanghai upgrade specifically enables GNO staking withdrawals on the chain, a significant improvement over the previous model that did not allow for the withdrawal of staked GNO. Simultaneously, the Capella upgrade ensures a consensus layer (CL) improvement, further bolstering the network&#8217;s performance and security. The combination of both upgrades has been dubbed &#8220;Shapella.&#8221;</p>



<p>Staking on Gnosis Chain offers users the opportunity to actively participate in securing the network while earning rewards. With a mere 1 GNO required for staking, the process is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to a wide range of participants. The network&#8217;s security is ensured through the collective efforts of thousands of at-home stakers worldwide, making it a neutral and resilient community-owned platform.</p>



<p>The successful activation of the Shapella upgrade on Gnosis Chain signals yet another step forward in the platform&#8217;s journey to become a versatile and reliable Ethereum side chain. As the chain continues to align with Ethereum&#8217;s roadmap, it reinforces its position as an essential part of the broader blockchain ecosystem, driving innovation and progress in the decentralized space.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bitfarms mined 378 Bitcoins in July, down 2.1% from the previous month and 24.4% year-on-year.</em></li>



<li><em>The company sold 333 Bitcoins for $9.9 million and aims to double hydropower capacity in Paraguay.</em></li>

</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitfarms, a leading global Bitcoin mining company, has <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/01/2715649/0/en/Bitfarms-Mines-378-BTC-in-July.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> its July 2023 update, revealing production figures and future expansion plans amid challenging market conditions.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-80.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="535" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-80-1024x535.png" alt="Bitfarms Mines 378 Bitcoins in July, Plans Hydropower Expansion Amid Market Challenge" class="wp-image-207781" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-80-1024x535.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-80-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-80-768x401.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-80-750x392.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-80-1140x596.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-80.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bitfarms Mines 378 Bitcoins in July, Plans Hydropower Expansion Amid Market Challenge 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>Despite a disciplined growth strategy and a strong track record, the company faced some setbacks, but it remains optimistic about its future prospects.</p>



<p>In July, <a href="https://coincu.com/187592-bitfarms-reports-first-quarter-2023-results/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitfarms</a> mined a total of 378 Bitcoins, which marked a slight decline of about 2.1% compared to the previous month and a significant year-on-year decrease of 24.4%. The total computing power of the company remained steady at 5.3EH/s by the end of July.</p>



<p>During the same period, Bitfarms managed to sell 333 Bitcoins for a total of $9.9 million. This indicates the company&#8217;s ability to capitalize on the market and monetize its production effectively.</p>



<p>Geoff Morphy, the CEO of Bitfarms, emphasized the company&#8217;s focus on securing low-cost power and investing capital wisely to achieve compelling projected returns. In line with this strategy, the company initiated an expansion plan to double its hydropower capacity to 350 MW by acquiring 150 MW of under-utilized hydropower in Paraguay. The expansion aims to leverage the company&#8217;s industry knowledge and economies of scale to enhance production efficiency. Construction on the first 50 MW facility is set to begin in Q3 2023.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-81.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="562" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-81.png" alt="Bitfarms Mines 378 Bitcoins in July, Plans Hydropower Expansion Amid Market Challenge" class="wp-image-207782" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-81.png 1000w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-81-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-81-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-81-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Bitfarms Mines 378 Bitcoins in July, Plans Hydropower Expansion Amid Market Challenge 11"></a></figure></div>


<p>Bitfarms also started production at its 11th farm in Baie-Comeau in July, with plans to reach 11 MW of production in Q3 2023 and an additional 11 MW scheduled to come online in 2H 2024. This move will increase Bitfarms&#8217; Quebec portfolio to 8 sites and 170 MW of low-cost hydropower.</p>



<p>However, the company faced challenges during the month. The BTC production decrease was partly attributed to the impact of intense weather events, such as record temperatures and unprecedented wildfires, which led to poor air quality in Quebec. This forced Bitfarms to temporarily throttle back its miners. Furthermore, the Magog farm experienced a 7-day outage due to a direct lightning strike that disabled its primary electricity transformer, but the company&#8217;s redundancy and geographic diversification strategies helped minimize the overall production impact. With a skilled in-house electrical subsidiary and reserve equipment, Bitfarms was able to restore production quickly, mitigating potential losses.</p>



<p>The average BTC price in July rose to $30,100, representing a 9.1% increase from the previous month. Out of the 378 BTC mined, 333 BTC were sold, and 45 BTC were added to the company&#8217;s treasury, which reached 594 BTC by the end of July 2023.</p>

<p>Bitfarms also reported an overall 1.8% decrease in BTC production in July compared to June, largely due to disruptions caused by extreme weather conditions. Network difficulty increased by 3.3% in July as miners continued to invest in capacity to prepare for anticipated higher Bitcoin prices. The increased difficulty has improved mining economics by 21.0% year-to-date, considering a roughly 76.5% rise in <a href="https://coincu.com/206516-bitcoin-is-slowly-gaining-bullish-momentum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BTC</a> price in the same period.</p>



<p>Despite the challenges, Bitfarms remains confident in achieving its Q3 2023 target hashrate of 6.3 EH/s as miner deliveries and installations progress smoothly in Rio Cuarto, Argentina. The company&#8217;s expansion plans and efficient operations indicate a promising future for Bitfarms amid the dynamic cryptocurrency market.</p>

<li><em>Ukrainian National Bank demands financial statements from local crypto companies.</em></li>



<li><em>Kuna exchange leaves the Ukrainian market due to NBU&#8217;s actions, facing significant volume reduction.</em></li>



<li><em>IRS collaborates with Ukraine to tackle crypto-related sanctions evasion.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a <em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-crypto-businesses-to-provide-financial-statements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cointelegraph</a></em> report, the government of Ukraine has recently approached the country&#8217;s cryptocurrency industry with a new request for financial information.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-78.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="840" height="560" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-78.png" alt="Ukraine&#039;s Crypto Industry Under Scrutiny: NBU&#039;s Bold Demands" class="wp-image-207771" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-78.png 840w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-78-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-78-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-78-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" title="Ukraine&#039;s Crypto Industry Under Scrutiny: NBU&#039;s Bold Demands 13"></a></figure></div>


<p>The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) has specifically targeted four local crypto companies &#8211; Kuna, CoinPay, GEO Pay, and Qmall &#8211; demanding their financial statements for the first two quarters of 2023. The NBU set a tight deadline, requiring cryptocurrency businesses to submit their financials within just seven days.</p>



<p>The revelation of this request came to light through Michael Chobanyan, the founder and CEO of Kuna exchange, who shared the news on July 3. He <a href="https://t.me/michaelchobanian/2069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">referred</a> to a document distributed by the Ukrainian Telegram news channel, Politics of the Country, which contained the NBU&#8217;s demands.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-76-724x1024.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="724" height="1024" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-76-724x1024.png" alt="Ukraine&#039;s Crypto Industry Under Scrutiny: NBU&#039;s Bold Demands" class="wp-image-207769" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-76-724x1024.png 724w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-76-212x300.png 212w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-76-768x1086.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-76-750x1061.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-76.png 905w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" title="Ukraine&#039;s Crypto Industry Under Scrutiny: NBU&#039;s Bold Demands 14"></a></figure></div>


<p>In addition to financial statements, the NBU also seeks data on the operating volumes of these crypto companies, along with detailed information regarding the receipt and transfer of funds. Furthermore, Ukrainian cryptocurrency firms are required to provide statements for all accounts dating back to the beginning of 2023.</p>



<p>Chobanyan confirmed the NBU&#8217;s action through his own Telegram channel, expressing uncertainty about the reasons behind the latest move. He noted that such information had never been requested in Ukraine before, even before the launch of Kuna back in 2015. Chobanyan speculated that the government&#8217;s intentions were apparent, referring to a series of recent searches and raids on exchanges across the country triggered by the actions of the NBU, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Security Service of Ukraine.</p>



<p>The repercussions of the NBU&#8217;s actions have been significant for the Kuna exchange. In March 2023, Kuna made the decision to leave its business-to-customer market in Ukraine due to what Chobanyan described as &#8220;predatory actions&#8221; by the NBU.</p>



<p>He expressed concern that such measures were undermining the potential of his country in the crypto and Web3 space. As a result of these regulatory challenges, Kuna&#8217;s exchange volumes have plummeted by 90% in recent months. Previously, the company also faced a substantial drop in volumes when it exited the Russian market after February 24, 2022.</p>



<p>While the reasons behind the NBU&#8217;s stringent actions remain unclear, they have undoubtedly sparked debates within the Ukrainian crypto community and raised concerns about the future of the industry in the country.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, on a separate note, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) criminal investigative division is <a href="https://coincu.com/186897-irs-supports-ukraine-in-crypto-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ramping</a> up its efforts to pursue sanctions evaders, collaborating with Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics company, and Ukrainian investigators. Approximately 50 Ukrainian law enforcement officers recently attended a virtual training session to bolster their engagement in combating crypto-related crimes.</p>

<p>In April, Ukrainian officials <a href="https://coincu.com/183062-ukraine-to-adopt-new-crypto-law/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attempted</a> to implement particular MiCA regulations in order to legalize crypto assets in the nation.

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Genesis Digital Assets (GDA) opens three new Bitcoin mining data centers in South Carolina&#8217;s Western region, further establishing its presence in the United States.</em></li>



<li><em>The data centers leverage South Carolina&#8217;s clean energy sources, with one facility running on hydroelectric energy and another equipped with eco-friendly distribution transformers.</em></li>



<li><em>GDA&#8217;s expansion in the US signifies its commitment to sustainable practices in the Bitcoin mining industry, creating local jobs and contributing to the state&#8217;s economic growth.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://coincu.com/148660-alameda-invested-1-15-bn-in-genesis-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genesis Digital Assets (GDA)</a>, a prominent Bitcoin mining company, has successfully established its presence in the United States by opening three new data centers in South Carolina&#8217;s Western region, <em>Decrypt</em> <a href="https://decrypt.co/150837/genesis-digital-assets-expands-bitcoin-mining-activity-pro-innovation-south-carolina" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-74-1024x535.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="535" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-74-1024x535.png" alt="Genesis Digital Assets Unveils Massive Bitcoin Mining Expansion In South Carolina" class="wp-image-207728" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-74-1024x535.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-74-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-74-768x401.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-74-750x392.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-74-1140x596.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-74.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Genesis Digital Assets Unveils Massive Bitcoin Mining Expansion In South Carolina 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>This expansion is part of the company&#8217;s strategy to strengthen its operations within the country, as it currently accounts for 2% of the total hash rate of the <a href="https://coincu.com/206516-bitcoin-is-slowly-gaining-bullish-momentum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> network.</p>



<p>The first data center, located near the town of Anderson, has been operational since February 2023, boasting an impressive capacity of 18 MW. Following closely, in March 2023, the other two facilities located between the towns of Union and Lockhart commenced operations, with a combined capacity of 15 MW.</p>



<p>The choice of South Carolina as the location for these data centers was intentional, driven by the state&#8217;s abundance of clean energy sources. The Pacolet facility, one of the data centers, sits in close proximity to two hydroelectric generation plants operated by Lockhart Power, a major renewable and clean energy supplier in the region. Moreover, the Anderson data center is equipped with environmentally friendly dry-type distribution transformers from Hitachi. Additionally, it will play a crucial role in strengthening the local energy grid by returning excess power when needed, benefiting Duke Energy.</p>

<p>One notable aspect of this expansion is GDA&#8217;s commitment to supporting local economies. During the construction of the two data centers between Union and Lockhart, 95% of the workforce was hired locally within South Carolina, creating nearly 150 jobs. Among these, 125 positions were filled by local contractors who played a significant role in setting up the data centers.</p>



<p>GDA&#8217;s new data centers have a combined total capacity of 33 megawatts (MW), further solidifying the company&#8217;s position as one of the world&#8217;s largest Bitcoin miners. In addition to its presence in South Carolina, GDA had previously initiated a mining data center project with a capacity of 40 megawatts in Texas.</p>



<p>CEO and Founder of GDA, Andrey Kim, expressed excitement about the company&#8217;s expansion in South Carolina, emphasizing the state&#8217;s favorable renewable energy landscape as a driving force behind their decision. This aligns with GDA&#8217;s commitment to pursuing environmentally sustainable practices in the Bitcoin mining industry, despite ongoing debates about the sector&#8217;s environmental impact.</p>



<p>With its expansion in the United States and other regions worldwide, GDA continues to solidify its position as a significant player in the Bitcoin mining industry. While critics raise concerns about the environmental implications, GDA aims to demonstrate that Bitcoin mining can be conducted in an environmentally, socially, and governance-friendly manner, contributing to the broader goal of a more sustainable future.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Justin Sun&#8217;s group reports impressive Q2 revenue of $193 million and a 183% profit increase compared to Q1, reaching $85 million.</em></li>



<li><em>Legal allegations emerge against Sun, accusing him of covertly acquiring the popular stablecoin TrueUSD (TUSD) through various entities.</em></li>



<li><em>Huobi clarifies asset decline reports, urging timely data updates from Glassnode to ensure transparency in cryptocurrency reporting.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In the second quarter of the year, Justin Sun&#8217;s group, which includes TRON, Huobi, Poloniex, and TUSD, among others, reported remarkable financial results, showcasing substantial growth and profitability.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-73.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-73.png" alt="Justin Sun&#039;s Group Soars: Q2 Profits Surge 183%" class="wp-image-207724" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-73.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-73-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-73-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-73-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Justin Sun&#039;s Group Soars: Q2 Profits Surge 183% 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>The founder, <a href="https://coincu.com/207600-justin-sun-takes-out-52-5-million-from-aave/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Justin Sun</a>, disclosed that the group&#8217;s revenue for Q2 reached $193 million, with a profit of $85 million, marking an impressive 183% increase from the $30 million profit achieved in the previous quarter.</p>



<p>The positive performance was attributed to the group&#8217;s effective strategies to boost revenue and reduce costs. With this trajectory, Sun <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1686371227089436672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predicted</a> that the third quarter would continue to flourish, projecting a revenue of $200 million and an expected profit of $100 million. It is important to note that these figures do not include investment gains and losses.</p>



<p>However, amidst the success and optimism, the group is now facing legal challenges. A prominent blockchain technology company, Archblock, has <a href="https://coincu.com/203450-archblock-founder-claims-justin-sun-secret-tusd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a lawsuit against Sun, alleging that he was secretly involved in acquiring TrueUSD (TUSD), a popular stablecoin. According to the undisclosed founder, Sun employed covert means, utilizing various entities and individuals to conceal his role in the acquisition. If proven true, these actions could potentially raise concerns about Sun&#8217;s transparency and integrity within the cryptocurrency space.</p>

<p>On a separate note, Huobi, one of the key components of Sun&#8217;s group, has <a href="https://coincu.com/202402-huobi-addresses-asset-decline-speculations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taken</a> a stand to clarify recent media reports regarding &#8220;asset decline&#8221; based on Glassnode data. The company stated that the data collected by Glassnode does not accurately reflect the current state of Huobi&#8217;s assets due to changes in hot wallet and cold wallet addresses used for asset storage. Additionally, Huobi&#8217;s assets are distributed across multiple chains, including 400 million USDT on TRON, 6,500 TRC20 BTC, and partial collateralization of ETH as an ETH validator. Huobi highlighted that Glassnode&#8217;s data had not been promptly updated to account for these changes.</p>

<p>In response to the discrepancies in the reporting, Huobi proactively urged Glassnode to update its data, reaffirming the company&#8217;s commitment to transparency and accurate information sharing within the cryptocurrency community.</p>



<p>As Sun&#8217;s group continues to thrive in the competitive cryptocurrency market, the legal allegations and transparency challenges serve as a reminder of the need for accountability and adherence to industry standards. Investors and stakeholders will closely monitor the developments, expecting a fair resolution to the legal claims and a commitment to accurate financial reporting from all parties involved.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fibrous becomes one of the most attractive DEXs on the <a href="https://coincu.com/204036-starknet-starknet-appchains-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starknet</a> ecosystem because it finds the most efficient paths for a token swap, also splits your funds between different protocols, and aggregates the best rates across StarkNet AMMs. So let&#8217;s find out all about this project through the article below.</strong></h5>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Fibrous ?</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-34.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-34-1024x576.png" alt="Fibrous, AMM Aggregator With Best Swap Rate On StarkNet" class="wp-image-207628" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-34-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-34-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-34-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-34-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-34.png 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Fibrous, AMM Aggregator With Best Swap Rate On StarkNet 21"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>StarkNet is an ecosystem that receives great attention from investors. Although StarkNet is in the Alpha process, there is already a development project on this ecosystem. This article will teach about Fibrous Finance &#8211; a Dex Aggregator on StarkNet.</p>



<p><a href="https://fibrous.finance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fibrous Finance</a> is a decentralized Dex Aggregator exchange developed on StarkNet. This platform will aggregate the liquidity of all Dex AMM exchanges on StarkNet and provide the best rates to users.</p>



<p>The project designed a user-friendly interface, making transactions on StarkNet more efficient and accessible to newcomers. Currently, the project is allowing users to experience Testnet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How does it work?</h2>



<p>Fibrous is not a traditional AMM. No liquidity is provided to the platform. Fibrous is just an optimal routing finder on all StarkNet AMMs. With Fibrous, you don&#8217;t need to search for the best liquidity and price for your tokens between different StarkNet AMMs. The platform will automate this process for you. It will bring all the liquidity in StarkNet close to you. It serves to exchange the most convenient route for you by dividing your coins in the best way.</p>



<p>Fibrous uses an advanced optimized order routing algorithm to find better prices for you on StarkNet. One way Fiber Routers get a better price is to split your money across multiple pools and different AMMs through all of StarkNet&#8217;s aggregations.</p>

<p>As you know from traditional AMMs, a swap is always done through a single route in legacy routing. If you want to swap TokenA for TokenB, traditional AMMs will execute this transaction from a single pool with the highest possible liquidity. If there is not enough liquidity for this trade, you will face high negative slippage, and the price impact of your trade will result in a loss.</p>



<p>Even if an AMM performs a swap with multiple routes, it will only route from its own buckets. Similar to Uniswap v3 Smart Order Router. While this route is perfect for AMM, it&#8217;s still not enough. Because current routing only takes place within the group on a single AMM.</p>



<p>Fiber, on the other hand, goes a different route. Fibrous scans every AMM on StarkNet, any AMM, any group and finds the best price for you. In short, it is an AMM agnostic algorithm that only cares about the best swap rate for the trader by dividing your funds.</p>



<p>This is really special especially for large volume Swap orders because we also know the liquidity of some Dex exchanges is not really good and for large-volume Swap orders, it will create high slippage, causing losses for investors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What makes it different?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Consolidate all liquidity resources on one blockchain</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-35.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-35-1024x576.png" alt="Fibrous, AMM Aggregator With Best Swap Rate On StarkNet" class="wp-image-207629" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-35-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-35-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-35-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-35-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-35.png 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Fibrous, AMM Aggregator With Best Swap Rate On StarkNet 23"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Although StarkNet is in the Alpha process, we believe that StarkNet has great potential in the future. We anticipate that more AMM protocols will be announced on StarkNet over time. StarkNet is a valid Rollup that ensures Ethereum security and allows for very cheap transaction fees.</p>



<p>This is great but comes with a few things that could be improved. Many AMM protocols have been published on StarkNet, and due to the distribution of liquidity to many AMMs, it will be a bad experience for end users to find the protocol that offers the most liquidity and the best rate among them this AMM protocol.</p>



<p>This is where Fibrous comes into play. Instead of manually navigating each AMM that gives the best rate, Fibrous allows users to swap the best rate with one click in the cheapest way without extra effort. Just exchange for the best possible price in StarkNet. Yarn aggregates all StarkNet AMMs in one place.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The aggregator offers the best price</strong></h3>



<p>Offering only the best prices does not automatically earn the title of the best aggregator. In fact, the main goal of aggregators is to secure the most favorable price. However, in pursuit of providing the best rates, aggregators should also take into account the transaction costs associated with performing such operations.</p>



<p>Gas spending varies between each AMM, including pools within these AMMs, and even per token, thus resulting in different transaction fees. As a result, each AMM, pool, and token uses a different method of calculating transaction fees. An effective aggregator should prioritize providing the best price allocated after transaction fees rather than just offering the best price at face value.</p>



<p>It is essential to remember that transaction fees increase in proportion to the number of routes and divisions that an aggregator uses for swaps. Therefore, a careful balance is needed between the number of routes taken and the optimization of transaction fees.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Functions</h2>



<p>On January 6, 2023, Fibrous Finance launched the v2 version with many features, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Trading: Allows users to swap assets at the most profitable price. If other projects only use a single AMM, Fibrous will integrate the liquidity pool available on many AMMs to find the best price for users.</li>



<li>Cross Rollup and Mainnet Bridging: Allows users to swap assets across the chain.</li>



<li>Multi token inputs: Allows users to swap any number of different tokens for the desired number of tokens.</li>



<li>Set limit orders: Users can place buy and sell orders with a fixed price or can place Tp, Stop Loss orders.</li>



<li>Fallback mode for unauthorized Swap transactions: To ensure fast transaction speed, Fibrous Finance performs off-chain computation, exchanges user assets on-chain, and then sends them to the user&#8217;s wallet address. But if the off-chain Fibrous API doesn&#8217;t work, users may not be able to use Fibrous. In this case, the user can enable &#8220;fallback mode&#8221; and allow Fibrous to compute on-chain.</li>



<li>Gassless Trading: Fibrous Finance is conducting research on a swap tool that allows users to trade without fees and avoid MEV attacks.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Tokenomics</h2>



<p>Currently, the project claims to have an intention to issue tokens without a real and quality use case. For the future of Fibrous, the team may evaluate the token later. The sole goal of the project right now is to make Fibrous a better place for users.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Charging mechanism</h2>



<p>Thanks to StarkNet, fees will be extremely low, ensuring the safety of Ethereum. However, each fund divided by Fibrous will be an additional cost to the user. To mitigate this, Fibrous will split your funds into five paths and offer another solution for lower trades.</p>



<p>Fibrous is a protocol that provides Swap functionality between different AMMs and pools, but this also means higher transaction fees. However, to optimize transaction fees for users, Fibrous has designed a special mechanism to optimize fees during transactions.</p>



<p>Fibrous will look at the percentage of profit a user can make from a trade between two AMMs. If the return does not exceed the gas fees paid by the user, the protocol will not execute the transaction. This ensures that users only pay when it makes economic sense to them.</p>



<p>Sometimes, lower transactions don&#8217;t need to be split, and routing lower amounts can be unfavorable. This may not be preferred as each AMM applies a commission paid by you, and each route taken by Fibrous incurs a small gas fee. Even Fibrous is using a gas cost optimization algorithm to make sure every new step benefits your swap. In such a case, Fibrous offers the &#8220;Swap Cheapest&#8221; feature, especially for small trades. This feature is only for trading from the best liquidity pool in one go.</p>

<p>Specifically, Fibrous applies different fees for different types of swap transactions. For swaps between stablecoins, Fibrous will charge 0.02%, while other tokens will charge 0.15%. This helps users have a clear view of the fees they will have to pay when using the Fibrous protocol and can choose the transactions that suit their needs and priorities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Fibrous is a promising protocol with many possibilities for future growth. Currently, the protocol has two main features: Swap between AMMs and Multi token inputs, enabling users to swap between different asset classes easily. However, the development team is still working hard to bring more new features. The goal of the protocol is to expand further access for wallet providers and dApps growing on the StarkNet platform. This is to achieve the most optimal swap rate, ensuring users have the best Fibrous experience.</p>



<p>Expanding access for wallet providers will be of great benefit to the user community. At the same time, supporting dApps developed on StarkNet will also open up new opportunities to take advantage of the protocol&#8217;s potential and increase interoperability between applications on the StarkNet platform.</p>



<p>With its continuous development and scalability, Fibrous could become one of the important protocols in the DeFi ecosystem. The growth and development of Fibrous can contribute to the popularity and use of DeFi on the StarkNet platform and help the platform become more and more powerful.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Why the appearance of perpetual contracts in Defi?</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2325.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="618" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2325-1024x618.png" alt="How Perpetual Contracts Work In Defi Makes It Attractive?" class="wp-image-207388" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2325-1024x618.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2325-300x181.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2325-768x464.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2325-1536x927.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2325-2048x1236.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2325-750x453.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2325-1140x688.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="How Perpetual Contracts Work In Defi Makes It Attractive? 25"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>When DeFi first appeared, the focus was on attracting users and strengthening the industry&#8217;s position. This has been made possible by high-risk, high-return investment products. As a result, the industry became unfriendly to regular investors looking for steady income growth. However, with the development of DeFi 2.0, the industry and all its players are now finding ways to attract casual investors. Low-risk investment products like index funds are popping up in DeFi.</p>



<p>This change is necessary because the average investor is the majority, and by serving them, the DeFi industry can dream of becoming mainstream. The tried and tested low-risk financial products from TradFi are offered in a DeFi style that can cater to investors with different risk appetites. Furthermore, investors who want to explore the DeFi space but need help with its risky nature will have an easier path to DeFi.</p>



<p>Perpetual Contracts in DeFi (Decentralized Finance) refer to perpetual contracts, a type of derivative financial instrument that exposes users to price movements of an underlying asset without owning the property itself. These perpetual contracts are widely used in DeFi platforms, allowing users to trade various assets, including cryptocurrencies, commodities, and more, with leverage.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How does perpetual contract work in Defi?</h2>



<p>Perpetual contracts are created as smart contracts on the blockchain platform. Smart contracts define specifications, such as underlying assets, contract size, leverage ratio, funding rate calculation, etc. To understand how a perpetual contract works, we need to understand the critical components of a perpetual contract.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Leverage trading</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2326.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2326.png" alt="How Perpetual Contracts Work In Defi Makes It Attractive?" class="wp-image-207392" width="760" height="456" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2326.png 760w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2326-300x180.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2326-750x450.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" title="How Perpetual Contracts Work In Defi Makes It Attractive? 26"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Perpetual contracts allow traders to hold leveraged positions, meaning they can control a more prominent position than their initial collateral. For example, if a trader has 1 ETH and chooses 10x leverage, they can control a position worth 10 ETH in the contract.</p>



<p>One of the benefits of perpetual contracts is the ability to trade with high leverage, meaning that traders can hold a large position with limited capital, thereby improving capital efficiency. This can be appealing to traders looking to maximize their potential profits, but it should be remembered that this also increases the level of risk involved. Traders need to determine that the higher the leverage, the greater the possibility of liquidation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Initial Margin and Maintenance Margin</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2327.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="301" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2327-1024x301.png" alt="How Perpetual Contracts Work In Defi Makes It Attractive?" class="wp-image-207397" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2327-1024x301.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2327-300x88.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2327-768x226.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2327-750x221.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2327.png 1136w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="How Perpetual Contracts Work In Defi Makes It Attractive? 27"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>When a trader enters a position, they need to make an initial deposit to open a contract. The initial margin ensures the trader has enough collateral to cover the possible losses on the position. There is also a maintenance margin, which is the minimum margin required to keep the position open. If the value of the position falls below the maintenance margin, the trader needs to add more collateral. Otherwise, the position may be liquidated.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Funding rate</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2328-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2328-1024x576.png" alt="How Perpetual Contracts Work In Defi Makes It Attractive?" class="wp-image-207400" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2328-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2328-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2328-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2328-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2328-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2328-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2328-1140x641.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="How Perpetual Contracts Work In Defi Makes It Attractive? 28"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>With a predetermined expiration date, it is easier for traders to predict the settlement price and funding cost of a perpetual contract trade. Thus, a funding rate is introduced.</p>



<p>In perpetual contracts, the funding rate is used to keep the contract&#8217;s price in line with the underlying asset&#8217;s price. Funding rates are typically exchanged between traders buying (buying) and selling (selling) at fixed intervals, usually every few seconds. The funding rate is determined by comparing the contract&#8217;s price to the underlying asset&#8217;s spot price.</p>



<p>When the contract price is trading at a premium (higher) than the spot price, the buying traders pay the selling traders. Conversely, when the price of the contract is trading at a discount (lower) than the spot price, the short traders pay the funding to the buying traders. The goal is to incentivize traders to keep the contract price close to the underlying asset&#8217;s price.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>PnL</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2329-1024x461.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="461" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2329-1024x461.png" alt="How Perpetual Contracts Work In Defi Makes It Attractive?" class="wp-image-207402" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2329-1024x461.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2329-300x135.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2329-768x346.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2329-750x338.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2329-1140x513.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2329.png 1450w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="How Perpetual Contracts Work In Defi Makes It Attractive? 29"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>PnL stands for profit and loss, and it can be realized or unrealized. Your PnL is unrecorded while you have open positions in the perpetual futures market, which means it still fluctuates in reaction to market fluctuations. The unrealized PnL becomes the executed (partially or completely) PnL when you close your positions.</p>



<p>Because the actual PnL refers to the profit or loss derived from closed positions, it has no direct relationship to the reference price but only to the execution price of the orders. On the other hand, unrealized PnL constantly changes and is the main driver leading to liquidation. Therefore, the reference price ensures that the unrealized PnL calculation is accurate and fair.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mark price</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2330.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="453" height="508" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2330.png" alt="How Perpetual Contracts Work In Defi Makes It Attractive?" class="wp-image-207403" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2330.png 453w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2330-268x300.png 268w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" title="How Perpetual Contracts Work In Defi Makes It Attractive? 30"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The mark price is an estimate of the true value of a contract (fair price) when compared to its actual trading price (last price). The mark price calculation prevents unfair liquidations when the market is highly volatile. So while the Index Price is related to the price of spot markets, the mark price represents the fair value of a perpetual futures contract. Typically, the mark price is based on the Index Price and the funding rate &#8211; and is also an essential part of the &#8220;unrealized PnL&#8221; calculation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Liquidation</strong></h3>



<p>If the value of your collateral falls below the maintenance margin, your future account may be liquidated. Depending on the exchange you use, liquidations happen in different ways. Generally, liquidation prices vary according to each user&#8217;s risk and leverage (based on their collateral and net risk). The larger the total position, the higher the required margin.</p>



<p>To avoid liquidation, you can close your positions before the liquidation price is reached or add funds to your collateral balance &#8211; causing the liquidation price to move further from the current market price.</p>

<p>Perpetual contracts in the DeFi platform typically use an Automated Market Maker (AMM) system to provide liquidity and enable seamless trading. AMM is a smart contract that facilitates transactions by using an algorithm to determine an asset&#8217;s price based on the asset&#8217;s current supply and demand.</p>



<p>In the case of perpetual contracts, the AMM system allows traders to enter and exit positions without a counterparty. Traders can buy (buy) or sell (sell) contracts with the leverage provided by the protocol. AMM automatically adjusts the contract&#8217;s price based on the funding rate, current demand, and supply to maintain price stability.</p>



<p>The AMM system ensures that there is always enough liquidity for traders to execute their trades, allowing for round-the-clock trading, similar to traditional financial markets.</p>



<p>Since the price of the perpetual contract is close to the spot price, the PnL (profit and loss) of the perpetual contract trade is close to the leveraged spot trade. You can view the funding as a representation of the interest paid to the bank, while the funding rate is adjusted more often than the bank rate, and sometimes you even make more money than you pay it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Perpetual Contracts are increasingly attractive in the Defi sector because they allow traders to speculate on the price movement of digital assets without time constraints. However, it is also high risk, especially when leverage is applied.</p>



<p>With high-frequency funding payments, the funding payments may be larger than a trade&#8217;s profit or expose the trade to more risk. Traders need to do their due diligence before getting their hands on perpetual swaps.</p>



<p>Essentially, perpetual contracts can be traded continuously forever. Traders don&#8217;t need to worry about upcoming expiration dates or buy-back structures when converting. In that sense, perpetual contract trading is more flexible and active than single futures in cryptocurrency.</p>
