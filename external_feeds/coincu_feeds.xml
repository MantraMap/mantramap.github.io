<p>Jacobi Asset Management, the asset management firm behind the ETF, initially announced its plans to list the Bitcoin ETF on Euronext Amsterdam in July 2022. However, the launch was delayed due to concerns about market timing.</p>



<p>The delay in launching the Jacobi Bitcoin ETF was attributed to last year&#8217;s perception that the timing was unfavorable. Factors such as the Terra Luna May 2022 crypto crash and the November FTX crypto exchange crash likely influenced the decision to postpone the launch. The asset management firm took a cautious approach to ensure optimal market conditions for the ETF&#8217;s debut.</p>



<p>Jacobi Asset Management made headlines with the announcement of the Jacobi Bitcoin ETF. This groundbreaking ETF received regulatory approval from the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC) in October 2021, paving the way for its launch. The ETF will be listed on Euronext Amsterdam with the trading code BCOIN.</p>

<p>To ensure the smooth operation of the ETF, Jacobi Asset Management has partnered with reputable industry players. Fidelity Digital Assets will provide custody services, ensuring the secure storage of the Bitcoin assets. Additionally, Flow Traders and DRW have been selected as market makers, facilitating the trading of the ETF on the exchange.</p>



<p>The launch of Europe&#8217;s first Bitcoin ETF signifies a significant milestone in the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. ETFs provide investors with a regulated and convenient way to gain exposure to Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements without directly owning the digital asset. The introduction of such products opens up opportunities for both institutional and retail investors to participate in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>As the launch of the Jacobi Bitcoin ETF approaches, investors and market participants eagerly anticipate the potential impact on the broader financial landscape. The ETF&#8217;s success and investor response will likely shape future developments in the cryptocurrency ETF space and contribute to the evolving regulatory environment surrounding digital assets.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>South Korea&#8217;s Financial Services Commission aims to institutionalize security tokens through legislative amendments.</em></li>



<li><em>Proposed changes include allowing the issuance and circulation of these tokens and establishing regulations for account management agencies and over-the-counter transactions.</em></li>



<li><em>The move reflects the growing interest in incorporating blockchain-based token securities into the financial investment industry.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Korean media <em><a href="https://www.hankyung.com/finance/article/202307133572B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hankyung</a></em>, South Korea&#8217;s Financial Services Commission (FSC) is planning to submit amendments to the Electronic Securities Act and the Capital Market Act, aiming to institutionalize security tokens.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-825-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-825-1024x576.png" alt="South Korea Moves To Revolutionize Capital Markets With Security Tokens" class="wp-image-202413" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-825-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-825-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-825-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-825-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-825-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-825.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="South Korea Moves To Revolutionize Capital Markets With Security Tokens 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>The proposed bill will incorporate the rectification plan for security token issuance and circulation that was introduced by the <a href="https://coincu.com/200166-financial-authorities-virtual-asset-legislation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FSC</a> in February. It will establish regulations for the issuance and circulation of security tokens, including the role of account management agencies and over-the-counter transaction intermediaries.</p>



<p>The move to institutionalize token securities is seen as a significant development in the financial investment industry. Security tokens are issued in the form of tokens using blockchain technology and can represent various rights, allowing for the trading of assets such as commercial buildings, artworks, and intellectual property. This opens up new possibilities for innovative businesses in the securities industry.</p>

<p>In preparation for the bill proposal, public hearings were held by the People&#8217;s Power Policy Committee, Political Affairs Committee, and Digital Asset Special Committee to discuss the potential impact of token securities on the capital market. </p>



<p>The proposed bill is expected to align with the Token Securities Issuance and Distribution Regulatory System Maintenance Plan announced by the FSC earlier this year, which includes amendments to enable the issuance of token securities and the establishment of new institutions and brokerages related to their issuance and distribution.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-826.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="960" height="582" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-826.png" alt="South Korea Moves To Revolutionize Capital Markets With Security Tokens" class="wp-image-202414" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-826.png 960w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-826-300x182.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-826-768x466.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-826-750x455.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" title="South Korea Moves To Revolutionize Capital Markets With Security Tokens 5"></a></figure></div>


<p>The submission of these amendments to the Electronic Securities Act and the <a href="https://coincu.com/165218-south-korea-issues-guidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capital Market Act</a> signifies a significant step toward the institutionalization of security tokens in <a href="https://coincu.com/201600-south-korea-accounting-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Korea</a>. If approved, it will provide a regulatory framework that facilitates the issuance, trading, and management of tokenized securities, bringing increased clarity and opportunities to the industry.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.huobi.com/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.huobi.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Huobi</a> clarified that the media reports were based on asset data provided by Glassnode, but professional analysis has revealed inaccuracies and a clear omission in the address data.</p>



<p>According to Huobi&#8217;s analysis, the data collected by Glassnode fails to accurately reflect the current state of HB&#8217;s assets. It was discovered that the main hot wallet and cold wallet addresses used for asset storage have undergone changes since the data was collected. Furthermore, HB&#8217;s assets are distributed across multiple chains, including 400 million USDT on TRON, 6,500 TRC20 BTC, and partial collateralization of ETH as an ETH validator. Unfortunately, Glassnode has not been updating its data in a timely manner to reflect these changes.</p>



<p>Huobi has taken proactive steps to establish contact with Glassnode, urging them to update the necessary data. HB recognizes the importance of accurate and up-to-date information to maintain transparency and provide an accurate picture of its asset holdings.</p>

<p>Huobi recently revealed the Merkle tree asset reserve certificate for July 1st. The total assets held by users on the Huobi platform have surpassed $3 billion, demonstrating the significant trust and participation of the user base.</p>



<p>It is crucial for accurate data to be utilized in assessing the financial health and performance of platforms like HB. HB&#8217;s efforts to rectify the inaccurate data provided by Glassnode demonstrate their commitment to transparency and ensuring accurate reporting to the crypto community.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points </strong></p>



<ul>
<li>The upcoming ZhangHeng hard fork for the BNB Beacon Chain mainnet represents an important step towards improving security and functionality.</li>



<li>The introduction of on-chain asset reconciliation through BEP-255 and measures to address security vulnerabilities will enhance the overall resilience of the blockchain.</li>



<li>As Binance and its community prepare for the hard fork, the focus remains on reinforcing the chain&#8217;s security measures and providing a robust platform for users to participate in the BNB ecosystem.</li>
</ul>

<p>The ZhangHeng hard fork will introduce Binance Evolution Proposal<a href="https://github.com/bnb-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEP255.md?ref=binance.ghost.io" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/bnb-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEP255.md?ref=binance.ghost.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> BEP-255</a>, focusing on on-chain asset reconciliation. This crucial feature aims to mitigate potential damage from cross-chain bridge exploits, such as the previous Binance Smart Chain exploit in October 2022. By tracking user balance changes in each block, the blockchain can identify and reconcile any issues, ensuring the security of assets on the BNB Beacon Chain itself.</p>



<p>The hard fork also addresses security concerns related to Rogue Key Attacks, where perpetrators produce valid aggregate signatures using private keys not owned by them. </p>



<p>Additionally, it enhances the chain&#8217;s capability to handle more complex business rules and logic, further fortifying the overall security infrastructure of the BNB Beacon Chain.</p>

</figure>



<p>To successfully implement the hard fork, Binance emphasizes the need for two-thirds of validators to switch to version v0.10.16 of the software.Failure to upgrade may lead to complications, and full nodes that do not upgrade will be unable to execute blocks beyond the hard fork block height.</p>



<p>While the hard fork will impact downstream services like bridges, deposits, and withdrawals on exchanges, Binance considers this drastic action necessary to safeguard the chain and its users. Once the blockchain resumes, necessary measures will be taken, such as blacklisting or correcting affected accounts, ensuring a secure environment for all participants.</p>

<p>This significant drop in value comes as concerns surrounding the project&#8217;s functionality and usability have surfaced, leading to an imminent delisting by Upbit, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange.</p>



<p>The plummeting price of REP highlights the impact of the project&#8217;s underlying issues on investor confidence. Reports suggest that the services provided by Augur (REP) are currently experiencing severe functionality problems, rendering them virtually unusable.

<p>Confirming the severity of the situation, Upbit, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has announced its decision to delist Augur (REP) at 14:00 local time on July 13. This delisting further reinforces concerns about the project&#8217;s viability and its ability to meet the expectations of its users and investors.</p>



<p>The delisting decision by Upbit carries weight within the crypto community, as it reflects the exchange&#8217;s assessment of Augur&#8217;s (REP) current state and its potential impact on traders and investors. Delistings often result from concerns about project performance, functionality, or compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>



<p>It is important to note that the delisting of Augur (REP) by Upbit does not necessarily imply a definitive judgment on the long-term prospects of the project. However, it serves as a clear signal that the exchange believes the current state of Augur (REP) warrants caution.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In an <a href="https://twitter.com/klever_io/status/1679267565434986501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official announcement</a>, the team at Klever Wallet acknowledged a recent incident involving suspicious activity and identified the root cause as a known exploit related to low entropy mnemonics.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-808-1024x538.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-808-1024x538.png" alt="Klever Wallet Addresses Security Issues, Users Be Alerted" class="wp-image-202363" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-808-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-808-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-808-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-808-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-808-1140x599.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-808.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Klever Wallet Addresses Security Issues, Users Be Alerted 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>The exploit, similar to one previously reported by <a href="https://coincu.com/183241-trust-wallet-can-be-cracked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TrustWallet</a> in April 2023, affects the security and unpredictability of generated keys. As a result, Klever Wallet is urging users to take prompt action to ensure the security of their wallets and funds.</p>



<p>To address this, Klever Wallet emphasizes the importance of flawless entropy generation, particularly in the Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) scheme used for key management and portability. The HD scheme offers convenience and signer roaming capabilities, allowing users to switch seamlessly between wallets. However, a flawless entropy source is crucial to maintaining the security and integrity of the scheme.</p>



<p>In the specific incident, all the affected wallets were imported into Klever Wallet K5 and had been originally created using an old and weak pseudorandom number generator algorithm as their entropy source. Klever Wallet K5, on the other hand, utilizes robust security measures and leverages the native security features of iOS and Android operating systems to ensure secure entropy and mnemonic generation. </p>

<p>Additionally, the implementation of KleverSafe, a specific component of Klever Wallet, incorporates a true Random Number Generator (RNG) that relies on physical phenomena to generate entropy, providing a reliable and highly secure source of randomness.</p>



<p>To mitigate potential vulnerabilities associated with outdated or weak pseudorandom number generator algorithms, Klever Wallet advises users to migrate to new wallets created on Klever Wallet K5 or Klever Safe. By taking this proactive step, users can benefit from enhanced security measures and improved entropy generation, ensuring a more secure and reliable environment for managing their cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Klever Wallet encourages users to report any anomalies promptly to their support team, who are prepared to address user concerns during this time. The company is committed to maintaining open communication and keeping users informed as they work diligently to address the incident and provide a secure platform and optimal user experience for all.</p>



<p>As the situation unfolds, users are advised to stay vigilant and follow the recommended actions to safeguard their funds and maintain the security of their wallets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Ransomware attacks on the rise, posing significant threats to individuals and organizations. </em></li>



<li><em>Various scams targeting crypto users continue to proliferate, exploiting vulnerabilities in the ecosystem. </em></li>



<li><em>Governments worldwide implementing stricter regulations to combat crypto-related crimes.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The year 2023 has proved to be a year of recovery for crypto crime, following a tumultuous 2022. The prices of digital assets such as Bitcoin have risen by over 80% as of June 30, indicating a positive trend for the industry. </strong></h5>



<p>However, this is not the only good news. According to our data, cryptocurrency-related crime has decreased significantly this year. This is a welcome development for the industry, and it is reflected in the graph below. The graph shows cumulative daily inflows to legitimate, risky, and illicit services for 2023, as compared to previous years. It is heartening to see the downward trend in illicit services and a corresponding increase in legitimate services. This indicates the industry is moving in the right direction, and the future looks bright for cryptocurrency.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter" id="attachment_7548"><a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chart-1-yearly-comps-1024x640.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chart-1-yearly-comps-1024x640.png" alt="Crypto Crime Drops 65%: Mid-Year 2023 Update Reveals Positive Trend" class="wp-image-7548" title="Crypto Crime Drops 65%: Mid-Year 2023 Update Reveals Positive Trend 18"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The transaction volume mentioned above does not include the inflows to entities that have been sanctioned or are subject to special measures by agencies such as FinCEN. Please note that all the figures mentioned are lower bound estimates and the measure of illicit and risky transaction volume is expected to increase over time as we identify new addresses associated with illicit activities. It is important to mention that the figures do not capture the proceeds from non-crypto native crimes, such as conventional drug trafficking that involves cryptocurrency as a mode of payment.</p>



<p>As of the end of June, we have noticed a significant decline of 65% in crypto inflows to known illicit entities (excluding inflows to entities that have been sanctioned or are subject to special measures) compared to figures from the same time last year. Similarly, inflows to risky entities, primarily consisting of mixers and high-risk exchanges, have dropped by 42%. While it is true that transaction volumes have decreased across the board, legitimate services have only experienced a 28% decline in inflows. Therefore, it can be concluded that there has been a market pullback, and the volume of illicit crypto transactions is decreasing much more than legitimate crypto transactions. It is important to note that this trend is expected to continue as we identify more such entities and take stricter measures against them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Which specific forms of cryptocurrency-based crime are declining the most?</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1627963643_Notable-news-about-the-cryptocurrency-market-.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chart-2-waterfall-1024x479.png" alt="Crypto Crime Drops 65%: Mid-Year 2023 Update Reveals Positive Trend" class="wp-image-7549" title="Crypto Crime Drops 65%: Mid-Year 2023 Update Reveals Positive Trend 19"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Cryptocurrency-based crimes have seen a significant decline in various categories, including nflows to illicit addresses. However, the most impacted form of crypto crime is scams, which have experienced a whopping decrease of almost $3.3 billion in 2023 compared to the previous year. This downturn has resulted in a total earning of just a little over $1.0 billion this year. On the other hand, ransomware has been the only type of cryptocurrency-based crime that is on the rise, with attackers extorting $175.8 million more than what they earned at the same point in 2022. This increase in ransomware attacks could indicate a reversal of the positive downward trend we saw in 2022.</p>



<p>To gain a better understanding of the decline in scams and the rise in ransomware in 2023, let&#8217;s take a closer look at their respective activities. It is possible that scams have declined due to increased awareness among the public, leading to more caution and better recognition of fraudulent activities. Meanwhile, the rise in ransomware attacks could be attributed to attackers&#8217; increasing sophistication in their methods and the evolving tactics they use to extort money from victims. However, it is essential to remain vigilant and stay informed about emerging trends in cryptocurrency-based crimes to prevent falling prey to such malicious activities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Cryptocurrency scam revenue plummets as two of 2023’s biggest scams abruptly disappear</h2>



<p>Cryptocurrency-based scams have been a major concern in recent years, consistently ranking as the highest-revenue form of cybercrime. However, there seems to be a significant decline in the total revenue generated by these scams in 2023, compared to previous years. In fact, through the end of June, crypto scammers have pulled in 77% less revenue than they did through June of 2022, which itself saw a decline in revenue compared to the previous year. This decline is notable, especially given the rising trend of crypto asset prices. Typically, positive price movements translate to higher scam revenue, as increased market exuberance and FOMO make victims more susceptible to scammers&#8217; schemes. However, 2023&#8217;s drastic scam decline bucks that long-standing trend.</p>



<p>One possible explanation for this decline is the increasing awareness among crypto users about the prevalence of scams and measures to avoid them. More and more people are becoming educated about the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies and are taking steps to protect themselves from falling prey to scams. Furthermore, regulatory bodies are taking a more active role in cracking down on scams and fraud in the crypto industry, which may be deterring would-be scammers from operating.</p>



<p>Despite the decline in total revenue, cryptocurrency-based scams still pose a significant threat to investors and the industry as a whole. It is important for users to remain vigilant and adopt best practices to avoid falling victim to these scams. The chart below shows the total daily crypto scam revenue and revenue for the ten largest crypto entities identified as scams by Chainalysis.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chart-2-1-scam-top-ten-1024x481.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chart-2-1-scam-top-ten-1024x481.png" alt="Crypto Crime Drops 65%: Mid-Year 2023 Update Reveals Positive Trend" class="wp-image-7550" title="Crypto Crime Drops 65%: Mid-Year 2023 Update Reveals Positive Trend 20"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>We can see here that the category’s revenue decline is largely driven by the sudden disappearance of two large-scale scams: VidiLook and, to a lesser degree, Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Financial Management. Both scams follow the typical investment scam model of offering outsized returns on any cryptocurrency “invested” by users, but VidiLook does so with a unique twist, paying users its native VDL token in return for watching digital ads, which it then claims users can stake for large rewards.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/vidilook-guy-1024x751.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/vidilook-guy-1024x751.png" alt="Crypto Crime Drops 65%: Mid-Year 2023 Update Reveals Positive Trend" class="wp-image-7551" title="Crypto Crime Drops 65%: Mid-Year 2023 Update Reveals Positive Trend 21"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p><em>Source:&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcWDcvFLSsg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>YouTube</em></a></p>



<p>Both VidiLook and Chia Tai appear to have&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_scam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exit scammed</a>, as they’ve moved all cryptocurrency out of their primary wallets and ceased deposits and withdrawals for users. We can see how VidiLook’s exit scam unfolded on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/chainalysis-reactor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chainalysis Reactor</a>&nbsp;graph below.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/vidilook-grf-final-1024x444.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/vidilook-grf-final-1024x444.png" alt="Crypto Crime Drops 65%: Mid-Year 2023 Update Reveals Positive Trend" class="wp-image-7552" title="Crypto Crime Drops 65%: Mid-Year 2023 Update Reveals Positive Trend 22"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>After receiving funds from victims throughout the beginning of 2023, VidiLook sent over $50 million in USDT_TRX to the personal wallet on the right side of the graph during the months of March and April 2023, with most being sent after VidiLook’s reported exit scam in mid-April.</p>



<p>VidiLook’s exit scam isn’t surprising, but what is surprising is that total scam revenue remains so low after its decline. Ordinarily, we’d expect new scams to fill the void. But despite low overall scam revenues this year, VidiLook serves as an example of why cryptocurrency businesses, users, and law enforcement must remain vigilant — VidiLook bilked victims out of over $120 million worth of cryptocurrency in just a few months, highlighting the damage a single effective scam can do in a short period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s also worth noting that while crypto scam revenue is significantly down as a whole, one type of scam has taken a much smaller hit than others.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chart-3-scam-subclasses-1024x675.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chart-3-scam-subclasses-1024x675.png" alt="Crypto Crime Drops 65%: Mid-Year 2023 Update Reveals Positive Trend" class="wp-image-7553" title="Crypto Crime Drops 65%: Mid-Year 2023 Update Reveals Positive Trend 23"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Impersonation scams, in which fraudsters impersonate a law enforcement officer or some other kind of authority figure to extort money from victims, have seen just a 23% decline in inflows so far in 2023, compared to 77% for scams as a whole. Worse yet, the number of individual transfers to impersonation scam addresses has actually&nbsp;<em>increased</em>&nbsp;49% year over year, suggesting that more people have fallen victim to impersonation scams in 2023, even if the total amount lost is lower. Those data points go to show that even with total scam revenue down, law enforcement and crypto compliance teams can’t rest on their laurels.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Ransomware rising as big game hunting makes a comeback</h2>



<p>Ransomware is the one form of cryptocurrency-based crime on the rise so far in 2023. In fact, ransomware attackers are on pace for their second-biggest year ever, having extorted at least $449.1 million through June.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chart-4-ransomware-1024x659.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chart-4-ransomware-1024x659.png" alt="Crypto Crime Drops 65%: Mid-Year 2023 Update Reveals Positive Trend" class="wp-image-7554" title="Crypto Crime Drops 65%: Mid-Year 2023 Update Reveals Positive Trend 24"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>If this pace continues, ransomware attackers will extort $898.6 million from victims in 2023, trailing only 2021’s $939.9 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we published our annual&nbsp;<a href="https://go.chainalysis.com/2023-crypto-crime-report.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crypto Crime Report</a>&nbsp;in February, we were pleased to report that 2022 ransomware revenue had&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/crypto-ransomware-revenue-down-as-victims-refuse-to-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plummeted significantly</a>&nbsp;compared to 2021. Why the reversal in fortunes? For one thing, big game hunting — that is, the targeting of large, deep-pocketed organizations by ransomware attackers — seems to have bounced back after a lull in 2022. At the same time, the number of successful small attacks has also grown. Both trends are evident on the chart below, which shows how the distribution of ransomware payment sizes has changed since 2020.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Daily-OpenSea-volume-exceeds-2020-total.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chart-5-ransomware-dist-1024x701.png" alt="Crypto Crime Drops 65%: Mid-Year 2023 Update Reveals Positive Trend" class="wp-image-7555" title="Crypto Crime Drops 65%: Mid-Year 2023 Update Reveals Positive Trend 25"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>On the left side of the graph, we see an increase in the number of very small ransomware payments in 2023, while the number of very large payments on the right side has also grown substantially. The payment size distribution has also extended to include higher amounts compared to previous years. In other words, we’re seeing growth in ransomware payments at both ends of the spectrum. Below are a few ransomware strains whose average and median payment sizes reflect those extremes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Strain name</strong></td><td><strong>2023 average payment size</strong></td><td><strong>2023 median payment size</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Dharma</td><td>$265</td><td>$275</td></tr><tr><td>Phobos</td><td>$1,719</td><td>$300</td></tr><tr><td>Stop/djvu</td><td>$619</td><td>$563</td></tr><tr><td>BlackBasta</td><td>$762,634</td><td>$147,106</td></tr><tr><td>ALPHV/Blackcat</td><td>$1,504,579</td><td>$305,585</td></tr><tr><td>Cl0p</td><td>$1,730,486</td><td>$1,946,335</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>At the top of the chart, we see low-level Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) strains like Dharma and Phobos, which are typically used in spray and pray attacks against smaller targets and can be deployed by relatively unsophisticated actors. These types of attacks can have devastating effects on small businesses and individuals. In the middle range of the chart, we see an increase in the number of ransomware strains that are more sophisticated and require more technical expertise to deploy. These types of attacks are more targeted and tend to hit bigger organizations for more money. At the bottom of the chart, we see the biggest, most sophisticated strains like BlackBasta and Cl0p, which are typically deployed by highly skilled actors. These types of attacks are the most dangerous and can have the greatest impact on large organizations.</p>



<p>Experts at cybersecurity and incident response firm Kivu have seen 2023’s changes in ransomware patterns first-hand, especially the growth in payment sizes. “These notable shifts in figures directly align with the growing number of extremely high initial demands, ranging in the tens and hundreds of millions of USD,” said Kivu General Counsel and Risk Officer Andrew J. Davis. This trend is particularly concerning for businesses and individuals who may not have the financial resources to pay such exorbitant demands.</p>



<p>While we previously attributed the 2022 decline in average ransom size to improved cybersecurity and data backup practices by large organizations, as well as law enforcement efforts, increased availability of decryptors, and sanctions against services offering cashout services to ransomware gangs, it appears that attackers are adapting to these changes. In 2023, both small and large organizations are being targeted more frequently, and the size of ransom demands is increasing. This trend is likely due, in part, to the fact that many organizations are still refusing to pay ransoms. However, this non-payment trend may also be prompting ransomware attackers to increase the size of their ransom demands, perhaps with the intention of squeezing the most money possible out of the firms still willing to pay ransoms. To that end, Davis also noted an increase in more extreme extortion techniques, such as harassment of employees from victim firms who have not yet paid.</p>



<p>We also can’t discount the role of the Russia-Ukraine War in last year’s ransomware decline, as the conflict likely displaced ransomware operators and diverted them away from financially inspired cyber intrusions. It is clear the ransomware ecosystem has rebounded in 2023 both in terms of payments and attacks, with record-setting incident numbers. The data serves as an important reminder that ransomware remains a significant threat, and that businesses should continue to shore up their cybersecurity and data backup procedures for added protection.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">2023 is off to a good start</h2>



<p>According to the data from Chainalysis, the year 2023 is showing a significant decline in crypto crime, with the exception of ransomware. This decline in illicit inflows signifies that the combined efforts of both private and public sectors are paying off well. The pressure from law enforcement agencies seems to be working effectively in curbing criminal activity, while crypto businesses are also doing their part in preventing scams and hacks, especially for DeFi protocols, which have been a major concern in previous years. The need for vigilance, however, is still apparent as ransomware continues to be a persistent threat. We will continue to monitor these trends closely and share updates as they become available. We also look forward to presenting our year-end findings in our next Crypto Crime Report.</p>

<p>Kava, a Layer 1 blockchain that combines the power of Ethereum developers with the speed and interoperability of Cosmos, has launched the Kava 14 upgrade. This upgrade implements &#8216;internal bridge&#8217; technology to seamlessly migrate native Cosmos assets to and from Ethereum&#8217;s ERC-20 token standard.</p>

<p>This is a big step forward for Cosmos DeFi builders and users to provide a safer, more secure, and more reliable method for transferring assets to and from the Cosmos ecosystem.</p>



<p>In July of Tether, Kucoin now <a href="https://coincu.com/196860-tether-to-launch-usdt-on-kava/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supports</a> Kava&#8217;s Cosmos network and EVM, providing reliable CEX for user transactions in the Cosmos ecosystem. Meanwhile, Curve Finance&#8217;s launch of the USDt liquidity pool offers a decentralized alternative for experienced users. At the same time, Stargate, the top liquidity layer of the multi-chain, is set to launch on Kava, anticipating increased usage and liquidity. This expansion follows a governance proposal that plans to expand the reach of the Kava Rise incentive fund.</p>

<p>Unlike third-party external bridging solutions that create fragmented pools of wrapped assets, with the launch of Kava 14, <a href="https://twitter.com/KAVA_CHAIN/status/1671500022808993793" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USDt </a>issued natively on Kava is portable between chains blocks IBC and EVM through an &#8216;internal bridge&#8217; with strict access controls and restrictions that significantly mitigate vector attacks. Kava makes moving assets across chains fast and highly secure, providing users with an efficient mechanism for stablecoin liquidity provision and transfer.</p>



<p>This integration thus has the potential to catalyze a significant expansion of the DeFi economy on Cosmos, providing an attractive solution to the liquidity problem that has been challenging since Terra&#8217;s UST collapsed. dumped in Q1 2022. Deploying Tether, a stablecoin with a strong market reputation and ~65% dominance, will also increase security and reliability for users and developers alike.</p>



<p>Kava is a secure, lightning-fast Layer 1 blockchain that combines the developer power of Ethereum with the speed and interoperability of Cosmos in a single, scalable network. Kava is the trusted choice for developers and users worldwide and is committed to driving innovation and growth.</p>
