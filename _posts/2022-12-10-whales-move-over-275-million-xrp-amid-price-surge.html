Amid the crypto winter and the Ripple lawsuit saga, XRP is breaking records with over a 4% price surge in 30 days. Unfortunately, the past 30 days have been terrible in the market after the FTX collapse, which broke down cryptocurrency values. However, the low price period proved very beneficial to some fat wallet holders who seized the opportunity to accumulate more assets. Ripple&#8217;s native token, XRP, recorded more recovery than Bitcoin amid whale accumulations in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Ethereum: On-Chain And Social Metrics Reveal Bulls Vs.

The data also revealed that whales purchased over 113 million XRP, about $44 million, in the past 24 hours. Is XRP Showing Signs Of Dominance Over Bitcoin? Most of the transactions came from the Bitso crypto exchange, with the highest record being XRP tokens worth over $15.3 million. These movements saw a price surge in the XRP token, bringing over a 4% increase. However, Bitcoin trades at the $17,153 level, with a 3% dump in the last 30 days. Around the same time, Ripple&#8217;s general counsel, Stuart Alderoty, announced the filing of their final briefing in the XRP lawsuit. The two-year-long legal tussle between the SEC and Ripple is approaching the summary judgment stage. The crypto industry anticipates the outcome of the court&#8217;s ruling as it would affect the future of XRP and the broader digital assets. If the SEC wins the case, XRP will be seen as a security, and other similar tokens may follow suit. Ripples believe the long-standing battle with the Securities and Exchanges Commission is a fight for the crypto industry. However, Stuart Alderoty affirms that the Securities and Exchanges Commission holds no proof to satisfy its claims that XRP is a security. The attorney believes the defendants have an advantage over the commission in the case. Whales&#8217; Continuous Transfer Of XRP: Hold Or Sell signal?
