<ul>
<li><em>SlowMist exposes a concealed false deposit attack on CEXs.</em></li>



<li><em>Attacker exploited loophole in exchange&#8217;s transaction processing mechanism.</em></li>



<li><em>Importance of enhanced security measures and collaboration in fortifying crypto landscape against malicious actors.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SlowMist has recently brought to light a shocking revelation that exposes a false deposit attack that has remained concealed within centralized exchanges (CEXs) for an extended period.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2141.png"><img decoding="async" width="976" height="716" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2141.png" alt="SlowMist Reveals Long-Hidden False Deposit Attack on CEXs" class="wp-image-206841" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2141.png 976w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2141-300x220.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2141-768x563.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2141-750x550.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px" title="SlowMist Reveals Long-Hidden False Deposit Attack on CEXs 1"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p> The attack exploited vulnerabilities in the exchange&#8217;s transaction processing mechanism.</p>



<p><a href="https://slowmist.medium.com/how-does-the-false-top-up-attack-break-through-the-defense-of-the-exchange-d6e8ebb434f5" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://slowmist.medium.com/how-does-the-false-top-up-attack-break-through-the-defense-of-the-exchange-d6e8ebb434f5" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to SlowMist&#8217;s detailed analysis</a>, the attacker executed the false deposit attack by sending forged transaction data to the exchange&#8217;s designated wallet address. Tragically, the exchange&#8217;s system erroneously perceived the malicious transaction as a legitimate deposit request and credited the corresponding digital assets directly into the attacker&#8217;s account.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2142.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="918" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2142-1024x918.png" alt="SlowMist Reveals Long-Hidden False Deposit Attack on CEXs" class="wp-image-206842" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2142-1024x918.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2142-300x269.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2142-768x689.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2142-750x672.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2142-1140x1022.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2142.png 1314w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="SlowMist Reveals Long-Hidden False Deposit Attack on CEXs 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This sophisticated attack method enabled the attacker to accumulate a substantial amount of digital assets over time, taking advantage of the loophole in the exchange&#8217;s security protocols. SlowMist&#8217;s disclosure of this previously hidden attack has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community, raising concerns about the vulnerabilities present in some CEXs.</p>



<p>False deposit attacks pose significant risks to exchanges and their users. The seamless execution of such attacks raises questions about the efficacy of existing security measures employed by CEXs to safeguard user assets.</p>



<p>The revelation has sparked discussions among industry experts and stakeholders about the need for enhanced security measures and robust transaction verification protocols within centralized exchange platforms. Ensuring the integrity and accuracy of deposit processing is paramount to protect users from potential financial losses.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2143.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="400" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2143.png" alt="SlowMist Reveals Long-Hidden False Deposit Attack on CEXs" class="wp-image-206843" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2143.png 400w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2143-300x300.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2143-150x150.png 150w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2143-75x75.png 75w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2143-350x350.png 350w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" title="SlowMist Reveals Long-Hidden False Deposit Attack on CEXs 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>While SlowMist&#8217;s disclosure has shed light on this particular false deposit attack, it also underscores the importance of constant vigilance and thorough security audits within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As the industry continues to evolve, addressing vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors becomes a shared responsibility among exchanges, security companies, and users alike.</p>



<p>SlowMist&#8217;s dedication to cybersecurity and its commitment to uncovering hidden threats in the crypto space further emphasizes the importance of collaboration between security firms and industry players. This collaborative approach is instrumental in fortifying the crypto landscape against malicious actors.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Phoenix Technology, a UAE-based cryptocurrency mining hardware retailer, is in preliminary discussions for a potential IPO in Abu Dhabi.</em></li>



<li><em>The company is developing one of the largest mining facilities in the Middle East with a $2 billion crypto-mining farm project.</em></li>



<li><em>UAE&#8217;s crypto-friendly policies and growing interest in blockchain technology make it an attractive hub for the industry</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Phoenix Technology, a leading cryptocurrency mining hardware retailer based in the United Arab Emirates, is reportedly in the early stages of considering an initial public offering (IPO) in its home country, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-28/crypto-hardware-retailer-phoenix-said-in-early-talks-for-uae-ipo#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2138.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2138-1024x683.png" alt="Phoenix Technology Explores Prospects With Potential UAE IPO" class="wp-image-206829" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2138-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2138-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2138-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2138-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2138.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Phoenix Technology Explores Prospects With Potential UAE IPO 4"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to insiders familiar with the matter, the company is contemplating a listing on the stock exchange in Abu Dhabi as early as this year.</p>



<p>The firm is known for its ambitious project to create one of the largest mining facilities in the entire Middle East. While specific details of the IPO, such as the exact timing and size, are still fluid and subject to change, the potential move signals Phoenix Technology&#8217;s desire to capitalize on the growing interest in cryptocurrencies and the blockchain industry.</p>



<p>The United Arab Emirates, particularly Dubai, has been proactively positioning itself as a welcoming hub for the crypto sector, drawing in major players like <a href="https://coincu.com/206699-binance-accuses-cftc-overruling-stop-the-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a>, <a href="https://coincu.com/206150-okx-wallet-worldcoin-power/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OKX</a>, and <a href="https://coincu.com/197893-bybit-now-secures-license-to-cyprus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bybit</a>. This appeal has been boosted by the country&#8217;s friendly policies and supportive stance on cryptocurrencies. However, recent reports indicate that the UAE is now taking steps to tighten scrutiny of crypto license applicants to ensure proper oversight, especially in the wake of prominent scandals within the industry.</p>



<p>Phoenix Technology&#8217;s establishment in 2015 has seen impressive growth, with operations spanning across the US, Canada, Europe, and the Middle East, totaling more than 700 megawatts. The company&#8217;s latest and most ambitious venture is the development of a massive $2 billion crypto-mining farm within the UAE, aiming to become the largest mining site in the region.</p>



<p>Additionally, Phoenix Technology last year announced a strategic and exclusive regional partnership agreement with MicroBT, a blockchain technology company, to distribute their acclaimed WhatsMiner brand in the GCC countries, Egypt, and Turkey markets.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2140.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="770" height="440" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2140.png" alt="Phoenix Technology Explores Prospects With Potential UAE IPO" class="wp-image-206832" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2140.png 770w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2140-300x171.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2140-768x439.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2140-750x429.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" title="Phoenix Technology Explores Prospects With Potential UAE IPO 5"></a></figure></div>


<p>The potential IPO in Abu Dhabi comes at a pivotal moment for the global cryptocurrency industry, where market interest and regulatory scrutiny are at an all-time high. Phoenix Technology&#8217;s move to go public could not only bolster its financial standing but also contribute to further cementing the UAE&#8217;s position as a major player in the ever-evolving blockchain landscape. However, as with any financial endeavor, the success of the IPO will depend on market conditions and regulatory developments.</p>



<p>As of now, the company has not released any official statements regarding the IPO discussions. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency community and investors will undoubtedly be keeping a close eye on Phoenix Technology&#8217;s next moves, as they could have significant implications for the future of the UAE&#8217;s role in the rapidly expanding crypto space.</p>

<p>The recent MKR movements involving a16z, Paradigm, Coinbase, and <a href="https://falconx.io/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://falconx.io/" rel="noreferrer noopener">FalconX</a> raise questions about the motivations behind such actions.

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>South Korean gaming company WeMade investigated for using controversial financial techniques with WEMIX tokens.</em></li>



<li><em>Memo reveals plan to lock up tokens and conduct a secondary sale through crypto exchange.</em></li>



<li><em>Allegations of fraud led to delisting from major South Korean exchanges.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em>Block Media</em> <a href="https://www.blockmedia.co.kr/archives/340180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> an exclusive revelation that the South Korean game company WeMade attempted to utilize a &#8220;structured financial technology&#8221; method to transfer tokens owned by the Wemix Foundation.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2130.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="749" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2130-1024x749.png" alt="WeMade Investigated For Controversial Financial Technique Involving WEMIX Tokens" class="wp-image-206808" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2130-1024x749.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2130-300x219.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2130-768x562.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2130-750x549.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2130.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="WeMade Investigated For Controversial Financial Technique Involving WEMIX Tokens 13"></a></figure></div>


<p>The company planned to lock them up for a specific duration and then engage in a secondary sale to an on-site cryptocurrency exchange. This approach was considered as an alternative when the exchange sale faced hurdles due to the <a href="https://coincu.com/150005-court-rejects-wemades-wemixs-delisting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WEMIX</a> issuance controversy.</p>



<p>According to a memorandum of transaction terms for structured financing obtained by <em>Block Media</em>, likely written in March this year, the minimum investment required was set at 300 million won, with a lock-up period of one year that could be adjusted based on the investment amount.</p>



<p>Under the terms of the fund&#8217;s purchase of tokens held by the Wemix Foundation, a discount rate exceeding 20% was applied, enabling investors to achieve a 20% profit even if the WEMIX token&#8217;s price remained constant for a year after the transaction. The fund offered a base rate of return of 10%, and investors were subject to a 1% management fee. Furthermore, if the fund&#8217;s profit exceeded 10% when selling WEMIX tokens one year later, an additional 10% would be paid to the fund manager as a performance fee.</p>

<p>An anonymous source familiar with the fund transaction disclosed that the Wemix Foundation intended to create a fund of 3 to 5 billion won or more, primarily catering to large individual investors.</p>



<p>When approached by <em>Block Media</em>, WeMade officials stated that the only use of WEMIX tokens in the fund was limited to 18 million cases utilized in the Hyperism Eco Fund, which was publicly disclosed in the second quarter of 2022.</p>



<p>The situation surrounding WeMade and its WEMIX tokens has attracted significant attention from South Korean authorities. Following a complaint filed by WEMIX investors on May 12, accusing the company of fraud, embezzlement, and breach of trust, prosecutors initiated a comprehensive compulsory investigation into the market maker of <a href="https://coincu.com/153026-wemade-unveils-blockchain-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WeMade</a>, a listed game company in the country. This investigation also involved the seizure and search of relevant materials.</p>

<p>Coincu previously <a href="https://coincu.com/199111-wemade-under-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that the South Korean authorities are scrutinizing WeMade and its WEMIX token market maker amid allegations of fraud and breach of trust. The investigation extended to WeMade&#8217;s headquarters and market makers involved in WEMIX activities. These allegations have led to the company&#8217;s delisting from major South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges, adding to the complexity of the situation.</p>



<p>As the investigation continues, authorities and investors alike are closely monitoring the outcome to assess the potential impact on the gaming company and its cryptocurrency-related activities.</p>

<p>The two countries have also had discussions regarding their individual approaches to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) which is a digital version of a country&#8217;s fiat currency. Both countries emphasized the importance of these efforts and the need for them to be part of international standard-setting bodies like the International Organization of Securities Commissions (<a href="https://www.iosco.org/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.iosco.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">IOSCO</a>) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB).</p>



<p>The United Kingdom and Singapore have agreed to sustain their dialogue and collaboration on the regulation of crypto and digital assets. They will also work together on other areas such as sustainable finance, fintech, and innovation.</p>

<p>In June, the Monetary Authority of Singapore published a whitepaper that outlines a standard for the use of digital currencies, including CBDCs. This whitepaper was created in partnership with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as well as the central banks of Italy and South Korea, among others. It is expected that this initiative will pave the way for more countries to adopt similar standards and contribute to the global evolution of digital currencies.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2124.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2124-1024x683.png" alt="Arthur Hayes Predicts AI Powered by DAO for Self-Organization" class="wp-image-206780" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2124-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2124-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2124-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2124-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2124.png 1098w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Arthur Hayes Predicts AI Powered by DAO for Self-Organization 18"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p><a href="https://cryptohayes.medium.com/moai-da798c72a83b" data-type="URL" data-id="https://cryptohayes.medium.com/moai-da798c72a83b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Hayes, </a>AI will adopt a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure for self-organization. Unlike traditional centralized systems, DAO relies on public blockchains, paving the way for a new era of collaboration between AI and humans within the AI+Human economy.</p>



<p>The DAO structure empowers AI and humans to collaboratively shape the future of various industries, enabling growth and prosperity in the evolving digital landscape. By harnessing the potential of public blockchains, DAO gains independence from state control, offering a more decentralized and autonomous approach to organization.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2123.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="775" height="1024" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2123-775x1024.png" alt="Arthur Hayes Predicts AI Powered by DAO for Self-Organization" class="wp-image-206779" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2123-775x1024.png 775w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2123-227x300.png 227w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2123-768x1014.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2123-750x991.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2123.png 848w" sizes="(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px" title="Arthur Hayes Predicts AI Powered by DAO for Self-Organization 19"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Hayes emphasizes that the role of DAOs will be instrumental in facilitating the expansion of the AI+Human economy. This synergy between AI and human intelligence creates a powerful ecosystem, driving innovation and unlocking untapped potential in various sectors.</p>



<p>As AI&#8217;s capabilities continue to grow, it becomes evident that traditional centralized systems cannot effectively govern artificial intelligence. DAOs present a robust alternative, providing the structure and framework needed for AI and human collaboration without heavy reliance on central authorities.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2125.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="542" height="708" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2125.png" alt="Arthur Hayes Predicts AI Powered by DAO for Self-Organization" class="wp-image-206781" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2125.png 542w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2125-230x300.png 230w" sizes="(max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px" title="Arthur Hayes Predicts AI Powered by DAO for Self-Organization 20"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>One of the key advantages of the DAO structure lies in its ability to raise funds and trade various tokens, including debt, equity, and utility, on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). By leveraging DEXs hosted by non-traditional centralized exchanges (CEXs), DAOs ensure a more transparent and secure environment for financial activities.</p>



<p>Hayes foresees the emergence of natural monopolies within the crypto space, particularly for exchanges that facilitate the trading of all forms of DAO tokens. Identifying such DEXs and acquiring their admin tokens could potentially lead to substantial profits for investors and participants in the evolving AI-driven economy.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>U.S. Senate passes 2024 NDAA with tighter crypto regulations.</em></li>



<li><em>The bipartisan amendment targets crypto trading oversight and anonymous assets.</em></li>



<li><em>Bill requires Treasury examination standards for crypto and study on combating anonymous transactions.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The U.S. Senate successfully passed the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a significant milestone that included a provision aimed at enhancing oversight over financial institutions involved in cryptocurrency trading, <em>Reuters</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/majority-us-senate-backs-sweeping-defense-policy-bill-voting-continues-2023-07-28/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2119.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="717" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2119-1024x717.png" alt="U.S. Senate Passes 2024 NDAA With Stricter Crypto Regulations And Oversight" class="wp-image-206775" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2119-1024x717.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2119-300x210.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2119-768x538.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2119-750x525.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2119-1140x798.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2119.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="U.S. Senate Passes 2024 NDAA With Stricter Crypto Regulations And Oversight 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>Additionally, the legislation targeted crypto mixers and &#8220;anonymity-enhancing&#8221; crypto assets, making it one of the most substantial congressional actions taken to date concerning digital assets.</p>



<p>This amendment was <a href="https://coincu.com/206365-us-senate-advances-crypto-aml-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced</a> by a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators, including Kirsten Gillibrand, Cynthia Lummis, Elizabeth Warren, and Roger Marshall. In a joint press release, the senators emphasized the importance of this move in regulating the crypto landscape and combating illicit finance activities.</p>



<p>The Senate&#8217;s approval of the NDAA, by a notable 86-11 vote, authorized a topline figure of $886 billion for fiscal year 2024, a total amount agreed upon during the debt ceiling negotiations between the Biden administration and House Republicans.</p>



<p>Unlike previous years, the passage of the NDAA encountered minimal drama, as the Senate displayed a commitment to bipartisan cooperation. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer consistently urged the chamber to expedite the legislative process in a collaborative manner.</p>



<p>The provisions included in the amendment were derived from the 2023 Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act and Senator Warren&#8217;s and Senator Marshall&#8217;s Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act, both introduced in 2022. The key aspects of the amendment required the Secretary of the Treasury to establish examination standards for crypto assets, enabling better risk assessment and ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering and sanctions laws. Additionally, the Treasury Department was mandated to conduct a study on combating anonymous crypto asset transactions, particularly focusing on the use of crypto mixers that can obscure fund origins.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2121.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="500" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2121.png" alt="U.S. Senate Passes 2024 NDAA With Stricter Crypto Regulations And Oversight" class="wp-image-206777" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2121.png 900w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2121-300x167.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2121-768x427.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2121-750x417.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="U.S. Senate Passes 2024 NDAA With Stricter Crypto Regulations And Oversight 22"></a></figure></div>


<p>Senator Lummis stressed the necessity of cracking down on illicit finance in the crypto industry to root out bad actors and prevent crypto assets from being exploited for evading sanctions and funding terrorism.</p>



<p>It is customary to add non-defense-related amendments to the NDAA. Notably, the Republican-controlled House passed its version of the bill by a narrow 219-210 majority, with some hard-right Republicans introducing amendments addressing social issues unrelated to defense, such as the repeal of a Pentagon policy related to service members&#8217; abortion-related travel expenses.</p>



<p>In the same vein, the House Financial Services Committee <a href="https://coincu.com/206573-house-lawmakers-locked-in-battle-stablecoins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">approved</a> the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act on July 26. The bill aims to establish clear guidelines and consumer protections for the cryptocurrency industry. Although the bill passed with a 35-15 vote, it faced strong opposition from several senior Democrats.</p>

<p>In a separate development, the House Agriculture Committee also <a href="https://coincu.com/206631-house-agriculture-committee-crypto-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advanced</a> the Financial Innovation Technology for the 21st Century Act following the House Financial Services Committee&#8217;s approval. The bill seeks to create a comprehensive federal regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies within the United States.</p>
