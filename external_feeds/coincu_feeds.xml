<p>In his latest post on Twitter, he expressed his experiences at <a href="https://news.coincu.com/160740-us-trustee-disagrees-with-ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a> and with the former head of the now-defunct exchange <a href="https://news.coincu.com/160662-bankman-fried-secret-allow-backdoor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>. Harrison says <strong>his first month at FTX US was &#8220;wonderful.&#8221; </strong>The impression of the former FTX US chairman with SBF is &#8220;seemed like a sensitive and intellectually curious person who cares about animals, and that endeared him to me.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">11/49 My first few months at FTX US were wonderful. I worked largely independently of Sam to grow a US-based team and foster a professional environment prepared for regulated businesses.</p>&mdash; Brett Harrison (@BrettHarrison88) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrettHarrison88/status/1614371371454275586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 14, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>After a while, however, Harrison realized that SBF, despite being less involved in the U.S. business. but his decisions often come &#8220;without warning.&#8221; And then Harrison&#8217;s decisions were rejected by the SBF, leading to a rift in their relationship.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">15/49 Six months into my time at the company, pronounced cracks began to form in my own relationship with Sam. Around then I began advocating strongly for establishing separation and independence for the executive, legal, and developer teams of FTX US, and Sam disagreed.</p>&mdash; Brett Harrison (@BrettHarrison88) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrettHarrison88/status/1614371376751689728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 14, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The former chairman would like to reiterate that<strong> people thought this was a &#8220;dream job,&#8221; </strong>but for him, <strong>it was not</strong>, given all of the events he went through at FTX US in the months leading up to the relinquishment of his position. his relationship with &#8220;Sam Bankman-Fried and his deputies had reached a point of total deterioration, after months of negotiation over management practices at FTX.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">3/49 The truth was that FTX US hadn’t felt to me like the dream job it appeared to the industry and media for some time, and my departure was not abrupt.</p>&mdash; Brett Harrison (@BrettHarrison88) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrettHarrison88/status/1614371361060708353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 14, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Harrison claimed to have noticed a change in the first SBF and &#8220;intransigence when his decisions were questioned, his spitefulness, and the volatility of his temperament.&#8221; He also implied that<strong> the disagreement between him and the SBF reached a climax when Sam&#8217;s allure overpowered them all.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">21/49 Standing up to an insecure, prideful manager is hard under any circumstance. But it’s nearly impossible when every day, every major voice of culture and commerce deafens you with a narrative that implies if you disagree with your manager *you* clearly must be wrong.</p>&mdash; Brett Harrison (@BrettHarrison88) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrettHarrison88/status/1614371385060507648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 14, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>At the end of September last year, the crypto community was quite <a href="https://news.coincu.com/128304-brett-harrison-is-leaving-president-ftx-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surprised</a> when <strong>Brett Harrison</strong> gave up his position at <strong>FTX US</strong>. Brett Harrison managed the company&#8217;s expansion as it held unicorn status and ventured outside of cryptocurrency to include stock and non-fungible token trading after joining the company as president in <strong>May 2021</strong>.</p>

<p>The Acumen Microfinance Responsive Dapp Project Built on Solana connects crypto and traditional finance, allowing DeFi users to earn attractive, stable, and uncorrelated returns while creating environment equality where Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and entrepreneurs can prosper. The project allows depositors of all sizes to participate in the microfinance economy.</p>



<p>After the FTX crisis, the project claimed to be unaffected by the FTX crash but <a href="https://acumenofficial.medium.com/important-snapshot-for-evm-move-taken-4ba9ed227d9c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took a snapshot </a>of all $ACM token holders on Solana. All holders of this unlocked $ACM token will receive a new token on the EVM chain when it becomes available. All fairlaunch locked token holders will also be treated the same as before.</p>

<p>Before learning about projects, let&#8217;s have an overview of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/160682-cardanos-vasil-hard-fork-mean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardano Blockchain</a>.</p>



<p>Cardano&#8217;s ICO, ADA token, in December 2016 helped the team <strong>raise over $62 million</strong>. Cardano was launched in September 2017 by Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Ethereum, and aims to be a <strong>third-generation blockchain project (or blockchain 3.0) </strong>based on the pioneering technology of Bitcoin (the world&#8217;s) first generation) and Ethereum (second generation). Cardano aims to be a highly scalable and energy-efficient intelligent contract platform.</p>



<p>The Ouroboros consensus mechanism is based on peer-reviewed research by computer scientists and cryptographers from the University of Edinburgh, the University of Tokyo, and others. Their goal is to build a decentralized network that can validate transactions securely in a scalable way while ensuring that the Cardano platform is as energy efficient as possible.</p>



<p>Cardano is one of the most<strong> innovative and exciting blockchain projects in the space,</strong> referred to by many as the &#8220;Third Generation&#8221; blockchain network. It is often praised for its advanced functionality and cryptography compared to older blockchains, which is slower and less efficient.</p>



<p>Cardano&#8217;s ADA native token is also used to power platforms like Ethereum&#8217;s ETH. It is used in the blockchain&#8217;s PoS consensus mechanism to pay transaction fees on the network and reward users for participating in Cardano staking.</p>



<p>In the future, it could also become a governance token that allows holders to vote on changes and upgrades to the Cardano platform.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>1. Minswap (MIN)</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="451" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-913-1024x451.png" alt="Top 3 Best dApp Projects On Cardano Blockchain You Can&#039;t Miss" class="wp-image-160790" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-913-1024x451.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-913-300x132.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-913-768x338.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-913-1536x676.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-913-750x330.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-913-1140x502.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-913.png 1841w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Top 5 Best dApp Projects On Cardano Blockchain You Can&#039;t Miss 11"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Minswap is an automated market-maker (AMM) decentralized exchange (DEX) that <strong>supports multiple pricing functions for a single liquidity pool</strong>. Traditionally centralized exchanges have been backed by large trading firms or brokerage houses with deep capital funding. They would earn profits through the spread that the centralized exchanges were offering. Minswap leverages the concepts of DeFi and AMM to allow individual retailers to pool their funds and provide the same service as trading firms. Through pooling funds, individuals can become the market markers and earn profits from the spread, while traders gain access to competitive rates.</p>



<p>Liquid Finance enables users to lend and borrow against their Cardano assets through AMMs. Minswap builds on this and <strong>allows users to trade pairs directly as a decentralized exchange</strong>. Both provide large volumes of liquidity to the space and help build out the Cardano blockchain by providing fluid transactions of Cardano native assets. SundaeSwap is another project trying to help build out the Cardano ecosystem by providing an additional decentralized exchange protocol.</p>



<p>The Babel fee mechanism on MinSwap allows users to pay transaction fees with other tokens without having to hold ADA, which is another innovative feature of the platform. This is a traditional game changer on the Ethereum platform. Users need to keep ETH to swap any two ERC20 tokens, which can cause enormous difficulties, especially for users. The newbie must understand that it&#8217;s necessary to hold ETH to cover network fees among more than 10,000 tokens in the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>



<p>MinSwap is also compatible with Ethereum, which <strong>has an ERC20 converter that is highly convenient for connecting assets across networks.</strong></p>



<p>Another notable positive mention is around the platform&#8217;s <strong>MIN token</strong>. The DeFi platform has undergone a fair launch, which is rare nowadays. There are <strong>no private or VC rounds, ensuring that the community benefits and not early speculators, investors, and insiders who have no intention of using the platform.</strong></p>



<p>Therefore, Minswap is considered a solid DEX that meets the supply and demand of an exchange ecosystem.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>2. Liqwid Finance (LQ)</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Liqwid Finance is an open-sourced, algorithmic, non-custodial interest rate protocol. What this means is that it creates liquidity pools for lenders and borrowers. The interest rates are automated through a type of automated market maker (AMM) which <strong>is calculated based on the lender supply and borrower demand for any particular asset.</strong></p>



<p>Liqwid Finance is<strong> one of the flagship&nbsp;DeFi&nbsp;protocols </strong>on the Cardano blockchain. By using an automated market maker users remain in full control of their assets when they<strong> go to borrow or lend rather than depositing them with a centralized custodian</strong>. All liquidity pools on Liqwid Finance are exclusive to a native asset on the Cardano blockchain. The project creates a robust and secure marketplace where borrowers can find competitive rates, and lenders can earn passive income on their crypto assets.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>3. SundaeSwap (SUNDAE)</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="427" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-911-1024x427.png" alt="Top 3 Best dApp Projects On Cardano Blockchain You Can&#039;t Miss" class="wp-image-160788" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-911-1024x427.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-911-300x125.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-911-768x320.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-911-1536x640.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-911-750x312.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-911-1140x475.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-911.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Top 5 Best dApp Projects On Cardano Blockchain You Can&#039;t Miss 13"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>As the competition is so close between MinSwap and&nbsp;Sundaeswap, we figured it was only fair to mention the other leading DEX on Cardano. SundaeSwap is a decentralized exchange protocol for the Cardano network that <strong>enables native and ADA asset exchanges peer-to-peer in a trustless decentralized manne</strong>r.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SundaeSwap is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) similar to the likes of Uniswap and essentially performs in the same way but on Cardano instead of the Ethereum network. Instead of the more common buy and sell orders found on order book systems on exchanges, <strong>Sundaeswap creates a “Liquidity Pool” of reserves between two assets</strong>, where the value of both assets is more or less equal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once the pool is populated with assets, a trader submits a trade for one of the two assets in the pool, resulting in the price of both assets increasing or decreasing, creating a new market rate. Instead of filling a buy or sell order of another trader, the trader is buying or selling directly within the pool.</p>



<p>The SundaeSwap protocol works using a permissionless, decentralized system, meaning it can be accessed by anyone, anywhere, with no restrictions. As long as a user has a Cardano wallet and internet access, they can add and remove liquidity from a pool and swap assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The SundaeSwap interface is well-designed, easy to use, and the liquidity is sufficient for most traders’ needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The SUNDAE token is a utility token central to the operation of the SundaeSwap DEX. As the protocol establishes a DAO and is placed in the hands of the community, the SundaeSwap token will represent voting power within the organization.</p>

<p>The entire <strong>SUNDAE supply will be 2,000,000,000 tokens</strong>, with the majority distributed to users of the protocol. 55% of the SUNDAE supply went to the public, 5% to the initial stake pool offering, 25% went to the team, 13% to investors, 5% to future hires and 2% to investors.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>4. World Mobile Token (WMT)</strong></h2>

<p>The World Mobile Token is a blockchain-based solution for telecommunications infrastructure. The goal of the project is to develop a sharing economy around telecommunications and to <strong>connect the 3.7 billion people globally </strong>that are still unconnected to the internet. By connecting the unconnected people to the internet, World Mobile Token also opens up a multitude of opportunities for these people. Having a decentralized digital ID enables access to online banking, microcredit loans, healthcare, online education, as well as <strong>unlocking 3.7 billion new content creators and innovators.</strong></p>



<p>The problem that World Mobile Token is <strong>trying to solve is how to make the creation and maintenance of telecommunications infrastructure affordable and sustainable</strong>. This is a particularly&nbsp;difficult problem in remote and underdeveloped regions&nbsp;where the cost to develop the infrastructure using traditional means is simply not cost-effective.</p>



<p>The rewards for using the app and providing information to be recorded on the blockchain are then shared between World Mobile Token and the community the air node is located in. <strong>These rewards can be used to pay off the balance of the air node which incentivizes people to use the dApp</strong>. These profits can be used to pay off the balance of the hardware which then becomes community-owned and operated as a small business creating lasting sustainability in the area.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>5. AnetaBTC (cNETA)</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="856" height="482" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-915.png" alt="Top 3 Best dApp Projects On Cardano Blockchain You Can&#039;t Miss" class="wp-image-160793" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-915.png 856w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-915-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-915-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-915-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 856px) 100vw, 856px" title="Top 5 Best dApp Projects On Cardano Blockchain You Can&#039;t Miss 16"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The problem anetaBTC<strong> is trying to solve is how to enable users to leverage the value of their&nbsp;Bitcoin&nbsp;on other blockchain projects</strong>. By enabling users to leverage the value of their Bitcoin, anetaBTC also provides much-needed liquidity to DeFi applications on other blockchains. It does this by creating a synthetic wrapped Bitcoin asset that transfers the full value of the Bitcoin on a 1:1 basis. Holders of anetaBTC are then able to access several applications through a wrapped Bitcoin application including yield-earning products, futures derivatives, and lending.</p>



<p>AnetaBTC is not the first project to introduce the concept of a wrapped Bitcoin. In 2019 the first wrapped Bitcoin product WrappedBTC was available on the Ethereum blockchain. It was developed by BitGo, Kyber Network, and Ren.</p>



<p>There are two main differences between the WrappedBTC and anetaBTC. The first is simply that they are developed for different blockchains. Wrapped BTC runs on the Ethereum blockchain, whereas anetaBTC was developed for the Ergo and Cardano blockchains. The second and more important difference between the two projects is that anetaBTC is entirely decentralized whereas WrappedBTC is centralized and runs through BitGo as a custodian. This means BitGo has full legal control over all of the locked Bitcoin wrapped in wBTC whereas anetaBTC allows users to keep full control of their BTC. AnetaBTC achieves this through fully-audited open-sourced smart contracts that allow Bitcoin holders to directly mint and redeem anetaBTC when they choose.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Above are the 5 best dApp projects on Cardano Blockchain. Although the network is still not quite as fast and powerful as the project theory is, the network is still going strong despite the bear market. In particular, Cardano completed the long-awaited Vasil hard fork in September 2022. This is considered an important milestone in its development and expansion.</p>

<p>Cardano has been in operation since 2015, and it was<strong> founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson</strong>. High scaling capabilities, robustness, functional compatibility, rapid transactions, minimal fees, and quick verifications are all provided by the platform. The Ouroboros (Proof-of-Stake variant) consensus method is crucial to the network. </p>



<p>Furthermore, <strong>Cardano has its own native currency, ADA</strong>, which has conventional functionalities like<strong> paying fees and rewarding stakeholders</strong>. It is also the network key management element; all ADA holders may present and vote on ideas for building and upgrading the Cardano network.</p>



<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">The Advantages of Developing NFT Solutions on Cardano</h1>



<p>Consensus process of the Ouroboros. The consensus method is one of Cardano&#8217;s primary advantages for launching NFT solutions. <strong>Ouroboros is a Proof-of-Stake variant developed by the Cardano team and notable scientists</strong>. They intended to create a blockchain that was quick, scalable, dependable, and extremely secure. Ouroboros is the first consensus method that has been academically demonstrated to be secure and reliable.</p>



<p><strong>In Ouroboros, the transactions are verified by a set of network members (slot leaders) drawn from a particular candidate pool</strong>. Any ADA token holder who blockstakes their tokens in the wallet can become a candidate. Because leader selection is random, the system stays decentralized, as opposed to traditional PoS, where the largest token holders benefit. If the leaders accomplish their duties, they are rewarded with ADA, otherwise, the system removes their ADA tokens.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Interoperability</strong>. This concept refers to the capacity of diverse blockchains to effortlessly collaborate, resulting in solutions that can function with numerous separate blockchains while moving information and value across them.</li>



<li><strong>Scaling</strong>. Cardano&#8217;s Ouroboros consensus mechanism and sidechains technologies enable it to execute up to a trillion transactions per second at full network deployment (i.e., when millions of people will use the network). Cardano&#8217;s bandwidth is still 250 transactions per second. It is, nevertheless, faster than Bitcoin (4-7 transactions per second) or Ethereum (in June 2022, 12-17 transactions per second).</li>
</ul>

<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">How to develop an NFT marketplace on Cardano?</h1>



<p>On the technological side, a blockchain-based NFT marketplace is an online store that allows users to quickly produce, purchase, and sell NFTs; the procedure is comparable to purchasing things on Amazon or eBay. The only important distinction is that all NFT minting and trading transactions are recorded in the blockchain. Here is a step-by-step guide for creating an NFT marketplace on Cardano.</p>



<h2 style="font-size:26px"><strong>Step 1: Identify your niche</strong></h2>



<p>Similarly to any other project, selecting the target niche is the first step in building a blockchain platform for trading non-fungible tokens. There are two types of NFT platforms based on these characteristics.</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>General NFT market</strong></h3>



<p>These are NFT trading systems that allow users to produce and sell various asset types. Users can, for example, go to OpenSea and sell assets in the following categories: digital art, collecting cards, sports, video games, domains, metaverses, texts, and so on. These markets have larger audiences due to a diverse selection of NFT items, but they cannot offer individualized designs or utilize highly efficient marketing tactics concentrating on a limited target group.</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Specialized NFT platform</strong></h3>



<p>These are NFT markets that only provide one asset type. For example, NBA Top Shot exclusively offers sports NFT, whereas Gala Games only sells video game-related products. However, niches might be much more specific; for example, Valuables sells celebrity tweets. </p>



<p>Without addressing design, developing customized NFT platforms is similar to developing generic platforms. Specialized projects enable the deployment of specialized user interface designs that are more efficient for a specific target group.</p>



<h2 style="font-size:26px"><strong>Step 2: Select a blockchain developer</strong></h2>



<p>The second stage is to identify a technical partner to assist you with project implementation. You should look for a development team that has substantial expertise in dealing with the Cardano blockchain and NFT markets.</p>



<h2 style="font-size:26px"><strong>Step 3: Pick a project monetization model</strong></h2>



<p>Following your agreement with the developer, you must extensively work on the project concept, defining business goals, functionality, technological requirements, and other critical points.</p>



<p>There are numerous monetization strategies from which to choose:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Fees</strong>. The most common monetization technique is collecting a charge for each trade that takes place on the site. The provider usually pays 1-5% since they benefit from selling the token. However, SuperRare and Foundation charge up to 15% in buyer fees, which is unpleasant and unfavourable.</li>



<li><strong>Fees for listing</strong>. This popular approach requires the vendor to pay a fee to post their NFT on your site. Furthermore, you will collect a fee regardless of whether the user sells the NFT. Typically, this technique is advantageous if a large number of vendors spam products. A listing fee will keep spammers at bay.</li>



<li><strong>Subscription</strong>. Although it is not a widely used monetization approach, it is used in other online areas. This strategy requires the customer to pay a monthly subscription to access your NFT platform. This monetization technique will benefit you if you can sell market-exclusive things that no one else can. Use it, for example, if you have NFTs of influencers, politicians, athletes, authors, or developers.</li>



<li><strong>Freemium</strong>. It is also a common monetization strategy for online marketplaces. Essentially, you will provide basic features for free while charging people for extra options. For example, you might provide ad-free, a distinctive item card, top listing positions, and so on.</li>



<li><strong>Advertisement</strong>. Advertisements are the final profit possibility. You can promote NFTs on your platform or advertise items or services from providers like cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets.</li>
</ul>



<h2 style="font-size:26px"><strong>Step 4: Decide marketplace functions</strong></h2>



<p>The fourth step in creating a Cardano NFT marketplace is identifying the functions for users and administrators. Here is a list of functions, along with descriptions, that each NFT platform must offer.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-904.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="514" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-904-1024x514.png" alt="Cardano Guide: 9 Basic Steps To Develop NFT Marketplace Effectively" class="wp-image-160771" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-904-1024x514.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-904-300x151.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-904-768x386.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-904-360x180.png 360w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-904-750x376.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-904-1140x572.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-904.png 1273w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Cardano Guide: 9 Basic Steps To Develop NFT Marketplace Effectively 21"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rarible showcase Sample</figcaption></figure></div>


<figure class="wp-block-table has-small-font-size"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Showcase</strong></td><td>The display for NFTs is the first thing your users see. As a result, extensively investigate the structure, content, colour scheme, and design. </td></tr><tr><td><strong>Integrations with wallets</strong></td><td>Metamask and TrustWallet are the most popular NFT wallets. Enjin, AlphaWallet, Coinbase, PillarWallet, Binance Chain Wallet, Argent, Kukai, and less popular options are available.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Creating/mining NFT assets</strong></td><td> You must also allow the creation of non-fungible tokens in the marketplace. You will need a smart contract and an interface to guide the user through the process of creating an NFT.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Listing items</strong></td><td>Token generation and token listing are two distinct procedures. To sell an NFT on the platform, the user must give it a name, provide a description, choose a sales method and payment system, and specify the price and duration.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Search engine, filters</strong></td><td>You must provide a search engine to assist users in finding goods using keywords, categories (art, music, texts, videos, collectables, domains), and filters (price, date, type).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ratings and feedback</strong></td><td>Users are now accustomed to comparing their reactions to those of others; hence, this functionality is required. You must enable people to provide comments and ratings. Furthermore, you must incorporate NFT ratings based on user feedback.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Auction system</strong></td><td>Users are also accustomed to attending auctions to purchase NFTs and other works of art. It will help NFTs sellers to maximize their profits while also making trading more interesting.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Notifications</strong></td><td>Users will get a variety of messages from your platform. Typically, you will alert users of the end-of-lot moderation, new selling and item messages in the chat, platform upgrades, and so forth.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>NFT Royalty</strong></td><td>This function allows writers to earn money from the resale of their NFTs. You must develop unique smart contracts in accordance with the requirements.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Support</strong></td><td>The last function is user technical and informational assistance. These are articles, tutorials, and online or mobile discussions.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<h2 style="font-size:26px"><strong>Step 5: Create a visually pleasing UI</strong></h2>



<p>Your user interface has a significant influence on the user experience. The user interface must be clean, appealing, and simple to use. Furthermore, the user interface design must be scalable and functional.</p>



<p>The following is the technological stack for the NFT marketplace&#8217;s frontend:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Programming languages for web</strong>:&nbsp;Angular.JS, React.JS, and Vue.JS.</li>



<li><strong>Programming languages for mobile</strong>:&nbsp;Java, Kotlin for Android, and Swift for iOS.</li>



<li><strong>Architecture</strong>:&nbsp;MVVM for Android and MVC, MVP, MVVM, and VIPER for iOS.</li>



<li><strong>IDE:</strong>&nbsp;Android Studio and Xcode for iOS.</li>



<li><strong>SDK</strong>:&nbsp;Android SDK and iOS SDK.</li>
</ul>



<h2 style="font-size:26px"><strong> Step 6: Develop smart contracts</strong></h2>



<p>Smart contracts that contain the minting and NFT trading conditions are the next stage in building an NFT marketplace on Cardano. Cardano supports smart contracts written in Plutus, Haskel, and Marlowe programming languages. Each language has its own features, allowing you to choose the best option for your needs.</p>



<h2 style="font-size:26px"><strong>Step 7: Develop the server</strong></h2>



<p>The technical stack for an NFT marketplace&#8217;s backend:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Frameworks</strong>:&nbsp;Spring, Symfony, Flask.</li>



<li><strong>Programming languages</strong>:&nbsp;Java, PHP, Python.</li>



<li><strong>Databases SQL</strong>:&nbsp;MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MS SQL, Oracle.</li>



<li><strong>Databases NoSQL</strong>:&nbsp;MongoDB, Kassandra, DynamoDB.</li>



<li><strong>Search engines</strong>:&nbsp;Apache Solr, Elasticsearch.</li>



<li><strong>DevOps</strong>:&nbsp;GitLab CI, TeamCity, GoCD Jenkins, WS CodeBuild, Terraform.</li>



<li><strong>Cache</strong>:&nbsp;Redis, Memcached.</li>
</ul>



<h2 style="font-size:26px"><strong>Step 8: Testing</strong></h2>



<p>This is another critical step of NFT marketplace development that entails thoroughly testing the code for bugs as well as functionality, usability, performance, and stability, among other things.</p>



<h2 style="font-size:26px"><strong>Step 9: Launch the NFT marketplace</strong></h2>



<p>The final phase in developing your marketplace will be to move it into production, set up a support service, and begin a marketing campaign.</p>



<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">Conclusion</h1>



<p>Through these developing steps above, we hope NFT-conscious people will have a clear observation of the development of the NFT marketplace, especially, the Cardano NFT marketplace.</p>



<p>Cardano is working on a smart contract platform that will provide more sophisticated functionality than any prior protocol and will serve as a robust and secure platform for the creation of enterprise-level dApps. <strong>Cardano will adopt a democratic governance structure in the near future</strong>, allowing the project to expand over time and support itself in a sustainable manner through a visionary treasury system.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Alameda Research lost over $1 million in assets during its liquidation.</em></li>



<li><em>The account was forcibly reduced, according to an Arkham report dated January 14.</em></li>



<li><em>The news came after $72,000 in Alameda funds were liquidated on Aave on January 12 after being combined into one wallet.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>According to a tip that crypto intelligence company Arkham <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/202417/alameda-lost-1-million-liquidations-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided</a> with <em>The Block</em>, Alameda Research lost over $1 million in assets as a result of liquidation last night.</strong></h5>

<p><strong>9,000 ETH </strong>worth <strong>$10.8 million</strong> were held in the original account as collateral, along with<strong> $4 million in DAI</strong> and <strong>20 million USDC</strong>. The account now has a net balance of <strong>$15.2 million</strong>.</p>



<p>However, a report from <strong>Arkham</strong> dated <strong>January 14</strong> indicates that the account was <strong>forced to be closed</strong> and that<strong> $1.2 USDC </strong>was liquidated in return for <strong>731 ETH</strong>. The account now has a net balance of <strong>$30,000</strong> and a short sell of<strong> $1.1 million in ETH</strong> versus <strong>$1.14 million in USDC</strong>. Arkham said in the report:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Surprisingly, transactions out of the wallet were made before and during liquidation, indicating that whoever was in control of the wallet either was unable to understand how to close out the positions, or was simply unwilling to.&#8221; </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Before that, <strong>$72,000 </strong>in <strong>Alameda</strong> funds were <a href="https://news.coincu.com/160353-recovery-process-is-alameda-liquidators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liquidated</a> on <strong>Aave</strong> on January 12 after being combined into one wallet. Some Twitter users claimed that. <strong>Sam Bankman-Fried was engaged in the incident </strong>where Alameda funds were seen switching wallets.</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s transfer to Alameda is unlikely to occur, though, as he was not able to use the online platforms until <strong>December 30, 2022</strong>, following his arrest in the <strong>Bahamas</strong> on <strong>December 12, 2022.</strong></p>

A group of<strong> 50 permissionless validators</strong> must carefully coordinate and conduct thorough testing to accomplish that. Anyone with enough <strong>MARS</strong> or delegated <strong>MARS</strong> to join the validator set will be able to validate after genesis.</p>



<p>Inquiring validators can use the <strong>Ares</strong> <strong>testnet</strong> as a <strong>sandbox</strong> to get acquainted with the network and start setting up their gear for the imminent mainnet launch.</p>



<p><strong>Mars</strong> is a novel interchain credit protocol primitive facilitating non-custodial borrowing and lending for the Cosmos ecosystem and beyond. Its hub and spoke architecture allows Mars to operate on any chain in the <strong>Cosmoverse</strong> and enables a new primitive: the <strong>Rover</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Rovers</strong> will give their pilots DeFi superpowers to engage in virtually every activity they might encounter on a centralized exchange: spot trading, margin trading, lending, and borrowing — all in a single decentralized credit account represented by a transferable <strong>NFT</strong>.</p>

<p>There are <strong>234,000 </strong>British residents with BSV. The lawsuit alleges that the four exchanges delisted <strong>Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) </strong>in <strong>2019</strong> and caused investor losses, claiming <strong>9.9 billion pounds</strong> (about <strong>$12.11 billion</strong>).</p>



<p>The case sets some of the most influential figures in cryptocurrency against the illustrious group of UK parliamentarians. It charges that the removal of the digital token from their marketplaces three years earlier resulted in investor losses on exchanges, including the biggest in the world, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/159799-sweden-now-becomes-the-7th-eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a>.</p>



<p>The court is expected to issue a ruling in the next few months on whether the case can continue, according to a memo issued by law firm <strong>Crowell &amp; Moring LLP</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>BSV Claims Limited </strong>was established in <strong>May 2022</strong> to launch a class action against exchanges for delisting <strong>BSV</strong>. The company&#8217;s directors include former justice and justice minister <strong>Robert Buckland</strong> and the first chairman of the UK Competition Market Authority, <strong>David Currie</strong>.</p>

<p>Class-action lawsuits could now serve the same purpose for investors looking to prevent significant losses, just as the boom days of digital currency brought together unlikely casts of characters looking to get rich quickly. This is demonstrated by the alliance of established figures with colorful crypto entrepreneurs.</p>



<p>It has also led others to question the judgment of politicians who are willing to work for a mysterious offshore organization that is funded by a person who has run-ins with the law in the US and Canada.</p>

<p>Due to S&amp;C&#8217;s prior associations with the defunct cryptocurrency exchange, potential conflicts of interest were raised in the <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTQzODMzMw==&amp;id2=-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filing</a> by U.S. Trustee <strong>Andrew</strong> <strong>Vara</strong>, dated <strong>January 13</strong>.</p>



<p>The filing expresses fear that the company would trample on future work by an independent examiner and is similar to those made by a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators and Sam Bankman-Fried, the creator of the cryptocurrency exchange.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“S&amp;C’s disclosures as filed are wholly insufficient to evaluate whether S&amp;C satisfies the Bankruptcy Code’s conflict-free and disinterestedness standards. The incomplete disclosures are a sufficient and independent reason to deny the application.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Vara</strong> pointed out that FTX&#8217;s General Counsel<strong> Ryne Miller </strong>spent eight years as an employee of S&amp;C, and the law firm might find itself in the conflicted position of looking into both itself and its former employee.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>It also pointed out that the S&amp;C application to represent FTX <strong>makes no mention of the kinds of services S&amp;C had previously rendered to the exchange</strong>, particularly when it was on the verge of collapse.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The S&amp;C Application is virtually silent as to both its connections to the Debtors and the work it did for the Debtors. For example, the S&amp;C Application omits the fact that the General Counsel of certain of the Debtors, Mr. Ryne Miller, was a partner at S&amp;C until about 14 months before the filing,&#8221; said Vara.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As a U.S. Trustee, <strong>Vara</strong> works for the <strong>Department of Justice</strong>, which oversees bankruptcy cases in the country. <strong>Vara</strong> is responsible for making sure that bankrupt corporations are not acting in a way that might harm creditors or other parties involved in the case.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Any investigation led by S&amp;C would be duplicative and wasteful of estate resources if the Court were to grant the U.S. Trustee’s pending motion to appoint an examiner with a comprehensive investigative mandate,” Vara added.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Previously, Vara had expressed opposition to the planned sales of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/152410-ftx-sell-4-subsidiaries-including-ledgerx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LedgerX</a>,<strong> FTX Europe</strong>, and<strong> FTX Japan</strong>, three of its subsidiaries.</p>

<p>However,<strong> John</strong> <strong>Ray</strong>, who became the new CEO of FTX on November 11, stated in a deposition on <strong>December 21</strong>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“S&amp;C is one of the leading law firms in the world in all of the key practice areas.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Bankman-Fried</strong> <a href="https://news.coincu.com/160231-bankman-fried-insisted-didnt-steal-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> in a blog post on Thursday that S&amp;C&#8217;s relationships with FTX before the company&#8217;s demise had been more than merely transactional and that its employees had coerced him into declaring bankruptcy on November 11.</p>



<p>At a hearing on <strong>January 11</strong>, Judge <strong>John</strong> <strong>Dorsey</strong> <a href="https://news.coincu.com/159420-4-us-senators-doubt-sullivan-cromwells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruled</a> that the letter requesting the appointment of an impartial examiner into the matter constituted an improper intrusion.</p>

<p>One of the predictions said that Ethereum would grow strongly in the next year. Specifically, ETH will be deflationary in 2023. The total circulating supply will decrease by at least 1%. On the other hand, after the Shanghai Upgrade, it will be possible to withdraw the staked ETH, from which it is possible to increase the amount of ETH staked by at least 50%.</p>

<p>Last September, the Ethereum blockchain switched its consensus mechanism from proof of work to proof of stake. As of January 5, 2023, <strong>$21 billion in ETH has been staked on the network, or about 14% of the total supply.</strong></p>



<p>Currently, that <strong>ETH cannot be &#8220;deposited&#8221;</strong>. The transition to proof-of-stake is complex, and one way the Ethereum network controls risk is by not allowing users to withdraw their staked ETH.</p>



<p>However, around 2023, the Ethereum blockchain will go through a phase known as the <strong>&#8220;Shanghai Upgrade&#8221; that will allow the withdrawal of staked ETH</strong>. This will give investors who can&#8217;t stand an indefinite lockout an incentive to participate.</p>



<p>Therefore, in 2023, expect the total amount of <strong>ETH staked to increase by at least 50%</strong> by the end of the year.</p>

<p>Ethereum&#8217;s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in September of last year significantly reduced the new ETH the blockchain released simply because proof-of-stake is more efficient than proof-of-work.</p>



<p>When you combine this lower issuance with the fact that <strong>ETH is burned</strong> as people access the network, you create a situation where the <strong>net supply of ETH could decrease.</strong></p>



<p>Before the move to proof of stake, <strong>the circulating supply of ETH was growing at an annual rate of about 2.5%</strong>. But since making the switch, net issuance has remained virtually unchanged, <strong>with collection only increasing at a rate of 0.011% per year.</strong></p>



<p>So Bitwise predicts that there will be significantly more demand for accessing and using Ethereum applications in 2023 than in 2022, increasing the amount of ETH burned through transactions. As a result, <strong>the total amount of ETH in circulation will decrease by 1%</strong>, causing a significant impact on investors.</p>



<p>The Merge is a breakthrough in the development journey of the Ethereum ecosystem. The improvements in Sharding technology will also help the Ethereum chain to require fewer resources, be faster, and be easy to scale but still possible to share while keeping the security. It is also the premise for the solid future development of Ethereum.</p>
