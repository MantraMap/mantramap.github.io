<li dir="ltr">SEC emails suggest XRP doesn&rsquo;t satisfy all Howey factors, John Deaton notes.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The lawyer says SEC staff noted &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; to believe that XRP is not a security.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The SEC sued Ripple Labs and two of its executives for selling alleged unregistered securities in the form of XRP.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">In latest <a href="http://US%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission%20(SEC)">Ripple news</a>, a lawyer says the ongoing court battle between <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ripple/">Ripple</a> and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could be game over for the regulator should the case go to a jury.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The attorney made the comments after stumbling on references of SEC emails in the briefs and arguments Ripple presented before court in this long standing battle.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">XRP not a security? SEC emails on XRP and Howey test</h2>
<p dir="ltr">John Deaton, a pro-XRP lawyer that has followed the SEC vs. Ripple case since its filing in 2020, <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1660064039236411394" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a> new email details suggest staff at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seem to have indicated there are &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; to believe XRP is not a security.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The emails are highlighted as part of the footnote in Ripple&rsquo;s arguments against the SEC allegations. One of these is &ldquo;exhibit 220.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">SEC staff states that there are reasonable grounds to believe XRP is NOT a security </p>
<p>THAT&rsquo;S BY SEC ENFORCEMENT LAWYERS PEOPLE! </p>
<p>But the SEC charges <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@bgarlinghouse</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/chrislarsensf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@chrislarsensf</a> with Recklessness because it&rsquo;s so obvious that XRP is a security?</p>
<p>Absolutely shameful. <a href="https://t.co/5YMPYfLS1o">https://t.co/5YMPYfLS1o</a></p>
<p>&mdash; John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1660064039236411394?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">Deaton said:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Exhibit 220 is part SEC emails: XRP is mentioned and that there are reasonable grounds XRP doesn&rsquo;t satisfy ALL Howey factors. HUGE</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">There&rsquo;s also a citation of &ldquo;SEC-LIT-EMAILS&rdquo; which the lawyer points out relates to the Hinman emails.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Since noticing this, I&rsquo;ve been racking my brain about two things: 1) why wouldn&rsquo;t Ripple lawyers make a much bigger deal about this (and not just include it in a footnote); and 2) how tf did I miss it before today (although to be fair I&rsquo;ve read thousands of pages and do have a job)?</em>&rdquo; he tweeted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As to why Ripple didn&rsquo;t go hard on the SEC in light of these suggestions, he says it&rsquo;s likely the fact that the information is not a direct quote from an SEC official. He argues that the emails might have been reference to an analysis of XRP and not an absolute statement of XRP not being a security.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">SEC emails are &ldquo;huge&rdquo;, it could be game over if it goes to jury</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Anticipation of a favourable ruling for Ripple continues to build across the crypto community.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As CoinJournal covered <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/xrp-price-surging-after-judge-ruling-on-ripple-vs-sec-case/">here</a>, this was evident when a recent ruling saw the XRP price react higher. And Deaton says the emails could be a game-changer in favour of the company if this goes to a jury. Some experts have opined that the SEC could choose to settle.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">On June 13, 2018, SEC Enforcement lawyers wrote an XRP &#128221; analyzing whether XRP satisfied Howey. Yet, the SEC did NOT recommend enforcement or a cease and deist letter to stop selling XRP. When you add that XRP &#128221; w/this statement about XRP, it could be game over for a jury.</p>
<p>&mdash; John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1660068285600215041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">The lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC began in December 2020, when the SEC filed a complaint alleging that Ripple had violated federal securities laws by selling XRP as an unregistered security.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ripple has denied the allegations and has accused the SEC of overreach.</p>

<li dir="ltr">TORN price fell more than 40%, dropping from highs of $7.29 to lows of $3.55.</li>
<li dir="ltr">This is after the Tornado Cash DAO had passed a malicious proposal that included a bug from an attacker.</li>
<li dir="ltr">With complete control over the Tornado Cash governance system, the attacker proceeded to drain locked votes.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The price of TORN fell sharply as the market reacted to cryptocurrency news about a malicious takeover of the Tornado Cash governance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the initial market reaction, TORN price plummeted by nearly 50%, with sellers pushing the token&rsquo;s value from highs of $7.29 to lows of $3.55. While further losses could still materialize, the token&rsquo;s value has rebounded to above $4.40 as buyers attempt to keep the bears at bay.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the time of writing, Tornado Cash is ranked 1,103 by market cap on CoinGecko. It has a market cap of $6.8 million, but has seen a total of $25.7 million worth TORN traded in the past 24 hours.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Attacker maliciously takes over Tornado Cash DAO</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The price of Tornado Cash fell after an attacker took over the governance of the Tornado Cash DAO. The compromise happened after the community passed a malicious proposal, which the attacker used to drain funds from the governance treasury.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tornado Cash is a crypto mixing service that runs on Ethereum. It was sanctioned by the US Treasury in February 2023. The governance system controls upgrades to the protocol and is run by those holding the project&rsquo;s native TORN tokens.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On May 20, 2023, an attacker purportedly added an extra function to an upgrade passed by TORN holders. This gave the unknown entity an extra 1.2 million votes and effective control of the cryptocurrency&rsquo;s governance system.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">On 2023/05/20 at 07:25:11 UTC, Tornado Cash governance effectively ceased to exist. Through a malicious proposal, an attacker granted themselves 1,200,000 votes. As this is more than the ~700,000 legitimate votes, they now have full control.<a href="https://t.co/nY87XmrYgT">https://t.co/nY87XmrYgT</a> <a href="https://t.co/h9qjc3xRqz">pic.twitter.com/h9qjc3xRqz</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">As highlighted by a pseudonymous crypto intelligence account Samczsun, control allowed the attacker(s) to withdraw 10,000 votes in TORN tokens. They sold these for $25,600 before draining the remaining amount of locked votes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In total, 483,000 TORN was taken from the vault. 6,000 TORN was deposited on crypto exchange Bitrue, 379,000 was sold on-chain for $680,000 of ether, and just under 100,000 TORN remains under the attacker&rsquo;s control.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the aftermath of the compromise, Binance announced it would be halting TORN deposits until further notice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Due to circumstances surrounding the protocol, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Binance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Binance</a> will temporarily pause <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TORN&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$TORN</a> deposits until further notice.</p>
<p>&mdash; Binance (@binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1660127515459895296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">Tron founder Justin Sun <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1660139594216779782" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> TORN deposits and withdrawals on Huobi would remain open. Meanwhile, the Tornado Cash team says its working on a fix for the vulnerability.&nbsp;</p>

<li dir="ltr">The next week will be critical for BTC, crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe says.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Bitcoin price could see a new uptrend if BTC can break out after a successful retest of the 200-day moving average.</li>
<li dir="ltr">However, if BTC fails to break above this level, it could fall to past recent lows, with the key target at $25k or lower.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/"><u>Bitcoin&rsquo;s price</u></a> has struggled to reclaim support above $28,000 and is currently facing fresh downside pressure just above the $27k level.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the price is looking for a successful retest and bounce from a key technical level, bulls could be left battling a deeper correction if prices break lower from this level, which one analyst has&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1659991038298144769" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>highlighted</u></a> as a likely make or break scenario for BTC this coming week.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin price: analyst says next week could be crucial</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Market events next week could have an impact on Bitcoin price, with crucial economic data and events to watch out for including US GDP revisions, minutes of the last FOMC meeting and the core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator &ndash; the Fed&rsquo;s preferred measure of inflation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A decision or vote on the debt-ceiling talks is also expected to highlight critical market-moving events this coming week. According to Michael van de Poppe, the Bitcoin price outlook for next week is likely to trend alongside a broader market reaction to the busy week.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He says BTC&rsquo;s retest of the 200-day moving average has historically signaled an opportunity to accumulate. If BTC can break above this level, it could signal the end of the current correction and the start of a new bull market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The analyst sees the next few days as important for bulls, suggesting that it could be a &ldquo;make-or-break&rdquo; situation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>If you go back in history, the 200-MA retest is a great period to accumulate. In the past 6 months, #Bitcoin has been swimming beneath for a long period, making it the most undervalued since existence. Next week is make-or-break. Fast breakout upwards -&gt; end of correction</em>,&rdquo; van de Poppe tweeted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">The 200-day moving average is a long-term moving average that traders often look to for support or resistance levels. A BTC breakout from the 200-day moving average has often seen bulls take control.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If BTC can break above the 200-day moving average, it could reach $35,000 by the end of the week. However, if bulls fail to fend off the marauding bears, it&rsquo;s possible for a revisit of the $25k region.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Acredius will also deploy smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain, allowing for the tokenization of loans.</li>
<li dir="ltr">ADA price has struggled to break above $0.37 since the rejection at around $0.46 in mid-April.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Acredius, a Swiss lender that provides financing to small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs), has&nbsp;<a href="https://acredius.ch/acredius-collaborates-with-cardano-to-revolutionise-marketplace-lending-with-blockchain-technology/"><u>launched</u></a> on the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/cardano/"><u>Cardano</u></a> blockchain.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The integration will allow Acredius&rsquo; investors to use ADA, the native token of the Cardano blockchain, to invest in SMEs and will also provide greater investment flexibility and transparency, the fintech platform said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition, Acredius will deploy&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/smart-contracts/"><u>smart contracts</u></a> on Cardano. This will allow for the tokenization of loans, which will make it easier for retail investors to participate in the lending market.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Cardano to help Acredius revolutionise the lending marketplace</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Acredius is a Swiss fintech platform that helps investors and borrowers shape the future of the economy by supporting small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). The company provides a marketplace where investors can lend money to SMEs, and borrowers can access capital to grow their businesses.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The collaboration with Cardano could spark further adoption of the ADA token, providing new impetus for its value to rise in the future. Elsewhere, it enhances Cardano&rsquo;s growing ecosystem and outlines the positive impact of blockchain technology in the world.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">ADA price outlook</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/cardano/"><u>price of Cardano</u></a> has been trading below $0.4 since the retreat from the highs of $0.46 in mid-April. ADA bulls have found it difficult to break above $0.37, and the bearish outlook is likely to be helped by a broader lull in the crypto market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If ADA breaks below the support level of $0.35, it could fall to the next support level of $0.31. However, should bulls reclaim the $0.40 in coming weeks, a retest of the resistance level at $0.43 could rally to the next resistance level currently at $0.48.</p>

<li>Michael Saylor reiterates his bullish view on Bitcoin.</li>
<li>MicroStrategy Inc currently has about 140,000 BTC.</li>
<li>Bitcoin has lost nearly 10% from its high in April.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> has lost nearly 10% in recent weeks but the pullback is only an opportunity to build a position as far as Michael Saylor &ndash; Chairman of MicroStrategy Inc is concerned.</p>
<h2>Saylor is sceptic on other cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>Interestingly, his bullish view is particular to bitcoin only while he remains &ldquo;sceptic&rdquo; on other cryptocurrencies in the midst of regulatory uncertainty. Speaking with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/05/19/microstrategy-michael-saylor-crypto-growing-pains.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNBC</a> today, Saylor said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think bitcoin has found the bottom, the leverage is out of it, we are on a bull run. BTC is the one commodity the SEC won&rsquo;t regulate. I think the way is clear for bitcoin to rally from here.</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier this month, the U.S. Federal Reserve signalled a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-03/fed-raises-rates-by-a-quarter-point-and-hints-at-possible-pause" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pause</a>&rdquo; which could be a tailwind for BTC moving forward as easing monetary policy is known to see investors make riskier bets.</p>
<p>MicroStrategy Inc currently has about 140,000 bitcoin bought for a total cost of roughly $4.17 billion.</p>
<h2>Why else is he keeping bullish on bitcoin?</h2>
<p>Saylor is convinced that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/04/us-banks-failing-pacwest-western-alliance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent bank failures</a> and the regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies will work in favour of the bitcoin considering its reputation as the safe haven.</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin is the most secure network, the most secure asset. You&rsquo;ll see a consistent flow of capital flowing from the rest of the crypto ecosystem to bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other reasons cited for the bullish view on BTC include the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lightning-network.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lightning Network</a>&rdquo; &ndash; a protocol layered over bitcoin that he&rsquo;s convinced has the potential to be a disruptive payment network.</p>
<p>Also on Friday, Anthony Pompliano also <a href="https://cryptonews.net/news/bitcoin/21011727/">said</a> that bitcoin was like the world&rsquo;s biggest insurance company.</p>

<li dir="ltr">The new platform is designed to give users more control over their data and identity</li>
<li dir="ltr">Web5 is also targeted at making it easier for developers to build decentralised applications.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The platform is powered by the Bitcoin blockchain.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">TBD, a fintech startup of former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey&rsquo;s company Block, has <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/projects/web5/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a> the launch of a new decentralised web platform called Web5.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Web5: Giving users more control over their data</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The announcement that TBD made on 19 May at the Bitcoin 2023 in Miami revealed that the new platform&rsquo;s focus will be on giving users a way to enjoy more control over personal data and identity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Web5 is built on top of the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> blockchain, and it uses decentralised identifiers (DIDs) to create a secure and private way for users to sign in to applications. DIDs are unique identifiers that are not tied to any centralised entity, so users can be sure that their data is not being tracked or sold.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The platform includes a decentralised web node (DWN), which is a personal data store that users can use to store their own data. This data can include things like contact information, social media profiles, and financial records.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">DWNs are encrypted and stored on the blockchain, so users can be sure that their data is secure and private.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Web5 will also look to offer access to the tools and support developers need to build decentralised applications.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">TBD primarily focused on Bitcoin</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Dorsey is one of the most popular self-taught programmers and a big believer in Bitcoin. He also believes in the power of decentralised technology, which is the path TBD is taking as it looks to create a more decentralised and user-centric web.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While most of the industry is looking to tap into Web3, Dorsey&rsquo;s Web5 is seeing the potential the new Web5 technology offers in terms of handing control of data and identity to users. Key actors in this quest include wallets, Decentralised Web Nodes (DWNS), and Decentralised Web Apps (DWAS).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dorsey teased the development of TBD in June 2021, which CoinJournal covered <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/jack-dorsey-unveils-plans-for-a-bitcoin-developer-platform/">here</a>.</p>

<li>The Miami International Securities Exchange (MIAX) is owned by Miami International Holdings (MIH).</li>
<li>The acquisition deal was announced in April and approved by the bankruptcy judge on May 4.</li>
<li>LedgerX is one of the FTX assets the bankruptcy court approved for sale in January.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Miami International Securities Exchange (MIAX) has today completed acquiring LedgerX, which is one of the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/is-ftx-insolvent-why-is-binance-selling-ftt-deep-dive/">FTX&nbsp;</a>assets the court had approved for sale.</p>
<p>LedgerX operated as an exchange and clearinghouse and was regulated by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>
<h2>MIAX expansion into the swaps and futures industry</h2>
<p>According to the CEO of MIAX, Thomas Gallagher, the acquisition of LedgerX is &ldquo;an important part of our growth strategy, expanding our ability to offer new and innovative products to the swaps and futures industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an April tweet, the CEO of OPNX, a cryptocurrency exchange co-founded by Three Arrows Capital (3AC) founders claimed that MIAX was also an investor in the firm.</p>
<p>The acquisition process started in April when the involved parties entered into a $50 million purchase agreement. The agreement was, however, approved on May 4 by Judge John Dorsey of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware and it has taken almost 15 more days to complete the purchase.</p>
<h2>FTX assets approved for sale</h2>
<p>LedgerX was among the four <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ftx-has-the-green-light-to-sell-its-other-businesses-including-ledgerx/">FTX subsidiaries that were approved for sale</a> in January by the Delaware court. The other three are FTX Japan, FTX Europe, and the stock-trading platform Embed.</p>
<p>On May 17, FTX filed a lawsuit against the former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, former engineering director Nishad Singh, and co-founder Gary Wang for failing to apply due diligence when acquiring Embed. FTX paid $200 million when acquiring the stock trading platform.</p>
<p>It was reported that 117 prospective buyers expressed interest in the four assets out of which 56 wanted to acquire LedgerX.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">The DeFi ecosystem has suffered huge losses over the past two years due to the ongoing bear market.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Giddy&rsquo;s DeFi smart wallet seeks to solve the problems of interoperability and ease of use within the DeFi ecosystem.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Eric Parker, the CEO of Giddy, believes that the DeFi ecosystem will ultimately become Finance 2.0</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Binance Smart Chain (BNB) and Ethereum were some of the leading blockchains for DeFi projects. Despite the major growth recorded by the DeFi ecosystem in recent years, one of the major issues that remain is interoperability. Not many projects are working on solving interoperability within the DeFi ecosystem, a solution that would make it easier to move tokens between various blockchains.</p>
<p>Giddy, a provider of a self-custody smart wallet, is making a mark in this area. The company&rsquo;s DreFi smart wallet integrates with some of the best projects in DeFi and is set to increase interoperability and ease of use even more.</p>
<p>Coinjournal sat down with Eric Parker, the CEO of Giddy, to discuss the company&rsquo;s plans after recently raising $6.9 million in a funding round.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Coinjournal (CJ)</strong>: Giddy recently raised $6.9 million and will use the funds to boost DeFi adoption. How does Giddy intend to improve on some of the existing DeFi solutions or expand its services?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Eric Parker (EP:&nbsp;</strong><em>We&rsquo;ve developed a ton of new tech already- from our self-custody no-seed-phrase private key solution to our Autogas and our one-tap staking, all of this works together to make DeFi feel seamless for brand new and experienced crypto users alike. Giddy currently integrates with some of the best projects in DeFi, and we&rsquo;ll be using this funding to increase interoperability and ease-of-use even more. Next up we&rsquo;re going to add more chains, integrate new DeFi protocols, add more utility to our token, add new fiat off-ramps, and bolster our private key platform for more ease and security. We&rsquo;ve shown we can build the concept and scale it. Now it&rsquo;s all about extending our DeFi smart wallet across all aspects of DeFi.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>CJ</strong>: Could you talk more about the involvement of your strategic investors in this funding round, and how their expertise will contribute to Giddy&rsquo;s growth and development?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>EP:&nbsp;</strong><em>We have some really incredible advisors and strategic investors, who come from backgrounds and have experience at some of the biggest consumer experience brands like Disney, Fortnite, Traegar Grills, and more. What we love is that they have &ldquo;been there, done that&rdquo; when it comes to creating incredible consumer experiences &ndash; something we think that&rsquo;s been lacking in the crypto space, and is a prerequisite to true mass adoption. So much of crypto has been focused on infrastructure technology, and while that&rsquo;s certainly needed, we think there&rsquo;s a huge opportunity to solve the &ldquo;last mile&rdquo; problem by putting tech in actual user&rsquo;s hands and focusing on the end user experience to an extreme degree. We&rsquo;re beyond lucky and very grateful to have these advisors helping us make something really special happen here.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>CJ</strong>: Can you discuss how Giddy&rsquo;s Autogas feature works and how it addresses the issue of gas fees in DeFi transactions?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>EP: </strong><em>Pretty much anyone who has interacted with the blockchain knows the pain of running out of gas, or having to hold some arbitrary amount of tokens just to pay network fees. Giddy&rsquo;s Autogas feature is a first for crypto users and is a game changer when you experience it. As long as you hold USDC, GIDDY token, or MATIC in your wallet, you can swap, stake, or send any token on the Polygon chain with no additional cost or hassle. More token types and chains are coming soon, which means with the Giddy smart wallet, you&rsquo;ll never have to worry about running out of gas again, no matter what chain you&rsquo;re on.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>CJ</strong>: How does Giddy ensure the security of its users&rsquo; private keys, especially with the increasing prevalence of hacking and cyber attacks in the crypto industry?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>EP:&nbsp;</strong><em>Great question. So first off, it&rsquo;s important to mention that under the hood, Giddy is a self-custody wallet, which means it&rsquo;s always your keys, your crypto. You can export your private key, and verify all transactions as they happen on the blockchain. But what we&rsquo;ve done is eliminate the need to write down your seed phrase and have to store it somewhere, which, as you know, is a dangerous single point of failure for many users.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>When you download our app and go through the one-minute setup process, Giddy is actually splitting your private key into multiple secure shares that are owned and controlled by you, using several factors that you&rsquo;re familiar with, such as your email login, your phone, an Authenticator app, etc. This allows you to recover your wallet as long as you control at least two of your shares &ndash; meaning if you ever lose your device or forget a password, your money can still be recovered as long as you have the other shares. And crucially, if one of your shares is ever compromised, your funds are still safe because it always takes at least two factors to get your wallet back. This makes your wallet as convenient as a hot wallet, while being just as secure (if not more so) than a cold wallet. With Giddy, you can say goodbye to lost seed phrases.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>CJ</strong>: What is the Giddy MPC technology, and how exactly does it work?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>EP:&nbsp;</strong><em>We dove into how it works in the last question, but this is a good time to talk a bit about Multi-Party Computation (MPC). Most MPC implementations utilize other individuals, such as a family member or friend, to be a guardian of a share of your private key. That&rsquo;s where Giddy stands out &ndash; our implementation gives users complete control over their wallet recovery, all while using security factors that you own. So rather than having to go to Uncle Bob to unlock your MPC wallet, with Giddy, you always have complete control. How it works feels incredibly natural, just like using any other Web 2.0 mobile app &ndash; except you&rsquo;re getting the full benefits and tech behind a real self-custody Web 3.0 wallet.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>CJ</strong>: Giddy&rsquo;s unique solution implements elements of the Ethereum Foundation&rsquo;s guidelines in the new ERC-4337 standard. What does Giddy intend to achieve with this solution?&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>EP:&nbsp;</strong><em>The Ethereum Foundation released the new ERC-4337 standard to help improve end users&rsquo; experience on the Ethereum network, but this didn&rsquo;t just happen overnight. Vitalik and other key Ethereum developers have been talking about the core principles behind ERC-4337, e.g. account abstraction, for years. The other thing to know about ERC-4337 is that it&rsquo;s a set of guidelines to help developers, but developers still have to actually build the technology themselves. The Giddy smart wallet has been in development for almost 18 months, and we started with the end user in mind. So it&rsquo;s no wonder that we&rsquo;ve actually arrived at many of the same conclusions set out and defined in ERC-4337. We set out to solve the same challenges outlined in ERC-4337 before it was fully baked, and we&rsquo;re already ahead of the game by implementing some of the core features spelled out in the proposal, such as AutoGas and one-tap staking.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>CJ</strong>: Giddy has been chosen for the Robinhood Connect Program. What role will Giddy play in the program, and how will Robinhood Connect boost crypto adoption?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>EP:&nbsp;</strong><em>We had a chance to meet with the Robinhood Connect team at ETH Denver, and quickly hit it off. As you can probably tell from this interview, we&rsquo;re obsessed with user experience, and so are they, which is why Robinhood Connect fits perfectly into our platform. We&rsquo;re happy to be one of the first wallets to integrate Robinhood Connect as a launch participant, and see it as a great channel for onboarding users into crypto going forward through its ease of use.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>CJ</strong>: What do you think about the current DeFi ecosystem, and where do you see the sector in the next decade?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>EP: </strong><em>Yeah, there has certainly been a lot of discussion about the state of DeFi, particularly coming out of the &lsquo;DeFi Summer&rsquo; of 2021 and into the down cycle of 2023. I&rsquo;m seeing major investments into the foundational infrastructure of what will ultimately become Finance 2.0. While most of the million-percent APY inflationary IDOs (I like to call them Ponzi speedruns) have gone away, we&rsquo;re now seeing fundamentally sound business models operating on-chain, generating real yield and rewriting legacy financial protocols into modern Web 3.0 equivalents. I think over the next decade, we&rsquo;ll see quite a bit of market consolidation &ndash; right now most of the tech is fractured, and interoperability isn&rsquo;t quite where it needs to be yet. The best user experiences will rise to the top because that&rsquo;s what will drive adoption as people look for how to get on board with the finance 2.0 movement. Also, smart regulation will allow the entire ecosystem to build trust within the nations that embrace it, whereas those that don&rsquo;t will be left behind.</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has stalled its movement over the past few days as investors consider their positions.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Investors are keenly observing the ongoing debt talks, with the United States&rsquo; debt now above $31 trillion.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">With prices now down, this could be an excellent opportunity for investors to purchase cryptocurrencies like Metacade.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has been in a consolidating stage this week, with prices of most cryptocurrencies currently in the red zone.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Investors have been keenly observing the ongoing debt ceiling talks in the United States, with many of them conservative in their approach. This has led to a poor performance from the crypto market this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As the prices of most cryptocurrencies declined this week, could this be a perfect opportunity to purchase more coins and tokens like&nbsp;<a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=investment_opportunity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a>?&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The debt ceiling and how it could affect the cryptocurrency market</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently stated that the United States could surpass its debt ceiling by June 1st. If that happens, market experts believe that the US could default on its debt.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the official data obtained from the US Treasury Fiscal Data website, the US&rsquo;s current&nbsp;<a href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-debt/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20national%20debt,accumulated%20over%20the%20nation's%20history." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>debt stands at $31.46 trillion</u></a>. The debt limit is the highest amount the United States government can borrow to service the economy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Due to the ongoing talks, the cryptocurrency market has underperformed this week. Bitcoin, the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, continues to trade below $27k. At press time, the price of Bitcoin stands at $26,884, down by 1% so far today.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The total cryptocurrency market cap also stands at $1.13 trillion, down by 1% over the last 24 hours.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What are experts saying about the debt ceiling?&nbsp;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Some market experts believe that the US will not default on its loan but will likely print more dollars. This will effectively weaken the dollar and strengthen assets such as cryptocurrencies and commodities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jesse Meyers, the chief operating officer of investment firm Onramp,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Croesus_BTC/status/1650934343316152320" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>believes</u></a> that the US government will print more money, resulting in a 2020-like rally by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He stated that;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;When the debt ceiling is lifted, and credit-contraction leads to an economic crisis. They will have to print money on a massive scale. Bitcoin was the winner during the last round of stimulus.&ldquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Market analysts are predicting that Bitcoin and other major assets could experience a boost if the US government prints more dollars to service its debts, as there would be liquidity available for investors to purchase BTC and other cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How does this affect projects like Metacade?&nbsp;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin&rsquo;s rally is usually duplicated by other cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;<a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=investment_opportunity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> could be one of the projects that could be a big winner if the market experiences another bull cycle soon.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At press time, the price of Metacade stands at $0.02002, down by 10% over the last 24 hours. The token is down by 56% from its all-time high price of $0.04569. This could represent an excellent buying opportunity for investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">What makes MCADE one of the tokens investors could consider is the potential of the Metacade project.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade is a web3 project that is powered by the Ethereum blockchain. The development team is working to improve the existing play-to-earn (P2E) ecosystem, allowing users to enjoy new web3 experiences.&nbsp;</p>
