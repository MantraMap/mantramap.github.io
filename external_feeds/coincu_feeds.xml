<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>SyncSwap advises users to withdraw their assets from USD+ LP within 12 hours to avoid the impact of the EraLend hack.</em></li>



<li><em>Withdrawal from LP is required to proceed with USD+ rebase and resume regular operation of the USD+ protocol.</em></li>



<li><em>The USD+ team will take a snapshot of USD+ holders and LP providers at the rebase block, and it will be used for the purpose of distributing EraLend proceeds.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to the official announcement from DEX SyncSwap, it advises users to withdraw their funds from USD+ LP within 12 hours to avoid the impact of the <a href="https://coincu.com/205867-eralend-by-3-4m-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EraLend hack</a>.</strong></h5>

<p>The zkSync ecosystem DEX SyncSwap was not affected by the recent EraLend attack, which only affected USDC deposits on the lending platform.</p>



<p>The DEX has confirmed that all other assets, including the SyncSwap USDC/ETH liquidity available on EraLend, are safe and intact. Users who have provided liquidity on EraLend are advised to withdraw their funds before the issue is resolved to avoid further troubles. There is no need to withdraw funds from the SyncSwap protocol itself.</p>



<p>The USD+ team will take a snapshot of USD+ holders and LP providers at the rebase block, and it will be used for the purpose of distributing EraLend proceeds.</p>



<p>On July 25, EraLend, the most significant lending protocol operating on the Ethereum extension blockchain zkSync, fell victim to an attack that resulted in a substantial loss of $3.4 million.</p>

<p>Since then, the group has stopped the attack, and the attackers have been unable to continue. As a precaution, EraLend has suspended all borrowing to protect funds while working with cross-chain bridge partners and zkSync to prevent additional asset flows.</p>



<p>Currently, EraLend is also working with cybersecurity companies to trace the source of the attack.</p>



<p>EraLend&#8217;s recent <a href="https://twitter.com/Erea_Lend/status/1683905399408435200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update</a> is that all users are suggested to request a refund and revoke application approval for Eralend. An interim compensation disbursement has been allocated due to negative market sentiment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The price of Dogecoin (DOGE) surged more than 8% in the past 24 hours after receiving momentum from avid fan Elon Musk.</em></li>



<li><em>Musk retweeted a video tweet related to the new Logo X on Twitter shared by DogeDesigner.</em></li>



<li><em>Earlier, the Twitter boss said he wanted to remove the bird icon on Twitter and replace it with an &#8220;X&#8221;.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dogecoin (DOGE) received great motivation from Twitter boss Elon Musk to increase sharply by 8% while the whole market was quiet.</strong></h5>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/205415-elon-musk-profile-appears-dogecoin-symbol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOGE</a> at the time of writing is up 8.12% over the past 24 hours, trading for $0.081. And in the past week, it has gained almost 17%, making it one of the best performing coins.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

Source: <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinMarketCap</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The impetus for DOGE to surge while the significant tokens of the market were sleeping came from familiar fan Elon Musk when he tweeted an ad for the social networking site&#8217;s new logo, originally shared by DogeDesigner.</p>



<p>A few days earlier, Twitter owner Elon Musk said he wanted to get rid of the bird icon on Twitter and replace it with an &#8220;X&#8221; while emphasizing that this should have been done long ago. Since Musk bought Twitter in October 2022, the company has changed its business name to X Corp.</p>

<p>The short-term increase of DOGE is familiar to the community when there is a move from billionaire Elon Musk. That is why he is also fondly called the second father of Dogecoin.</p>



<p>In 2013, Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus created Dogecoin as a joke to mock the cryptocurrency craze at that time. Eight years later, when he saw the price of Dogecoin continuously being manipulated, Jackson Palmer took to Twitter to warn crypto players about the current state of the market. Co-founder Billy Markus also admits &#8220;his views are quite reasonable&#8221;.</p>



<p>However, this memecoin did not fail, Musk started pumping coins on Twitter in 2020 by posting memes, increasing in value and gaining many followers. His electric car company Tesla also accepts cryptocurrencies. Tesla has never disclosed whether its customers have used Dogecoin or, if so, how much it received. But Musk&#8217;s relationship with the meme coin has attracted some negative attention.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The US SEC charged Quantstamp with unregistered crypto-security ICOs in 2017.</em></li>



<li><em>Quantstamp has raised over $28 million by selling QSP tokens to approximately 5,000 investors.</em></li>



<li><em>The platform agreed to settle the allegations for $2.5 million without admitting or denying the SEC&#8217;s findings.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Blockworks, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Quantstamp of conducting an unregistered initial coin offering (ICO) of crypto-security in 2017.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1853.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="535" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1853-1024x535.png" alt="US SEC Charges Quantstamp $2.5M With Unregistered Securities ICO In 2017" class="wp-image-205941" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1853-1024x535.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1853-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1853-768x401.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1853-750x392.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1853-1140x596.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1853.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="US SEC Charges Quantstamp $2.5M With Unregistered Securities ICO In 2017 5"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>According to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2023/33-11215.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regulatory filings</a>, Quantstamp has raised over $28 million by selling QSP tokens to about 5,000 investors. The filing adds that the company plans to use the proceeds from the ICO to develop a protocol on the ethereum blockchain that will provide automated security audits for smart contracts.</p>



<p>The company allegedly made QSP buyers expect the value of the tokens to increase with the success of the company&#8217;s business. In a press release last week, the SEC said it had taken steps to make the tokens tradable on third-party digital asset exchanges after the ICO.</p>



<p>Quantstamp claimed that the unregistered sales of QSP were exempt, but “failed to qualify for any exemption to registration,” the SEC said in a news release last week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Quantstamp agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the SEC&#8217;s findings, paying nearly $2.5 million in judgment, interest, and a $1 million civil penalty. The company&#8217;s automated smart contract security audit platform, built in June 2019, is no longer operational.</p>



<p>The settlement comes about a week after a US district judge <a href="https://coincu.com/204894-us-sec-signals-appeal-court-ripple-xrp-case/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruled </a>after a nearly three-year span on SEC allegations that Ripple&#8217;s XRP token sale was a service unregistered security.</p>



<p>Quantstamp is the first Smart Contract security audit protocol. Specifically, they solve security problems by creating a scalable and cost-effective system that allows audits of all Smart Contracts on the Ethereum platform. It attracted a lot of attention from the community after the ICO announced QSP at the end of 2017 and went on Binance afterward. </p>



<p>Contrary to the sharp decline of tokens when caught in legal trouble with the SEC, QSP is even up 3% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $0.012.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>DOJ requests time to gather evidence against Celsius founder for fraud charges.</em></li>



<li><em>Celsius settles with FTC for $4.7 billion over investor deception.</em></li>



<li><em>The trial date is pending, and if convicted, Mashinsky and a co-defendant could face lengthy prison sentences, making this a significant case in the crypto industry.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a high-stakes legal battle, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has requested six to eight weeks from a federal judge to gather evidence against Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former CEO of cryptocurrency lending platform <a href="https://coincu.com/204888-celsius-hits-deal-users-compensation-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celsius</a>, <em>CoinDesk</em> <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/25/us-doj-needs-6-8-weeks-to-process-evidence-against-alex-mashinsky-attorneys-tell-judge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1849.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="860" height="394" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1849.png" alt="DOJ Seeks Evidence in Fraud Case Against Celsius Founder Amidst $4.7B FTC Settlement" class="wp-image-205928" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1849.png 860w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1849-300x137.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1849-768x352.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1849-750x344.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" title="DOJ Seeks Evidence In Fraud Case Against Celsius Founder Amidst $4.7B FTC Settlement 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>The DOJ&#8217;s attorneys have cited the need to sift through a massive trove of corporate records and communications from Celsius, which includes over 1,200 videos of &#8220;ask-me-anything&#8221; sessions featuring Mashinsky and other executives, some lasting over an hour.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/204802-celsius-network-a-story-of-greed-and-deception/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mashinsky</a>, who was taken into custody earlier this month, has <a href="https://coincu.com/202741-celsius-network-founder-pleads-not-guilty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entered</a> a plea of not guilty to charges of securities fraud, commodities fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to manipulate the price of CEL, Celsius&#8217; native token. His defense in court is led by lawyer Marc Mukasey.</p>



<p>Judge John G. Koeltl of the District Court for the Southern District of New York has set the next conference date for October 3rd, with the trial date yet to be determined. Koeltl had previously granted Mashinsky&#8217;s team additional time to comply with the conditions of his $40 million bail.</p>



<p>This recent arrest follows Mashinsky&#8217;s previous detention on July 13 on federal securities fraud charges, coinciding with the crypto exchange&#8217;s agreement to settle a $4.7 billion lawsuit with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</p>

<p>Celsius, along with Mashinsky, is also facing lawsuits from both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on allegations of conspiring to defraud investors of substantial amounts.</p>



<p>Mashinsky faces a string of charges in Manhattan federal court, encompassing securities, commodities, and wire fraud, as well as various securities manipulation and fraud charges. If convicted, both Mashinsky and his co-defendant, Roni Cohen-Pavon, could be sentenced to decades in prison.</p>



<p>Celsius&#8217; settlement with the FTC stands as one of the largest in the agency&#8217;s history, comparable to the record $5 billion fine imposed on Meta in 2019. This settlement comes as the FTC accuses Celsius and Mashinsky of engaging in repeated deceptive practices.</p>

<p>The terms of the settlement, announced by the FTC, dictate that the payment will be withheld until Celsius can return the remaining customer assets amidst ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.</p>



<p>In the charging document, the office of U.S. Attorney Damian Williams alleges that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Mashinsky misrepresented, among other things, the safety of Celsius’s yield-generating activities, Celsius’s profitability, the long-term sustainability of Celsius’ high rewards rates, and the risks associated with depositing crypto assets with Celsius.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As the trial date looms, the outcome of this high-profile case could have significant implications for the crypto industry and its regulatory landscape. The court proceedings will undoubtedly be closely monitored by stakeholders and investors alike.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>KuCoin, a cryptocurrency exchange, denies rumors of laying off 30% of its workforce amid declining profits and legal challenges from the New York State Attorney General.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin has been grappling with rumors of potential workforce reductions as it contends with legal challenges and declining profits.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1845.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="567" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1845-1024x567.png" alt="KuCoin Faces Profit Woes Surround, But No Layoffs Confirmed" class="wp-image-205920" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1845-1024x567.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1845-300x166.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1845-768x425.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1845-750x416.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1845-1140x632.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1845.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="KuCoin Faces Profit Woes Surround, But No Layoffs Confirmed 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>Twitter news account <em>Wu Blockchain</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1683821842447106048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cited</a> three anonymous internal sources in a tweet, claiming that <a href="https://coincu.com/198648-kucoin-mandatory-kyc-verification/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KuCoin</a> plans to lay off up to 30% of its employees, amounting to nearly 1,000 staff members. The decline in profits was attributed to the implementation of strict Know Your Customer (KYC) policies, a move made in response to the legal challenges posed by the United States.</p>



<p>However, a spokesperson for KuCoin refuted the claims, stating that the company has not initiated any layoff plans, <em>CoinDesk</em> <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/07/25/crypto-exchange-kucoin-to-adjust-some-personnel-as-needed-denies-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>. Instead, the spokesperson asserted that any personnel adjustments would be part of routine business development and semi-annual employee performance reviews—a normal process in organizational development.</p>



<p>The legal troubles faced by the exchange are not unique, as the cryptocurrency industry faces increasing scrutiny from regulators worldwide. The New York Attorney General&#8217;s lawsuit against the exchange <a href="https://coincu.com/172664-kucoin-sued-asks-permanent-ban-eth-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alleged</a> violations of the Martin Act, a powerful state securities law, accusing the exchange of conducting unauthorized transactions and offering a product called &#8220;KuCoin Earn&#8221; that generated income for both the platform and investors. Moreover, the lawsuit contested the exchange&#8217;s claim of being an official &#8220;exchange.&#8221;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1847.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="960" height="503" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1847.png" alt="KuCoin Faces Profit Woes Surround, But No Layoffs Confirmed" class="wp-image-205922" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1847.png 960w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1847-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1847-768x402.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1847-750x393.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" title="KuCoin Faces Profit Woes Surround, But No Layoffs Confirmed 11"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">New York State Attorney General Letitia James</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Despite the challenges, the exchange has amassed over 27 million users across 207 countries and regions since its launch in September 2017. However, in terms of trading volume among cryptocurrency spot exchanges, KuCoin trails behind major players like Binance, <a href="https://coincu.com/204526-coinbase-stops-coinbase-borrow-users-repay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a>, and <a href="https://coincu.com/200835-fbi-targets-kraken-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kraken</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, KuCoin&#8217;s rival, Binance, has <a href="https://coincu.com/202996-binance-fired-1000-people-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly</a> undergone workforce reductions in recent weeks, although the exchange denies the extent of the layoffs. Binance, like KuCoin, attributed these adjustments to a reevaluation of talent and expertise in critical roles.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1848.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="674" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1848.png" alt="KuCoin Faces Profit Woes Surround, But No Layoffs Confirmed" class="wp-image-205923" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1848.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1848-300x197.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1848-768x506.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1848-750x494.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="KuCoin Faces Profit Woes Surround, But No Layoffs Confirmed 12"></a></figure></div>


<p>As the cryptocurrency industry continues to evolve, exchanges face mounting pressure to comply with regulatory frameworks and adapt to changing market dynamics. For KuCoin, navigating legal challenges and implementing measures to enhance customer security remain crucial factors in securing its position in the competitive crypto landscape.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Web3 gaming company Aurory announces integration with Arbitrum, Ethereum&#8217;s Layer 2 scaling solution, enabling digital asset existence on both Arbitrum and Solana blockchains.</em></li>



<li><em>Players can now use SyncSpace technology to deposit and withdraw gaming assets between Solana and Arbitrum, offering a seamless cross-chain experience.</em></li>



<li><em>This significant milestone advances Aurory&#8217;s multi-platform vision and enhances the utility of in-game assets.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Aurory, a renowned web3 gaming company offering a universe of interoperable games, has taken a significant step towards its multi-platform vision. The company recently <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aurory-franchise-enables-cross-chain-operability-with-arbitrum-integration-301885313.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its integration with <a href="https://coincu.com/204281-arbitrum-foundation-grants-phase-1-targets-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arbitrum</a>, the leading Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, opening up new possibilities for digital asset acquisition and management within its gaming ecosystem.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843-1024x576.png" alt="Aurory Sets The Stage For Seamless Web3 Gaming With New Integration On Arbitrum" class="wp-image-205906" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Aurory Sets The Stage For Seamless Web3 Gaming With New Integration On Arbitrum 13"></a></figure></div>


<p>While Aurory&#8217;s free-to-play games don&#8217;t require wallet connections, the company has enabled on-chain Aurory assets to exist on both Arbitrum and Solana, two prominent blockchain ecosystems within the web3 gaming realm. These assets encompass AURY tokens, playable NFT characters, skins, and Neftie eggs, all of which serve or will serve a utility in Aurory&#8217;s flagship games, Adventures (JRPG) and Tactics (Timeline-Based Battle Arena).</p>



<p>SyncSpace technology plays a pivotal role in making this integration possible. It is a proprietary hybrid on-chain/off-chain inventory management system specifically designed by Aurory. Originally aimed at reducing friction for new users entering the Aurory gaming universe without the need for wallet connections, SyncSpace also allows them to earn in-game items that can later be minted on-chain when withdrawn to an external wallet. Moreover, users can deposit on-chain items into SyncSpace, facilitating seamless gameplay, trading, Neftie egg hatching, Aurorian expeditions, and more without the constant need for blockchain transaction approvals.</p>



<p>By leveraging SyncSpace, Aurory now empowers gamers to deposit their assets from the Solana network into SyncSpace and withdraw them on the Arbitrum network and vice versa, ensuring a seamless cross-chain experience. Notably, this innovation also opens the door for Aurory games to integrate with traditional gaming platforms that impose stricter regulations on incorporating blockchain elements.</p>

<p>The integration with Arbitrum comes at a time when the network is making substantial strides in the web3 gaming industry. During the first quarter of 2023, Arbitrum witnessed a staggering 125% growth in active blockchain gaming users, thanks to its cutting-edge technological advancements in scaling performance. The Arbitrum Nova scaling solution utilizes &#8220;AnyTrust&#8221; technology, processing data off-chain to enable low-cost transactions, which is particularly beneficial for game developers handling high transaction volumes.</p>



<p>Arbitrum has been a hotbed of activity lately, attracting prominent projects in the blockchain gaming space. Notably, Xai, a gaming-focused permissionless Layer 3 blockchain, revealed plans to launch on the network later this year. Additionally, The Graph, a leading indexing and query protocol for organizing blockchain data, recently commenced its final phase of migration to Arbitrum.

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Flashbots, an Ethereum infrastructure service, raises $60 million in a Series B funding round led by Paradigm.</em></li>



<li><em>The funding will be used to advance the development of Flashbots&#8217; SUAVE network, aimed at mitigating maximum extractable value (MEV) challenges on Ethereum.</em></li>



<li><em>SUAVE enables cost-effective and private transactions, making significant strides in revolutionizing blockchain efficiency and privacy.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Flashbots, an Ethereum infrastructure service, has successfully completed its Series B funding round, securing $60 million. The funding was led by Paradigm, a prominent crypto-focused investment firm.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1841.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="494" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1841-1024x494.png" alt="Flashbots Secures $60M In Funding Led By Paradigm To Enhance SUAVE MEV Network" class="wp-image-205900" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1841-1024x494.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1841-300x145.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1841-768x371.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1841-750x362.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1841-1140x550.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1841.png 1450w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Flashbots Secures $60M In Funding Led By Paradigm To Enhance SUAVE MEV Network 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>The primary focus of this funding is to accelerate the development of Flashbots&#8217; maximum extractable value (MEV) network called <a href="https://writings.flashbots.net/mevm-suave-centauri-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SUAVE</a>.</p>



<p>The news of the funding round was initially reported by <em><a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/241327/flashbots-becomes-unicorn-after-completing-60-million-raise" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Block</a></em>, which mentioned a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July 21.</p>



<p>The filing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1879282/000187928223000003/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Flashbots had raised $30,353,089 of its targeted $59,999,919. The completion of the round is expected to be confirmed shortly when additional filings become public.</p>



<p>An intriguing aspect of the project&#8217;s fundraising approach was their invitation to investors and partners to participate in a reverse pitch &#8220;beauty contest for decentralization.&#8221; Paradigm emerged as the lead investor among the chosen backers.</p>



<p>Flashbots is known for its extensive research and development work centered around Ethereum. Their main objective is to tackle the issue of MEV, which refers to the potential profits that network operators can gain by previewing or reordering upcoming blockchain transactions.</p>



<p>The project also officially <a href="https://twitter.com/SheaKetsdever/status/1683477917949411330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the open-source implementation of Nodes in its MEV-Share product array. Specifically, it said that the biggest motivation behind this decision is to be transparent about the arrangement and distribution of profits after MEV transactions.</p>



<p>The SUAVE (Single Unifying Auction for Value Expression) platform, developed by Flashbots, is an independent network serving as a mempool and decentralized block builder. Developers can use SUAVE to launch intra-block applications such as block builders or orderflow auctions. These applications then compete to execute user preferences, leading to more cost-effective and private transactions compared to traditional chains like Ethereum.</p>

<p>With the additional funding, <a href="https://coincu.com/133876-flashbots-announced-an-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flashbots</a> plans to further enhance the SUAVE platform, with a specific focus on allowing users to transact more affordably and privately on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>



<p>This successful Series B funding round comes after earlier reports that Flashbots aimed to become a unicorn by raising up to $50 million. Notably, Paradigm was also a lead investor in the project&#8217;s seed-stage fundraising round back in 2020.</p>



<p>In addition to proposing blocks for validators on the Ethereum blockchain, Flashbots offers MEV-boost, a middleware that optimizes MEV for use by Ethereum validators.</p>



<p>With the new funding in place and the continuous development of SUAVE, Flashbots is well-positioned to address MEV challenges and provide more efficient and private transaction solutions on the Ethereum network.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Tennessee couple charged with defrauding over 100 investors in the &#8220;Blessings of God Thru Crypto&#8221; scheme by the CFTC.</em></li>



<li><em>They raised $6 million, promising high returns through crypto futures trading.</em></li>



<li><em>CFTC seeks restitution, but recovery difficult as funds were transferred to untraceable digital wallets.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8757-23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a complaint on July 25 against Michael and Amanda Griffis, owners of a real estate company in Clarksville, Tennessee, for allegedly defrauding over 100 people in a digital assets commodity pool scheme. The couple raised more than $6 million by persuading colleagues and customers to pool funds for trading digital assets.</strong></h5>

<p>Operating under the name &#8220;Blessings of God Thru Crypto,&#8221; the defendants promised high returns to participants by claiming to trade &#8220;crypto futures&#8221; on the &#8220;Apex Trading Platform&#8221; with guidance from an individual named &#8220;Coach Wendy.&#8221; Their personal and professional connections were leveraged to lend credibility to the scheme.</p>



<p>A commodity pool is an investment vehicle that combines funds from multiple investors for trading in futures contracts or other commodity interests, typically managed by a pool operator.</p>



<p>The CFTC is seeking restitution, civil monetary penalties, permanent trading and registration bans, as well as a permanent injunction against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The defendants falsely represented that pool funds would be safe and under their control, that pool participants could expect high gains, and that the defendants would use pool funds to trade &#8216;crypto futures&#8217; on the &#8216;Apex Trading Platform&#8217; with the advice of a person identified only as &#8216;Coach Wendy,'&#8221; the CFTC stated.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The couple allegedly mingled the pool funds with their personal finances. Investors would transfer funds to Michael Griffis&#8217; account, which were then moved to his personal account on Coinbase. Next, the funds were converted into digital asset commodities and transferred to the Apex Trading Platform for futures trading. However, the CFTC revealed that over $4 million of the pool funds were quickly transferred to digital wallets beyond the defendants&#8217; control, making recovery impossible.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1839.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1839-1024x576.png" alt="CFTC Charges Tennessee Couple For Defrauding Investors In Crypto Scam Scheme" class="wp-image-205893" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1839-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1839-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1839-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1839-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1839-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1839.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="CFTC Charges Tennessee Couple For Defrauding Investors In Crypto Scam Scheme 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>Approximately $855,000 was paid out to certain pool participants, resembling Ponzi-style payments. The <a href="https://coincu.com/205581-binance-cz-file-a-petition-dismiss-cftcs-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CFTC</a> warned that retrieving lost funds might prove difficult, as the defendants may lack sufficient assets. Despite this, the regulatory body is steadfast in holding the couple accountable for their actions. The defendants are accused of misappropriating around $1 million to settle debts and indulge in luxury purchases. The remaining funds were allegedly used for Ponzi-like payments to prolong the scheme.</p>



<p>Commodity pool scams have long been used to deceive victims, with perpetrators offering promises of unique market insights and fast returns. However, once the funds are in the pool operator&#8217;s control, recovering them becomes significantly challenging, especially when perpetrators transfer the funds to digital wallets outside their jurisdiction.</p>



<p>Ian McGinley, the CFTC&#8217;s director of enforcement, declared: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The defendants betrayed their pool participants, and they profited from that betrayal. Today&#8217;s filing reinforces the CFTC&#8217;s long-standing commitment to hold accountable those who take advantage of victims.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The CFTC insists that it will continue to hold the defendants responsible for their acts.</p>



<p>In a recent development, the CFTC <a href="https://coincu.com/202226-digitex-futures-founder-default-judgment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> a default judgment against Florida resident Adam Todd and his affiliated companies. The judgment comes from his involvement in illegal activities related to their digital asset exchange, operating under the name &#8220;Digitex Futures.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the franchise continues to flourish, the creators have now set their sights on further expansion.

<p>The migration to Ronin represents a strategic move for the Kongz team, as they plan to leverage the gaming ecosystem provided by Sky Mavis and delve deeper into the Southeast Asian and Japanese markets. A representative from Sky Mavis confirmed the partnership, which also involves rewarding players of <a href="https://coincu.com/202547-axie-infinity-launches-new-player-profile-module/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axie Infinity</a> with digital assets from the CyberKongz collection.</p>



<p>The franchise is not content with just the migration, as they are launching a new anime-inspired NFT collection called &#8220;Genkai.&#8221; The collection is set to make its debut on July 27, with some of the tokens being minted on Ronin, while others will be available on the Ethereum mainnet. The total supply of Genkai tokens is 20,000, with 4,000 of them available on Ronin through Sky Mavis&#8217;s in-house NFT marketplace, Mavis Market.</p>



<p>&#8220;Myoo,&#8221; the pseudonymous founder and artist behind CyberKongz, expressed excitement about Genkai, stating, &#8220;Genkai is the first non-pixel artwork I have created for CyberKongz, and will represent our growth as a project to expand our IP into the Southeast Asian and Japanese markets.&#8221; Furthermore, the collaboration with Ronin will also pave the way for the development of a game featuring the Genkai collection.</p>

<p>Despite the fluctuations in the NFT market, <a href="https://coincu.com/197996-cyberkongz-introduces-on-chain-2fa-with-erc-721x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CyberKongz</a> remains determined to thrive, and the introduction of Genkai is a testament to their commitment to evolving their IP and engaging with the gaming community. Sky Mavis&#8217;s support in rewarding Mystic Axie holders with Genkai NFTs aims to foster a strong connection between the two franchises.</p>



<p>The Genkai minting on Ronin is significant as it marks the first non-Axie Infinity NFT drop on the blockchain. This move comes shortly after Sky Mavis&#8217;s announcement of its collaboration with multiple game studios, including The Machines Arena developers, to bolster Ronin&#8217;s gaming ecosystem.</p>



<p>With a total of 20,000 NFTs set to be minted for Genkai, 16,000 will be available on the Ethereum mainnet, while 4,000 will reside on Ronin. Moreover, Ethereum NFT holders will have the option to migrate their Genkai NFTs to Ronin in the future, giving them more flexibility in managing their digital assets. The Ethereum public mint for Genkai NFTs will commence on July 27, priced at 0.25 ETH per token.</p>

<p>According to blockchain security firm CertiK, the attack <a href="https://skynet.certik.com/alerts/security/c501f496-5302-4c6a-b3a4-5b12b9a78915" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exploited</a> a vulnerability in EraLend&#8217;s smart contract code, allowing the attacker to withdraw more funds than authorized within a single transaction. As a result of the exploit, the total amount of locked capital on EraLend dropped from $18.5 million to $7.7 million, as reported by DefiLlama.</p>

<p>The vulnerability that the attacker took advantage of involved a read-only function, typically considered safe due to its inability to modify the contract&#8217;s state. These functions perform view actions, such as calculating token balances, without altering any data. However, the hacker manipulated this function through a reentrancy exploit, repeatedly calling it to drain assets from EraLend. The exploit focused on a faulty price oracle that EraLend relied on, ultimately allowing the attacker to siphon off significant funds from the protocol.</p>

<p>Era Lend addressed the incident promptly, suspending all borrowing operations and warning users against depositing USDC (USD Coin) until the issue is resolved. The team is actively working with cybersecurity firms and partners to investigate the attack and implement necessary security measures.</p>



<p>In the wake of the attack, Era Lend <a href="https://twitter.com/Era_Lend/status/1683826465446715397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reassured</a> its users that only the USDC pool was compromised, and the security of assets other than USDC remains intact. As a precautionary step, the platform temporarily halted borrowing operations to prevent further losses.</p>



<p>The attack on EraLend bears a resemblance to a similar incident that targeted the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol <a href="https://coincu.com/204863-conic-finance-liquidity-pools-not-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Conic Finance</a> the previous week, resulting in a total loss of $3.6 million. It highlights the need for increased security measures within the DeFi space as attackers continue to exploit vulnerabilities in smart contract code.</p>



<p>Despite the setback, EraLend remains committed to enhancing its security infrastructure to protect user funds and bolster the confidence of its community. As the DeFi ecosystem evolves, it is evident that constant vigilance and proactive security measures are essential to safeguarding users&#8217; assets and the overall integrity of decentralized platforms.</p>
