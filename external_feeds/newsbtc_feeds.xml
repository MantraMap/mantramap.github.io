					<description><![CDATA[Cardano (ADA) is a blockchain-based platform that allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Created by Charles Hoskinson, one of the co-founders of Ethereum to address some of the scalability and interoperability issues faced by existing blockchain networks. Given the asset’s potential, ADA has gained a lot of attention in the crypto community over the years. However, lately, many investors and traders have wondered about the crypto&#8217;s next move amid the uncertainty in the crypto market.  Cardano (ADA) Possible Bullish Breakout In the past week, Cardano (ADA) has seen some significant bearish price action. The asset crashed in the past 7 days with the price down by nearly 20%. This bearish trend can be attributed to several factors, including the ongoing downtrend in the market.  However, despite the bearish trend, ADA may be poised for a bullish breakout, according to the asset’s price chart. On the 1-day time frame, Cardano has just tapped into an order block indicating a likely reversal (upward movement). An order block is basically the last bullish or bearish candle before the formation of a significant move in the market. It refers to a price level where a large number of buy or sell orders are clustered, creating a significant level of support or resistance.  Large institutional traders, hedge funds, or other market participants who place big buy or sell orders at a specific price level create order blocks. An identified order block at a certain price level may be that price will bounce off that level and move in the opposite direction.  In this case, ADA could form a reversal to the upside given the asset tapping into the order block at the $0.37 region. Though it is uncertain when ADA will execute the reversal, it could happen soon given the precision in the chart. Meanwhile, at the time of writing, ADA bears seem exhausted as the asset has only been down only 0.2% in the last 24 hours. ADA currently trades at $0.38, slightly above the above-identified order block price level.  Should ADA continue an opposite direction to the upside and not invalidate the marked out order block. ADA&#8217;s price could tap into major highs such as the one at the $0.46 zone. Fundamentals That Could Contribute To ADA&#8217;s Breakout Technicalities aside, Cardano also has some fundamentals that could be a part of its possible bullish breakout. An instance is the Snowmantastic NFT project transition from the Ethereum network to the Cardano network. Snowmantastic has collaborated with over 200 projects in the industry. Its transition to Cardano could drive a huge amount of investors into this ecosystem, therefore, increasing the native’s token price in the long run.  On the Cardano network, we can already see a similar scenario where the accumulation of ADA is on the rise. According to a chart shown by the popular crypto analyst, Ali Chart, on April 1, the number of large transactions on Cardano reached 4,000.   By April 13, the transactions climbed up nearing 5,000. The analyst noted, Large ADA transactions are on the rise, suggesting that Cardano network activity is heating up as institutional players and whales make their moves.

					<description><![CDATA[The cryptocurrency market has experienced significant volatility in recent months, with the price of Bitcoin (BTC) dropping from its new yearly high of $31,000 to its current trading price of $27,300. This pullback has left Bitcoin at a crossroads, with traders waiting to see whether the key support level of $27,000 will hold or break. However, Bitcoin is known for its volatility, and bid liquidity movement can provide valuable insights into market activity. In Q1/2023, a block of bid liquidity was identified in what appeared to be controlled by a single entity, which was named Notorious B.I.D, according to the research and analysis firm Material Indicators.  Related Reading: Bullish Momentum Expected For ARB As Arbitrum Completes DAO Airdrop Bitcoin Rally 2.0 On The Horizon? This entity was successful in attracting more bids to fuel a Bitcoin rally, and the movement of bid liquidity became predictable over time. However, the game ended with a rug pull in the first week of March. As of this writing, according to Materials,  there are indications that a similar entity may be active in the market again, with bid liquidity movement that looks similar to what was seen in Q1. While there is no way of knowing for sure if Notorious B.I.D. is back, it appears that somebody is using a large stack to play a similar game. One of the key differences between what was seen in Q1 and what is being observed now is that the buy walls are changing size. This could be a distribution strategy, as the large buyer seeks to push the price up to a higher distribution range and ultimately use those bids as exit liquidity.  According to the fire chart of the Material Indicator, there is a substantial bid wall situated just below the $26,000 mark. This bid wall may have the potential to prevent a further decline in Bitcoin&#8217;s price shortly, but only if the $27,000 support floor is broken. Despite this, Bitcoin&#8217;s current support level has remained stable, indicating that there is a possibility of a rebound to higher levels. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that Bitcoin&#8217;s price may bounce back to higher levels. BTC’s MVRV Reaches 11-Month High According to Gaah, a researcher and analyst from the CryptoQuant Firm, the MVRV (market-value-to-realized-value) ratio is a key indicator of market sentiment and can provide valuable insights into investor behavior. The ratio is calculated by dividing the market capitalization of Bitcoin by its realized capitalization, which is the sum of the value of all Bitcoin transactions since they were last moved on-chain. When the MVRV ratio is in the green quadrant, below a value of 1.44, it is considered to be in the accumulation zone. This indicates that there is decreased selling pressure in the market, as the realized capitalization of Bitcoin exceeds its market capitalization. In other words, investors are less motivated to sell their Bitcoin, as they believe that its true value is higher than its current market price. Gaah notes that the MVRV ratio reached a high of 0.82 in December 2022, when Bitcoin was still trading at around $17,000. This is the same level that the ratio reached in 2018, just before Bitcoin experienced a significant drop in value. However, Gaah believes that the current market conditions are different and that the MVRV ratio is a reflection of the increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin.

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum&#8217;s (ETH) staking ecosystem has made headlines in the blockchain space since the recent Shanghai upgrade. As the crypto market continues to grow, Ethereum has emerged as a market leader in staking, offering some of the best yields and attracting more investors. But what exactly makes Ethereum&#8217;s staking so attractive? Related Reading: Bullish Momentum Expected For ARB As Arbitrum Completes DAO Airdrop Ethereum Staking Goes Big According to DeFi Ignas, a leading expert in decentralized finance (DeFi), Ethereum&#8217;s ETH has the best token economics in crypto. One of the main reasons for this is Ethereum&#8217;s decision to move away from the Proof of Work (PoW) to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.  He suggests that If Ethereum had remained on PoW, $4.7 billion worth of ETH would have been issued, more than the entire market cap of UNI, Uniswap’s native token, at $4 billion. This move has made Ethereum supply deflationary, creating a more valuable asset for investors. However, as DeFi Ignas points out, Ethereum&#8217;s staking ratio currently stands at just 14.8%, the lowest among major blockchains. This is despite offering a competitive ~4.5% APR. One reason for this low staking ratio is that other blockchains have a more concentrated token distribution, with insiders, team members, and early investors actively staking for rewards.  According to DeFi Ignas, recent data suggests that the staking landscape is shifting, with some major players losing market share and a significant amount of ETH being withdrawn from staking platforms. In particular, Kraken, Coinbase, and Huobi have all seen a decline in their market share in the past month. Furthermore, 36% of all ETH staking withdrawals originate from Kraken. It&#8217;s worth noting that when there are more withdrawals than deposits, it typically indicates a bearish sentiment among investors, as they sell their holdings in larger quantities than they are buying. This is further supported by the fact that around 40% of all ETH stakers have a negative ETH PnL, meaning they are holding ETH at a loss. However, there is a silver lining to this data. According to DeFi Ignas, 29% of all ETH stakers have staked their ETH at the current price, which suggests that there are still many investors who believe in the long-term potential of ETH and are willing to hold onto their investments despite short-term market fluctuations, which for him, this is a bullish sign for the future of Ethereum staking. ETH Staking, The Best Risk/Reward Option For Financial Freedom? According to DeFi Ignas,  Ethereum staking is poised to overtake decentralized exchanges (DEXes) by total value locked (TVL), with just 15% of all ETH currently staked across 83 protocols. Also, despite being a relatively new industry, the Liquidity Staking Derivative (LSD) ecosystem has already surpassed lending, bridging, and CDP stablecoins in terms of TVL, and it&#8217;s expected to continue growing in the future.  Additionally, Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), which enables &#8220;squad staking&#8221; by allowing groups to stake different amounts of ETH collectively, is another trend gaining traction in the Ethereum staking ecosystem. On the same note, the prominent crypto analyst McKenna has stated in a recent Twitter post that Ethereum&#8217;s staking rate has increased from 14.15% to 14.93% post-Shanghai, and this trend is expected to continue. McKenna predicts that ETH staking will become a major sink, with a staking rate close to 20% by the end of the year. The increase in staking is also a bullish sign for the future of Ethereum, as it demonstrates the community&#8217;s commitment to the network and its success. As more funds are locked in staking, the circulating supply of ETH decreases, creating a scarcity that could potentially drive up the asset&#8217;s price.

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin market may be close to a decision point as on-chain data shows the Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR) is retesting the 1.0 level. Bitcoin aSOPR Has Declined Towards A Value Of 1.0 Recently According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the BTC market had shifted towards a profit-dominated regime back in January. The &#8220;aSOPR&#8221; is an indicator that tells us whether the average investor is selling their Bitcoin at a profit or at a loss currently. The &#8220;adjusted&#8221; in aSOPR comes from the fact that this metric has been adjusted for filtering out transactions/sales of all coins that were done within only one hour of the previous transaction/purchase. The benefit of making this restriction is that it removes all noise from the data that wouldn&#8217;t have had any noticeable implications for the market. When the value of this indicator is greater than 1.0, it means the total amount of profits being harvested by the investors is more than the losses right now. On the other hand, values of the metric below the threshold suggest the market as a whole is realizing some losses at the moment. The 1.0 level itself naturally serves as the break-even mark, where the total amount of profits becomes equal to the losses. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin aSOPR over the last few months: The value of the metric seems to have been above the 1.0 mark in recent days &#124; Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 17, 2023 Historically, the aSOPR 1.0 level has been quite important for Bitcoin, as it has represented the mark where the transition between bullish and bearish trends has taken place. During bear markets, the indicator generally stays under this level, as investors naturally realize large losses. The mark acts as resistance in such market conditions, meaning that any attempts to break above it usually end up in failure. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘ESR’ Continues To Show Bullish Divergence, Will Price Follow? On the contrary, the 1.0 level acts as a support for the price during bullish periods, making sure that the indicator stays in the profits zone. Both these patterns can also be seen in action in the above graph, as the 2022 bear market saw the metric being stuck in the zone below 1.0, while the rally that started in January has observed it is in the green area. There was an exception last month, however, when the Bitcoin aSOPR sharply plunged below the 1.0 mark due to a sharp plunge in the price. It wasn&#8217;t long, though, before the metric (and also the price) returned back toward the bullish trend, implying that it was only a temporary anomaly. Recently, as the asset&#8217;s price has once again been going down, the indicator has also declined toward the 1.0 level. &#8220;With aSOPR currently retesting the break-even level of 1.0, this puts the market close to a decision point,&#8221; explains Glassnode. Related Reading: What’s Behind The Recent Bitcoin Drop?

					<description><![CDATA[In five short days, three Bitcoin whales have activated addresses with thousands of BTC. The community is concerned that the quick activation of these big BTC wallets might be due to a security flaw affecting wallet private key generators and would adversely affect prices. Old Bitcoin Wallets Awakening The large BTC movements notably coincide with a sharp retracement of prices from recent peaks of $31,000.  Over the last week, prices have dumped, moving down towards $27,000 and retesting critical support levels. Typically, how whales move coins between addresses and sometimes to centralized exchanges can impact sentiment, subsequently affecting prices. According to WhaleAlert, 6,071 BTC worth over $178.1 million was transferred on April 20. The sending address still holds 3,999.99999789 BTC and the last time it was active was on October 10, 2021. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Upcycle Shows Small Drawdowns, Report A day later, on April 21, another wallet holding 1,128 BTC holding coins worth over $31.5 million moved 278 BTC. While big, the sending address was last activated on June 1, 2021. The latest movement, though recently moved as early as 15 months ago in mid-December 2021, saw 1,000 BTC valued at more than $27.5 million transferred. 💤 💤 💤 A dormant address containing 1,000 #BTC (27,456,958 USD) has just been activated after 12.0 years!https://t.co/lHrgCNWpbY &#8212; Whale Alert (@whale_alert) April 24, 2023 It has yet to be verified whether the 7, 349 BTC, worth over $201 million at spot rates, moved were transferred to centralized exchanges. Often, when coins are moved to centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, the community believes they will be liquidated; influencing sentiment. Old Wallet Private Key Generator Cracked? Will BTC Prices Fall? One analyst observed that the sudden transfer of huge chunks of BTC could be because of a flaw in an old wallet&#8217;s private key generator that has now been exploited. If an unauthorized third party gets a private key, they can recover the wallet and take charge of all coins held by the vault.  If that happens, then old dormant wallets, including Satoshi Nakamoto&#8217;s, the founder of Bitcoin; can be compromised. Satoshi Nakamoto is believed to hold 1 million BTC, which he mined in the early days of Bitcoin before disappearing. There is a general belief that if the identity of Nakamoto is revealed and his coins moved, BTC prices may fall due to the fear of expected liquidation. However, that has not been verified, and none of his coins have been moved. Unless these wallets are somehow related to Mt Gox cold storage, then some old wallet generator has to have been cracked. We’re now at waay too many 10+ year wallets springing to life on multiple assets all of a sudden… &#8212; Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) April 24, 2023 The situation making the rumor a possibility is that it is currently impossible to verify the true owner of the wallet.  The pseudonymous nature of the Bitcoin network means it until the &#8220;victim&#8221; reveals their true identity and admits that their wallet had been compromised and their stash stolen, there is no way to verify if this was an exploit or if it was the actual owner moving the coins.

The wallet was inactive from 2011 until April 24, when it began sending dust transactions. The address has not transferred any amount when writing.

<p>It has yet to be verified whether the 7, 349 BTC, worth over $201 million at spot rates, moved were transferred to centralized exchanges. </p>
<p>Often, when coins are moved to centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, the community believes they will be liquidated; influencing sentiment.</p>
<h2><strong>Old Wallet Private Key Generator Cracked? Will BTC Prices Fall?</strong></h2>
<p>One analyst observed that the sudden transfer of huge chunks of BTC could be because of a flaw in an old wallet&#8217;s private key generator that has now been exploited. If an unauthorized third party gets a private key, they can recover the wallet and take charge of all coins held by the vault. </p>
<p>If that happens, then old dormant wallets, including Satoshi Nakamoto&#8217;s, the founder of Bitcoin; can be compromised. Satoshi Nakamoto is believed to hold 1 million BTC, which he mined in the early days of Bitcoin before disappearing.</p>
<p>There is a general belief that if the identity of Nakamoto is revealed and his coins moved, BTC prices may fall due to the fear of expected liquidation. However, that has not been verified, and none of his coins have been moved.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Unless these wallets are somehow related to Mt Gox cold storage, then some old wallet generator has to have been cracked.</p>
<p>We’re now at waay too many 10+ year wallets springing to life on multiple assets all of a sudden…</p>

<p></p>
<p>The situation making the rumor a possibility is that it is currently impossible to verify the true owner of the wallet. </p>
<p>The pseudonymous nature of the Bitcoin network means it until the &#8220;victim&#8221; reveals their true identity and admits that their wallet had been compromised and their stash stolen, there is no way to verify if this was an exploit or if it was the actual owner moving the coins.</p>

<p>Presently, on-chain data direct attention to another key dormant wallet holding 79,957.25 BTC. The wallet was inactive from 2011 until April 24, when it <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/1FeexV6bAHb8ybZjqQMjJrcCrHGW9sb6uF" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">began</a> sending dust transactions. The address has not transferred any amount when writing.</p>
