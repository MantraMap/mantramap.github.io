<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) narrowly avoided a drop below the $30,000 level on Monday, as market sentiment remained uncertain following recent gains.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD slipped to an intraday low of $30,045.23 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes a day after peaking at $30,437.56.</p>
<p>Some expected prices to drop this week, after last week&#x2019;s rally pushed volumes deep into overbought territory.</p>

<p>The relative strength index (RSI), which reached a high of 66.00 last week, now sits at the 52.85 mark.</p>
<p>This is marginally above a floor at 52.00, which seems to have been the last line of defense preventing <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> from falling under $30,000.</p>
<p>As of writing, bitcoin is trading at $30,201.14.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also moved lower on Monday, however traders were once again able to prevent price from dropping below the $1,900 level.</p>
<p>Following a high of $1,942.03 during Sunday&#x2019;s session, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD dropped to a bottom of $1,901.06 to start the week.</p>
<p>This resulted in the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency falling lower for a fourth consecutive day.</p>

<p><!-- TradingView Widget END --></p>
<p>Since reaching a multi-month high at $2,029, sellers and profit takers have moved to push price lower.</p>
<p>Similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, this was due to price strength being overbought, with a reading above the 70.00 mark. However, it now sits at 52.94.</p>
<p>The next visible floor appears to be at 50.00, and should it reach this point, ethereum will likely be trading below $1,900.</p>

Specifically, the blockchain analytics firm explained that crypto inflows to known illicit entities are down 65% compared to the previous year while inflows to risky entities are down 42%.</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Crime Down &#8216;Significantly&#8217; This Year</h2>
<p>Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis released its mid-year update on cryptocurrency-related crime on Wednesday. Noting that crypto crime is down 65% overall, the firm wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our data shows that cryptocurrency-related crime is down significantly this year.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Through the end of June, crypto inflows to known illicit entities — not including inflows to entities that have been sanctioned or subject to special measures — are down 65% compared to where they were at the same time in 2022,” Chainalysis detailed.</p>
<p>In addition, “Inflows to risky entities (made up primarily of mixers and high-risk exchanges) are down 42%” and “Inflows to illicit addresses are down in nearly every category,&#8221; the firm noted.</p>
<p>While crypto crime is down substantially overall, the blockchain analytics firm pointed out that ransomware was the sole type of cryptocurrency-related crime projected to grow in 2023, as attackers have extorted an additional $175.8 million more than they did during the same time period last year.</p>

<p>Moreover, crypto scammers have experienced a significant drop in revenue compared to the previous year, with their total collections in 2023 through June being approximately $3.3 billion less than in 2022. Noting that their total earnings for the current year amounted to slightly over $1 billion, Chainalysis emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>Through the end of June, crypto scammers have pulled in 77% less revenue than they did through June of 2022 — and keep in mind as well that 2022 itself saw a large drop in revenue compared to 2021.</p></blockquote>

Amidst this digital revolution, <a href="https://trackingjustbit.io/d6fa265fc">JustBit </a>emerges as a distinctive platform that has captivated a multitude of gamers with its extensive selection of games and flexible deposit methods. In this comprehensive review, we delve into the captivating world of online casinos, unraveling the reasons behind the wins and losses, unpacking the essential concept of Return to Player (RTP), and shedding light on the unique features that render Justbit an enticing choice for online gaming.</p>
<p><b>The JustBit Experience: An Introduction</b></p>

<p><b>Casino Gameplay: Winning and Losing Explained</b></p>
<p>To comprehend why players win or lose at casinos, we need to delve into the underlying mechanisms of casino games. Casinos, including online ones like <a href="https://trackingjustbit.io/d6fa265fc">JustBit</a>, use a system called Random Number Generator (RNG) to ensure fair gameplay.</p>
<p><b>The Role of RNG in Casinos</b></p>
<p>RNG, standing for Random Number Generator, ensures a diverse array of results with every interaction in games such as slots, poker, blackjack, and roulette. The outcomes are consistently spontaneous, unaffected by any prior results, providing players with a genuinely impartial gaming encounter across websites, including <a href="https://trackingjustbit.io/d6fa265fc">JustBit</a>.</p>
<p>However, the element of randomness also implies that outcomes are mostly down to luck. While the player has a mathematical edge, it doesn&#x2019;t guarantee that the player always wins. Players may hit winning streaks or endure losing streaks, all due to the RNG mechanism. Hence, it&#x2019;s crucial for players to view casino games primarily as a form of entertainment rather than a consistent source of income.</p>
<p><b>The Influence of Strategy on Game Outcomes</b></p>
<p>In the realm of casino games, it&#x2019;s common for players to credit victories or defeats to the caprices of fortune. However, while fortune indeed plays a pivotal role in numerous casino games, it&#x2019;s crucial to understand that it&#x2019;s not the solitary determinant. For some games, implementing strategic thought and thoroughly comprehending the game&#x2019;s regulations can notably sway your prospects of clinching a victory. This thrilling intersection of expertise, planning, and probability constitutes the real allure of casino games across websites such as <a href="https://trackingjustbit.io/d6fa265fc">JustBit</a>.</p>
<p><b>Mastering the Art of Strategy in Casino Games</b></p>
<p>A number of casino games, like Blackjack and Poker, don&#x2019;t solely rely on the unpredictable hand of fate. Instead, these games open up a space for strategic decisions that can markedly impact your chances of victory. Understanding the rules of the game forms the basic foundation here. Grasping the different hand combinations in Poker or knowing when to hit, stand, or double down in Blackjack can significantly affect the game&#x2019;s outcome.</p>
<p>In addition to the rules, acquiring knowledge of basic strategies is equally critical. For instance, Blackjack strategy charts provide a mathematical breakdown of the best decisions to make based on your cards and the dealer&#x2019;s face-up card. On the other hand, in Poker, knowing when to fold and when to raise, reading your opponents&#x2019; behaviors, and managing your poker bankroll are strategies that can reduce and increase your winning potential.</p>
<p><b>The Role of Luck: A Constant Variable in Casino Games</b></p>
<p>Despite the strategic elements, it&#x2019;s important to remember that no strategy can guarantee a win in these games. The variable of luck ensures a certain level of unpredictability in every game round. This means that even the most experienced players armed with fail-proof strategies can occasionally lose to beginners.</p>
<p>These scenarios highlight the fundamental element of chance in casino games, reminding us that while strategies can significantly enhance the gameplay and boost your winning potential, they can&#x2019;t promise consistent triumphs. This unpredictability ultimately infuses these games with their sense of thrill and engagement over websites, <a href="https://trackingjustbit.io/d6fa265fc">JustBit</a> being a case in point.</p>
<p><b>Psychology&#x2019;s Impact on Casino Outcomes</b></p>
<p>When pondering over casino games, our thoughts frequently gravitate toward components such as fortune, probability, and tactical moves. Even though these elements definitively mold the casino gameplay arena, a nuanced yet potent facet carries significant weight in dictating outcomes &#x2013; the player&#x2019;s psychology. As a profound interaction of mental operations and emotional reactions, human psychology profoundly influences the actions we undertake, the choices we execute, and our responses to the results when engaged in games over web-based venues like <a href="https://trackingjustbit.io/d6fa265fc">JustBit</a>.</p>
<p><b>The Thrill of Anticipation and the Pleasure of Reward</b></p>
<p>One of the most fascinating psychological aspects at play in casino gaming is the thrill of anticipation. As players place their bets and await the outcome, an intense sense of excitement builds up. This feeling is linked to the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter in our brain associated with pleasure and reward. When we anticipate a potentially rewarding activity, such as hitting a winning combination in a slot game on <a href="https://trackingjustbit.io/d6fa265fc">JustBit</a>, our brain releases dopamine, creating feelings of enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>

<p><b>RTP (Return to Player)</b></p>
<p>The world of online casinos is fascinating, brimming with colorful graphics, exciting sounds, and the constant thrill of potential winnings. While these elements make for an engaging experience, understanding some of the key terminologies used in the industry can elevate your gaming adventure, offering you insights that could potentially help your gameplay strategy.</p>
<p>One such term is the RTP, which stands for Return to Player. Although it might sound complicated, the concept behind RTP is quite straightforward. To put it in simple terms, RTP is a measure that tells you how much a particular casino game is designed to pay back to its players over an extended period. It&#x2019;s a theoretical figure calculated based on thousands, if not millions, of game rounds.</p>
<p>Imagine you&#x2019;re playing a slot game with an RTP of 96%. This percentage indicates that over a long timeline, the game will give back 96 EUR for every 100 EUR that players put into it. However, this doesn&#x2019;t mean that if you, as an individual player, wager 100 EUR, you&#x2019;re guaranteed to receive 96 EUR back. Some players might win a jackpot, while others might get less than 96 EUR. This scenario underscores the random nature of casino games, where winning or losing primarily depends on luck.</p>
<p><b>Why RTP Matters?</b></p>
<p>Grasping the concept of RTP can substantially impact your gaming choices on platforms like <a href="https://trackingjustbit.io/d6fa265fc">JustBit</a>. Each game&#x2019;s RTP is a consideration, with a Blackjack game potentially offering over 99% RTP and certain slots offering around 95%.</p>
<p>RTP can shape your gaming approach. High RTP games might appeal to those avoiding risks, while those seeking thrill may choose lower RTP games. However, your decision shouldn&#x2019;t hinge solely on RTP. Your familiarity with the game, its enjoyment level, and volatility should also play a part.</p>
<p><b>Exploring the Exclusive Bonus Structure at Justbit</b></p>
<p>Justbit stands out with its innovative array of bonuses and promotions designed to optimize players&#x2019; potential for success.

Under the arrangement, an Ethiopian airliner was paid local currency equivalent to $100 million while Dangote Cement is said to have received a similar amount of nairas. </strong></p>
<h2>Ongoing U.S. Dollar Shortages</h2>
<p>The central bank of Ethiopia is reported to have performed a $100 million currency swap transaction with its Nigerian counterpart. Under the swap agreement, Ethiopia’s national airliner, which has been unable to repatriate funds trapped in Nigeria, took over the Nigeria cement company Dangote Cement’s profits which were similarly stuck in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>According to a local <a href="https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/35363/">report</a>, the two central banks resorted to the swap transaction because the arrangement obviates the need for U.S. dollars when settling. As suggested in the report, the arrangement is seemingly suitable for Ethiopia and Nigeria which both face ongoing shortages of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>As has been reported by Bitcoin.com News, the two countries are among several African states facing <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nigerias-rising-inflation-and-foreign-exchange-shortages-fueling-devaluation-speculation-imf-mission/">persistent</a> U.S. dollar shortages. The shortages have in turn led to the growth of the foreign exchange parallel market. Attempts to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethiopian-central-bank-restricts-the-amount-of-cash-that-should-held-by-travelers-to-and-from-the-country/">rein in</a> the parallel market by both central banks have seemingly failed to channel the flow of the greenback away from the parallel market.</p>

<p>Under the arrangement, Ethiopian Airlines, which could not retrieve about $180 million from Nigeria, will receive the local currency equivalent of $100 million from the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE). Likewise, Dangote Cement, which had over $200 million locked in Ethiopia’s financial system, would get paid nairas equivalent to $100 million by the Central Bank of Nigeria.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the unnamed sources at NBE have reportedly characterized the swap transaction as a temporary measure. Mesfin Tassew, the CEO of the Ethiopian airline, suggested that the swap agreement only applicable to the $100 million and not for the entire blocked funds.</p>

Failla called to attention the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) approval of Coinbase&#8217;s Initial Public Offering (IPO), hinting that the agency could have been more thorough. Failla expressed skepticism about the SEC&#8217;s posture that approving the Coinbase S-1 form to go public meant &#8220;nothing,&#8221; stating that the commission could have called out Coinbase&#8217;s behavior.</strong></p>
<h2>SEC v. Coinbase: Judge Failla Was Skeptical Towards Regulator&#8217;s Posture on Coinbase IPO Approval</h2>
<p>Katherine P. Failla, judge for the Southern District of New York, has called attention to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) behavior when approving the Initial Public Offering (IPO) of Coinbase to go through back in 2021. Failla hinted that the commission might have done more to signal the problems in the exchange&#8217;s business model before greenlighting its listing on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>During the pre-motion conference of the case, which took place on July 13, Failla was curious about the SEC approval of the S-1 form from Coinbase, which described its business model to the commission to be listed in public markets.</p>
<p>Failla questioned SEC attorney Peter Mancuso about this, <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/46XloV2v8raTCNRhg8XTKZ/2a13c4bec44230bc8ae30ab37c01722e/Premotion_Conference_Tr.__7.13.23_.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there some significance that I should give, or maybe there is none, to the fact that the commission issued the S-1 and didn&#8217;t say, hey, watch out, guys, you&#8217;re engaging in securities laws violations?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mancuso stated that there was &#8220;no way&#8221; that approval of an S-1 constituted a &#8220;blessing of a company&#8217;s entire business.&#8221; However, Failla pressed the subject, expressing &#8220;skepticism&#8221; towards the SEC&#8217;s stance. She declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You never could have said to them, hey, you guys need to register as a securities exchange. That was within the power of the SEC to do, was it not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Mancuso explained that he could not &#8220;really speak to that,&#8221; Failla explained that nothing stopped the commission from doing it.</p>

<h2>Further Criticism</h2>
<p>The approval of Coinbase&#8217;s public offering came up again further along in the discussion, with Sullivan &amp; Cromwell&#8217;s Steven Peikin blasting the commission&#8217;s stance, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact is, other judges have had the exact same instinct that you have had and have said, in numerous instances, the fact that the commission reviews and authorizes a registration statement is of some legal weight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The approval of Coinbase&#8217;s IPO was signaled in one of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-alleges-sec-lacks-any-powers-to-regulate-digital-asset-exchanges-in-recent-filing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filings</a> before this pre-motion conference as part of the exchange&#8217;s defense, stating that the commission allowed Coinbase&#8217;s shares &#8220;to be sold to millions of retail and institutional investors&#8221; and implying that the recent lawsuit contradicts this approval action, given that six of the twelve assets deemed to constitute securities by the commission were already listed on Coinbase&#8217;s trading platform at the time.</p>

Unlike existing zero knowledge blockchain protocols, QED has a novel state model which is horizontally scalable, meaning it is no longer limited by TPS restrictions that have previously prevented adoption of blockchain technologies in Web2 use cases such as social networks, traditional finance, and gaming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enabled by advances in fast recursive zero knowledge proofs, QED is able to achieve this scale without compromising security or decentralization and proves all transactions end-to-end using proof recursion (verifying a zero knowledge proof in a zero knowledge proof ). This process of decentralized recursive proving culminates in a single block proof which can be verified by an Ethereum smart contract, making the protocol only reliant on the Proof of Math itself, rather than an incentive based consensus system vulnerable to collusion, hacking and misaligned incentives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the first blockchain capable of serving billions of users in a single block, QED does away with the need for a zk-VM by compiling smart contract functions directly to zero knowledge circuits, making it the first zk-Native blockchain. QED’s novel approach to ZKP allows users to prove their own transactions on their own device in milliseconds, enabling a new privacy centric internet where transactions are private by default and sensitive data never has to leave a user’s device.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its announcement of the QED Protocol, Open Asset Standards unveiled QED&#8217;s official Dapen Smart Contract IDE. With Dapen, Web2 developers can write zk Smart Contracts in the world&#8217;s 2 most popular programming languages, JavaScript and Python, which have a developer market share 357 times larger than the Solidity community which only makes up a miniscule 0.1% of the world’s developers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to making blockchain accessible to more developers than ever before, Dapen has integrated support for Markdown smart contracts which allow even non-technical users to write smart contracts in English using their integration with several large language AI models (LLMs) including ChatGPT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backed by Animoca Brands&#8217; fund Sparkle Ventures whose General Partners include Sebastien Borget, Co-founder of Sandbox, and Yat Siu, Co-founder of Animoca Brands, QED is set to see major adoption within the gaming space which regularly support millions of concurrent gamers playing at once. Due to its horizontal scaling model, QED is able to add transaction processing capacity by simply adding more proving nodes to its network, allowing large scale gaming to integrate with blockchain technologies such as dynamic NFTs for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headed up by Founder and CEO Carter Feldman, a former childhood hacking prodigy and reverse engineer, the QED core team is made up of a diverse team from both Web2 tech giants and Web3 titans including Binance, reflecting the protocol&#8217;s mission to unite Web2 and Web3.</span></p>

The move indicates the regulator is preparing to seriously consider a bitcoin ETF and could eventually set the stage for wider adoption of crypto assets and products.</strong></p>
<h2>SEC Adds Blackrock’s Bitcoin ETF Application to Docket, Seeks Public Comments</h2>
<p>The U.S. securities regulator has officially accepted Blackrock’s application for a spot bitcoin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETF</a>. Once it’s published in the Federal Register, the SEC will open a 21-day window for submission of public comments on the proposal and they will be posted on its website.</p>
<p>The application’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nasdaq.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addition</a> to the SEC’s docket on Thursday marks the beginning of a long review process that will be closely followed by the crypto community and industry. Blackrock is the world’s largest asset management firm and the SEC process for its bitcoin ETF sends a signal about the future of crypto-based investment products in the United States.</p>
<p>Blackrock <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">filed</a> its application in mid-June amid an ongoing crackdown by the SEC on crypto platforms for alleged violations of U.S. securities laws through the offering of digital assets that the regulator considers unregistered securities.</p>
<p>One of the targeted companies, leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, was chosen by the asset manager to serve as custodian for its Ishares Bitcoin Trust, the assets of which consist primarily of bitcoin. Blackrock’s filing incorporates a surveillance-sharing agreement with Coinbase.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has previously denied approval of bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. on numerous occasions, citing concerns such as the risk of market manipulation and insufficient protection for investors.</p>
<p>Besides Blackrock, others that have also filed applications for spot bitcoin ETFs include Bitwise, Wisdom Tree, Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, Vaneck, Invesco, and Fidelity. Bitwise’s application was accepted earlier this week as well.</p>
<p>The number of applications, along with Blackrock’s status as a financial powerhouse, have spurred optimism in the crypto space that a bitcoin ETF will be approved in the United States, something that Canada, for example, has already done.</p>
<p>A report by the Financial Times on Thursday <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/europe-expects-its-first-bitcoin-etf-this-month-report/">unveiled</a> that Europe expects its first bitcoin ETF by the end of July. The product, which is on track to be publicly listed by Jacobi Asset Management after a year-long delay, has been authorized in the Channel island jurisdiction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernsey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guernsey</a> to avoid regulatory hurdles in the EU.</p>

The company, which uses its biometric World ID system to differentiate human beings, stated it has more than doubled the number of sign-ups since January when it reported having passed its first million.</strong></p>
<h2>Worldcoin Passes 2 Million Sign-Ups</h2>
<p>The Worldcoin project, a startup building an identity database of users as a public utility, has <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/worldocin-passes-2-million-world-id-sign-ups-demand-increases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> two million sign-ups using its World ID protocol. The company — which is backed by Openai co-founder <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/openai-boss-sam-altman-claims-hes-not-involved-in-worldcoins-day-to-day-operations-at-all/">Sam Altman</a> — reported that these sign-ups came via people registering from cities such as Barcelona, Berlin, Buenos Aires, New York, Seoul, and Tokyo, as part of the &#8220;<a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/worldcoin-orb-going-on-tour-globally" target="_blank" rel="noopener">world tour</a>&#8221; announced in May. Overall, Worldcoin is registering more than 40,000 sign-ups each week.</p>
<p>The World ID protocol requires using special hardware devices for users to register to prove their &#8220;uniqueness and humanness in a privacy-preserving way.&#8221; The device, called the Orb, reads the user&#8217;s iris using two cameras and stores a high-definition image.</p>
<p>The cities mentioned have been provided with several Orbs, allowing users to scan their irises at selected locations. Worldcoin stated that it reached two million sign-ups in less than half the time it took them to score the first <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/worldcoin-passed-1-million-sign-ups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">million</a>.</p>
<p>On reaching this milestone, Worldcoin stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Achieving 2 million World ID sign-ups is more than just an accomplishment for the Worldcoin community; it’s also a significant milestone in the broader global effort to make digitally-verifiable identity more accessible to everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worldcoin reported that, in response to the growing demand for verified World IDs, it will ramp up the availability of Orbs in the coming months. The project is still in its beta phases.</p>

<h2>Integration Growing</h2>
<p>The startup also stated its World ID protocol was being integrated into other apps, which are taking advantage of its identification database. To ease its integration tasks, Auth0, a company that provides identity and authentication services for third parties, developed a &#8220;sign in with Worldcoin&#8221; <a href="https://marketplace.auth0.com/integrations/worldcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integration plugin</a>, allowing the protocol to be used in tens of thousands of applications using Auth0&#8217;s services.</p>
<p>Also, Talent Protocol, a Web3 developer social platform, recently <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/talent-protocol-first-web3-platform-integrate-world-id-europe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it included World ID as one of the various ways of getting verified. Talent Protocol&#8217;s Pedro Oliveria stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human verification is a fundamental trust component for any builders community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worldcoin <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/worldcoin-launches-world-app-to-bolster-decentralized-identity-and-finance-for-mass-adoption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> its World App in May, designed to serve as a wallet that supports the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/worldcoin-launches-world-id-an-ai-resistant-iris-dependant-id-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World ID protocol</a> and get Worldcoin tokens, which the company intends to give as a sort of universal basic income (UBI) for verified users.</p>

<h2>Blackrock CEO Larry Fink Highlights Crypto&#8217;s &#8216;Differentiating Value&#8217;</h2>
<p>Larry Fink, the CEO and chairman of Blackrock, the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, discussed cryptocurrency in an interview with CNBC on Friday. Blackrock <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">filed</a> to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 15. While the SEC has rejected all bitcoin ETF applications so far, many are hopeful that the securities regulator will approve Blackrock’s filing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last five years, more and more global investors are asking us about the role of crypto,&#8221; the Blackrock CEO shared. &#8220;As I said, I do believe a lot of crypto is an international asset,&#8221; the executive continued, emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>It has a differentiating value versus other asset classes, but more importantly, because it’s so international it’s going to transcend any one currency and currency valuation.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If you just look at the value of our dollar — how it depreciated the last two months and how much it appreciated over the last five years — an international crypto product can really transcend that,&#8221; Fink noted. &#8220;And that&#8217;s why we believe there&#8217;s great opportunities and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re seeing more and more interest, and that interest is broad-based, worldwide.&#8221;</p>
<p>“We believe we have a responsibility to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-seeks-to-democratize-crypto-ceo-says-bitcoin-can-hedge-against-inflation-currency-devaluation/">democratize</a> investing. We’ve done a great job, and the role of ETFs in the world is transforming investing. And we’re only at the beginning of that,” Fink detailed.</p>
<p>Regarding Blackrock’s bitcoin ETF filing, Fink stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are working with our regulators because, as in any new market, if Blackrock’s name is going to be on it, we’re going to make sure that it’s safe and sound and protected.</p></blockquote>

This seems backwards to say the least,&#x201D; he stressed.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>SEC v Ripple Ruling &#x2018;Troubling on Multiple Fronts&#x2019;</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official John Reed Stark shared his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ripple-decision-cause-crypto-celebration-momentarily-best-stark/">analysis</a> of the SEC v. Ripple <a href="https://news-bitcoin-com.webpkgcache.com/doc/-/s/news.bitcoin.com/us-judge-rules-xrp-not-necessarily-a-security-on-its-face-sending-xrp-supporters-into-celebration/">ruling</a> concerning <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> on Linkedin Friday. Stark is currently president of cybersecurity firm John Reed Stark Consulting. He founded and served as chief of the SEC Office of Internet Enforcement for 11 years. He was also an SEC enforcement attorney for 15 years.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;The Ripple decision is troubling on multiple fronts,&#x201D; he stressed, adding:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>IMHO, the decision resides on shaky ground, is likely (and ripe) for appeal, will likely result in reversal and is not necessarily a cause for celebration.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
Regarding the offering of securities, the court categorized Ripple&#x2019;s <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> offering into three distinct categories: institutional sales, programmatic sales, and other sales. Each category received a separate ruling, Stark explained. Ripple Labs&#x2019; chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ripples-chief-legal-officer-breaks-down-ruling-in-sec-lawsuit-says-as-a-matter-of-law-xrp-is-not-a-security/">broke down the ruling</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The former chief of the SEC Office of Internet Enforcement detailed:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Ripple decision grants to the institutional investor full SEC protection and all remedies that go along with SEC violations, including rescission, fines, penalties, etc. However, the retail investor is not granted any SEC protection at all. This seems backwards to say the least.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
After providing a detailed analysis, Stark warned: &#x201C;My take is that the SEC will appeal the Ripple decision to the 2nd Circuit and the 2nd Circuit will overturn the district court&#x2019;s rulings related to &#x2018;programmatic&#x2019; and &#x2018;other sales.&#x2019;&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
He predicted that if the SEC does not win after the appeal, there will be &#x201C;a new crypto-iteration &#x2013; PBTs &#x2013; programmatic buyer tokens, available on your friendly neighborhood (and unregistered and unregulated) crypto-trading platform.&#x201D; According to the Ripple ruling, &#x201C;PBTs will be exempt from securities regulation because programmatical buyers don&#x2019;t read anything about the PBTs, don&#x2019;t know who their buying their PBTs from and don&#x2019;t know who is issuing the PBTs.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Stark concluded:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Ripple decision holds that the same exact token can be a security sometimes but not a security other times. And the more ignorance and willful blindness by retail investors, then the less protection the retail investors will receive. And the less disclosure about the token, then the less liability for the token issuer. That just can&#x2019;t be right.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
Last week, attorney Bryan Jacoutot similarly warned that the ruling on the SEC v. Ripple case &#x201C;rests on very shaky ground.&#x201D; Expecting an appeal, he believes that the judge <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/legal-expert-warns-victory-may-be-short-lived-for-ripple-and-xrp-says-judge-got-the-law-wrong/">got the law wrong</a>.&#13;<br />
