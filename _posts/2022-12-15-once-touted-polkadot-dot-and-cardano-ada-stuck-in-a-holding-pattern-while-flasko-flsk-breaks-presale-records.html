title: Once-Touted Polkadot (DOT) and Cardano (ADA) Stuck in a Holding Pattern, While
  Flasko (FLSK) Breaks Presale Records
tag: CryptoDaily

<p class="s3">There&rsquo;s no question that Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT) are among the most prominent tokens in the industry. Both tokens grew in stature after smart contract platforms were among the most popular investments in the last epic bull run of 2021. However, since then, the market downturn arising from the FTX fallout has seen their values hit yearly all-time lows.</p>
<p class="s3">Not surprisingly, investors are queuing up for the Flasko presale, a revolutionary alternative investment platform that analysts believe can do a 5,000% increase from its current presale price of $0.111 in the coming year.</p>
<p class="s3">Cardano (ADA) Continues on its Downward Trend</p>
<p class="s3">Cardano (ADA) Active address usage on the Cardano (ADA) network has increased dramatically by 90% daily. It has been reported that there are now over 1.2 million allocated wallets on the blockchain.</p>
<p class="s3">The price of ADA has decreased by 5% during the past week. The current price of Cardano is $0.304558. After Cardano (ADA) couldn't break its recent resistance at $0.44, analysts expected $0.32 to be the support. Still, the price of Cardano (ADA) fell further to its current $0.30 alongside the broad cryptocurrency market. Investors believe that if the price of Cardano (ADA) cannot hold the $0.30 price position, then a continuous fall would be expected. </p>
<p class="s3">Polkadot (DOT) Struggling With Extremely Bearish Market Conditions</p>
<p class="s3">Polkadot (DOT) is known for its growing development activity on its blockchain, but that hasn&rsquo;t exactly translated to Polkadot (DOT) token price increasing. It&rsquo;s a good thing to have social and dev activity as they are indicators of popularity, but Polkadot (DOT) has been slipping -2.0% over the past week. Currently, Polkadot (DOT) is trading at $5.29.</p>
<p class="s3">Daily charts show a torrid time for Polkadot (DOT) investors, as indicators pointed to prolonged bearish conditions in succeeding days. Investors may find more value in buying into projects with greater potential to make serious gains.</p>
<p class="s3">Experts Predict Flasko (FLSK) To Surge 4,000% In The Coming Months</p>
<p class="s3">Flasko is creating the first alternative investment platform combining non-fungible technology with the rare wines, whiskeys, and champagnes asset class. This allows Flasko NFT holders to take advantage of the potential of alternative investments as a hedge against inflation due to their scarcity and increasing value. </p>
<p class="s3">Flasko holders also stand to gain exclusive discounts and deals from Flasko-approved partners in the luxury beverages sector on its Flasko Launchpad. </p>
<p class="s3">With Flasko token prices available at $0.111 and widely predicted by eagle-eyed experts to do a 50x to $5 by 2023, Flasko might very well be the presale event of the season.</p>
<p class="s3">While Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT) may have some interesting action in the coming year, experts believe that Flasko will outperform both tokens in price action, considering Flasko is just about to list on Uniswap. Moreover, with its fully-audited smart contract by Solid Proof, locks on platform liquidity for 33 years, and on dev team token allocations (with another 3 years vesting), Flasko has done the necessary to secure its future success.</p>
