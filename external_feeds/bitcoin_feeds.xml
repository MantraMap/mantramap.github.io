<h2>Robert Kiyosaki on How to Tell if We&#8217;re in a Recession</h2>
<p>The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, has explained how to tell if the economy is in a recession. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.</p>
<p>Kiyosaki tweeted Thursday:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a lot of hot air about ‘Are we in a recession or not.’ The answer is simple. My rich dad said ‘If your neighbor loses his job, the economy is in a recession. You lose job, economy in depression. KISS. Keep It Super Simple. Be an entrepreneur. Never need a job.</p></blockquote>
<p>The famous author has cautioned about a recession multiple times. In January, he said, &#8220;We are in [a] global recession,&#8221; <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-we-are-in-global-recession-warns-of-soaring-bankruptcies-unemployment-homelessness/">warning</a> of soaring bankruptcies, unemployment, and homelessness. Kiyosaki has also voiced concerns about a depression. In February, he predicted that a &#8220;giant crash&#8221; is coming and a depression is possible.</p>

<p>The renowned author has advised people to buy gold, silver, and bitcoin. He believes that these three investments are the best for &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-about-stocks-bonds-mutual-funds-says-bitcoin-best-for-unstable-times/">unstable times</a>.&#8221; Last week, Kiyosaki stressed that more banks are about to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-more-banks-are-about-to-fail/">fail</a>.</p>
<p>Many people believe that the U.S. economy is headed for a recession. Economist <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-steve-hanke-warns-of-an-ugly-recession-looming-and-accuses-federal-reserve-of-directionless-policies/">Steve Hanke</a> recently predicted that an &#8220;ugly&#8221; recession is looming. Gold bug <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/peter-schiff-says-banking-crisis-not-over-much-worse-financial-crisis-incoming-warns-of-massive-recession/">Peter Schiff</a> expects a &#8220;massive&#8221; recession and a severe financial crisis. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-america-predicts-milds-recession-after-feds-tightening-action/">Bank of America</a> is bracing for a mild recession. Bloomberg Intelligence&#8217;s senior commodity strategist, Mike McGlone, stated in April that the U.S. economy is heading toward a &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/commodity-strategist-warns-us-economy-heading-toward-severe-deflationary-recession/">severe deflationary recession</a>.&#8221; <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-ceo-expects-inflation-to-persist-but-no-major-us-recession-in-2023/">Blackrock CEO Larry Fink</a>, however, sees no major U.S. recession this year.</p>

<h2>&#8216;Binance Will Regret Having Ever Filed This Motion&#8217;</h2>
<p>Former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official John Reed Stark has provided insight into the potential consequences of Binance&#8217;s recent motion against the regulator, stating that it could expedite the process of bringing criminal charges against the cryptocurrency exchange. Stark is currently president of cybersecurity firm John Reed Stark Consulting. He founded and served as chief of the SEC Office of Internet Enforcement for 11 years. He was also an SEC enforcement attorney for 15 years.</p>
<p>The former SEC official explained in a tweet Thursday that  filed a motion on Wednesday asking the judge overseeing the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/">SEC-Binance enforcement case</a> to prevent SEC attorneys from making public statements asserting that Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) “have mishandled the assets of US-based customers.”</p>
<p>The crypto exchange claimed that the securities regulator “has not presented evidence of any alleged commingling” and argued that the watchdog’s publicly stating that Binance has mishandled customer assets &#8220;risks tainting the jury pool,” Stark detailed, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>My take is that Binance will regret having ever filed this motion.</p></blockquote>
<p>While acknowledging the potential benefits of Binance&#8217;s proposal, including the possibility of prompting the SEC to exercise more caution and restraint in its statements regarding the global crypto exchange, Stark emphasized: “Using litigation as marketing theater is never recommended when there exists a criminal indictment that is being contemplated or is already filed under seal, which is, IMHO, exactly the situation with Binance.”</p>
<p>The former SEC internet enforcement chief continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>The stark reality is that Binance’s motion is provocative and Binance’s antagonistic, arrogant, accusatory and unorthodox ethics battle-cry could fan the flames of whatever Binance-related criminal prosecution is cooking and instigate criminal prosecutors to act now against Binance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stark further pointed out that in its pleadings, the SEC stated: “It has also been widely reported that Binance and Zhao are under investigation by criminal authorities in the United States.”</p>
<p>He emphasized, “This sort of statement in an SEC pleading is unusual and rare,” noting that “Normally, the SEC is silent about any sort of parallel criminal investigation, especially in its pleadings and public statements.” Stark believes that by mentioning the criminal investigation, “the SEC is obviously working with criminal prosecutors and FBI agents — and infers that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-sec-official-predicts-impending-doj-indictment-against-binance/">criminal action could be imminent</a>.”</p>

<p>Stark opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>By poking the bear and accusing the SEC staff of ethical violations and by alleging that the SEC is making misleading statements about Binance’s alleged fraud and market manipulation, Binance is essentially daring the criminal authorities to prove Binance wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>“This is not a good look for a company already entangled in dynamic and multi-faceted prosecutorial crosshairs,” he noted. The former SEC internet enforcement chief also pointed out that there are already reports that Binance is under investigation by French investigators for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/french-investigation-targets-binance-allegations-of-money-laundering-and-regulatory-violations/">alleged money laundering</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Stark urged investors to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/founder-of-sec-office-of-internet-enforcement-warns-of-upcoming-regulatory-siege-get-out-of-crypto-platforms-now/">get out of crypto platforms</a> now, warning that &#8220;crypto platforms are under a U.S. regulatory/law enforcement siege which has only just begun.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you agree with former SEC official John Reed Stark that Binance shouldn’t have filed the motion above? Let us know in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

President Nicolas Maduro backed this integration, stating that this move is part of a de-dollarization push. More than 40,000 payment terminals are being adapted to accept Mir-compliant cards.</strong></p>
<h2>Venezuela Integrates Russia&#8217;s Mir Payments System</h2>
<p>The government of Venezuela recently announced that it is integrating Mir, a Russian payments system, into its point-of-sale network, as part of a national de-dollarization push previously <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/venezuelas-president-declares-inevitable-shift-away-from-us-dollar-in-de-dollarization-push/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> by President Nicolas Maduro.</p>
<p>Calixto Ortega, president of the Central Bank of Venezuela, <a href="http://www.mppef.gob.ve/venezuela-da-pasos-solidos-en-su-integracion-al-sistema-de-pagos-mir/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that the bank had finalized the necessary steps to &#8220;be connected to the interbank messaging of the Central Bank of Russia in order to be able to communicate with Venezuelan banks and Russian banks through this system.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this first phase, more than 40,000 point-of-sale terminals will be able to interact with the Mir payments system. The Central Bank of Russia established Mir in 2017 to circumvent the sanctions that credit card providers — like Mastercard and Visa — enacted against the country in 2014.</p>
<p>Ortega stated that the goal is for 30% of the available terminals to be connected to the Mir system to accept cards issued by Russian banks, denominated in rubles, to make payments in local currency in Venezuela.</p>

<h2>International Settlements Also Contemplated</h2>
<p>President Nicolas Maduro explained that this implementation was part of the construction of a new global payments system, away from Western sanctions and the influence of the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Maduro <a href="https://twitter.com/NicolasMaduro/status/1671144948207349761" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They tried to isolate us monetarily and financially, unfairly, with blockades and criminal sanctions, however, with the incorporation into the Russian Mir Payment System, we are building financial and monetary systems of the new world.</p>

<p>In April, during a visit of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to Venezuela, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/latam-insights-argentine-peso-plunges-venezuela-and-russia-to-develop-swift-alternative-bitcoin-mining-still-paused-in-venezuela/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">communicated</a> that the two countries were working to develop an alternative to SWIFT, the standard bank interconnection system, to free Russia and Venezuela from dollar hegemony.</p>

The total credit card balance of Americans is at its highest point since the U.S. Federal Reserve began tracking the data, and current metrics indicate that Americans are using credit to mitigate inflationary pressures.</strong></p>
<h2>U.S. Consumers Rely on Credit Cards to ‘Navigate Costs Associated With Inflation’</h2>
<p>While the most recent consumer price index (CPI) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-inflation-cools-to-4-annual-rate-setting-stage-for-feds-decision-on-interest-rates/">report</a> from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates a cooling of inflation in the United States, Americans have turned to credit cards to offset the rising prices. According to a <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/struggling-credit-card-debt-millions-americans-1807550">poll</a> published by Newsweek and Redfield &amp; Wilton Strategies, which surveyed 1,500 American citizens on May 31, approximately 30% of respondents have debt ranging from $1,000 to $5,000. Among Americans aged 22-34, around 22% have accumulated over $10,000 in debt, while 21% of U.S. citizens aged 35-44 also carry the same level of debt.</p>
<p>Melissa Lambarena, a credit cards expert at Nerdwallet, stated to Newsweek that U.S. “consumers have been actively using their credit cards to navigate costs associated with inflation.” The Nerdwallet executive noted that increasing prices have caused some Americans to depend on their credit cards to meet their financial needs. According to <a href="https://www.lendingtree.com/credit-cards/credit-card-debt-statistics/">statistics</a> from Lendingtree, credit card debt has reached a record high for American consumers, citing <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc">consumer debt data</a> from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</p>
<p>“Americans’ total credit card balance is $986 billion in the first quarter of 2023, according to the latest consumer debt data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,” a Lendingtree report details. “That’s unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2022’s record number, leaving the balance the highest since the New York Fed began tracking in 1999.”</p>

<h2>American Credit Card Debt Has Risen Significantly Since Q3 2020, Credit Debt Has Surged on a Global Scale</h2>
<p>The all-time high represents a 17% increase compared to the year prior, indicating that millions of Americans are relying on credit more than ever before to cover their expenses. Credit card debt had been steadily rising until the pandemic hit, and in 2020, it significantly declined as Americans reduced their usage of these financial tools. According to Newsweek&#8217;s survey, 55% of U.S. residents express significant or moderate concerns about their ability to repay credit card debt this year. The statistics also reveal that this trend is particularly pronounced among younger age groups, specifically those aged 18-24.</p>
<p>Moreover, Americans are not the only ones relying on credit card charges to make ends meet, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_debt">multiple sources</a> indicate a global surge in credit card debt. <a href="https://balancingeverything.com/credit-card-debt-statistics/">Data</a> reveals that the United States currently holds the highest amount of credit card debt, followed by Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Conversely, Italy, Brazil, and India have comparatively lower average credit card debt. According to the Newsweek poll, certain experts suggest the necessity of &#8220;debt forgiveness&#8221; or propose that American consumers could potentially “benefit from payment holidays.’&#8221;</p>

In the past 90 days, the minimum value of BAYC NFTs has plummeted from 64 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> to just above 37 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>. Furthermore, the floor value of the Cryptopunks NFT collection has been higher than BAYC&#x2019;s since the final week of April.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>BAYC Loses Ground to Competitors in NFT Market</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The once-dominant Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) has been facing a decline in both its market dominance and overall performance for the past three months.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
While BAYC used to reign as the leading collection in terms of trade volume, as evidenced by cryptoslam.io <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/">statistics</a>, other collections have now taken the spotlight. In a recent turn of events, a collection of Bitcoin-based Ordinal NFTs surpassed BAYC in seven-day sales volume, marking a shift in the hierarchy.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-594859 size-full" title="Bored Ape Yacht Club's Market Reign Crumbles as Rivals Take Center Stage" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/weekly.jpg" alt="Bored Ape Yacht Club's Market Reign Crumbles as Rivals Take Center Stage" width="1280" height="375" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/weekly-300x88.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/weekly-1024x300.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/weekly-768x225.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/weekly.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px">&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
However, there is still a glimmer of hope for Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) as its 30-day sales volume positions it as the top collection in terms of sales. When considering all-time sales, BAYC secures the second-largest spot, just behind Axie Infinity.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Nonetheless, the impressive all-time sales volume of Cryptopunks is rapidly closing in on BAYC&#x2019;s figures. BAYC boasts overall sales amounting to $2.89 billion, while Cryptopunks&#x2019; all-time sales tally reaches a notable $2.18 billion.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-594855 size-full" title="Bored Ape Yacht Club's Market Reign Crumbles as Rivals Take Center Stage" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/floot.jpg" alt="Bored Ape Yacht Club's Market Reign Crumbles as Rivals Take Center Stage" width="1280" height="950" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/floot-300x223.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/floot-1024x760.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/floot-768x570.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/floot.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px">&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
BAYC collectors have faced a rough patch as the floor statistics of the collection took a significant hit over the past 90 days. According to <a href="https://archive.ph/eCqsx">archived data</a> from coingecko.com on June 24, BAYC&#x2019;s floor value stood at 64.2 ether on April 1, 2023.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
However, it has now dwindled to 37 ether or $70,810 based on the current <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> exchange rates. Considering the entire collection of 10,000 unique apes, the market capitalization reaches an impressive value of over $707 million. Coingecko&#x2019;s report reveals that BAYC recorded a 24-hour volume of 6,339 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>, amounting to just over $12 million.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-594857 size-full" title="Bored Ape Yacht Club's Market Reign Crumbles as Rivals Take Center Stage" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/block-1.jpg" alt="Bored Ape Yacht Club's Market Reign Crumbles as Rivals Take Center Stage" width="1280" height="425" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/block-1-300x100.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/block-1-1024x340.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/block-1-768x255.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/block-1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px">&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As of 11:07 a.m. (ET) on June 24, 2023, according to <a href="https://archive.ph/604jk">archived metrics</a> from nftpricefloor.com, Cryptopunks reign supreme with the largest floor value of 49 ether. The web portal&#x2019;s data also reveals that within a mere 24-hour period, BAYC plummeted to a low of 33 ether, showcasing the challenges faced by the collection.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Additionally, <a href="https://archive.ph/QLG0d">archived records</a> from theblock.co indicate that Cryptopunks&#x2019; floor value surpassed that of BAYC since May 5, 2023. In fact, even prior to that date, BAYC struggled to maintain its leading position, with Cryptopunks consistently taking the lead.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The waning appeal of Bored Apes in recent times remains a mystery, but new collections, including those derived from Bitcoin, have been chipping away at their sales. <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=Bored%20Ape%20Yacht%20Club&hl=en">Google Trends data</a> reflects a sharp decline in global interest in the search term &#x201C;Bored Ape Yacht Club&#x201D; over the past 12 months.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-594858 size-full" title="Bored Ape Yacht Club's Market Reign Crumbles as Rivals Take Center Stage" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gt.jpg" alt="Bored Ape Yacht Club's Market Reign Crumbles as Rivals Take Center Stage" width="1280" height="450" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gt-300x105.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gt-1024x360.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gt-768x270.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gt.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px">&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Around this very week last year, the search term reached an impressive peak score of 100 out of 100. However, the current week&#x2019;s score has plummeted to a mere 10 out of 100. Notably, according to Google Trends, the top five countries showing the most interest in searching for the term &#x201C;Bored Ape Yacht Club&#x201D; are China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Myanmar (Burma), and New Zealand.&#13;<br />

This time, we posed a different question to the most popular AI chatbots to determine the projected price of bitcoin by December 31, 2023. </strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>AI Chatbots Challenged: Predicting Bitcoin&#x2019;s Year-End Price Amidst an Uncertain Macro Landscape</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
On June 23, 2023, Bitcoin.com News leveraged six AI-powered chatbots to find out their predictions for the leading crypto asset <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> by the year&#x2019;s end. Our research utilized six of the most popular AI chatbots including Anthropic&#x2019;s Claude Instant and 4, Google&#x2019;s Bard, Openai&#x2019;s Chatgpt 3.5 and 4, and also Bing AI&#x2019;s creative mode.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
It&#x2019;s worth noting that while we recorded Chatgpt 3.5 and 4&#x2019;s answers, 3.5 would not provide an answer at all and Chatgpt 4 said it provided a &#x201C;very rough estimate and should not be relied upon for investment decisions.&#x201D; The price prediction experiment is a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ai-chatbots-weigh-in-is-bitcoin-poised-to-become-a-global-reserve-currency/">follow-up to a study</a> our news desk conducted 14 days ago on the probability of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> becoming a global reserve currency.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In this experiment, we asked all six chatbots a single question in the form of a prompt which was:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>This experiment aims to determine the price of bitcoin by the end of 2023. As an expert in the field of bitcoin and crypto assets, you will evaluate the likelihood of bitcoin&#x2019;s price at the end of 2023 and provide an explanation for your prediction. The global macroeconomic landscape remains uncertain. The current date is June 23, 2023, and bitcoin is currently trading at $30,700 per unit. There are 191 days left until the end of the year. There&#x2019;s less than 45,000 blocks until the next reward halving, expected to take place on April 20, 2024. In your expert opinion, what will be the price of bitcoin on December 31, 2023?</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
<strong>Chatgpt 3.5 answer:</strong> As an AI language model, I don&#x2019;t have access to real-time data or the ability to predict future events such as the price of bitcoin. The price of bitcoin is influenced by various factors, including market demand, investor sentiment, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic conditions. These factors can be highly unpredictable and subject to rapid change. It is advisable to consult financial experts or analysts who specialize in cryptocurrency for more accurate predictions.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<strong>Bard answer:</strong> The price of bitcoin in 2023 is a difficult question to answer, as there are many factors that could influence its value. However, based on my knowledge of the cryptocurrency market and the current macroeconomic landscape, I believe that the price of bitcoin is likely to remain volatile in 2023. Based on my analysis, I believe that the price of bitcoin on December 31, 2023, is likely to be between $30,000 and $50,000. However, it is important to note that this is just a prediction, and the actual price could be higher or lower.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The lower end of my prediction ($30,000) is based on the assumption that the global macroeconomic landscape remains uncertain and that there is a risk of a recession. The higher end of my prediction ($50,000) is based on the assumption that bitcoin continues to be adopted by institutional investors and that the next halving leads to an increase in the price of bitcoin.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<strong>Claude 4 answer:</strong> Based on the information provided and my analysis of historical bitcoin price data and market trends, I would estimate the price of 1 bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) on December 31, 2023, to be around $42,000.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Here is my rationale:&#13;</p>
<ol>&#13;</p>
<li aria-level="1">Bitcoin has historically seen strong price appreciation in the 12-18 months leading up to reward-halving events, as investors anticipate reduced supply growth. With the next halving expected in April 2024, bitcoin may see upward price pressure over the next 6-12 months.</li>
<p>&#13;</p>
<li aria-level="1">Bitcoin has seen an average of 2-3 major bull runs in each 4-year cycle, with each bull run resulting in a new all-time high. If this pattern holds, bitcoin may see 1-2 more major rallies before the end of 2023, which could drive the price up significantly from current levels.</li>
<p>&#13;</p>
<li aria-level="1">Global macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain with high inflation in many economies. Bitcoin is seen by some investors as a hedge against inflation, which could drive increased demand and price appreciation.</li>
<p>&#13;</p>
<li aria-level="1">Increased mainstream adoption of bitcoin could also drive the price higher. Companies like Tesla, Microstrategy and others adding bitcoin to their balance sheets signals increasing mainstream acceptance which historically has preceded major price rallies.</li>
<p>&#13;
</ol>
<p>&#13;<br />
Of course, there is a high degree of uncertainty and volatility in the cryptocurrency market, so the actual price at the end of 2023 could differ substantially from this estimate. But based on the factors I outlined, I think $42,000 is a reasonable prediction for the price of bitcoin on December 31, 2023.&#13;<br />

&#13;<br />
<strong>Chatgpt 4 answer:</strong> As an AI, I can&#x2019;t predict future prices, but I can provide an analysis based on historical trends and known factors.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Historically, bitcoin has often increased in price leading up to and following &#x201C;halving&#x201D; events, where the reward for mining new blocks is halved. The next halving is expected to occur in April 2024, which is after the date in question but close enough that anticipation could potentially start to affect the price by the end of 2023.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
However, bitcoin&#x2019;s price is also influenced by a wide range of other factors, including regulatory changes, market sentiment, and macroeconomic factors. Given the current price of $30,700 and the uncertain global macroeconomic landscape, it&#x2019;s difficult to predict how these factors will evolve over the next six months.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
If we assume that the price of bitcoin will follow a similar trend to previous years leading up to a halving event, it&#x2019;s possible that the price could increase. However, this is a very rough estimate and should not be relied upon for investment decisions.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<strong>Bing AI answer:</strong> As an expert in the field of bitcoin and crypto assets, I will evaluate the likelihood of bitcoin&#x2019;s price at the end of 2023 and provide an explanation for my prediction.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Based on the current and historical data, as well as the opinions of other experts and analysts, I predict that the price of bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) on December 31, 2023, will be around $40,000.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
My prediction is based on the following factors:&#13;</p>
<ul>&#13;</p>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Inflation:</strong> bitcoin is seen as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, especially in countries with high inflation rates or unstable political situations. As the global macroeconomic landscape remains uncertain, more investors may turn to bitcoin as a store of value and a medium of exchange. According to Alistair Milne, founder of Altana Digital Currency Fund, inflation is a key factor in bitcoin&#x2019;s price in 2023.</li>
<p>&#13;</p>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Halving:</strong> Bitcoin&#x2019;s supply is limited by design, and every four years, the reward for mining new blocks is halved. This creates a scarcity effect that drives up the demand and price of bitcoin. The next halving is expected to take place on April 20, 2024, which means that 2023 could be a year of accumulation and anticipation for the event. Some experts believe that the halving could trigger a massive rally in bitcoin prices next year, with predictions ranging from $250,000 to $300,000.</li>
<p>&#13;</p>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Adoption:</strong> Bitcoin&#x2019;s adoption is growing steadily, both among retail and institutional investors. More platforms, services, and products are integrating bitcoin as a payment option or an investment vehicle. For example, Blackrock, the world&#x2019;s largest asset manager, has filed for an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This could open the floodgates for more mainstream investors to access bitcoin and boost its liquidity and market capitalization. According to Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, the window to buy bitcoin before the ETF floodgates open is closing fast.</li>
<p>&#13;
</ul>

After starting the month mostly in the red, prices have strongly rebounded this past week, rising by as much as 15%. Additionally, ethereum was briefly back above the $1,900 mark. </strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) bulls once again controlled market sentiment, pushing price above the $31,000 level late on Friday night.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
After an earlier low of $29,927.28, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD moved to an intraday peak at $31,389.54 as the session matured.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This saw bitcoin climb to its highest level since June 6 last year, when price traded above the $31,400 mark.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Since reaching this peak, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has somewhat slipped, with the relative strength index (RSI) falling below a ceiling at 73.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The index now sits at a reading of 72.53, which is still deep in overbought territory, and could entice more bears to consider an entry.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
A recent crossover of the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages remains the main indicator highlighting the potential for more gains.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) briefly returned above the $1,900 level in the last 24 hours, however bulls here have been unable to sustain momentum.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD surged to a peak of $1,932.53 last night, however entering the weekend, price has since fallen back below that point.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Currently, the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency is trading at $1,888.03, which is marginally higher than Friday&#x2019;s low at $1,865.19.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
A key reason for the turbulence remains the fact that price strength has been unable to move past a ceiling at 61.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Currently ethereum&#x2019;s RSI is tracking at 59.81, however a potential upwards cross of its moving averages could be the straw that breaks the camel&#x2019;s back.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In the event that this occurs, chances of an <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> move above $2,000 will greatly increase.&#13;<br />

Luxury vehicles worth $2.7 million including a $600,000 Ferrari have been seized by law enforcement. </strong></p>
<h2>Ferrari Seized From Car Dealer</h2>
<p>Australian authorities have charged two alleged masterminds of a cryptocurrency scam that defrauded $5.5 million from two unnamed companies, a report has said. One of the men, Fabio Sa Alves, was arrested on June 16 in Sydney, and a day later, 6 luxury and classic vehicles, 11 motorcycles, cryptocurrency wallets, and designer watches were confiscated.</p>
<p>According to a local report, law enforcement agencies have seized luxury vehicles valued at $2.7 million, including a Ferrari worth $600,000 taken from a car dealer in Marrickville. Australian law enforcement said Alves used the crypto scam to steal from the two companies in 2021. His accomplice, an unnamed 67-year-old, is accused of authorizing the funds and hiding the Ferrari.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<h2>Residents Told to Deal With Approved Exchanges Only</h2>
<p>For his actions, Alves has been charged with three counts of &#8220;dishonestly obtaining financial advantage by deception&#8221; and for attempting to conceal the stolen funds. A court in Parramatta has since rejected Alves’ bail application and his next appearance is set for Aug. 24. However, Alves’ accomplice was granted bail by a court in Manly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gordon Arbinja, the Financial Crimes Squad Commander Detective Superintendent, told residents looking to invest in digital assets to work with approved crypto platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;When buying or selling crypto, make sure you use a digital currency exchange that is approved by AUSTRAC and always scrutinise all the details,&#8221; Arbinja reportedly said.</p>

The attorneys allege that the defendants received funds without undergoing any due diligence, and FTX did not obtain &#8220;equivalent value.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>FTX Pursues Legal Action to Recoup $700 Million in Suspected Fund Misuse</h2>
<p>FTX lawyers seek to <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.deb.188450/gov.uscourts.deb.188450.1679.0.pdf">claw back $700 million</a> in funds allegedly provided to K5 Global Technology, SGN Albany Capital, Mount Olympus Capital, and the founders of K5 Global, Michael Kives, and Bryan Baum. The attorneys aim to recover the funds from the defendants following reports of millions being channeled to these companies and founders in an alleged effort to amass influence.</p>
<p>The attorneys maintain that FTX co-founder <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/5-charges-temporarily-suspended-in-ftx-co-founder-sam-bankman-frieds-legal-battle/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> (SBF) sought to utilize Kives and Baum for networking purposes. According to FTX lawyers, two days following the Super Bowl, SBF “gushed about Kives’s access to celebrities and politicians,” and reportedly stated that he is &#8220;probably the most connected person I&#8217;ve ever met.&#8221; Kives, a former aide to the Clintons, is purportedly associated with numerous A-list celebrities and high-profile connections.</p>
<p>“Bankman-Fried stated that Kives and Baum were ‘something of a one-stop shop for relationships that we should utilize,’ and that they could provide ‘infinite connections,’ ‘potential unpaid partnerships with celebrities’ and ‘political relationships,’ and that they and FTX entities could ‘work together on electoral politics,’” the complaint details. The court filing adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>The FTX insiders, among others, took advantage of the FTX Group’s lack of controls and recordkeeping to perpetrate a massive fraud—lavishly spending the FTX Group’s assets on, among other things, private homes and jets, political and “charitable” contributions, and various investments. The K5 Transaction and Mount Olympus Transaction were two such investments.</p></blockquote>
<p>While FTX lawyers have filed a petition with the court to pursue the recovery of funds from the alleged K5 transactions, there are doubts about the potential outcome. “700m of the funds were transferred outside the 90-day preference window whereas only 100m were transferred within the 90 days,” an individual <a href="https://twitter.com/TheCommishhhh/status/1671948956685795345?s=20">commented</a> on Twitter regarding the court filing. “I don&#8217;t see how they get more than 100 and if this guy is really connected, he may avoid paying any of that back. I don&#8217;t think the estate will get much,” the person added.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ftx-sues-ex-clinton-aides-investment-firm-700-million-2023-06-22/">comment</a> forwarded to Reuters, a spokeswoman for K5 stated that the FTX lawsuit did not have merit. “K5 was under the impression — like many others — that SBF was completely legitimate, and that they were entering into a fair, long-term, and mutually beneficial business relationship.”</p>
