<p>Tether (USDT) Adds Bitcoin to its ReservesTether (USDT) initially launched in 2014 and is the crypto market&rsquo;s largest stablecoin ranked via market cap. Tether (USDT) was a beneficiary of the USDC depeg event as traders, users, and even whales rotated from USDC to Tether (USDT). Tether (USDT) has been doing excellent business as the FED has raised interest rates. Tether (USDT) holds billions and billions of dollars in short-dated treasury bills to back the value of Tether (USDT), which can be sold when investors want to exchange Tether (USDT) at a 1:1 ratio for dollars.As short-dated yields hit decade highs, Tether (USDT) has been clipping coupons and pocketing interest payments from the United States. Tether (USDT) has now decided to use some of this funding to buy Bitcoin (BTC), and this steady buy pressure should help markets rise. Seasoned investors realize that this buy pressure will bolster markets in general. Hence, the best strategy for high returns is to ignore Bitcoin (BTC) and focus on altcoins, especially those with solid fundamentals such as Tradecurve.&nbsp; Find out more about the Tradecurve presale here:</p>
