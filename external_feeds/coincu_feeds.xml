<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>In a recent report, the Atlanta Fed, a US Federal Reserve Bank district, emphasized Ripple&#8217;s business model.</em></li>



<li><em>The research emphasizes the increasing use of Web3 and blockchain technologies by governmental entities such as central banks.</em></li>



<li><em>It also draws attention to Project Mariana, a proof-of-concept initiative launched by the BIS.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (Atlanta Fed) has drawn attention to Ripple&#8217;s business model and how the firm utilizes XRP to address cross-border settlement demands in a study.</strong></h5>

<p>The bank <a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/-/media/documents/research/publications/policy-hub/2023/05/15/03--introduction-to-web3-with-implilcations-for-financial-services.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">considers</a> XRP to be &#8220;an international payment medium.&#8221;</p>



<p>The report focuses on the potential of Web3 and the usage of digital assets. It also drew attention to Project Mariana, a proof-of-concept created by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), Banco de France, and other financial institutions, illustrating the rising acceptance of Web3 and blockchain technology by public organizations such as central banks.</p>



<p>The Atlanta Fed article highlights Ripple and Stellar as two significant blockchain-focused startups to bring cost-effective value transfers, stressing the Mariana project&#8217;s objective of promoting more efficient cross-border settlements.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that this analysis focuses on the larger Web3 landscape rather than Ripple or XRP in particular. Moreover, the paper does not mention expressly that the Atlanta Fed intends to employ XRP for settlements.</p>

<p>Ripple&#8217;s promise of an efficient cross-border settlement mechanism has piqued the interest of many central banks. Ripple teamed with the Central Bank of Montenegro last month to help test its digital currency.</p>



<p>Ripple has <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188410-ripple-empowers-central-banks-cbdc-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> a new platform for CBDCs, allowing central banks, governments, and financial institutions to create and operate their own digital currency.</p>



<p>Institutions utilizing the platform may use XRP as a bridge currency, but it is not required. As of press time, information on the banks that had shown interest was scarce.</p>



<p>Although the US Federal Reserve has not clearly stated its goal to create a CBDC, it has continued to investigate the ramifications of doing so. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in March that the bank would require Congressional permission to create a CBDC.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Omni Network is being built to create a new direction for the modular future of Ethereum with the aim of connecting different Rollup solutions.</strong></h5>



<p>This is based on the fact that the scaling solutions, also known as Rollups, are helping the current Ethereum Layer 2 solve the Ethereum scalability problem but were not able to do the same interactions between different Rollups, leading to fragmented liquidity. Fragmentation in various L2 networks significantly reduces user experience and makes Ethereum more fragmented than ever.</p>

<p>Omni Network is a protocol that provides an EVM-compatible infrastructure layer by leveraging EigenLayer to facilitate the connection of<a href="https://news.coincu.com/189091-aztec-hybrid-zkrollup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Layer 2 rollups</a> such as Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, and Starkware… faster.</p>



<p>By integrating the Ethereum EigenLayer re-commit protocol and the Cosmos SDK into a unified platform, it aggregates Ethereum&#8217;s modular ecosystem. It enables developers to build on all Layer 2 on Ethereum to achieve security from ETH.</p>



<p>Combining the security of Ethereum with the speed and programmability of Cosmos in this way allows developers to reach more users and the users themselves to more easily access innovative new applications. Therefore, the project helps developers build and scale their applications while ensuring security without fragmenting liquidity.</p>



<p>This new design space is believed to usher in a new era of modular blockchain. As leaders in this trend, the project says it will open-source its modules to accelerate the adoption and testing of these technologies by other groups looking to build modular blockchains- their own dedicated and safe kettle.</p>

<p>For more than a decade, the crypto industry has been criticized for the slow and expensive nature of layer 1 blockchains. Over the past few years, scaling solutions, also known as rollups, have begun offering users the same open, permissionless promise of blockchains at a low cost. However, the problem is that too many aggregations will only grow when some high-profile zkEVMs start rolling out their mainnet.</p>



<p>While the intention to build these synthetic solutions is pure, Ethereum is more fractured than ever. As a result, both users and their liquidity, who used to share common ground on Ethereum layer 1, were scattered across several isolated environments. So the problem of high transaction fees is solved, but it certainly comes at the cost of fragmentation.</p>



<p>In the current context, developers who want to build dApps will only have two options:</p>



<p><strong>Option 1: Choose an independent ecosystem</strong></p>



<p>With this option, developers deploy their applications on a single chain. However, users will need to use bridges to move assets to different chains. This reduces the number of users and causes certain difficulties for new users.</p>



<p><strong>Option 2: Multi-chain</strong></p>



<p>Developers can choose to develop their applications using data transfer protocols to communicate between smart contracts on various chains. The complexity of this design model makes it easy for protocols to expose security holes.</p>



<p>Both of these options bring certain problems to projects. Recognizing that problem, Omni Network introduces a blockchain capable of interoperability and application management on all different chains. This solution helps access liquidity and users across every ecosystem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Undo the knot</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Interoperability Guaranteed by Ethereum</strong></h3>



<p>Nearly half of the funds lost in DeFi hacks originate from vulnerabilities in interoperability protocols. The design space needs to be improved, leading to fragile, insecure implementations. Omni solves this problem by re-imagining the future of the decentralized economy.</p>



<p>The future of cryptocurrency is built with Ethereum at its core. With this in mind, Omni built the most secure interoperability solution ever invented. By leveraging EigenLayer, the Omni Network can facilitate fast and rooted inexpensive communication between aggregations with security in Ethereum itself.</p>



<p>The Omni network includes validators that run both an Ethereum node and a built-in Rollup node, through which validators reset ETH and validate Rollup state updates to facilitate global interoperability.</p>



<p>Omni sets a new standard for cross-modular blockchain security. Using a reset-stake mechanism, the Omni Network is the first blockchain to achieve fully customizable features while still receiving security from Ethereum.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Programmable Interoperability</strong></h3>



<p>Omni is not only the most secure interaction solution ever created but also the most functional. By building a programmable interoperability layer, Omni will provide economically beneficial cross-rollup applications through properties such as multi-rollup liquidity pooling, compared to applications specified deployed on different networks.</p>



<p>Omni&#8217;s execution layer is EVM-compatible, implemented by Ethermint (an EVM module) on Cosmos, so developers can use their familiar Solidity tools for development. The execution layer includes a built-in functionality to access status, notifications, and applications from Total Integration, creating a seamless user access and liquidity experience.</p>



<p>By building a programmable interoperability layer, Omni will empower developers to create globally applicable applications by default, reducing the complexity of their operations. Developers.</p>



<p>Programmable interoperability will provide cross-totaling applications with a fundamental economic advantage over single applications through properties such as multiple liquidity pooling.</p>

<p>Omni Network announced on April 26 of this year that it has completed an $18 million funding round. Pantera Capital, Two Sigma Ventures, Jump Crypto, Hashed, The Spartan Group, and more participated in this funding round. Omni claims that its core technology partners include EigenLayer, the Ethereum re-commit protocol, and Arbitrum, Polygon, StarkWare, Scroll, Linea, and more, the Ethereum Layer 2 scaling network.</p>



<p>Omni will launch the Omni Network public testnet in Q3 of 2023 and plans to launch the first version of the mainnet in 2024 in collaboration with key Rollup partners such as Arbitrum, Polygon zkEVM, Scroll, ConsenSys&#8217; Linea and Starkware.</p>



<p>By taking security from ETH, Omni Network intends to reconnect the entire Ethereum ecosystem so that projects on Ethereum are no longer limited to a single Rollup, but users and liquidity can be found within the Ethereum as a whole ecosystem. The overall impact of this approach on Ethereum is to be expected.</p>



<p>Notably, the Omni network will mine Eigenlayer, a protocol built on the Ethereum network that introduces the reset of authorized Ethers on the beacon chain and from liquidity staking schemes like Lido Finance. With EigenLayer, Ethereum stakingers can help secure multiple decentralized finance protocols by resetting their staked Ether and simultaneously opting into multiple DeFi projects, thus providing pooled security.</p>



<p>Although Omni Network has yet to launch a test network, it aims to achieve a seamless and secure Rollup user experience through modularization of the core infrastructure of the application, which has attracted a lot of attention.</p>



<p>The Omni Network is in its early stages of development, and a lot of things are yet to be released to the public. In the coming weeks, the Omni networking team has announced that they will be releasing more details on how DeFi developers can benefit from the newly launched layer two interoperable infrastructure.</p>



<p>Specifically, the Omni network intends to educate users on how it derives security from Ethereum for interoperability, a new layer of programmable interoperability applications that will facilitate, and technical progress with its core aggregation partners.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SeaSwap, described as a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Sui blockchain, allowing users to trade various cryptocurrencies in a fast and secure manner, has become the latest name to cause users to lose confidence in DeFi projects as it became a vanity project after only a short time of launch.</strong></h5>

<p>SeaSwap promises to be a DEX based on the Sui blockchain, allowing users to exchange numerous cryptocurrencies quickly and securely. SeaSwap, as an automated market maker, employs a central limit order book to offer liquidity and enable users to buy and sell tokens at market rates in real-time. According to the project whitepaper, it provides additional chances for generating income via liquidity providing and staking, in addition to trading. But in reality, this is just a scam project.</p>



<p>DeFi trends continue to rise as the wave of recovery from meme coins and Ordinals is growing strongly. This leads to scammers taking advantage of platforms to perform tricks to steal user assets.</p>



<p>According to on-chain investigator ZachXBT, a crypto project named Fintoch, which purported to be sponsored by investment giant Morgan Stanley, seems to have stolen about $32 million from its members&#8217; wallets, Coincu previously <a href="https://news.coincu.com/189440-morgan-df-fintoch-scammed-with-31-6-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>. The fund guaranteed customers 1% daily income on their money. Nevertheless, platform customers have begun to allege that they are now unable to withdraw cash from Fintoch.</p>

<p>AirSwap is a decentralized peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchange that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other without the need for intermediaries or a centralized exchange. AirSwap is built on the principles of decentralization, privacy, and security.</p>



<p>The platform utilizes smart contracts to facilitate token swaps between parties. Instead of placing orders on a traditional order book, AirSwap uses a protocol called the Swap Protocol. This protocol enables users to signal their intent to trade and find counterparties through off-chain negotiation. Once the trading terms are agreed upon, the actual token transfer occurs on the Ethereum blockchain through a peer-to-peer atomic swap.</p>



<p>One of the key features of AirSwap is its focus on privacy. The platform does not require users to create accounts or provide personal information, enhancing anonymity and protecting user privacy. Additionally, AirSwap does not hold custody of user funds during the trading process, further mitigating the risk of theft or hacks.</p>



<p>AirSwap has its native ERC-20 utility token called AST, which can be used to access additional features and services within the AirSwap ecosystem. The token plays a role in signaling trade intent, creating liquidity pools, and incentivizing market makers.</p>

<p>AirSwap operates on the Ethereum blockchain and utilizes a decentralized protocol called the Swap Protocol. Here&#8217;s a step-by-step explanation of how AirSwap works:</p>



<ol>
<li>Intent to Trade: A user who wishes to trade a particular cryptocurrency token signals their intent to trade by broadcasting it off-chain. This intent is expressed by creating an order that includes the details of the desired trade, such as the token, the quantity, and any specific trading conditions.</li>



<li>Indexer: employs an Indexer, which is a distributed network that helps users discover potential counterparties for their trades. The Indexer maintains an index of available orders and facilitates the matching of buyers and sellers.</li>



<li>Order Matching: The Indexer helps connect traders who have compatible orders. It searches for the best matches based on the desired token, quantity, and trading conditions. This matching process occurs off-chain, allowing for efficient and scalable order discovery.</li>



<li>Peer-to-Peer Atomic Swap: Once a suitable match is found, the traders engage in an off-chain negotiation to agree on the terms of the trade. They can communicate directly or through any chosen communication channel. This negotiation ensures that both parties are satisfied with the trade details.</li>



<li>On-Chain Settlement: After the off-chain negotiation, the actual token transfer occurs on the Ethereum blockchain through an on-chain settlement process called a peer-to-peer atomic swap. Atomic swaps ensure that either the entire trade is executed, or none of it takes place, minimizing the risk of partial or failed transactions.</li>



<li>Token Transfer: Using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, the tokens are securely transferred from one party&#8217;s wallet to the other party&#8217;s wallet. The execution of the swap is transparent, verifiable, and irreversible once recorded on the blockchain.</li>



<li>Privacy and Security: AirSwap prioritizes user privacy and security. The platform does not require users to create accounts or provide personal information, preserving anonymity. Furthermore, AirSwap does not hold custody of user funds during the trading process, reducing the risk of theft or hacks.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Features of AirSwap</h2>



<p>AirSwap offers several features that distinguish it as a decentralized peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchange. Here are some notable features of AirSwap:</p>



<ol>
<li>Decentralized Trading: operates as a decentralized exchange, allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other without the need for intermediaries. This eliminates the reliance on centralized exchanges, reducing counterparty risk and promoting peer-to-peer transactions.</li>



<li>Swap Protocol: utilizes the Swap Protocol, a decentralized protocol for trading ERC-20 tokens. The protocol enables off-chain negotiation and on-chain settlement, providing an efficient and secure trading experience.</li>



<li>Privacy and Anonymity: prioritizes user privacy by not requiring users to create accounts or provide personal information. The platform allows users to trade while maintaining their anonymity, enhancing privacy and security.</li>



<li>Non-Custodial Model: follows a non-custodial approach, meaning that it does not hold custody of user funds during the trading process. This reduces the risk of theft or hacking since users retain control of their tokens in their personal wallets until the trade settlement occurs on the blockchain.</li>



<li>User-Friendly Interface: aims to provide a user-friendly trading experience. The platform offers an intuitive interface that simplifies the process of creating, discovering, and executing trades. This makes it accessible to both experienced traders and newcomers to the cryptocurrency space.</li>



<li>ERC-20 Token Support: primarily focuses on ERC-20 tokens, which are tokens built on the Ethereum blockchain. It supports a wide range of ERC-20 tokens, allowing users to trade various cryptocurrencies within the Ethereum ecosystem.</li>



<li>AST Token and Incentives: has its native ERC-20 utility token called AST. The AST token plays a role in signaling trade intent, creating liquidity pools, and incentivizing market makers. AST token holders can participate in governance and decision-making processes within the AirSwap ecosystem.</li>



<li>Community and Liquidity: has an active community of users and market makers who contribute to liquidity on the platform. Liquidity providers facilitate trades by offering tokens for trading, ensuring that there is sufficient depth in the market for smooth trading operations.</li>
</ol>

<li>Lower Liquidity: Compared to large centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges like AirSwap may have lower liquidity, which could result in wider bid-ask spreads and potentially impact trade execution.</li>



<li>Reliance on Ethereum Network: AirSwap operates on the Ethereum blockchain, and as such, its performance and transaction speed are dependent on the scalability and congestion of the Ethereum network. During periods of high network congestion, transactions on AirSwap may experience delays or higher fees.</li>



<li>Off-Chain Negotiation: The off-chain negotiation process used by AirSwap may introduce some complexities and require users to engage in direct communication or use additional communication channels to agree on trade terms.</li>



<li>Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. While AirSwap provides a platform for trading, users should still be aware of the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency investments and fluctuations in token prices.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">AirSwap Fees</h2>



<p>AirSwap has a unique fee structure that differs from traditional centralized exchanges. Here&#8217;s an overview of the fee components associated with using AirSwap:</p>



<ol>
<li>Trading Fees: AirSwap does not charge any direct trading fees to users. When executing a trade on AirSwap, there are no transaction fees or commissions imposed by the platform itself. This distinguishes AirSwap from many centralized exchanges that typically charge trading fees based on the transaction volume or maker-taker models.</li>



<li>Gas Fees: As AirSwap operates on the Ethereum blockchain, users are subject to gas fees. Gas fees are required to pay for the computational resources and network fees associated with executing transactions on the Ethereum network. These fees can vary depending on the congestion of the Ethereum network at the time of the transaction and the complexity of the transaction. Gas fees are paid directly to the network miners and not to AirSwap.</li>

<p>According to Wu blockchain, the Fantom network accounts for the highest proportion of Multichain&#8217;s $1.76 billion TVL, reaching 36.7%. The assets on the Fantom network are about $1.66 billion, and nearly 40% of the assets are wrapped assets of <a href="https://scan.multichain.org/#/charts/charts-home" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://scan.multichain.org/#/charts/charts-home" rel="noreferrer noopener">Multichain</a>. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Among the $1.76billion TVL of Multichain, the Fantom network accounts for the highest proportion, reaching 36.7%; the assets on the Fantom are about $1.66 billion, nearly 40% of the assets are wrapped assets of Multichain; the main stablecoin on Fantom is 191 million, USDC and 82…</p>&mdash; Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1661941653970751488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 26, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The main stablecoin on Fantom is 191 million USDC and 82 million USDT assets are issued by Multichain. Although Multichain is Fantom&#8217;s official cross-chain bridge, most chains operate normally, and there is no sign of a de-peg of USDC and USDT on Fantom.</p>



<p>Previously, a Twitter account known as &#8220;Ignas | DeFi Research&#8221; reported the rumors spreading on Twitter that the Multichain team had been arrested leading to a FUD resulting in a 5x increase in daily bridging volume. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Rumors are spreading that the Multichain team has been arrested.<br><br>The FUD resulted in a 5x increase in daily bridging volume.<br><br>What does other on-chain data reveal? <a href="https://t.co/kqmuAOUxtp" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/kqmuAOUxtp</a></p>&mdash; Ignas | DeFi Research (@DefiIgnas) <a href="https://twitter.com/DefiIgnas/status/1661720127447105537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 25, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Despite this, the bridging volumes do not show signs of panic. &#8220;An Ape&#8217;s Prologue&#8221; reported that Fantom is the most exposed to Multichain&#8217;s wrapped tokens. 35% of its TVL locked depends on these wrappers. Multichain issues 40% of non-$FTM assets ($650M) and handles 81% of Fantom&#8217;s total stablecoin MC. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After the rumors involving the Multichain team being arrested, we decided to take a look at the protocols with the highest exposure to it.<br><br>In first place comes Fantom, with 35% of its total TVL locked in it and a significant portion of the chain&#39;s assets issued by the bridge. <a href="https://t.co/ZTp6TH1bod" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/ZTp6TH1bod</a></p>&mdash; An Ape&#39;s Prologue (@apes_prologue) <a href="https://twitter.com/apes_prologue/status/1661489464798072832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 24, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Although the amount withdrawn was larger than deposited by $18M, it is only 1% of its total TVL of $1.78B USD. Not much panic was seen.</p>



<p>Fantom should have experienced a significant outflow of TVL due to its reliance on Multichain. Although TVL has dropped by 9.55% in USD, adjusting for the price of FTM, the data shows no significant outflow of capital. The clearest sign of panic is the Multichain LPs on Fantom. </p>



<p>A total of $33M USD has been withdrawn by LPs from Fantom, with only $1.7M in deposits. Multichain reported that &#8220;some of the cross-chain routes are unavailable due to force majeure&#8221; and that Kava, zkSync, and Polygon zkEVM routes were temporarily suspended. Eighty-three transactions were pending for more than a day.</p>

<p>It is important to note that on-chain data does not reveal a massive capital outflow. However, the lack of communication from the team is worrying. The current Multichain CEO, Zhaojun, hasn&#8217;t been online in a week. </p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Since its launch, Blend has captured the NFT lending market share of the entire market.</em></li>



<li><em>Its contract is already the third largest holder of &#8220;Fat Penguin&#8221; Pudgy Penguins NFT.</em></li>



<li><em>The volume on all NFT lending platforms right now is $375 million, so Blend alone has an 82% market share.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Blend&#8217;s attraction may be driving the stagnating capital inflow into the NFT segment, which is still the dominant platform in the market at the moment.</strong></h5>

<p>According to data disclosed by Alex Svanevik, CEO of blockchain analysis company Nansen, the current Blur lending (Blend) contract is already the third largest holder of &#8220;Fat Penguin&#8221; Pudgy Penguins NFT. A total of 60 Pudgy Penguins NFTs are held in this contract, second only to &#8220;Metadrop: Wrapped Penguins&#8221; (82) and &#8220;Big Brain Holdings&#8221; (68).</p>

<p>On-chain data analysis from <a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/blur-dominates-82-of-the-nft-lending-market" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DappRadar</a> shows that NFT marketplace Blur&#8217;s lending platform Blend has <a href="https://news.coincu.com/190034-blend-surges-from-4200-to-169900-eth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">amassed</a> 169,900 ETH, equal to $308 million in loan volume, in the first 22 days after its inception. Blend now has an 82% market share on all NFT lending platforms, with a volume of $375 million.</p>



<p>Blend, as stated by the development team, is a lending solution that enables NFT holders to use their assets as collateral to borrow ETH from others. Blend, in particular, will link borrowers and lenders in a peer-to-peer model.</p>



<p>Blend has announced loan funding for a number of popular NFT projects, including Pudgy Penguins, Clone X, Otherdeeds, Bored Ape Kennel Club, Kanpai Pandas, and Redacted Remilio Babies.</p>



<p>Blur is a fast-growing rival to OpenSea and the world&#8217;s largest NFT exchange and aggregator. Even before the new Blend, Blur discovered ways to break away from typical NFT exchange trading techniques and spearheaded a paradigm shift with its order book function, vastly boosting convenience for NFT traders.</p>



<p>Not only that, the total value locked on the platform has reached a new high with over $26.5 million, which is a significant step forward for the fledgling NFT lending protocol.</p>

<p>Although Blend is growing strongly, it still comes with concerns because of the way the volume spike it brings, creating an unstable market and difficult to determine price movements.</p>



<p>Moreover, the issue of wash trading on Blur is still a hot topic. The DappRadar report notes that the above $19 million has been identified as wash trading in the past week alone. The exchange itself also had a grand launch with &#8220;huge&#8221; airdrops, but attracted most of the platform just for &#8220;interactive farming&#8221;, causing many people to question the real quality of the exchange.</p>

<p>FUDs continued to erupt after the failure of this bridge as some users noted the slowness of Multichain cross-chain transfers. The team explained that the main reason was due to the back-end side of the project.</p>



<p>On May 23, the project announced that the bridge was not available for some chains. The project is upgrading and repairing but the completion time has not been determined, the affected people will be compensated. But up to now the user money has not been paid. Some of the affected routes are Kava, zkSync &amp; Polygon zkEVM. However, most other remittance routes are still operating normally.</p>



<p>As mentioned in the previous Coincu News article, yesterday there were rumors that the CEO and CEO of Multichain, Zhao Jun, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/189724-multichain-co-founder-ceo-zhao-jun-missing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had suddenly disappeared</a> and cut off all communication. However, on May 24, his Twitter account was still active when he shared a project plan.</p>

<p>Then, there were rumors that the Multichain team in China had been arrested by the authorities, and this information caused a stir on Twitter on the evening of May 24. Thereby, according to a Chinese source, the project team was arrested and the project&#8217;s cold wallet with $1.5 billion in assets is being controlled.</p>

<p>Before the questions raised, the project&#8217;s silence was the reason why many partners and investors decided to get out of this deep hole.</p>



<p>Lookonchain has detected the transfer of MULTI tokens to the Gate exchange by whale wallets. In addition, Fantom Foundation also had a strange move when withdrawing $ 2.4 million worth of MULTI tokens from the liquidity pool on SushiSwap.</p>

<p>The most recent outrage in the community was caused by a tweet from self-proclaimed crypto market investigator @BoringSleuth, which <a href="https://twitter.com/BoringSleuth/status/1661808784291889159" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> the probable foundation for a rug-pull. According to @BoringSleuth, Multichain now houses up to $1.8 billion in various digital currencies split across many networks.</p>



<p>The detective believes that if Multichain makes a move to take away all of the cash, which seems to be the case, the market&#8217;s devastating impact may be reversing.</p>



<p>Multichain previously stated that the majority of the Multichain protocol&#8217;s cross-chain routes are operational, but certain cross-chain routes are inaccessible due to force majeure, and the time to restore service is unclear. Customers complained that cash had been blocked in the bridge for many hours. The team reached an agreement to reimburse users for their losses.</p>



<p>The protocol vowed to reimburse customers for any losses incurred as a result of the incident, which community members think will not be maintained.</p>

<p>With the realization that the sector has seen countless scams and rug pulls, exchanges began taking the necessary safeguards to protect investors. Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange, <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1661649462387957760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took</a> one of the most aggressive measures in this situation by temporarily suspending deposits for bridging tokens associated with Multichain. The exchange may resume deposits only after receiving confirmation from the Multichain team.</p>



<p>But, @BoringSleuth is still <a href="https://twitter.com/BoringSleuth/status/1661848938280886277" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suspicious</a> about numerous prior rugs, as well as Binance.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;There are rumors of an arrest &amp; some bridges are no longer working. I&#8217;m most suspicious though because of previous work I had done where they came, and stayed on my radar due to their teams connections to several previous rugs, and Binance.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On SushiSwap, Fantom Foundation <a href="https://twitter.com/apes_prologue/status/1661489464798072832" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spent</a> $2.4 million of the protocol&#8217;s native MULTI tokens. HashKey Group sent $250,000 to cryptocurrency exchange Gate.io, while Tron creator Justin Sun transferred 470,000 USDD stablecoin. The absence of Multichain cross-chain routes has the greatest impact on Fantom Foundation, followed by BSC and Optimist.</p>

<p>The constantly evolving world of cryptocurrency has once again caught the public&#8217;s attention with recent developments reported by on-chain sleuth ZachXBT. One of the most notable events was when Ben.eth quote tweeted a phishing scam that caused his followers to lose around $170k. This incident has highlighted the importance of being vigilant and cautious when dealing with cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Another significant development was when 26 ETH was sent to the address involved in the andy8052 SIM swap and swatting attack last month. This event highlights the need for heightened security measures in the crypto world to protect users from malicious attacks.</p>

<p>A week ago, Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188281-bitboy-crypto-betrays-community-swapped/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/188281-bitboy-crypto-betrays-community-swapped/" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported </a>that BitBoy Crypto, a popular digital currency YouTuber had sold all his BEN token holdings, according to ScopeProtocol. He had promised his community he would lock the fan tokens for six months, but the tokens were dumped just six days after the promise was made.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Lookonchain reported that two Machi Big Brother addresses spent 1,442 ETH ($2.6M) on buying 9.42M JIMBO at an average price of $0.2763, which is 14.1% of the total supply.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>On May 17th, Machi Big Brother purchased 9.96M JIMBO V1 with 823 ETH ($1.5M). However, due to contract issues, Machi Big Brother sold all of JIMBO V1 for 742 ETH ($1.35M) after V2 was launched, losing 81 ETH ($152K).</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether Machi Big Brother is very bullish on Jimbos Protocol or if there is a partnership, or if Machi Big Brother is one of the founders.</p>
