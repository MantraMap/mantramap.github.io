<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>US lawmakers, Gus Bilirakis, and Jan Schakowsky, initiate a bipartisan inquiry into Apple&#8217;s App Store crypto policies.</em></li>



<li><em>Concerns were </em>raised over the <em>potential restriction of blockchain and NFT technologies, threatening US tech industry leadership.</em></li>



<li><em>Coinbase&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer and Blockchain Association CEO support the investigation, seeking clarity on the impact of guidelines on crypto-related applications.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a significant move, two US lawmakers, Republican Congressman Gus Bilirakis and Democratic Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, have jointly <a href="https://bilirakis.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/bilirakis.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/23.07.28-apple-app-store-blockchain-letter_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">addressed</a> a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook, expressing concerns about the App Store&#8217;s restrictive policies regarding cryptocurrency-related applications.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2233-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2233-1024x576.png" alt="U.S. Lawmakers Question Apple About App Store’s Restrictive Crypto Policies" class="wp-image-207122" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2233-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2233-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2233-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2233-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2233-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2233.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="US Lawmakers Challenge Apple&#039;s Crypto App Store Policies 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>The bipartisan initiative aims to seek clarity on how the guidelines may be influencing emerging technologies like blockchain and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), potentially hindering the progress of the United States in this rapidly evolving field.</p>



<p>Representative Bilirakis and Congresswoman Schakowsky, who also hold positions as Chairman and Ranking Member of the Innovation, Data, and Commerce Subcommittee, raised doubts about the tech giant&#8217;s intentions with regard to these emerging technologies. They suspect that the guidelines may inadvertently be used to suppress innovations in the blockchain and NFT space, which could have adverse effects on the country&#8217;s leadership in the tech industry.</p>



<p>The letter to Tim Cook specifically calls for transparency and requests documents relating to Apple&#8217;s policies concerning its <a href="https://coincu.com/205598-apple-store-appears-scam-program-users-beware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iOS App Store</a>. The lawmakers emphasize the importance of supporting and fostering blockchain, NFTs, and other distributed ledger technologies to ensure the continued growth of the US technology sector.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2232.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2232-1024x576.png" alt="U.S. Lawmakers Question Apple About App Store’s Restrictive Crypto Policies" class="wp-image-207121" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2232-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2232-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2232-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2232-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2232-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2232-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2232.png 1960w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="US Lawmakers Challenge Apple&#039;s Crypto App Store Policies 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>In addition to seeking information about Apple&#8217;s approach to these technologies, the letter poses questions about the company&#8217;s own plans to develop apps utilizing blockchain technology. The lawmakers are also troubled by the possibility that Apple&#8217;s App Store policies might be prioritizing the company&#8217;s revenue over the interests of cryptocurrency-related applications.</p>



<p>Bilirakis and Schakowsky stressed the significance of understanding the App Store Guidelines fully and evaluating how they might impact innovation and America&#8217;s position as a technology leader.</p>



<p>In response to the inquiry, Apple has been given a deadline of August 14 to provide comprehensive answers to the lawmakers&#8217; questions and concerns regarding their crypto policies.</p>



<p>The bipartisan effort has garnered support from notable figures in the cryptocurrency industry. Coinbase&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, <a href="https://coincu.com/197845-coinbases-clo-criticizes-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Grewal</a>, commended the initiative, expressing approval of the lawmakers&#8217; move to seek clarity on the matter. Similarly, Kristin Smith, the Chief Executive of the crypto advocacy group Blockchain Association, welcomed the inquiry as a step towards ensuring fair treatment of blockchain and cryptocurrency applications on the App Store.</p>



<p>The ongoing scrutiny of Apple&#8217;s App Store policies comes in the wake of recent controversies surrounding the removal of certain cryptocurrency-related applications.</p>



<p>Last month, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong <a href="https://coincu.com/198327-coinbase-ceo-criticizes-apple-damus-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticized</a> the removal of the app &#8220;Damus&#8221; from the App Store, considering it disrespectful to users and damaging to the brand&#8217;s reputation. <a href="https://coincu.com/198033-damus-founder-banned-from-apple-app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The founder of Damus</a> has vowed to appeal the removal, citing the abuse and misapplication of Apple&#8217;s rules.</p>

<p>As the bipartisan inquiry unfolds, the tech industry, cryptocurrency advocates, and stakeholders eagerly await Apple&#8217;s response, hoping for a clearer understanding of the company&#8217;s stance on blockchain, NFTs, and other emerging technologies. The outcome of this inquiry may play a crucial role in shaping the future of cryptocurrency-related applications on the App Store and their potential impact on technological advancement in the United States.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The new cryptocurrency Worldcoin has sparked immense interest among Kenyans, as the platform rewards users with free WLD tokens in exchange for verifying their humanity through retinal scans, according to <em><a href="https://nation.africa/kenya/news/kenyans-scanning-their-eyeballs-worldcoin-cryptocurrency-tokens-4319600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Nation</a></em>.</strong></h5>

<p>Launched just five days ago on Monday, July 24, the <a href="https://coincu.com/207022-worldcoin-security-audit-reports-92-6-fixed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worldcoin</a> app utilizes special machines, known as Orbs, stationed in 35 countries, including Kenya, to perform the eye-scanning verification process.</p>



<p>The allure of receiving free tokens has drawn a surge of young people to at least 13 Quickmart Outlets in Nairobi, where these Orb devices are located. Eager participants can scan their eyeballs, and upon successful verification, they are rewarded with WLD tokens. These tokens can then be transferred to popular crypto exchanges, such as Binance, and used to purchase various other cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>The value of the first 25 WLD tokens stands at around Sh7,786 ($55), offering early adopters a tangible incentive to participate in the scheme. James Makau, a bodaboda driver from Ruaka, shared his success story, having earned Sh6,461 ($45.6) from scanning his iris and subsequently converting his tokens into Kenyan shillings by trading them for USDT, a different cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Worldcoin, co-founded by <a href="https://coincu.com/187287-openai-founder-sam-altman-raise-100-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Altman</a>, the CEO of OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT&#8217;s artificial intelligence platform, has ambitious goals. Their mission is to grant global market access to everyone by providing a verified digital ID, free crypto tokens, and a cryptocurrency wallet. According to their whitepaper, Worldcoin aims to create an inclusive digital currency accessible to people worldwide, regardless of their socio-economic status.</p>



<p>Despite the promising prospects, concerns loom over the true implications of this novel approach to identity verification. Worldcoin&#8217;s founders, Altman and Blania, caution that the journey will be challenging, and uncertainties remain in the outcome. To encourage widespread adoption, participants receive a few WLD tokens as compensation for their involvement, with the exception of the United States, where regulatory scrutiny has made this option unavailable.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1-1024x576.jpeg" alt="Worldcoin Sparks Frenzy In Kenya: Free Tokens for Eye-Scanning Verification" class="wp-image-207118" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1-750x422.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1-1140x641.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FxeCOcqWIAE8Gzy-1.jpeg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Worldcoin Sparks Frenzy In Kenya: Free Tokens for Eye-Scanning Verification 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>The core concept behind Worldcoin&#8217;s iris scanning system is to establish a trustless digital identity to combat the growing capabilities of AI and robots to imitate real humans. The free tokens, in addition to potentially granting voting rights within the platform, are intended to facilitate the cryptocurrency&#8217;s adoption on a global scale.</p>



<p>However, the initial performance of the <a href="https://coincu.com/206599-worldcoin-circulating-supply-111-million-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WLD</a> token has been volatile, with its value doubling shortly after launch but subsequently experiencing a sharp 90% drop. Moreover, the project faces challenges raised by the UK&#8217;s data regulator. The regulator emphasizes the importance of users being able to withdraw consent &#8220;without detriment,&#8221; a challenge given the immutability of blockchain technology, which stores data permanently.</p>

<p>Questions have also been raised by prominent figures in the crypto community, including Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and Ethereum&#8217;s Vitalik Buterin, further adding to the scrutiny. Notably, Worldcoin has garnered significant support from various venture capital investors, such as Reid Hoffman, Andreessen Horowitz, and Coinfund, among others. Presently, 107 million WLD tokens are in circulation, with a notable concentration held by a limited number of entities.</p>



<p>As the excitement around Worldcoin grows in Kenya, the Office of Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) has issued a warning urging caution. The ODPC advises Kenyans against sharing sensitive personal data until they have been provided with sufficient information regarding how their data will be utilized within the platform.</p>



<p>Worldcoin&#8217;s innovative approach to digital identity verification and its incentivization with free WLD tokens have piqued the curiosity of many Kenyans. However, the venture faces challenges and scrutiny over data privacy and the volatility of its cryptocurrency. As the project evolves, careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits will be vital in shaping the future of this ambitious cryptocurrency initiative.</p>

<p>Speaking on the Unchained podcast with host Laura Shin, Torres <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ocDx7zI0uc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused</a> the <a href="https://coincu.com/206974-sec-and-binance-unite-to-thwart-eeon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a>, led by Chairman Gary Gensler, of employing a &#8220;regulation by enforcement&#8221; approach towards crypto innovators. He argued that the actions taken by the SEC under Gensler&#8217;s leadership seemed arbitrary and capricious, asserting that the agency had declared war on the entire crypto industry instead of solely focusing on bad actors.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2218.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="700" height="466" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2218.png" alt="Ritchie Torres Takes On SEC: Advocates for New Crypto Laws and Bipartisan Support" class="wp-image-207094" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2218.png 700w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2218-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" title="Ritchie Torres Takes On SEC: Advocates For New Crypto Laws And Bipartisan Support 9"></a></figure></div>


<p>In alignment with his concerns about the SEC&#8217;s regulatory approach, Torres voiced his support for the recently advanced market structure bill, known as the Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT) for the 21st Century Act. According to Torres, the FIT Act aims to clarify which crypto assets fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC. The bill proposes that the SEC would have authority over a crypto asset until it can be demonstrated that the asset is sufficiently decentralized. Once proven decentralized, the asset would then be categorized as a commodity and would be governed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>



<p>On July 26, the House Financial Services Committee voted in favor of the FIT Act, with Torres being among the lawmakers supporting the bill.</p>



<p>Additionally, Torres threw his weight behind another bill intended to regulate stablecoins and ensure that these assets are fully backed by reserves. He referred to stablecoins as &#8220;the clearest usage case of crypto&#8221; and expressed his approval for giving stablecoin issuers the option to comply with either federal regulations or state regulations, such as New York&#8217;s BitLicense.</p>



<p>However, it was reported on July 27 that the stablecoin bill <a href="https://coincu.com/206573-house-lawmakers-locked-in-battle-stablecoins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed</a> to reach a bipartisan agreement, despite Torres&#8217; endorsement.</p>



<p>Undeterred by the setback, Torres remained optimistic about the future of both bills. He revealed that the market structure bill received six Democratic votes, and he expected even more support for the stablecoin bill. Nonetheless, he acknowledged that the bill&#8217;s progress might be hindered if it fails to gain the support of Rep. Maxine Waters, the ranking member.</p>

<p>Responding to claims that Democratic party members were largely opposed to cryptocurrency development, Torres highlighted that recent cryptocurrency legislation had enjoyed bipartisan backing. He also noted that younger lawmakers appeared to be more open to crypto, while Republicans tended to embrace the crypto industry, possibly due to the party&#8217;s pro-business stance.</p>



<p>Previously, Torres had <a href="https://coincu.com/203714-ritchie-torres-urges-sec-to-rethink-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">penned</a> a letter to Gensler, urging the agency to reassess its regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies. This letter was prompted by a legal setback for the SEC in a case involving <a href="https://coincu.com/206896-ripple-prominent-attorney-to-withdrawal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple</a>, where a federal judge ruled that certain digital-asset transactions did not fall within the agency&#8217;s regulatory scope. Torres used this ruling as evidence to argue that cryptocurrencies themselves were not securities but could be included in investment contracts qualifying as securities.</p>

<p>The surge in minting activity and fee income showcases the Bitcoin NFT protocol&#8217;s robustness and scalability, capable of handling a vast number of transactions with efficiency and security. The protocol&#8217;s ability to process such a significant volume of mintings is a testament to the underlying blockchain&#8217;s strength and the community&#8217;s trust in the platform.</p>

<p>NFTs have emerged as a transformative force in the art, gaming, and entertainment industries, enabling creators to tokenize and sell their work directly to collectors without intermediaries. This decentralized approach empowers artists and content creators, allowing them to retain more control over their creations and receive fair compensation for their artistry.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Alameda Research seeks support from GBTC shareholders in a lawsuit against Grayscale and DCG.</em></li>



<li><em>The lawsuit alleges share redemption prevention and excessive fees.</em></li>



<li><em>Grayscale faces legal pressure amid wider GBTC discount.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In an ongoing legal battle, Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency investment firm that is currently facing bankruptcy, is <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/661579480/Motion-for-a-One-Week-Extension" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calling</a> on shareholders holding at least 10% of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to participate in its lawsuit against Grayscale Investments and its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG).</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2209-1024x683.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2209-1024x683.png" alt="Alameda Urges GBTC Shareholders Holding At Least 10% To Join Lawsuit Against Grayscale" class="wp-image-207071" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2209-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2209-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2209-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2209-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2209.png 1098w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Alameda Urges GBTC Shareholders Holding At Least 10% To Join Lawsuit Against Grayscale 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>The initial lawsuit was filed by <a href="https://coincu.com/204571-former-alameda-co-ceo-admits-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alameda</a> against Grayscale in March, accusing the crypto investment management company of preventing shareholders from redeeming Bitcoin and Ethereum trust shares and imposing excessive management fees.</p>



<p>Now, Alameda has revealed its intention to file an amended complaint against <a href="https://coincu.com/206678-grayscale-sec-concurrent-approval-bitcoin-etfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grayscale</a>, aiming to add additional plaintiffs who own a minimum of 10% of the outstanding shares of GBTC. The firm is in talks with several GBTC shareholders who are willing to join as co-plaintiffs, but an additional five days have been requested to confirm their participation and contribute to the amended complaints.</p>



<p>Recently, Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey <a href="https://twitter.com/davidfbailey/status/1684725681828028416" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">urged</a> GBTC shareholders to register on RedeemGBTC.com and become part of the lawsuit, emphasizing that the outcome would affect all shareholders and determine their position as investors or hostages in the dispute.</p>



<p>The initial lawsuit by Alameda Research <a href="https://coincu.com/171897-ftx-alameda-sues-gray-scale-dcg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused</a> Grayscale of enriching itself at the expense of shareholders due to its high fees and refusal to allow share redemptions from its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and Grayscale Ethereum Trust. The legal pressure adds to the challenges faced by DCG after its unit, Genesis Global Trading, experienced bankruptcy following the crypto market downturn.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2208.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="931" height="523" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2208.png" alt="Alameda Urges GBTC Shareholders Holding At Least 10% To Join Lawsuit Against Grayscale" class="wp-image-207070" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2208.png 931w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2208-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2208-768x431.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2208-750x421.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 931px) 100vw, 931px" title="Alameda Urges GBTC Shareholders Holding At Least 10% To Join Lawsuit Against Grayscale 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>Notably, last year, Grayscale <a href="https://coincu.com/201403-grayscale-opposes-sec-approval/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued</a> the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when the regulator rejected the company&#8217;s proposal to convert GBTC into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Despite this, Grayscale continues to impose fees much higher than those typically paid to advisers on crypto-tied ETFs, as alleged by Alameda Research, causing significant financial harm to the firm.</p>



<p>In May, Grayscale sought to dismiss Alameda&#8217;s lawsuit, arguing that such allegations could only be brought by at least two unaffiliated shareholders owning a minimum of 10% of the Trusts&#8217; shares.</p>



<p>As the legal dispute unfolds, GBTC&#8217;s discount to its net asset value (NAV) has recently <a href="https://ycharts.com/companies/GBTC/discount_or_premium_to_nav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">widened</a> to 30.11%, after a period of narrowing earlier in the month. Grayscale is currently embroiled in a separate legal battle with the SEC over the approval of its plan to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. The outcome of these legal proceedings could have significant implications for both Grayscale and GBTC shareholders.</p>

<li><em>Hester Peirce SEC commissioner expresses concerns over non-audit work for crypto firms.</em></li>



<li><em>Crypto firms fear lack of transparency due to SEC statement discouraging non-audit work by accounting firms.</em></li>



<li><em>Accounting firms urged to adopt all-or-nothing approach to engagements with crypto firms to prevent a lack of transparency for investors.</em></li>

<p>Pierce believes that the statement might discourage sincere efforts by crypto firms due to fear, as they might refrain from providing transparency regarding proof of reserves.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Crypto platforms &amp;  their accountants should be clear about what proof of reserves is and isn&#39;t &amp; customers should understand the limitations, but why would we want to discourage good-faith efforts to provide more transparency? <a href="https://t.co/fsuxUGPrrb" target="_blank">https://t.co/fsuxUGPrrb</a></p>&mdash; Hester Peirce (@HesterPeirce) <a href="https://twitter.com/HesterPeirce/status/1684689141789798400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 27, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>While Pierce noted that crypto firms and accountants should ensure transparency regarding proof of reserves, specifying what is and isn&#8217;t acceptable, she questioned why accounting firms should be cautious of providing assurance work to crypto firms. She believes that discouraging good-faith efforts to provide transparency is not an ideal approach to regulate the crypto industry.</p>

<p>Munter suggested that accounting firms adopt an all-or-nothing approach to engagements with crypto firms, as partial engagements might result in crypto firms selectively choosing only certain aspects of the business to show accounting firms and then presenting that information as a full audit to clients. Munter believes that such an approach will lack transparency for investors.</p>



<p>According to Munter, if an accounting firm discovers that a client is making misleading statements about its non-audit work to the public, it should take a firm stance and consider making a &#8220;noisy withdrawal, disassociating itself from the client, including by way of its own public statements,&#8221; or report the firm to the SEC.</p>



<p>Mike Shaub, an auditing and accounting ethics professor at Texas A&amp;M University, commented on the statement in a July 29 tweet. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It seems likely they would in virtually every circumstance.

<p>He stated that auditors are bound by confidentiality, which makes it difficult to make public statements as Munter suggested. Shaub also highlighted the issue of some accounting firms aligning themselves with cryptocurrency expertise to boost their reputation but becoming unresponsive when problems surface. Overall, it is important to balance transparency and confidentiality while regulating the crypto industry.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Figure Technologies lays off 90 employees ahead of IPO.</em></li>



<li><em>The lending business shows strong financial performance.</em></li>



<li><em>The company remains optimistic about future prospects.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Blockchain-powered fintech start-up Figure Technologies Inc. has made significant strides in its financial performance despite facing challenges in the crypto industry. According to documents reviewed by <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-28/mike-cagney-s-figure-lays-off-20-of-staff-amid-ipo-plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>, the company recently laid off 90 employees, approximately 20% of its workforce, as it gears up for a planned initial public offering (IPO) for its lending business next year.</strong></h5>

<p>Figure Technologies was co-founded by Mike Cagney, the former CEO of Social Finance Inc. (SoFi), with the vision of leveraging <a href="https://coincu.com/205617-us-gao-urges-stronger-oversight-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blockchain technology</a> to create innovative financial products. Like many other crypto-related start-ups, Figure had experienced talent loss and funding difficulties during an industry downturn.</p>



<p>However, the company&#8217;s financial milestones present a promising outlook. During the second quarter of the current year, Figure&#8217;s lending business achieved a record volume of $900 million. Additionally, the company reported $83.5 million in revenue in the first half of the year and generated $2.7 million in adjusted profit during the second quarter. According to a letter from Cagney to Figure investors and partners, the lending business demonstrated profitability with a more than 50% contribution margin.</p>



<p>Encouraged by the impressive performance, Figure is now looking to take its lending division, known as &#8220;LendCo,&#8221; public in early 2024. Cagney expressed optimism about achieving a $2.5 billion valuation for LendCo during the IPO, which would surpass the company&#8217;s last valuation of $3.2 billion in a venture-backed funding round in 2021.</p>



<p>Despite the positive developments, the recent layoffs raised concerns among some employees due to their timing. The meeting held to address these job cuts saw several inquiries considered too sensitive to address directly, according to documentation of the event. Approximately half of the laid-off employees were engineers.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>In response to the layoffs, Senior Vice President of Engineering, Matt Conroy, sent a message on an internal Slack channel, urging remaining employees to be understanding of the company&#8217;s leadership. Conroy emphasized the bright future ahead, pointing to the strong performance during the first half of 2023 and ambitious goals for 2024. These goals include the planned IPO for LendCo and a potential IPO for their Markets business and other products.</p>



<p>In light of the tough market conditions earlier in the year, Figure Technologies is also seeking fresh funds to navigate through challenges. Reports suggest that the US-based fintech is actively searching for investors to raise up to $100 million. Additionally, the company is exploring the possibility of spinning off some of its businesses.</p>



<p>Figure Technologies employs its Provenance Blockchain to develop traditional financial services, such as lending and payments. While the company faced setbacks in previous attempts to raise funds and go public, the recent financial successes and strategic plans indicate a determined effort to thrive in the market.</p>



<p>Looking forward, remaining team members may be reassigned to new product groups in the coming weeks as Figure Technologies continues its journey toward growth and financial stability in the ever-evolving fintech landscape.</p>

<p>The bank aims to leverage the innovative Ripple Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) platform to tokenize properties and facilitate faster loan issuance using digital Hong Kong dollars. This move signals a major step towards modernizing the real estate industry and embracing the potential of blockchain technology.</p>



<p>Real estate tokenization involves converting the ownership of physical properties into digital tokens on a blockchain network. This process offers several advantages, such as increased liquidity, fractional ownership, and easier transferability. By utilizing the Ripple CBDC platform, Fubon Bank seeks to streamline the entire tokenization process and expedite property transactions.</p>

By incorporating CBDCs in the real estate market, the bank aims to eliminate traditional barriers to property investments and offer increased accessibility to potential buyers and investors.</p>



<p>During the third quarter testing phase, Fubon Bank plans to tokenize select properties from its portfolio, making them available for investment through digital Hong Kong dollars. Interested parties can acquire fractional ownership in these properties, allowing them to participate in the real estate market with smaller investment amounts.</p>

<p>One of the key advantages of the Ripple CBDC platform is its ability to provide instant settlement for transactions.

This improvement in efficiency will not only benefit customers but also enhance the bank&#8217;s overall operational performance.</p>

<p>Worldcoin published a security audit report on its official blog that starting April 2023, audit firms Nethermind and Least Authority conducted two independent security audits of the protocol.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Among them, Nethermind focused on examining the smart contract of the agreement and found a total of 26 issues. Of these, 92.6% were fixed after the verification phase, one bug was mitigated, and the other was confirmed.</p>



<p>The Least Authority focused on examining the cryptographic usage of the protocol, found three problems, and made six recommendations. All issues are &#8220;solved or planned to be solved.&#8221;</p>

<p>Worldcoin first surfaced in 2021 when it announced that it would give away free tokens to any user who verified their humanity, which they could do by scanning their irises with a device named &#8220;The Globe&#8221;. The project was co-founded by Sam Altman, the co-founder of AI developer OpenAI. The project started going public on July 25 after nearly two years of development and beta testing.</p>



<p>The crypto community was split when the project launched, with some participants seeing it as the beginning of a dystopian future where privacy would be eliminated. On the contrary, others see it as a necessary step to protect humans from malicious AIs.</p>



<p>Previously, the French and UK watchdogs had also warned that they would scrutinize the protocol with concerns about potential privacy risks associated with data collection and storage of sensitive biometrics.</p>
