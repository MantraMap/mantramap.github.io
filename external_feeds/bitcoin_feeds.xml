This year, the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency has emerged as &#x201C;the institutional-grade digital asset,&#x201D; said Microstrategy founder Michael Saylor.</strong></p>
<h2>Microstrategy Acquires More Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Nasdaq-listed Microstrategy Inc. announced Wednesday that it has purchased more bitcoin for its corporate treasury. Michael Saylor, the company&#x2019;s founder and executive chairman, tweeted Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Microstrategy has increased its bitcoin holdings by ~2,500 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. As of 12/27/22 Microstrategy holds ~132,500 bitcoin acquired for ~$4.03 billion at an average price of ~$30,397 per bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/content/dam/website-assets/collateral/financial-documents/financial-document-archive/form-8-k-12-28-2022.pdf">filing</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Microstrategy clarified that the 2,500 coins were acquired between Nov. 1 and Dec. 24 by its wholly owned subsidiary Macrostrategy.</p>
<p>The subsidiary bought approximately 2,395 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> at an average price of $17,871 per coin between Nov. 1 and Dec. 21. It then sold about 704 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> at $16,776 per coin on Dec. 22. Macrostrategy then bought about 810 more <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> at $16,845 per coin on Dec. 24. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $16,656.80.</p>
<p>The bitcoin sale in December marked the first time Microstrategy sold its bitcoin since it began <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/billion-dollar-public-company-microstrategy-250-million-btc-bitcoin-superior-to-cash/">accumulating</a> the crypto for its corporate treasury in 2020. The company cited tax reasons for selling <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. &#x201C;Microstrategy plans to carry back the capital losses resulting from this transaction against previous capital gains, to the extent such carrybacks are available under the federal income tax laws currently in effect, which may generate a tax benefit,&#x201D; the SEC filing describes.</p>

<p>Saylor said in an <a href="https://youtu.be/BiTc3tkrcEw?t=2">interview</a> last week:</p>
<blockquote><p>The most positive thing of the year is the emergence of bitcoin as the institutional grade digital asset and the clarity that &#x2026; there is one crypto asset that&#x2019;s a digital commodity &#x2026; Bitcoin is that commodity.</p></blockquote>
<p>The executive noted that both the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gensler-bitcoin-is-a-commodity/">chairman of the SEC</a> and the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have confirmed that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cftc-chairman-confirms-bitcoin-ether-are-commodities/">bitcoin is a commodity</a>.</p>
<p>Saylor previously <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/microstrategy-ceo-expects-bitcoin-to-go-into-the-millions-despite-crypto-market-sell-off/">explained</a> that Microstrategy is investing in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> &#x201C;for the long term.&#x201D; He added: &#x201C;Our strategy is to buy bitcoin and hold the bitcoin, so there&#x2019;s no price target &#x2026; I expect bitcoin is going to go into the millions. So, we&#x2019;re very patient. We think it&#x2019;s the future of money.&#x201D;</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about Microstrategy growing its bitcoin holdings to 132,500 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>? Let us know in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

The following day, on Dec. 28, 2022, Argo detailed it is selling its Helios facility to Galaxy Digital for $65 million, and the financially troubled business plans to refinance asset-backed loans with a new $35 million loan that stems from Galaxy.</strong></p>
<h2>Galaxy Digital Purchases Texas Data Center From Argo Blockchain, Company Hopes Transactions Will &#8216;Enable the Company to Continue Operations&#8217;</h2>
<p>Galaxy Digital is giving Argo Blockchain (Nasdaq: <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/ARBK:NASDAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ARBK</a>) some fresh liquidity, according to a press announcement published by Argo on Wednesday, Dec. 28, 2022. Argo detailed that it is selling its Helios facility to Galaxy for $65 million.</p>
<p>Galaxy has also agreed to host Argo’s fleet of Bitmain-manufactured S19J Pro bitcoin miners at the Helios facility. The Helios facility is located in Dickens County, Texas and the transaction between Argo and Galaxy is expected to settle on Dec. 28.</p>
<p>Argo further disclosed that Galaxy is providing the firm with a loan of $35 million with a term of 36 months. The financing is backed by a collateral package of Argo’s machines located at the Helios facility in Texas and some in Quebec.</p>
<p>The collateral package equates to 23,619 Bitmain S19J Pro bitcoin mining machines. A number of Argo’s debts are shown to be tied to the firm NYDIG, according to the announcement published on Wednesday morning (ET).</p>
<p>Argo insists the transactions with Galaxy will “strengthen Argo&#8217;s balance sheet, improve Argo&#8217;s liquidity position, and enable the company to continue operations.” Argo’s stock jumped on the news, and it increased 13.55% from $0.59 to the current $0.67 per share at 11:30 a.m. (ET) on Dec. 28.</p>

<p>The publicly-listed bitcoin miner also acknowledged the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/publicly-listed-bitcoin-miner-argo-blockchain-suspends-nasdaq-trading/">suspension</a> of ARBK share trading on Dec. 27 and detailed that ARBK trades on Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange were now open. The company noted that its Canadian assets, except for “certain mining machines and other assets located in Quebec” that are backing its new loan, are “not affected by the agreements with Galaxy.”</p>
<p>Further, Argo also disclosed that its earning results from the third quarter will not be reported “in light of the transaction with Galaxy,” the bitcoin mining operation concluded. Argo Blockchain is one of a handful of publicly-listed bitcoin mining operations that have dealt with financial shortcomings during 2022&#8217;s crypto winter.</p>

<h2>Report Claims FTX Co-Founder Sam Bankman-Fried &#8216;Expected to Enter a Plea Next Week,&#8217; Criminal Defense Attorney Says Feds Have a Case With &#8216;Very Few Holes&#8217;</h2>
<p>Just recently, the judge that was presiding over <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-a-32-billion-valuation-to-financial-troubles-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rise-and-fall-of-ftx/">Sam Bankman-Fried’s</a> (SBF) fraud case, judge Ronnie Abrams, withdrew from the case citing a conflict of interest. It seems Abrams husband, Greg Andres, was reportedly an FTX adviser last year. Andres is a partner at the white-shoe, international law firm headquartered in New York City, Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell. Following Abrams&#8217;s withdrawal from SBF&#8217;s case, the judge has been replaced by judge Lewis Kaplan.</p>
<p>The 78-year-old Kaplan has been called a “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-legal-proceedings-manhattan-lawsuits-bahamas-90d263df2132325c1b60bc9e0508ea9a">no-nonsense</a>” judge who has presided over a number of high-profile cases involving individuals like the ​​45th president of the United States, Donald Trump, and Prince Andrew, Duke of York. On Dec. 28, 2022, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/sam-bankman-fried-enter-plea-ftx-fraud-case-2022-12-28/">reported</a> that when SBF faces judge Kaplan, the FTX co-founder is expected to submit a plea during his arraignment.</p>
<p>“Sam Bankman-Fried is expected to enter a plea next week to criminal charges,” Reuters contributor Jonathan Stempel wrote on Wednesday. Court documents show that SBF is scheduled to see judge Kaplan on Jan. 3, 2023, in Manhattan’s federal court.</p>
<p>The news follows the recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/caroline-ellisons-testimony-claims-ftx-boss-sbf-directed-her-to-co-mingle-customer-funds-since-2019/">unsealed testimony</a> from Caroline Ellison, the ex-CEO of Alameda Research. Ellison is currently working with federal law enforcement officials, and in her testimony she described a number of fraudulent acts she says she participated in since 2019.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Moreover, a number of people do not believe the court will go easy on SBF. On Dec. 22, criminal defense attorney, Brian Wice, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ftx-charges-ll-planting-tomatoes-162303126.html">discussed the situation</a> with Yahoo Finance Live and he told the host, Rachelle Akuffo, that the U.S. attorney in SDNY, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftxs-gary-wang-and-alamedas-caroline-ellison-plead-guilty-to-fraud-duo-is-cooperating-with-feds/">Damian Williams</a>, has a case with “very few holes.”</p>
<p>Wice remarked that the feds wouldn&#8217;t go forward unless “they are convinced that they can make their case beyond a reasonable doubt.” As far as Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang are concerned, Wice said they didn&#8217;t have “ironclad plea deals,” but stressed the duo will “get substantial reductions in their sentences if they come in and they testify truthfully.”</p>
<p>As far as SBF is concerned, Wice remarked that he’s got a “tough road to hoe” ahead of him. “The more cooperators against him, the tougher it will be,” Wice told Akuffo. “And right now Damian Williams sent up the bat signal saying if you&#8217;ve got any guilty knowledge or involvement in this case, you better come in now or it&#8217;s only going to get worse,” the criminal defense attorney added.</p>

<p>In addition to the SDNY case against SBF, a class action lawsuit <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/">filed</a> by FTX customers wants the remaining digital assets tied to Alameda and FTX “earmarked solely for customers.”</p>
<p>The plaintiffs from the class action lawsuit detail that FTX’s loans to Alameda Research, as described by ex-CEO Caroline Ellison, were “in direct violation of FTX’s own customer agreements and terms of service, as well as common law and basic principles of honesty and fair dealing.” SBF was released on a $250 million bond on Thursday, Dec. 22, 2022, and the former FTX CEO was not asked to enter a plea.</p>

Reports show the hacker known as the &#x2018;FTX Accounts Drainer,&#x2019; traded large sums of ERC20 tokens for digital assets like tether, ethereum, and bitcoin.</strong></p>
<h2>Funds Tied to Sam Bankman-Fried&#x2019;s Alameda Research Traded for Ethereum, Tether, and Bitcoin</h2>
<p>It seems whoever controls the funds that once were connected to Alameda and FTX is starting to move a large handful of ERC20 tokens. According to the OXT onchain researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/ErgoBTC">Ergo</a>, on Twitter, Alameda-linked addresses started to swap ERC20s for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>. &#x201C;Alameda <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> addresses are digging around in the sofa for spare change and swapping bits ERC20s for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>,&#x201D; Ergo <a href="https://twitter.com/ErgoBTC/status/1607912106921172993?s=20&t=Zy19xKoFiDGaBD5KouE6Fw">tweeted</a>. &#x201C;<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> then funneled through instant exchangers. Rings some major alarm bells,&#x201D; the onchain researcher added.</p>
<p>In response to Ergo&#x2019;s tweet, the onchain sleuth <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt">Zachxbt</a> replied and <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1607915930440302592?s=20&t=Zy19xKoFiDGaBD5KouE6Fw">said</a>: &#x201C;the funds are being swapped for [bitcoin],&#x201D; while sharing four different <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> addresses (<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1q67r2dc46ve66pe2qr9smaz5ktzefehugky5sv6">1</a>, <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1qk4mnz4qkh9vfcm95z6ww9czhzjsknjr8s457mg">2</a>, <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1qwx3herf245w6k9ljjfgdsngtvjsp3qs6znp8dd">3</a>, <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1q7p22k0ly0pmy04ermzu76uyylveehu9cusrcnp">4</a>). All four of those addresses were sent roughly 11.9 bitcoin worth close to $199K using today&#x2019;s <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> exchange rates. In the thread published by Ergo, someone <a href="https://twitter.com/TMTWealthMgmt/status/1607916078126215170?s=20&t=Zy19xKoFiDGaBD5KouE6Fw">asked</a> if the fund movements likely derived from the liquidators. Zachxbt dismissed the idea when he <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1607916302584127489?s=20&t=Zy19xKoFiDGaBD5KouE6Fw">tweeted</a>: &#x201C;don&#x2019;t think they would use Fixedfloat or Changenow.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Nansen&#x2019;s <a href="https://twitter.com/themlpx">Martin Lee</a> also confirmed that the funds were sent to Fixedfloat or Changenow. &#x201C;Lots of activity going on among Alameda wallets in the past 6-7 hours,&#x201D; Lee <a href="https://twitter.com/themlpx/status/1607937597783035904?s=20&t=cONOW0ya00ROhUBeMNos-Q">said</a>. &#x201C;Various tokens on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> being consolidated into [two] main wallets. Swapped to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> (USDC to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> too). <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> [then] swapped to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>. Sent to multiple wallets and [then] to Fixedfloat [and] Changenow.&#x201D; Lee further added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Transactions seem odd to me. Consolidation makes sense but after it&#x2019;s being consolidated the funds get sent to fresh wallets before it gets sent to Changenow [and] Fixedfloat.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to the recent movements, the FTX Accounts Drainer also controls the ethereum (<a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH">ETH</a>) address &#x201C;<a href="https://blockchair.com/ethereum/address/0x97f991971a37d4ca58064e6a98fc563f03a71e5c">0x97f</a>.&#x201D; The wallet holds around $200 million in ERC20 tokens and $41 million worth of FTT tokens. There&#x2019;s a substantial sum of crypto assets that were confiscated by an unknown entity the same day FTX filed for bankruptcy protection.</p>

<p>Furthermore, just days before the bankruptcy filing, on Nov. 6, 2022, FTX&#x2019;s bitcoin reserves which equated to 20,176.84 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, were siphoned from the wallet in less than 24 hours. The whereabouts of the more than 20,000 bitcoin worth $334.24 million today is still a mystery. A number of speculators have wondered if white hat hackers or even law enforcement now have control over these funds, while many speculate the owner is simply a thief.</p>

The lawsuit, filed as part of the bankruptcy case in Delaware, seeks a court ruling recognizing that their holdings with the trading platform belong to them rather than the failed company.</strong></p>
<h2>Customers Sue FTX, SBF for Priority Right to Repayment Over Other Creditors</h2>
<p>Four FTX customers have filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against the crypto exchange and its former executives, including founder and ex-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). They want the court to declare that the digital assets held with the platform belong to its customers rather than FTX or its other creditors.</p>
<p>The group also asks their suit to be accepted as a class action as part of the case in Delaware, according to reports published by Reuters and Bloomberg. The Bahamas-based FTX <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed</a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the state on Nov. 11 as traders and investors rushed to withdraw their money.</p>
<p>Amid a number of legal efforts to lay claim to the assets of FTX, its <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-ftx-ceo-told-members-of-congress-sbfs-family-certainly-received-payments-from-the-business/">new management</a> pledged that customers will be repaid first. The latest complaint insists that “customer class members should not have to stand in line along with secured or general unsecured creditors in these bankruptcy proceedings just to share in the diminished estate assets of the FTX Group and Alameda.”</p>
<p>Following his resignation as chief executive and after his extradition from the Bahamas, Bankman-Fried is facing <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-charges-against-ftx-alameda-execs-wang-and-ellison-reveal-key-findings-us-regulator-says-ftt-is-a-security/">charges</a> in the U.S. related to a “fraud of epic proportions,” as a federal prosecutor put it. Among them, an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cftc-follows-sec-by-filing-a-lawsuit-against-disgraced-ftx-co-founder-sam-bankman-fried/">allegation</a> that customer deposits, in both fiat and crypto, were used to support his crypto trading platform Alameda Research.</p>

<h2>SBF’s Ex Also Liable for Converting Customer Holdings, Lawsuit Claims</h2>
<p>Besides Bankman-Fried, the customers are also suing Caroline Ellison, his ex-girlfriend and former CEO of Alameda. They say both should be held liable for breaching fiduciary duties to them and wrongfully converting their holdings. Ellison <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftxs-gary-wang-and-alamedas-caroline-ellison-plead-guilty-to-fraud-duo-is-cooperating-with-feds/">pleaded guilty</a> to fraud charges. In her testimony, she <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/caroline-ellisons-testimony-claims-ftx-boss-sbf-directed-her-to-co-mingle-customer-funds-since-2019/">admitted</a> that Alameda had access to a special borrowing facility which was FTX customer funds.</p>
<p>The proposed class action lawsuit asks the court to determine that “cash and assets traceable to customers, which never belonged to FTX or Alameda and do not belong” to other bankruptcy creditors “should be earmarked solely for customers.” It aims to represent over a million FTX customers in the United States and around the world.</p>
<p>And if the court decides that the holdings are property of FTX, then the customers seek a ruling from the judge granting them the priority right to repayment over other creditors of the exchange, which was the second largest in the crypto industry before it collapsed last month.</p>
<p>In a separate report quoting a source familiar with the case, Bloomberg revealed that the U.S. Justice Department has launched an investigation into an alleged <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-reportedly-hacked-as-telegram-group-admin-comments-on-possible-malware-present-in-apps-irregular-fund-movements-registered-onchain/">cyberattack</a> on FTX that led to the loss of over $370 million, mere hours after the bankruptcy court filing in November. It’s still unclear if that was an inside job or a hacking incident.</p>

<h2>Over $3 Billion in USD Value Has Been Erased From the Stablecoin Economy in 23 Days</h2>
<p>The market valuation of stablecoins has continued to slide and since Jan. 2022, $28.08 billion in U.S. dollar value has left the stablecoin economy. Archived data indicates that the stablecoin economy was valued at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220105204516/https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins">$167.08 billion</a> on Jan. 5, 2022, and today it&#x2019;s valued at <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins">$139.06 billion</a> or 16.77% lower than the first week of the year.</p>

<p>The stablecoin economy has not been this low in U.S. dollar value since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211023110407/https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins">Oct. 23, 2021,</a> or around 14 months ago. In Jan. 2022, tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>) had a market capitalization of around $77.14 billion, and today it&#x2019;s down to $66.25 billion.</p>

<p>Usd coin&#x2019;s (USDC) valuation 14 months ago was $42.74 billion and this week USDC&#x2019;s market cap is roughly $44.28 billion. BUSD&#x2019;s market cap was $14.28 billion on Jan. 5, 2022, and terrausd&#x2019;s (UST) market valuation was roughly $10.19 billion.</p>
<p>On Dec. 28, 2022, BUSD&#x2019;s market cap is higher at $17.16 billion, but UST&#x2019;s valuation was obliterated down to the current <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/terraclassicusd">$215 million</a>. UST was one of many stablecoins that depegged from the U.S. dollar this year.</p>
<p>This month alone the stablecoin economy shed $3.08 billion in value as it slid from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221205230049/https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins">$142.07 billion</a> to the current $138.99 billion. On Dec. 5, 2022, BUSD had a market cap of around $22.08 billion which is more than 22% higher than the current $17.16 billion.</p>

<p>356 days ago on Jan. 5, Makerdao&#x2019;s DAI stablecoin had a market valuation of around $9.07 billion, which is 43.55% higher than DAI&#x2019;s current $5.12 billion value. Below the stablecoin DAI are the dollar-pegged tokens frax, pax dollar, true usd, usdd, and gemini dollar.</p>
<h2>In Addition to Terrausd, Neutrino USD, HUSD, and FLEXUSD Depegged From Their $1 Parity</h2>
<p>Stablecoins that have been bumped down a number of positions include dollar-pegged coins like magic internet money, liquity usd, fei usd, and neutrino usd. The once-stable coin neutrino usd (USDN) is currently trading for $0.448 per unit after depegging from the $1 parity on Nov. 7, 2022.</p>

<p>Another former stablecoin that also lost its peg is HUSD, which depegged from the $1 parity on Oct. 27, 2022. A single HUSD token is currently exchanging hands for $0.14 per unit on Dec. 28.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-566213 size-full" title="The Stablecoin Economy Shed $28 Billion in 2022 After a Handful of Tokens Lost Their $1 Peg" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ddc.jpg" alt="The Stablecoin Economy Shed $28 Billion in 2022 After a Handful of Tokens Lost Their $1 Peg" width="1380" height="600" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ddc-300x130.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ddc-1024x445.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ddc-768x334.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ddc.jpg 1380w" sizes="(max-width: 1380px) 100vw, 1380px"></p>
<p>Furthermore, the once-stable coin flex usd (FLEXUSD) also lost its dollar peg this year. FLEXUSD is now trading for $0.25 per unit as it depegged from the $1 parity on June 20, 2022.</p>
<p>On Dec. 5, 2022, stablecoins represented $60.74 billion of the $107.29 billion in 24-hour trade volume recorded that day, which equates to 56.61% of all trades. 23 days later, the global trade volume is much lower at $37 billion, while stablecoins represent $29.92 billion or roughly 80.86% of the trades recorded on Dec. 28, 2022.</p>

The objective of the project, which is still under discussion, would be to educate consumers on the dangers of investing in crypto and also to protect them from investing in crypto Ponzi schemes.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Argentine Senate Gets Into Crypto Advertisement Regulation</h2>
<p>More and more countries are taking action to avoid the diffusion of cryptocurrency scams through advertising channels. Argentina, one of the countries in Latam where cryptocurrency adoption has been growing, has begun to mull the <a href="https://www.iproup.com/innovacion/36908-publicidad-enganosa-y-cripto-el-senado-argentino-interviene" target="_blank" rel="noopener">establishment</a> of crypto-related advertisement laws. The discussion, which is being promoted by Senator Eduardo Andrada and others, would put its focus on educating potential users of cryptocurrency about the particularities of these assets.</p>
<p>In the same way, another of the objectives of this potential project would be to protect investors from falling into fake and Ponzi-based crypto schemes. The meeting, which saw the presence of Sebastian Negri and Martín Breinlinger, members of the Argentine Securities Commission, presented several cryptocurrency schemes that had promotion and advertising through different media.</p>
<p>One of the ideas presented proposed that any crypto-related publicity would have to include slogans explaining the risks that such investments carry.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Divided Opinions</h2>
<p>Senators and other assistants had different views regarding the proposed project. Negri explained the benefits that the approval of such a law would bring to potential investors. He stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the rise of Bitcoin from 10,000 to 69,000 dollars, what they did was promise people that the profitability that occurred the previous year was going to be repeated for those who entered now. That is false advertising. One cannot promise guaranteed profits. That&#8217;s a basic rule, but it was happening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Negri stated that traditional financial institutions, such as banks, were not able to do so, but crypto can because of the low regulation of the ecosystem in the country. However, Senator Angela Negri expressed her disapproval of the idea of regulating crypto advertising, stating that this could cause the Senate to get caught up in other crypto-related issues.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t like this project. I don&#8217;t like regulations and I don&#8217;t really understand how to regulate something that isn&#8217;t regulated. It sounds to me that it is a first step towards a regulation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other countries have already established regulations around this subject. In January, Spain <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-spanish-regulations-to-target-crypto-asset-investment-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">established</a> its own rules to control crypto publicity, targeting influencers first. In the same way, the U.K. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/uk-advertising-watchdog-to-crack-down-on-misleading-crypto-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in July it would increase its vigilance over misleading crypto campaigns.</p>

The deal, which also includes the issuance of new stock valued at $52.7 million dollars, will allow the company to acquire financial and content creation experience.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Gumi Raises $52.7 Million in Metaverse-Driven Alliance</h2>
<p>More and more gaming companies are looking to include metaverse elements in their games. Gumi, a Japanese gaming company focused on mobile entertainment, has announced a capital and business alliance with <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/square-enix-announces-symbiogenesis-a-story-driven-nft-interactive-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Square Enix</a>, another Japan-based game developer, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/leading-japanese-online-broker-sbi-to-pull-out-of-russias-crypto-mining-sector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SBI Holdings</a>, one of the biggest financial service companies in Japan.</p>
<p>The deal includes the issuance of new shares valued at $52.7 million, which will give SBI Holdings a 22.46% stake in the company, becoming the top shareholder. Square Enix will have a marginal stake of 3.01%, according to regulatory <a href="https://jp.reuters.com/companies/ZOFf.TRE/key-developments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filings</a>.</p>
<p>Gumi&#8217;s target is the metaverse, and it declared that the funds raised will be invested to grow this new metaverse business at &#8220;an even faster rate than ever before.&#8221;</p>
<p>This pivot towards digital immersive entertainment and the metaverse has marked significance for the future of the company. In a <a href="https://gu3-co-jp.translate.goog/news/archives/9017/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=es&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> explaining the scope and objectives of the alliance, Gumi stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The group is working day and night to make the metaverse business a second earnings pillar in addition to the mobile online game business, which is the current mainstay of earnings.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Areas of Expansion</h2>
<p>With this strategic alliance, Gumi aims to have a platform to list the tokens it wants to issue as part of its future games strategy. As part of a takeover executed back in May, SBI Holdings purchased a majority stake in Bitpoint, a cryptocurrency exchange. The deal, valued at almost $100 million, would allow SBI to list tokens issued in Gumi-developed games.</p>
<p>The company qualified this development as essential, as most of the tokens issued in these kinds of games are distributed on international exchanges, making it &#8220;inconvenient&#8221; for domestic users. In the same way, Gumi will issue security tokens backed by these games to customers of SBI.</p>
<p>Gumi also hopes to take advantage of the experience that Square Enix has in developing, distributing, and publishing games in order to push its own blockchain gaming platform, including an NFT marketplace.</p>

According to Legalrocks, a crypto and blockchain-focused legal firm in Venezuela, more than 75 accounts have been blocked by Venezuelan private banks for facilitating crypto-to-fiat and fiat-to-crypto conversions since the end of 2021.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Venezuelan Banks Suspend Crypto-Related Accounts</h2>
<p>Venezuelan banks are ramping up vigilance on accounts that commonly are related to cryptocurrency transactions. According to a blog post <a href="https://legalrocks.medium.com/bancos-venezolanos-suspenden-cuentas-a-usuarios-por-utilizar-criptomonedas-qu%C3%A9-hacer-28012bc6efd8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> by Legalrocks, a Venezuelan law firm focused on cryptocurrency and blockchain, more than 75 cases of accounts that have been suspended or are under investigation have been registered since the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Ana Ojeda, CEO of Legalrocks, states that using these accounts to receive fiat currency for a sale or exchange for cryptocurrency should not be considered a valid reason for blocking them. However, she clarifies that this changes if there are sufficient signs that the funds used in these transactions are related to illegal or criminal activities.</p>
<p>In the same way, transactions going through cryptocurrency exchanges not authorized by Sunacrip, the national superintendency for cryptocurrency assets, could also be considered suspicious by financial authorities, and justify an investigation.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Stablecoin Love</h2>
<p>Ojeda explains that stablecoin exchanges through P2P markets are common due to the economic debacle and the high levels of devaluation that the national fiat currency (the Venezuelan bolivar) has experienced during this year. This means that people use stablecoins as a store of value, purchasing them when receiving fiat currency as payment and then exchanging them for fiat currency again to purchase goods and pay for services.</p>
<p>According to a report presented by the United Nations in July, Venezuela <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/un-report-venezuela-ranks-third-among-countries-with-most-crypto-adoption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranks</a> third among the countries with the most cryptocurrency adoption.</p>
<p>According to Ojeda:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Venezuela has been leading the region for several years as the Latam country that uses cryptocurrencies the most to protect itself against inflation and the loss of savings capacity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stablecoin-based P2P markets have become so popular and extensive in Venezuela that some analysts believe they could be playing an important role in the dynamics of the U.S. dollar-bolivar exchange rate. In November, when the bolivar fell 40% against the U.S. dollar, economist Asdrubal Oliveros <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/venezuelan-currency-plunges-almost-40-against-the-us-dollar-analysts-cite-crypto-drought-as-part-of-the-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> the interplay of crypto markets and the greater economy, along with the FTX collapse and the fear of holding funds on custodial exchanges, as a possible cause.</p>

<h2>FBI Warns About Pig Butchering Crypto Scam</h2>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has renewed its warning about the &#8220;pig butchering&#8221; cryptocurrency investment scam. Frank Fisher, public affairs specialist at the FBI&#8217;s Albuquerque division, warned that the pig butchering crypto scam &#8220;is sweeping the country,&#8221; CNN reported Monday, quoting him as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Be very careful when you go on social media and dating apps and somebody starts developing a relationship with you, and wants you to start investing … Don&#8217;t get butchered.</p></blockquote>
<p>In pig butchering schemes, scammers &#8220;fatten up the pig by getting the victim to think that they&#8217;re investing in something and get them to move money into cryptocurrency,&#8221; explained district attorney Jeff Rosen of Santa Clara County, California. He added that criminals in the pig butchering schemes &#8220;fatten up&#8221; their victims&#8217; digital wallets and then steal the money.</p>
<p>Rosen&#8217;s office manages a multi-agency task force combating technology-related crimes. He noted that based on the investigations conducted by his team, these crypto investment scams typically operate overseas, such as in Cambodia and China.</p>
<p>The district attorney warned that scammers are particularly active during the holidays as they often prey on victims who may be feeling lonely.</p>
<p>According to Rosen, pig butchering operations involve highly sophisticated methods and scammers have been &#8220;trained by psychologists to try to figure out the best way to manipulate people.&#8221; He stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>You&#8217;re dealing with people that are going to use different psychological techniques to make you vulnerable and to get you interested in parting with your money.</p></blockquote>
<p>U.S. authorities warned in August that the pig butchering crypto scam is becoming <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-authorities-warn-of-pig-butchering-crypto-scam-becoming-alarmingly-popular/">alarmingly popular</a>. In November, the Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-seizes-domains-used-in-pig-butchering-crypto-scam/">seized</a> seven domain names used in pig butchering schemes.</p>
