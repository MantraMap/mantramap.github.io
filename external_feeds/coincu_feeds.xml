<p>Momeni&#8217;s arraignment was postponed until May 2, and his lawyer, Paula Canny, argued that the camera footage cited by prosecutors as evidence does not support a premeditated murder charge. San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins has urged the court to keep Momeni in custody, arguing that the April 4 slaying was &#8220;planned and deliberate.&#8221;</p>



<p>Bob Lee, the chief product officer at cryptocurrency startup MobileCoin and creator of Cash App, was highly respected in the tech industry for his coding abilities. According to prosecutors, Lee was fatally stabbed with a kitchen knife on a San Francisco street after spending an evening with friends, including the sister of suspect Nima Momeni.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-25/bob-lee-murder-suspect-to-plead-not-guilty-lawyer-says?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=crypto#xj4y7vzkg&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-25/bob-lee-murder-suspect-to-plead-not-guilty-lawyer-says?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=crypto#xj4y7vzkg&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Paula Canny, the lawyer for Nima Momeni, plans to contest efforts to keep her client detained until his trial. She argues that it is the police’s responsibility to make all evidence available to defense counsel, including the autopsy report from the city medical examiner’s office, which she is awaiting. This comes despite objections from the San Francisco District Attorney, who believes that the April 4 murder of Bob Lee was premeditated.</p>



<p>According to the court filing, a color video segment shows two men standing on a sidewalk for about five minutes. The camera is too far away to identify their faces before one suddenly moves toward the other. One man walks away injured, while the other moves along a fence line where the knife was later recovered. </p>



<p>The men had driven in Momeni&#8217;s car together from his sister&#8217;s apartment building to a &#8220;dark and secluded area,&#8221; as per prosecutors. The filing also states that Momeni&#8217;s BMW was seen speeding away from the scene.</p>

<p>Recently, Markus Thielen, chief researcher at Matrixport, made some bold predictions about the future of Bitcoin. According to Thielen, the price of Bitcoin may reach around $45,000 by the end of this year. Thielen explained that this is due to the US 10-year bond yield trading below 3.50%, which means that inflation will be a big tailwind for risk assets, notably Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Despite recent volatility, Thielen believes that Bitcoin prices are exactly where they should be, based on his CPI/FOMC roadmap that he laid out in early February. He also stated that based on the January Effect, Bitcoin prices could finish the year around $45,000, which seems achievable.</p>



<p>Thielen suggested using the predictable path as a roadmap and selling when prices are above the &#8220;fair value&#8221; level or buying when below. This means that trading actions should be taken every time Bitcoin&#8217;s price trades +10% above this level or -10% below it. Therefore, Thielen suggested selling at $30,350 and adding around $25,000.</p>



<p>In addition, Thielen pointed out that as the US 10-year bond yield has started to trade below 3.50%, inflation will be a big tailwind for risk assets, notably BTC. He also noted that Bitcoin is more sensitive to liquidity and is expected to outperform stocks.</p>



<p>Currently, BTC is neither over- or undervalued, nor are the Greed &amp; Fear indices signaling extreme readings. Thielen emphasized that patience and discipline are needed to stick to the data and analysis as the path to $45,000 continues.</p>

<p>The plugin will be able to perform various tasks such as checking wallet balances, transferring tokens, and even purchasing NFTs. In one screenshot, a user is shown asking for a list of NFTs owned by a particular Solana address. This plugin can also help users with technical difficulties such as sending Solana transactions to another address, or purchasing an NFT. Each prompt returns the relevant instructions or information in natural language.</p>

<p>While Solana Labs has not yet stated when the ChatGPT plugin will be launched for general use, the project&#8217;s GitHub page suggests that the plugin can currently be installed as an unverified plugin by using the address: <a href="https://solana-gpt-plugin.onrender.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://solana-gpt-plugin.onrender.com</a>.</p>

<p>Solana Labs is not the only company exploring the use of AI in cryptocurrency services and projects. Binance recently launched a ChatGPT-powered “Sensei” chatbot on April 24. Similarly, Visa announced plans to hire an AI-focused blockchain developer on the same day.</p>



<p>AI features are also being integrated into crypto-integrated browsers such as Opera and Brave. Opera has announced an AI-integrated version called Opera One while Brave has integrated an AI-powered “summarizer” tool into its search engine in early March.</p>



<p>Even outside of the blockchain industry, individuals linked to Marvel Studios and Epic Games have spoken about the potential of AI in the entertainment industry. Therefore, it is clear that AI is becoming increasingly important in various industries and businesses.</p>

<p>Apple recently removed the Bitcoin whitepaper from the system files of macOS Ventura 13.4 beta 3. The file had been hidden in every copy of macOS since 2017, and its existence was thought to be a joke among Apple engineers. </p>



<p>However, with the latest beta version, the file and the entire internal tool called &#8220;VirtualScanner.app&#8221; have been removed. This tool allowed Apple engineers to simulate scanning and exporting documents and images without a scanner.</p>



<p>The Bitcoin whitepaper was initially added to the system with macOS Mojave in 2018, and it was never meant to be found by regular users. Although the original reason for adding the file is still unknown, it did not contain any sensitive information, which is why Apple&#8217;s engineers did not bother to remove it from the public release of macOS.</p>



<p>If you haven’t updated your Mac to the latest beta yet, you can still find the file by running the following command in Terminal:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>open /System/Library/Image\ Capture/Devices/VirtualScanner.app/Contents/Resources/simpledoc.pdf</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This recent development comes after the community discovered the file and its contents, which resulted in repercussions. Unsurprisingly, Apple has decided to remove the file from the system to avoid any further issues, as it was not intended to be part of the public release.</p>



<p>It is important to note that removing the Bitcoin whitepaper from the system files of macOS Ventura does not affect the use or availability of Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin remains popular and has been gaining more mainstream acceptance over the years.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit decided that Apple had violated state competition laws by preventing app developers from using alternative in-app payment methods other than its own that included a 30% commission. </strong></h5>

<p>The court&#8217;s decision was in the case of AP vs Epic Games, the creator of the popular video game Fortnite. While the court ruled in favor of Apple on most issues, it upheld a lower court&#8217;s decision from 2021 and explained that Apple&#8217;s anti-steering provision had harmed Epic Games. The anti-steering condition is an Apple policy that states that developers cannot communicate out-of-app payment methods through certain mechanisms, such as in-app links.</p>



<p>The court explained AP&#8217;s anti-steering violation through a second angle, ruling that consumers would have flocked to Epic Games directly had they learned about its much lower commission rate of 12%, compared to Apple&#8217;s 30%. The court further explained that if consumers could learn about lower app prices, which are made possible by developers&#8217; lower costs, and can substitute to the platform with those lower prices, they would do so. This would increase the revenue generated by the Epic Games Store.</p>



<p>The ruling frees iOS developers by allowing them to direct consumers to alternative payment solutions. This may clear the path for cryptocurrency and nonfungible token (NFT) projects to add more app functionality. If AP doesn&#8217;t appeal the ruling, it could set a case law precedent benefiting creators of crypto and NFT apps because they won&#8217;t be subject to Apple&#8217;s 30% &#8220;tax.&#8221;</p>

<p>The court found the anti-steering provision to be &#8220;unfair&#8221; pursuant to both the competitor-suit &#8220;tethering test&#8221; and the consumer-suit &#8220;balancing test.&#8221; The court stated that Epic Games would have earned additional revenue since August 2020 &#8211; save for Apple&#8217;s policy &#8211; by applying these tests. The court ruling may have important implications for developers and consumers alike, as it may encourage the development of alternative payment methods and the creation of competitive platforms.</p>



<p>The decentralized exchange Uniswap is one of the latest crypto projects to make its way into the App Store, despite Apple&#8217;s initial withholding of its launch in March. Nearly two months ago, the European Union set new anti-monopolistic rules requiring Apple to permit third-party app stores on its devices, allowing consumers to circumvent Apple&#8217;s 30% commissions. However, in December, Apple interfered with NFT transactions sent on Coinbase&#8217;s self-custody wallet, claiming that it was entitled to &#8220;collect 30% of the gas fee&#8221; through in-app purchases.</p>

<p>First Republic Bank recently reported a significant decrease in total deposits, which has raised concerns among investors. The bank&#8217;s deposits fell by 41% in the first quarter, a substantial decline. Although analysts expected deposits to be around $136.7 billion, the bank only reported $102.7 billion in deposits as of April 21, 2023, down only 1.7% from March 31, 2023. The decrease is linked to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank last month. Additionally, the bank saw a reduction in year-over-year revenues of 13.4%.</p>

<p>First Republic Bank&#8217;s stock has declined significantly, over 90% YTD, causing concern among investors. The bank is taking proactive measures to reduce expenses, including cutting executive compensation, consolidating office space, and reducing nonessential projects. It plans to cut its workforce by 20-25% this quarter and is considering selling off assets to restructure its balance sheet. While Bloomberg reported that the bank is looking to sell $100 billion of loans and securities to balance its books, First Republic Bank declined to comment.</p>



<p>During the call on Monday, First Republic&#8217;s CEO, Michael Roffler, reassured investors that the bank was liquid. He stated that as of April 4, First Republic had twice the available liquidity of uninsured deposits, excluding the $30 billion received from large banks.</p>



<p>Despite concerns about uninsured deposits and the overall health of the banking system causing the company&#8217;s shares to plummet over 88%, TD Ameritrade&#8217;s Investment Movement Index noted that its clients were net buyers of First Republic Bank in March.</p>

<li><em>Voyager says Binance US has sent notice to terminate its plan to acquire the bankrupt crypto lending platform.</em></li>



<li><em>The reason the deal was canceled was due to the strict regulatory environment of the United States, which had many obstacles during the acquisition process.</em></li>



<li><em>Voyager&#8217;s attorneys warned in a recent filing that the deal&#8217;s collapse could cost its more than 1 million creditors an additional $100 million.</em></li>

<p>After announcing that it <a href="https://news.coincu.com/182647-binance-us-voyager-acquisition-agreement-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has reached</a> almost all agreements with the US government, Binance US has sent a letter to cancel the acquisition of Voyager Digital.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Today we received a letter from <a href="https://t.co/yG7Airmib5" target="_blank">https://t.co/yG7Airmib5</a> terminating the asset purchase agreement. While this development is disappointing, our chapter 11 plan allows for direct distribution of cash and crypto to customers (a “toggle option”) via the Voyager platform.</p>&mdash; Voyager (@investvoyager) <a href="https://twitter.com/investvoyager/status/1650921887512272917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 25, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Binance.US cited the current regulatory environment as a reason to withdraw from the agreement with Voyager.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Binance.US has made the difficult decision to exercise its right to terminate the asset purchase agreement with Voyager (…). While our hope throughout this process was to help Voyager&#8217;s customers access their crypto in kind, the US&#8217;s hostile and uncertain regulatory climate has introduced an unpredictable operating environment impacting the entire American business community.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Instead, Voyager Digital will return cash and crypto to customers on its own through its platform, as the court restructuring plan has been approved. Voyager expressed disappointment in the tweet.</p>



<p>The Creditors Committee is upset and disappointed with this decision and is investigating potential claims against Binance US.</p>



<p>The initial terms allowed Binance.US to cancel the agreement within 4 months unilaterally. However, in a recent legal filing, Voyager&#8217;s lawyers warned that the deal&#8217;s failure could cost its more than 1 million creditors an additional $100 million.</p>



<p>The court authorized the deal to sell Voyager to Binance US last month at a valuation of $1.3 billion. Customers get 73% of their assets back, but this rate can be reduced to 48% if FTX and Alameda Research successfully appeal. Of the 6% of creditors who voted, 97% favored the Binance US &#8211; Voyager deal.</p>

<p>Binance US proposed to rescue Voyager last December and was approved by a New York court judge in March of this year. However, the SEC and the US Department of Justice spoke out<a href="https://news.coincu.com/173797-us-block-voyager-binance-1-billion-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> against</a> it, saying that Binance US is an unregistered stock exchange and its branch shows signs of violating US law. This scandal once made CEO Changpeng Zhao consider withdrawing from the deal.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has revealed that the regulatory agency is currently engaged in ongoing discussions with Binance. </strong></h5>

<p>The discussions come in the wake of charges that the CFTC initially filed against Binance on March 27, 2023, alleging that the popular cryptocurrency exchange solicited U.S. users to trade derivatives illegally.</p>



<p>CFTC Commissioner Kristin Johnson has stated that her agency has been in conversation with Binance to give them the opportunity to explain their conduct and work together to find a way forward. While she has not made any definitive statements regarding the course of litigation, Johnson did reveal that the CFTC typically has preliminary conversations with companies before launching litigation.</p>

<p>Despite Binance&#8217;s initial response to the charges, where they pledged to cooperate with U.S. regulators, and a number of subsequent discussions between the two parties, the CFTC has not yet found a satisfactory resolution to the matter. Johnson noted that the discussions with Binance have been focused on addressing the exchange&#8217;s &#8220;potentially problematic&#8221; actions but that the parties have not yet decided whether to settle the case out of court or to proceed with litigation.</p>



<p>In light of this ongoing legal dispute, Johnson has called for more cryptocurrency regulation from U.S. Congress, specifically around spot trading. She believes that such regulations would fall under the jurisdiction of the CFTC and would help to clarify the legal status of exchanges like Binance. While there is currently no immediate path forward in the case, Johnson remains optimistic that a solution can be found through continued discussions with Binance and other stakeholders in the cryptocurrency industry.</p>
