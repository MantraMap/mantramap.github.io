<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/first-bitcoin-tower-dubai/">First Bitcoin Tower to Be Built in Dubai</a></p>
<p>The upcoming COP28 Summit scheduled for Dubai has inspired the construction of a Bitcoin Tower, a Bitcoin-shaped and Bitcoin-themed hotel in the heart of the United Arab Emirates city.</p>
<h2>40-story Monument to Bitcoin</h2>
<p>The Bitcoin Tower will be a 40-story architectural monument that will represent the values that Bitcoin has bestowed on mankind.</p>
<p>A May 21 release by Metaverse Investment LLC, the company behind the concept of the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> hotel and towers, stated that the initiative will celebrate the importance, value, and controversies around Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency. The statement added that the hotel will embody the blockchain technology that underlies the working of Bitcoin, as well as promote artificial intelligence and the reduction of carbon emissions, which have been of concern to environmentalists.</p>
<h2>Rewards for Customers</h2>
<p>The planned hotel will also embrace a staking and reward system for customers. According to Salvatore Leggiero, the lead developer behind the project, rental fees paid by customers are considered staking investments that will yield redeemable APYs in a way that has not yet been applied by any other platform. He added that the project will be the first hotel to reward patrons by paying them back the rental fees with interest. This unique reward approach involved the gifting of non-fungible tokens to hotel customers as well as other incentives.</p>
<h2>Represented in the Metaverse</h2>
<p>Simone Micheli said that the Bitcoin Tower will be depicted in a virtual universe using a unique concept different from what is applied in conventional construction. The renowned architect said that the virtual reality created will give visitors experiences that are unimaginable.</p>
<p>As a part of the initiative, Salvatore said that the team is inviting creators, designers, artists, architects, and crypto enthusiasts to make submissions that will be used either as exclusive <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a> or in the internal design of the Bitcoin tower as what he called &#8216;an asset of exceptional tangible value.&#8217;</p>
<h2>More Ways to Experience Crypto</h2>
<p>Speaking on the initiative, the top investor in the project and the CEO of Metaverse Investment LLC said that the project is a reflection of the growing importance of cryptocurrencies in people&#8217;s lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;This innovative approach to hospitality reflects the growing importance of cryptocurrencies in today’s society and is an excellent way for people to experience and learn more about them,&#8221; he <a href="https://ffnews.com/newsarticle/bitcoin-tower-the-first-one-in-the-world-will-be-built-in-dubai/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>.</p>
<h2>Introduction to Stakeholders</h2>
<p>The project has been slated for introduction on Wednesday, May 24, 2023. The event will be held at the Bella Restaurant Lounge of the Grand Millennium Business Bay in Dubai. There&#8217;ll be an exclusive evening, even for stakeholders and VIPs. The renowned chef Alessandro Miceli is expected to grace the occasion.</p>
<p>Arabian Chain Piece, a Dubai-based company, has been tipped to build the Bitcoin Tower, the very first architectural tower masterpiece dedicated to the premier cryptocurrency and the technology behind it.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/jpmorgan-2023-revenue-target-84b/">JPMorgan Hikes 2023 Key Revenue Target to $84B Following Its First Republic Acquisition</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/jpmorgan-chase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JPMorgan Chase</a> (NYSE: JPM) has increased its 2023 key revenue target to $84 billion following its acquisition of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/first-republic-bank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Republic</a> earlier this month. The New York-based banking giant revealed the <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/investor-relations/documents/events/2023/jpmc-investor-day-2023/firm-overview.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">projected performance</a> at an <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/ir" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">investor presentation</a> Monday which should last throughout the day.</p>
<h2>Details of JPMorgan Revenue Target Development</h2>
<p>The new JPMorgan revenue target is $3 billion higher than the guidance given in April following the bank&#8217;s commendable <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/jpmorgan-record-q1-2023-revenue/">Q1 2023</a> results. At the time, the multinational financial services company hiked its net interest income expectations by $7 billion.</p>
<p>Regardless of its heightened net interest income prospects for the year, JPMorgan pointed out that deposits and economic uncertainty could impact its forecast. Although the bank has thrived during the US banking crisis, its comments suggest that it does not take its good fortunes for granted.</p>
<p>JPMorgan was one of a few banks to experience a surge in deposits during the first quarter as spooked investors fled to established institutions. Leveraging its strong position as an exemplary bank amid the ongoing chaos, JPMorgan <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/jpmorgan-chase-acquires-first-republic-bank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> the embattled commercial bank First Republic. The acquisition came after the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/jamie-dimon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jamie Dimon</a>-led banking powerhouse won a weekend auction for First Republic&#8217;s assets. Observers believe the acquisition would enhance JPMorgan&#8217;s earnings and aid the bank&#8217;s push for increased high-net-worth clientele. For instance, <a href="https://africa.businessinsider.com/news/jpmorgan-may-turn-first-republic-sites-into-special-branches-for-wealthy-clients/b4nbghx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">recent reports</a> stated that JPMorgan could turn the newly-acquired bankrupt bank into a special branch for wealthy clients.</p>
<p>However, JPMorgan appears to be in no rush to enhance its wealth management business with First Republic&#8217;s resources. Commenting on the development, the co-head of JPMorgan&#8217;s consumer bank, Marianne Lake, explained, &#8220;We have to do it in a way that works for this company.&#8221; There are also suggestions that the prominent bank&#8217;s quest to integrate First Republic&#8217;s assets into its wealth management business could receive added impetus. According to The Journal, JPMorgan could benefit from retaining the insolvent bank&#8217;s financial advisers.</p>
<h2>Some Critics Voice Concern that JPMorgan Could Become Too Powerful to Control with First Republic Acquisition</h2>
<p>JPMorgan&#8217;s acquisition of First Republic is largely seen as a boon within the financial and banking industry. However, some quarters fear that bigger banks snapping up smaller banks could become too powerful. For instance, on the day of the deal announcement, Senator Elizabeth Warren lamented, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p> &#8220;The failure of First Republic Bank shows how deregulation has made the too big to fail problem even worse.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The US Democratic senator also added:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A poorly supervised bank was snapped up by an even bigger bank — ultimately, taxpayers will be on the hook. Congress needs to make major reforms to fix a broken banking system.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>However, JPMorgan CEO Dimon, who will speak at the bank&#8217;s investor presentation later today, disagreed with Warren&#8217;s reasoning. Dimon opined that the First Republic acquisition underscored a functional US system. &#8220;We need large, successful banks in the largest and most successful economy in the world,&#8221; he stressed.</p>
<p>JPMorgan is the largest US bank and the world&#8217;s largest bank by market capitalization. For the first quarter of 2023, JPMorgan realized revenue of $39.34 billion, surpassing the $36.19 billion consensus estimate.</p>

<p>Despite a decline in crypto hacks in Q1 2023, the article warns that it is likely a temporary break before a potential surge in attacks.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/crypto-hack-decline-q1-2023/">Crypto Hack Decline in Q1 2023: Temporary Relief or Calm before Storm</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/crypto-hack-decline-q1-2023/">Crypto Hack Decline in Q1 2023: Temporary Relief or Calm before Storm</a></p>
<p>Crypto hacks significantly decreased during Q1 2023 compared to 2022, according to a report by blockchain intelligence company TRM Labs.</p>
<p>According to the TRM Labs study <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-hacks-fall-q1-temporary" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> by Cointelegraph, the amount stolen in cryptocurrencies dropped dramatically from nearly $30 million to less than $11 million compared to the quarters of 2022.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The average hack size also took a hit in Q1 2023 – down to $10.5 million from nearly $30 million in the same quarter of 2022, even though the number of incidents was similar (around 40).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the company warned that the decrease is likely only a temporary relief rather than a long-term trend, as in the past, declines of this kind were followed by a record increase in attacks.</p>
<h2>Record-Breaking Year: Cryptocurrency Hacks Soared in 2022</h2>
<p>According to a <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-biggest-year-ever-for-crypto-hacking/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> by Chainalysis, 2022 witnessed the highest number of cryptocurrency thefts in history, reaching record-breaking figures of approximately $3.8 billion. The majority of these thefts were primarily targeted at decentralized finance protocols, with a significant connection to hackers affiliated with North Korea.</p>
<p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols were the main targets for hackers, accounting for 82.1% of the stolen funds. The most affected were cross-chain bridges due to their role as centralized repositories of funds.</p>
<p>The report also emphasized the need to improve security in DeFi protocols by conducting code audits by third parties and adopting new security measures such as simulated attack tests, close monitoring of suspicious activity, and the implementation of automatic switches to halt transactions if suspicious activity is detected.</p>
<p>Additionally, the report highlights the significant involvement of hackers associated with North Korea, who were responsible for stealing over $1.7 billion in cryptocurrencies. Consequently, Chainalysis emphasized the critical importance of blockchain transparency in combating cybercrime.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency hacks appear to have cooled down following the sanctions on Tornado Cash.</p>
<p>TRM Labs stated that the sanction on <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tornado-cash-developer-alexey-pertsev-custody/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tornado Cash</a> and the arrest of the operator of Mango Markets may have been the causes that curbed cryptocurrency hacks this year. After the sanctions on the decentralized cryptocurrency mixer, the total cash flow entering the platform dropped by 68%.</p>
<p>However, as it was <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sanctions-inflow-tornado-cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by Coinspeaker, despite regulatory actions, Tornado Cash continues to operate, highlighting the challenges of regulating decentralized services. As a platform based on smart contracts, it cannot be forced to shut down by any individual or institution. According to Chainalysis, approximately 34% of all transactions made on Tornado Cash were associated with illegal activities such as cryptocurrency hacks and scams.</p>
<p>Similarly, the arrest of the alleged <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mango-markets-attacker-arrested-puerto-rico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mango Markets hacker</a>, Avraham Eisenberg, may have acted as a deterrent against the criminal activities of hackers. This is because Eisenberg could potentially face several years of imprisonment for his involvement in fraudulent practices and market manipulation, despite the regulatory ambiguity in the cryptocurrency sphere.</p>
<p>Therefore, although there is a decrease in hacks during Q1, history has shown that cryptocurrency users should not become complacent, as hackers may be lurking, waiting for an opportunity to strike again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/huobi-operations-malaysia-regulations/">Huobi Ordered to Cease Operations in Malaysia after Failure to Comply with Local Regulations</a></p>
<p>A leading centralized crypto firm <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/huobi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huobi Global Limited</a> and its Chief Executive Officer Leon Li have been accused of operating a digital asset exchange in Malaysia without registration. As a result, the Securities Commission of Malaysia (SC) has ordered the cryptocurrency exchange to immediately cease operations within its jurisdiction. Notably, the SC has ordered Huobi Global to disable its official website and mobile applications in Malaysia henceforth.</p>
<h2>Huobi in Malaysia</h2>
<p>The Malaysian regulator has also ordered Li to ensure the exchange does not issue advertisements to local investors through any platform.</p>
<p>“This decision comes after concerns about the platform’s compliance with local regulatory requirements and protecting investors’ interests. The SC views this breach seriously, as operating a DAX without obtaining the SC’s registration as a Recognised Market Operator (RMO) is an offense under Section 7(1) of the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007,” the Malaysian SC <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/resources/media/media-release/sc-takes-enforcement-action-against-huobi-global-for-illegally-operating-dax-in-malaysia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>.</p>
<p>As a result, the Malaysian SC has urged the local investors to immediately cease trading via Huobi Global, withdraw their investments, and close their accounts. Forward, the Malaysian SC has advised local crypto investors to use only register digital asset exchanges. Some of the registered crypto exchanges in Malaysia include Lino Malaysia, MX Global Sdn Bhd, SINEGY DAX Sdn Bhd, and Tokenize Technology (M) Sdn. Bhd. Binance announced a strategic investment in MX Global Sdn. Bhd, in order to penetrate the Malaysian crypt arena after several attempts to enter the market failed.</p>
<p>Notably, Huobi Global <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/regulation/guidelines/recognizedmarkets/list-of-registered-digital-asset-exchanges" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">joins</a> a long list of centralized exchanges that have already been banned from operating in Malaysia.</p>
<p>“Investors should exercise caution when choosing investment platforms and to always do their due diligence before making any investment decisions,” the Malaysian SC concluded.</p>
<h2>Huobi and the Market Outlook</h2>
<p>Huobi Global has been in operation since 2013 despite experiencing several regulatory issues with different countries including China. According to the official website, Huobi Global has more than 45 million users with a 24-hour trading volume of about $2,549,480,360 from more than 700 digital assets. The company’s core products include spot and futures trading, and Huobi Earn that significantly leverages the HT token.</p>
<p>The announcement to cease operations in Malaysia did not have a negative effect on the HT token, which traded around $2.94 on Monday, up approximately 1 percent in the past 24 hours. Furthermore, the HT token is mainly used by the HECO Chain (heco), which is marketed as a layer two scaling solution on the Ethereum network. According to the latest crypto price oracles, the HT token had a market capitalization of about $477,111,888 and a 24-hour trading volume of about $15,723,543.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/eu-1-3b-fine-meta-gdpr/">EU Slaps $1.3B Fine on Meta for Violating GDPR EU User Data Protection Laws</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Platforms Inc</a> (NASDAQ: META) recently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/22/meta-fined-record-1point3-billion-over-eu-user-data-transfers-to-the-us-.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incurred</a> a record 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) fine from the European Union (EU) for privacy violations. European privacy regulators alleged that the Facebook parent unlawfully transferred data from European users to the US.</p>
<p>The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), which announced the penalty, also ordered Meta to cease the further transfer of EU user data to the US. However, Meta said it would appeal the Irish watchdog’s decision.</p>
<h2>Details of EU Fine</h2>
<p>The EU fine on Meta is one of the most consequential in the five-year existence of the landmark data privacy law. This law, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), was established to protect the rights of the EU member citizenry from overseas ‘snooping’. Such unwanted activities include collating and analyzing the photos, friend connections, direct messages, and data of EU users for targeted advertising.</p>
<p>Ireland’s Data Protection Commission alleged that Meta continued to infringe upon the GDPR’s dictates despite a definitive European court ruling in July 2020. This 2020 legal case at the European Court of Justice saw the EU’s apex court invalidate the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework. The primary reason given by the European court at the time was that EU data conveyed to the US did not have sufficient protection from American spy agencies.</p>
<p>Privacy Shield had posed to be the main vehicle that could facilitate the legal transfer of personal data from the EU to the US. However, its backers failed to convince the court of its adequate safeguards.</p>
<p>Explaining the penalty, the Irish Data Protection Commission detailed how Meta carried out its ‘infringements.’ According to the watchdog, the Facebook parent deployed standard contractual clauses for the EU personal data transfer. These clauses were adopted by the European Commission, in addition to other Meta-implemented measures. Interestingly, no EU court blocked these clauses. However, the Data Protection Commission said those schematics failed to address the “risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects”.</p>
<h2>Meta Vows to Push Back Against ‘Unfair’ Fine</h2>
<p>Monday’s ruling applies only to Facebook and not to other Meta-owned social media platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp.</p>
<p>However, Meta described the EU’s punitive measures as unfair treatment. It also argued that other companies practice similar data-sharing methods. In a statement, the Menlo Park-based company’s President of Global Affairs, Nick Clegg, and Chief Legal Officer, Jennifer Newstead, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Without the ability to transfer data across borders, the internet risks being carved up into national and regional silos, restricting the global economy and leaving citizens in different countries unable to access many of the shared services we have come to rely on.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the duo also stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are appealing these decisions and will immediately seek a stay with the courts who can pause the implementation deadlines, given the harm that these orders would cause, including to the millions of people who use Facebook every day.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Proposed EU-US Cross-Data Transfer Pact Back in Focus</h2>
<p>Meta’s case reflects the ongoing development between the EU and the US to agree to a new data transfer mechanism. Last year, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/eu-and-us-agree-new-data-transfer-pact-to-replace-privacy-shield.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">both parties agreed, in principle,</a> to a new framework that facilitates trans-Atlantic data transfers. However, this new pact is yet to come into effect.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ryanair-posts-fy23-profit/">Ryanair Posts Impressive FY23 Profit as It Capitalized on Its Oil Hedging Positions</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ryanair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryanair Holdings Plc</a> (NASDAQ: RYAAY) one of the largest and most well-known low-cost carriers in Europe has reported a full-year net profit pegged at 1.43 billion euros ($1.55 billion). This record was boosted by increased traffic and rates, as well as favorable oil hedging positions of which it recorded more than 80% hedged at approximately $64 billion.</p>
<p>Notably, fuel hedging allows airlines to secure fuel at predetermined prices, reducing their exposure to price fluctuations in the unpredictable crude oil market.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/22/ryanair-reports-bumper-profit-on-favorable-fuel-hedges-sees-major-industry-consolidation.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a> from CNBC, Ryanair reported a 74% rise in full-year traffic to 168.6 million people, while rates were 10% higher than pre-Covid era. Interestingly, the update comes despite a difficult first quarter in 2022 which, despite the Russian invasion of Ukraine, travel demand improved relatively in the year.</p>
<p>The reported 74% customers increase indicates a strong recovery in passenger numbers. This suggests that people were gradually returning to air travel, possibly as COVID-19 restrictions eased and vaccination rates increased.</p>
<p>However, the report highlighted that Ryanair’s operating costs for the year rose to 9.2 billion euros, primarily driven by a 113% rise in fuel costs. Nonetheless, the low-cost airline established it was able to offset some of the increase in fuel costs due to favorable hedges.</p>
<p>Additionally, the report noted that the unit price was 31 euros per passenger, which was significantly lower than comparable European competitors. This lower fare served as an advantage for the airline in terms of competitiveness and profitability.</p>
<p>While Ryanair is already 85% hedged at $89 per barrel for this year, Neil Sorohan, Ryanair&#8217;s Chief Financial Officer highlighted the favorable fuel hedges will result in an increased cost of about $1 billion on the fuel bill this year.</p>
<h2>Ryanair Profit amid Major Industry Consolidation</h2>
<p>The current Ryanair profit growth push complements the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ryanair-strong-q4-2022-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q4 performance</a> from the company and while according to Sorohan, Ryanair considers its low-cost base as a factor, it may face impediments in its aims to expand its presence and market share across Europe. He mentioned that the biggest risk to Ryanair&#8217;s growth strategy is the aviation industry itself.</p>
<p>The aviation business faces numerous problems and uncertainties, including fuel pricing, regulatory changes, geopolitical events, economic conditions, and competition from other carriers.</p>
<p>According to Sorohan, consolidation in the European aviation industry is seen as “inevitable” and has already begun. Consolidation in this regard refers to the process of merging or acquiring airlines to create larger entities with increased market share and operational efficiencies. Notably, consolidation can result in cost savings, increased operational efficiency, extended route networks, and increased competitiveness.</p>
<p>Sorohan went further to say he wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if two of Europe&#8217;s other low-cost carriers were merged in the coming years. He claims the European aviation industry is likely to mimic the US model, with just four or five huge carriers essentially carrying 80% of the business around Europe.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/wise-shares-departure-cfo/">Wise Shares Impacted by Management Shakeups Including Pending Departure of Eight-Year CFO</a></p>
<p>Shares of British fintech firm <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/transferwise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wise</a> (LON: WISE) <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/22/fintech-firm-wise-stock-falls-after-cfo-quits-ceo-to-go-on-leave.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">slipped</a> 4% on news of CFO Matt Briers&#8217; resignation next year. The London-based company&#8217;s stock slide also comes amid reports of CEO Kristo Kaarman&#8217;s paternity leave which begins in September. Wise&#8217;s shares are changing hands at 590 GBX after management made the announcements.</p>
<p>Briers&#8217; pending departure in 2024 comes after an eight-year tenure with the UK fintech powerhouse. During that period, Wise transformed from a small-time promising business venture to a fintech giant with a listing on the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/london-stock-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">London Stock Exchange</a>. Today, the company also boasts millions of users and a revenue stream that typically exceeds 500 million GBP.</p>
<h2>Wise Begins Immediate Search for New CFO amid Shares Decline</h2>
<p>Amid its current shares development, and in a Monday update to investors, Wise revealed an immediate &#8220;comprehensive search for a new CFO.&#8221; The company&#8217;s management also detailed the extent of CEO Kaarman&#8217;s planned paternity leave. The Wise chief executive and co-founder will be away between September and December to spend time with his family. However, Wise&#8217;s Chief Technology Officer, Harsh Sinha, will assume the CEO role interim.</p>
<p>Briers exits his CFO role at Wise in March of next year to fully recover from a cycling accident he suffered in 2022. By the time he leaves, Kaarman is expected to have since returned from his sabbatical break.</p>
<p>In a statement, the outgoing Wise CFO looked forward to the future and reflected on his time at Wise. Briers <a href="https://fxnewsgroup.com/forex-news/executives/matthew-briers-to-step-down-as-wise-cfo/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;After almost eight years, it&#8217;s time to think about my life after Wise. I&#8217;m incredibly proud of what we have achieved in these early chapters at Wise and could not be more excited about what is ahead for the business. Wise is growing fast, with a massive opportunity in front of us, and we&#8217;ve bucked the trend by working out how to do this profitably.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Briers also added that his departure could spark the beginning of ongoing transitional changes in management at Wise for decades to come. As the departing CFO put it, the company &#8220;could have many CFOs in its first century,&#8221; Furthermore, he stressed, &#8220;This is simply me starting the process of handing over the reins to the next one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Briers suffered a severe cycling accident in February last year where he went under the wheel of a bus. At the time, while the CFO recovered at home, Wise appointed an interim finance chief in his place. Briers is largely credited with playing a pivotal role in transforming Wise&#8217;s fortunes.</p>
<h2>CFO Departure Second of Its Kind in UK Tech Industry in May</h2>
<p>The announcement of Briers&#8217; departure is the second of its kind this month, where a CFO position at a leading British fintech platform became vacant. Less than two weeks ago, London-based private neobank <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/revolut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revolut</a> announced the departure of its own CFO, Mikko Salovaara, after just two months on the job.</p>
<p>On May 11th, Revolut said Salovaara&#8217;s departure was due to personal reasons.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/hotbit-suspends-operations/">Crypto Exchange Hotbit Suspends Operations after Five Years of Service</a></p>
<p>Hotbit, a centralized cryptocurrency exchange (CEX), has suspended its business operations. The company <a href="https://hotbit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/14750194236823" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> the decision on May 22, 2023, citing several factors including the change in <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/news/crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market trends</a>, the depegging of stablecoins from their $1 benchmarks, and the deterioration of operating conditions.</p>
<p>Hotbit was founded in 2018 and quickly became one of the most popular exchanges in the industry. The firm offers users various options to trade digital assets, including meme tokens such as SHIB, KSM, and GRIN.</p>
<h2>Centralized Exchanges Are Becoming Increasingly Cumbersome</h2>
<p>In addition to spot trading options, the exchange provides staking services allowing users to earn passive income from their crypto holdings. However, the company&#8217;s success was not without its problems. In April 2022, the exchange was involved in legal disputes when law enforcement investigated its former staff for possible violations of criminal laws.</p>
<p>The incident took a toll on the company&#8217;s business as authorities froze its assets, forcing it to <a href="https://hotbit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8074249353495" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">halt</a> operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and funding functions for weeks.</p>
<p>The company also blamed changes in market trends for its closure,  noting that the collapse of centralized exchanges has caused the industry to either embrace regulations or become more decentralized.</p>
<p>Hotbit believes that &#8220;centralized exchanges are becoming increasingly cumbersome, with highly complex and interconnected businesses that are difficult to comply with, whether for compliance or decentralization and are unlikely to meet long-term trends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aside from the change in market trends and deterioration of operating conditions, Hotbit encountered numerous setbacks, such as cyber security theft and exploitation of project defects by malicious actors, contributing to its decision to shut down operations.</p>
<p>The exchange, which boasts of millions of users, has urged its customers to withdraw their assets from the platform. Hotbit said it will continue supporting the withdrawal until June 21, 2023, after which all accounts will be closed.</p>
<h2>Other Crypto Companies That Have Exited the Market</h2>
<p>Hotbit has been one of the many crypto companies to exit the market in recent months. In April, Paxful, a peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto exchange servicing the African region of Nigeria, <a href="https://paxful.com/sign-up-transition" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">suspended</a> its operations. The company&#8217;s CEO, Ray Youssef, cited regulatory hurdles and staff departure as reasons for its closure.</p>
<p>That same month, another digital assets service provider Bit4You halted its operations after its partner CoinLoan, which holds its customers&#8217; assets, declared bankruptcy in an Estonian court.</p>
<p>The crypto industry is in flux, and many companies struggle to weather the storm. Hotbit, Paxful, and Bit4You closures are signs of the challenges facing the emerging economy as the market continues to tumble. However, It remains to be seen how many more companies will be forced to exit the market in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/gemini-genesis-dcg-630m-payment/">Gemini Says Genesis Parent DCG Defaulted on $630M Payment, Updates Contingency Plan</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/gemini/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini Trust Company LLC</a> recently said that Genesis parent DCG missed a $630 million loan payment last week. This development is the latest occurrence in the ongoing dispute between the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/cameron-winklevoss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cameron Winklevoss</a>-run crypto custodian and digital currency VC firm.</p>
<p>In January, Gemini CEO Winklevoss <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/cameron-winklevoss-lawsuit-genesis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threatened to sue</a> his DCG counterpart <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/barry-silbert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barry Silbert</a>, and the entire company, over a $900 million loan repayment. At the time, Winklevoss’ threat came after one of DCG’s subsidiaries, Genesis, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The Gemini chief executive has been trying to recover his company’s loans and users’ assets from the sunk VC company.</p>
<p>Following DCG’s recent failure to fork over $630 million in payment to Gemini, the Winklevoss-run crypto exchange has taken active steps. Gemini is working closely with DCG and some of its subsidiaries, including Genesis and CoinDesk, to provide forbearance to DCG. The reason for this action is to avoid a default.</p>
<p>DCG also owes digital asset financial facilitator Genesis and crypto-focused news site CoinDesk.</p>
<h2>Gemini Provides Update to Contingency Plan Involving Genesis and DCG Following Payment Miss</h2>
<p>On its site, Gemini posted updated contingency plans it would execute if unable to reach a deal with DCG. The crypto custodian and other parties propose an amended reorganization scheme with Genesis. However, should this scenario occur, Gemini pointed out in the proposal that DCG’s approval would not be required.</p>
<p>Genesis <a href="https://www.gemini.com/earn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In the event a deal cannot be reached, Gemini (along with the other parties) is working with Genesis to suggest terms for an amended plan of reorganization that could be advanced without DCG’s consensual approval…This would be a plan that would have Gemini’s input if not outright support.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The New York-based crypto exchange and custodian also wrote in its updates:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Consideration will be based in part on whether the parties believe DCG will engage in good faith negotiations on a consensual deal.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Winklevoss Previously Accused DCG CEO of &#8216;Bad Faith Stall Tactics&#8217;</h2>
<p>Amid the repayment spat, Winklevoss, also Gemini’s co-founder, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/cameron-winklevoss-accuses-barry-silbert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused</a> DCG’s Silbert of “bad faith stall tactics.” In an <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1609913051427524608" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">open letter</a> posted on Twitter on January 2nd, Winklevoss ripped into the DCG CEO for ‘altering the lives’ of over 340,000 affected Earn users. The Gemini co-founder and CEO also pointed out that his company awaited a repayment agreement update from DCG for six weeks to no avail. At the time, Winklevoss lamented, “For the past 6 weeks, we have done everything possible to engage with you in good faith.” He also said that DCG repurposed $1.675 billion of owed money to further its own interests instead of repaying creditors. Some of these alleged ‘self-serving’ actions include share buybacks and illiquid venture investments that “ballooned” DCG Trust’s fee-generating AUM.</p>
<p>Winklevoss concluded his scathing missive at DCG by stressing that time was running out. He also said the VC firm could not remove itself from its loan obligations, however hard it may try.</p>
<p>Less than an hour after Winklevoss posted his open letter, Silbert <a href="https://twitter.com/BarrySilbert/status/1609926715454771200?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">responded</a>, saying DCG did not borrow $1.675 billion from Genesis. Furthermore, at the time, the embattled CEO added that his company was current with all its interest payments and outstanding loans. Lastly, Silbert stressed that DCG had yet to receive a response from the December 29th proposal sent to Genesis and Gemini advisors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, late last week, Genesis attorneys <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysb.314889/gov.uscourts.nysb.314889.329.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">filed a request</a> to a New York bankruptcy court seeking an extension for a Chapter 11 plan.</p>

<p>The chip and semiconductor industry is likely to see its next major distortion following the labeling of United States-based chipmaker <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/micron-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Micron Technology Inc</a> (NASDAQ: MU) as a threat to its National security infrastructure. As <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/22/china-chip-stocks-rally-after-beijing-says-micron-is-security-risk.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> by CNBC, China’s Cyberspace Administration said Micron failed to pass its latest security review.</p>
<p>This failure prompted the regulator to direct all operators of “critical information infrastructure” in the country to refrain from buying any product from Micron Technology.</p>
<p>This pronouncement has caused an immense plunge in the price of the shares of Micron Technology. The shares dropped 6.12% in the Pre-market and are changing hands at a price of $64. What turned out to be a major bane for Micron appears to be a key growth driver for Chinese chip stocks.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-listed Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd (HKG: 1347) inked a slight growth of 0.93% at the time of writing, data shows it has printed over 3% earlier in the day. Besides Hua Hong, the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Ord Shs (HKG: 0981) stock is also seeing a very definitive bullish growth, soaring by 1.20% over the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Labeling Micron Technology as a security threat has reawakened the now obvious war between the United States and China as it concerns the maintenance of dominance in the semiconductor industry. The Micron ban can be likened to a related move from the US when it <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/smic-shares-slump-8-following-u-s-export-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">placed a ban</a> on China’s biggest chipmaker SMIC.</p>
<p>During the President Trump Administration Semiconductor Manufacturing International was banned from using American technology, a move that limits its ability to expand. This ban impacted other fast-growing technology companies like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/huawei/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huawei Technologies Co Ltd</a> which was also banned by the US Government.</p>
<h2>China Ban on Micron, US Responds</h2>
<p>The ban on Micron Technology has drawn a response from US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo who said America will not sit back and firmly oppose restrictions that are not backed by proper facts.</p>
<p>“We firmly oppose restrictions that have no basis in fact,” he said, adding that the commerce department will enter into negotiations with the Chinese government to “detail” its position and seek further clarity.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Secretary said the government will enter into talks with its key allies and partners to ensure that the already fragile chip industry does not face any major distortions. While it remains uncertain the timeline that these negotiations will take, the US may seek to deepen its business ties with South Korea as it will look to cushion the impact of the Chinese ban on its technological advancement.</p>
<p>With the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic just wearing off in the semiconductor industry, sanctions and counter-sanctions will weigh the industry down and may impact on the bottom line of the frontline industries in this space.</p>
