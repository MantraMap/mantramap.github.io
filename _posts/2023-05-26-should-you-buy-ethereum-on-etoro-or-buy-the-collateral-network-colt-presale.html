<p>Ethereum (ETH) has solidified itself as one of the market's most popular and desirable crypto coins. However, as the recent lockup of ETH tokens hits new highs, investors are wondering about the coin's future movements.</p>
<p>While this is happening, a new player on the market &ndash; Collateral Network (COLT), is turning heads and making waves, with experts predicting a 3500% growth even while the token is still in its public presale.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Collateral Network Blows Investors Away with Incredible Gains</p>
<p>Collateral Network is one of the hottest projects in the crypto sphere right now. Set to revolutionize the lending industry, Collateral Network is the first decentralized lending platform on the blockchain that allows people to leverage their real-world assets in exchange for loans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's say you need to get a loan to fund an upcoming project, and you have a $10,000 watch. You can send that watch over to Collateral Network, where it will be valued and stored securely in a vault. Collateral Network will mint a 100% asset-backed NFT from your watch and sell it in fractions to other Collateral Network holders. Once you repay your loan, you'll get the watch back, and the NFT will be burned.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the people who fund the loans, i.e., buy fractions of the asset-backed NFTs, can create a diversified portfolio of multiple small loans and receive fixed-interest weekly payments from each loan. So, Collateral Network also allows lenders to create streams of passive income with competitive rates.</p>
<p>At the moment, this token is still in its public presale. Nonetheless, it's already providing gains for holders, as its initial presale price has already jumped from $0.01 to $0.014 in just a few weeks. Experts and analysts are predicting 3500% gains for the coin in the near future and an incredible 100x increase once the coin hits exchanges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is Buying Ethereum on eToro Worth It?</p>
<p>The Ethereum (ETH) price is continuing to see bearish reactions as the Ethereum lockup continues to rise. In an effort to boost the Ethereum value, Ethereum holders have been locking up their Ethereum coins in the past few weeks. Now, the total locked amount has reached a new high, with 19,375,242 Ethereum coins being locked away.</p>
<p>However, the lockup trend has yet to achieve its goal of boosting Ethereum value, and now investors are unsure where all of this will lead. Some experts are predicting a further decline in Ethereum prices in the future, with some saying that it could fall from its current trading price of $1,788.05 to $1,462.</p>
<p>If you want to wait for the expected dip once it comes, you can buy Ethereum on eToro. However, at this time, it's not recommendable that you do so, as predictions aren't so good for the coin. So, you'll be much better off investing in the Collateral Network presale if you want to get maximum gains.&nbsp;</p>
