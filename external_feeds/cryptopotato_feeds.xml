            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The National Tax Service (NTS) of South Korea has reportedly hit Bithumb Korea and Bithumb Holdings with a &#8220;special tax investigation&#8221; to determine whether the cryptocurrency platform has complied with domestic taxation laws.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The officials have also probed Kang Jong-hyeon (rumored to be the actual owner of the exchange) and his sister &#8211; Kang Ji-yeon. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tax Issues for the Local Giant</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a recent <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20230110077500002?section=economy/all&amp;site=major_news04" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">coverage</a>, the 4th Bureau of Investigation of the Seoul Regional Tax Service will inspect whether Bithumb had been involved in any tax evasion. It is worth mentioning that this unit solves only special tax cases.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The NTS will supposedly verify Bithumb&#8217;s tax operations by observing the company&#8217;s international and local transactions. The authorities will further examine the activities of Kang Jong-hyeon (the firm&#8217;s hypothetical owner) and his younger sister &#8211; Kang Ji-yeon. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Several sources have hinted that Jong-hyeon is the largest shareholder of Bithumb. However, to keep a low profile, he has registered most of his business interests, real estate, and numerous vehicles in his sibling&#8217;s name. The South Korean press has recently indicated that the mysterious man is dating Park Min-young (one of the most famous local actresses).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The officials conducted a similar tax investigation on Bithumb in 2018. Back then, they obtained 80 billion won (over $64 million) in income tax.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Recent Drama Surrounding Bithumb</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As <em>CryptoPotato </em></span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/vp-of-bithumb-linked-company-found-dead-in-seoul-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> at the end of 2022, the Vice President of Vidente &#8211; Mr. Park &#8211; was found dead near his home in Seoul, while the initial investigation found no signs of a potential murder. His company is among the largest shareholders of Bithumb Holdings (the organization behind the trading venue). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Park faced several charges of stealing customer funds and manipulating stock prices, while FTX&#8217;s former CEO &#8211; Sam Bankman-Fried &#8211; was reportedly in advanced talks to acquire the exchange. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another coverage <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bithumbs-owner-found-not-guilty-on-charges-of-fraud-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">informed</a> that Lee Jung-hoon &#8211; former Chairman of the South Korean cryptocurrency platform &#8211; has not violated the Act on the Aggravated Punishment Of Specific Economic Crimes and has not defrauded Kim Byung-gun for 112 billion won ($87.5 million). Had the court found him guilty, he could have gone to jail for up to eight years.</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[2023 has gotten off to a rather good start for the crypto market but not for Huobi. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seychelles-headquartered crypto exchange &#8211; Huobi Global &#8211; has been in trouble for quite some time now, which has translated into losing significant market share. The company has been mired in controversy for allegedly shutting down internal com and feedback channels and canceling various employee benefits, among other things. Its market share is also under threat from rival companies.</p>
<p>According to the latest <a href="https://marketing.kaiko.com/huobi-market-share-plummets-in-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">study</a> by data provider Kaiko, Huobi&#8217;s market share declined from 22% in 2020 to a mere 4% by 2022-end, thereby making it the biggest loser of the crypto bear market. Huobi&#8217;s quarterly revenue also <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1612675398470352899" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">fell</a> by almost 98% since 2021 Q2.</p>
<h2>Huobi in Trouble</h2>
<p>The crypto industry is still reeling after the spectacular fallout of the FTX empire, and the community is wary of more adverse developments around other high-profile participants. Huobi, too, is the latest to see a crisis in confidence.</p>
<p>Over the past week alone, it recorded outflows of more than $100 million in token outflows amidst insolvency concerns. Tron Founder Justin Sun, who is a major shareholder of the crypto exchange, transferred around $100 million worth of total of USDC and USDT from Binance to Huobi to boost confidence.</p>
<p>The USDD depeg also turned out to be an Achilles&#8217; heel for Sun&#8217;s crypto empire. For context, USDD, issued by the Tron DAO Reserve, aims to stabilize exchange rates for stablecoins issued on the TRX blockchain. The depeg was triggered by the FTX collapse, and since then, it has continued to hover below the $1 mark.</p>
<p>Despite USDD being claimed to be backed with a collateral ratio of over 200% in combination with Tron, Bitcoin, USDC, and USDT, it has failed to regain its peg. At the time of writing, USDD was trading around $0.97.</p>
<p>Kaiko&#8217;s research stated,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When looking at USDD-USDT order books, which is the highest volume trading pair, we can observe that market depth on the bid and ask side has been persistently imbalanced since early December.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Increasing FUD</h2>
<p>It was also found that the ratio of bids to asks was under 1 for most of the past month, a trend that was indicative of a heavy sell pressure that is dragging the price down. The ratio did see minor improvement since the beginning of the year, with the bid/ask ratio climbing above 1, thereby suggesting that more bids were placed on order books.</p>
<p>A switch in current sentiment will only be prompted if a shift in order book structure transpires. In fact, Kaiko&#8217;s research stated that USDD can still regain its peg. But this isn&#8217;t the case for Huobi, which continues to face an &#8220;uphill challenge in regaining market share.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sun recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/trons-justin-sun-confirms-20-layoff-at-huobi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">confirmed</a> that Huobi slashed its workforce by 20% in a bid to cope with mounting losses. The exchange will undergo &#8220;structural adjustment,&#8221; expected to conclude by the first quarter of this year.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Group One – a proprietary trading firm – has purchased options to buy 1.3 million shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR) worth $240 million, per a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">As </span><a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/group-one-makes-a-bitcoin-play-with-13-5-stake-in-microstrategy-1.1868233" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by Bloomberg on Tuesday, the purchase would account for a 13.5% stake in MicroStrategy, whose executive chairman is the Bitcoin booster, Michael Saylor. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Group One is a market maker and liquidity provider for U.S. equity options and other securities. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">MicroStrategy is an enterprise software company famous for being one of the world’s single largest holders of BTC. The company </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/microstrategy-adds-2500-btc-total-stack-now-132251-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">owns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> over 131,000 coins, while Saylor personally owns another 17,000. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Given its massive exposure to the asset, MSTR has become a proxy for U.S. investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin. The United States currently lacks a Bitcoin spot ETF, meaning formal avenues for gaining direct exposure are limited for U.S. investors. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">As such, MSTR was also a victim to Bitcoin’s tumultuous 2022, declining 74% across the year.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">MicroStrategy suffered a $1 billion impairment loss on its Bitcoin in Q2 2022. Michael Saylor relinquished his position as CEO around this time, but the company remained committed to its Bitcoin strategy. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The firm conducted its first-ever Bitcoin </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/heres-why-microstrategy-sold-704-bitcoins-on-december-22/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">sale</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> late last year for 704 BTC, but only to generate a tax benefit by purchasing those coins back only days later. Nevertheless, this technically constitutes a broken promise from Michael Saylor that MicroStrategy would never sell its coins. </span></li>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The positive performance comes even though the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at the end of December last year.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It operated around 243,000 and 234,000 ASIC servers, bringing its total hashrate to 24.4 EH/s in November and 23.7 EH/s in December. On the other hand, its self-mining computing power for December was 15.7 EH/s, compared to 15.4 EH/s in the prior month.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Core Scientific had to shut down several of its data center operators during 2022&#8217;s last two months. Its main facilities remain distributed in Texas, Georgia, Kentucky, North Caroline, and North Dakota.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The numerous closures in November and December represented 5,828 and 17,179 megawatt hours, respectively. The entity further stated that it has collaborated with utility companies to ensure power grid stability.</span></p>

<h2>Canadians Must Get Rid of Their USDT Before January 31</h2>
<p>According to the statement, users will have until January 31 to withdraw or exchange USDT for any other currency. Failure to do so will result in all USDT balances automatically converting to Circle&#8217;s USDC stablecoin.</p>
<p>Reddit user zoomercoomer9000 confirmed that Canadian regulators issued a <a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/news-events/news/csa-provides-update-crypto-trading-platforms-operating-canada" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">statement</a> in late December informing that cryptocurrency platforms that are registered or in the process of registering were prohibited from allowing Canadian customers to trade cryptocurrencies that &#8220;are themselves a security and/or derivative.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As a result of this ongoing work, the CSA is of the view that stablecoins, or stablecoin arrangements, may constitute securities and/or derivatives. Crypto trading platforms that are registered or that have entered into a pre-registration undertaking are reminded that they are prohibited from permitting Canadian clients to trade, or obtain exposure to, any crypto asset that is itself a security and/or a derivative.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Community Speculates on What Happened —And Why</h2>
<p>For many users, the delisting of USDT in Canada was seen as a glimpse of what could happen globally if regulators in other countries decide to attack cryptocurrencies with more burdensome regulations.</p>
<p>Others argued that the cause of the delisting was Crypto.Com&#8217;s good relationship with Circle, the issuer of USDC and that it was all a &#8220;business deal&#8221; to eliminate competition. Something very similar to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/multiple-exchanges-delist-usdc-and-usdt-on-solana/" data-wpel-link="internal">what Binance did</a> against USDC.</p>
<p>User zoomercoomer9000 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/108455o/cryptocom_is_delisting_usdt_what_do_they_know/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">added</a> that &#8220;Tether has a pretty shady history,&#8221; explaining that they previously lied about their 1:1 peg to the US dollar and did not disclose their association with Bitfinex until it was exposed in the Paradise Papers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other users reported that the delisting of USDT is &#8220;a big problem for Canadians,&#8221; as it leaves them with fewer options for earning interest on their money.</p>
<p>While the vast majority were unhappy with the actions taken by Crypto.com, other users indicated that regulations are the only way for cryptocurrencies to become more widespread and for big players to enter the ecosystem.</p>
<p>So far, Crypto.Com has not made an official statement on the issue but did <a href="https://decrypt.co/118812/crypto-com-delist-tether-canada" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">confirm</a> the decision to other media. They also did not clarify if this was a temporary or permanent ban, so it must be taken as effective until further notice.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[After a guilty plea to insider trading, Nikhil Wahi will be deported to India following his prison sentence.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nikhil Wahi – brother to former Coinbase product manager Ishan Wahi – has been sentenced to 10 months in prison following his guilty plea to leveraging his familial connection for insider trading of crypto tokens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The accomplice will be forced to return the $892,000 he generated in profits from those trades. </span></p>
<h2>“A Terrible Mistake”</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In July, both Nikhil and Ishan Wahi were </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/former-coinbase-product-manager-accused-of-insider-trading/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">arrested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on allegations that the latter tipped his brother with information about upcoming Coinbase listings shortly before they were publicly announced. This allowed him to invest large amounts of money into those tokens before other investors knew, affording the men an unfair advantage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having traded in this fashion at least 14 times dating back to June 2021, Nikhil was able to generate almost $900,000 in profit trading 40 different tokens, according to prosecutors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A friend of the brothers, Sameer Ramani, was also involved in the case, helping the group generate about $1.5 million in total. He too was charged with wire fraud, but remains at large. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I made a huge mistake, a terrible mistake,” said Nikhil to US District Judge Loretta Preska on Tuesday. “It’s something that I will have to live with forever.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After his </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-execs-brother-pleads-guilty-to-cryptocurrency-wire-fraud/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">guilty plea</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in September, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said this was the first instance in which “a defendant has admitted guilt in an insider trading case involving the cryptocurrency markets.” By contrast, Ishan Wahi </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ex-coinbase-executive-pleads-not-guilty-to-insider-trading-case-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">pled not guilty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in August.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nikhil’s 10-month sentence is a far cry from the 20-year maximum that perpetrators of wire fraud can face, but still a disappointment for the brother, who sought no jail time whatsoever. On the other hand, prosecutors hoped to see him in prison for as many as 16 months. After his sentence, Nikhil will be deported to India. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Coinbase called in Ishan Wahi for a meeting on May 16, 2022 over suspicions that he could be involved in such illicit activity. He attempted to flee to India the night before this meeting but was stopped by airport security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Coinbase was forced to </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-dismisses-950-people-citing-current-economic-climate/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">lay off</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> another 950 employees on Tuesday due to the current economic climate. </span></p>
<h2>OpenSea Insider</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first insider trading case involving digital assets was </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/former-opensea-employee-charged-for-nft-insider-trading/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">filed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in June 2022 against former OpenSea employee Nathaniel Chastain. Like the Wahi brothers, Chastain was accused of investing in NFTs shortly before he knew they would be listed by the marketplace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On-chain sleuths tracked down Chastain’s shady activity in September 2021 and was </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/openseas-head-of-product-is-out-following-accusations-of-nft-insider-trading/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">fired</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from OpenSea shortly afterward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Chastain filed a motion to </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/openseas-former-head-of-product-files-motion-to-drop-insider-trading-charges/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">dismiss</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> such charges against him in August, with his lawyers claiming he had technically broken no laws, given that NFTs are yet to be classified as either securities or commodities. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The government… should not be permitted to proceed on a Carpenter wire fraud theory of insider trading when it agrees that the relevant pieces of “digital artwork” are not securities,” read the filing. </span></p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[The widespread outrage over OFAC's designation was due to the fact that it is a non-custodial and open-source protocol. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Office of Foreign Assets Control&#8217;s (OFAC) tryst with the crypto industry dates back to 2018 when it designated two Iran-based individuals of malicious cyber activity. There has been no looking back since. More recently, the bombshell announcement that the US Treasury Department banned American citizens from using Tornado Cash, has had industry leaders abuzz.</p>
<p>While sanctions did reduce Tornado Cash&#8217;s activity, a recent report by Chainalysis shows that it is not easy to &#8220;pull the plug&#8221; on a decentralized protocol.</p>
<h2>Affect of OFAC&#8217;s Sanction on Tornado Cash</h2>
<p>The blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis published a new <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/how-2022-crypto-sanction-designations-affected-crypto-crime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">report</a> highlighting OFAC&#8217;s increased efforts in targetting crypto activity and its effect on the Ethereum-based coin mixer, Tornado Cash.</p>
<p>On-chain data before sanctions revealed that 34% of all funds sent to Tornado Cash originated from illicit sources, while illegal activity was concentrated on just crypto hacks and scams. For instance, the Harmony Bridge exploit last summer accounted for more than 65% of the mixer’s total stolen fund inflows during a period of 60 days before OFAC initiated sanctions against it.</p>
<p>However, this pattern of isolated, unique events and most illicit funds came in brief spikes. This is in contrast to similar activity from services such as darknet markets which see a more constant flow producing a steady stream of funds.</p>
<p>Post sanctions, on the other hand, the coin mixer&#8217;s activity dropped significantly, but it hasn’t ceased completely. It is because Tornado Cash runs on smart contracts, which cannot be taken offline the way a centralized service can. Chainalysis, hence, concluded that OFAC or any other entity cannot do anything except impose legal consequences of sanctions violations stopping individuals from using it.</p>
<p>Having said that, Tornado Cash has been difficult to access after its website, which acted as a front-end for easy access to the mixing service, was removed. Its inflows declined by 68% in the 30 days following its designation. The report stated,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Those incentives appear to have been powerful, as its inflows fell 68% in the 30 days following its designation. That’s especially important here given that Tornado Cash is a mixer, and mixers become less effective for money laundering the less funds they receive overall.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Privacy Advocates Decry Tyranny</h2>
<p>The sanction against Tornado Cash provoked a massive backlash. Non-profit blockchain advocacy group Coin Center filed a lawsuit against the US Treasury in September, stating that the move effectively criminalizes the citizens&#8217; wanting to protect their privacy while using their own crypto-assets.</p>
<p>The prominent crypto exchange Coinbase also <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-funds-lawsuit-against-treasury-department-for-sanctioning-tornado-cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">sued</a> OFAC, accusing the financial intelligence agency of overstepping its authority.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The company had earlier laid off 20% of its workforce amidst industry headwinds in the summer of 2022. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BlockFi said it plans to disclose assets and liabilities, as well as statements of certain payments made by the platform to insiders and other parties prior to its bankruptcy filing in November.</p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockFi/status/1612485882388582400" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">update</a>, the embattled crypto lending announced it would file both its Schedules of Assets and Liabilities and its Statement of Financial Affairs with the Court on January 11, 2023.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;BlockFi looks forward to continuing its open dialogue with the UCC, U.S. Trustee, and all stakeholders in its chapter 11 cases. More information related to the Claims Process and the filing of Proof of Claims will be sent to clients at the appropriate time. Please note that, at this time, no deadlines have been set.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In a presentation filing for its stakeholders, BlockFi reportedly reached out to 106 domestic and<br />
international potential buyers shortly after its first bankruptcy hearing in November. It now plans to file a motion seeking approval of bidding procedures on January 30th.</li>
<li>It also clarified that the management team did not withdraw any crypto-asset from the platform after October 14, 2022, nor any of its members made a withdrawal greater than 0.2 BTC in value at any time after August 17 of the same year.</li>
<li>Throughout 2022, BlockFi&#8217;s retail withdrawals accounted for a total of $7.7 billion. The management team&#8217;s withdrawals represent 0.15% of that total volume.</li>
<li>BlockFi said the team deployed their personal assets on the platform to trade, earn interest, and store different under the same terms of service as clients.</li>
<li>2022 has been brutal for several companies, including BlockFi. FTX did offer a $400 million loan to the company and was close to purchasing it in July, but the<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-ftx-botched-acquisition-a-timeline-of-high-profile-bailout-that-never-happened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"> spectacular collapse</a> of SBF&#8217;s crypto empire dragged BlockFi into <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy-following-ftx-crash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bankruptcy</a>.</li>
<li>More recently, BlockFi&#8217;s attorneys <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/blockfi-says-it-repaid-investor-15-mln-settle-over-crypto-crash-2023-01-09/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">notified</a> the bankruptcy court that its executives repaid an investor $15 million to settle a threatened lawsuit over the lender&#8217;s collapsing equity value in mid-2022.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Beacon spoke with over 1000 projects during the selection process, and expects a similarly low acceptance rate for its next cohort. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Polygon founder Sandeep Nailwal has unveiled the first 13 Web 3 companies to participate in Beacon, his newly launched startup accelerator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The team has confirmed that companies involved in the next cohort will each receive $250,000 in support, for an $8 million post-money valuation. </span></p>
<h2>Fostering Web3 Growth</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nailwal </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/polygon-founder-sandeep-nailwal-launches-web3-acceletor-beacon/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> Beacon’s launch late last year, with the goal of helping Web 3 founder navigate the challenges of the industry. It uses weekly sessions and mentoring to help startups build a community, market themselves, and launch their product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In an FAQ shared with CryptoPotato, the founder said that his team spoke with over 1,000 projects, from which 15 were chosen for Cohort 0, and 13 graduated Demo Day. These companies included Arcana, Blinkmoon, ChapterX, Colexion, Community Gaming, Cubist, FastLane, Meta Apes, Mystic Moose, Nillion, Davos Protocol, Timeswap, and Yilde. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We feel like Cohort 0 is our MVP of Beacon,” explained the team. “So for this cohort, we handpicked our favorite teams through taking calls with founders sourced through our networks.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cohort 1 will operate differently, using an open application process available until January 31st. The actual cohort will begin in April, for which the founder expects a similar acceptance rate of roughly 1%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Beacon said that </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/former-ftx-chief-engineer-wants-a-deal-with-us-authorities-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">FTX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">’s fallout had cast doubt on whether the companies within cohort 0 would stick around for the three-month program. “We completely scrapped [our user-focused] schedule and had to rewrite the whole agenda, with the focus of trying to provide guidance to our companies to help steer them through this turmoil.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Beacon was a chain-agnostic program, and most founders were focused on developing cross-chain applications. “With that, we had the highest number of teams building in the Ethereum ecosystem,” it said.</span></p>
<h2>Selection Criteria</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The program used five core values for screening Beacon companies – with a primary focus on committed teams. “We are looking for extremely committed founders who have the expertise, drive, and grit to build the world’s best companies,” said Beacon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Beacon also welcomed teams within emerging markets that “may have been overlooked by the traditional VC and accelerator industries.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The accelerator’s selection was “vertical agnostic,” meaning it welcomes companies across the entire category of web 3, rather than one specific vertical like </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/5-bullish-and-2-bearish-cases-for-defi-going-into-2023-opinion/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">DeFi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, NFTs, or the Metaverse.</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[WOO, the native token of the Woo Network, saw a 20% surge on Tuesday as the team announced significant changes to its tokenomics.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Woo Network is a DeFi liquidity provider for institutional platforms and has attracted equity investments from backers like Binance.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Revamped Tokenomics for Woo</h2>
<p>The Woo Network tokenomics revamp involves a series of improvements to its token distribution, the team<a href="https://woo.org/blog/en/woo-tokenomics-revamp-q1-2023" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"> announced</a> on Monday, (January 10, 2023). These improvements are part of efforts to address issues regarding the current token distribution.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Woo’s token revamp will begin with a planned burn of 705 million WOO tokens, currently worth $127 million. Token burning in crypto is when coins are destroyed by sending them to a burn address, forever removing them from circulation. The planned burn will see 24% of the WOO token supply destroyed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The tokens to be burned will come from the allocations given to WOO Ventures, WOO DAO, and the project’s insurance fund, according to the announcement. Woo’s statement revealed 147,417,657 tokens from WOO Ventures, 259,136,204 tokens from WOO DAO, and 298,697,900 from the WOO insurance fund are part of the coin burn process. Also, the project will wind down these affected segments following the token burn.</p>
<p dir="ltr">WOO Ventures was supposed to be the investment arm of the project, but the announcement cited “a number of challenges” as being the reason for discontinuing the endeavor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Following the token burn, Woo Network says it will embark on initiatives to improve the utility of its native token.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The token burn announcement spurred a significant uptick in price action, with WOO gaining 20% in today’s trading. Tuesday’s price spike is in keeping with a positive start of 2023 for the Woo token, which is up more than 45% in the last seven days.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Crypto Tokens Record a Bullish Start to 2023</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The WOO token price is part of a series of<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-maintains-above-17k-aptos-skyrockets-40-daily-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal"> bullish price actions</a> at the start of 2023.
