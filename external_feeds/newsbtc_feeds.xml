					<description><![CDATA[Recent comments from former SEC Attorney John Reed Stark have further dampened optimism about the regulator approving any of the pending Spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Looking More Unlikely The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has continuously denied applications for a Spot Bitcoin ETF, and Stark has suggested that this trend isn’t going to change anytime soon as the SEC will likely deny all the pending applications due to several “compelling reasons.” While aligning his opinion with that of Better Markets, Stark stated that the arguments laid forward in the nonprofit’s letters to the SEC “brilliantly” highlighted why the SEC would not approve any of these applications. Related Reading: Want A Bitcoin Spot ETF?

					<description><![CDATA[Base, the Ethereum Layer 2 rollup developed by crypto exchange Coinbase, is already making a name for itself in the market. The blockchain’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has been on a rapid rise over the last few weeks, rising triple-digits in just the last two weeks alone. So the question now is, what’s driving the TVL growth? Meme Coins, Rugs, And Newcomers Unlike other Layer 2 networks, Base seemed to have gotten its big break with the growing trend of meme coins being launched on the network. The most notable of these was the BALD meme coin which went from less than $100,000 in market cap to over $50 million in a matter of days. As the popularity of BALD ramped up, so did the popularity of Base and decentralized finance (DeFi) traders clamored to bridge to the blockchain. Related Reading: Regulatory Pressure Mounts On Worldcoin, Can WLD Price Recover? The rug deployer rugged the project not long after, making off with over $9 million in liquidity. Following this, there were speculations of former FTX CEO and founder Sam Bankman-Fried Nverbeing the mastermind behind BALD, although nothing came from these accusations. However, instead of the blockchain’s first big project rugging being a deterrent, it seems to have had the opposite effect. More developers have moved to launch their projects on the blockchain seeing the potential. This includes the likes of SushiSwap, Uniswap, and Compound, among others, which have all provided support for the Base network. New projects such as Alien Base, SwapBased, and Krav have also been gaining ground with their TVL growing rapidly during this time as well. So for Base, it has been able to turn a negative situation into a positive one. Base Joining The Layer 2 Blockchain Race In the last two weeks, the Base TVL has grown from $13 million to more than $130 million, data from DefiLlama shows. This represents an almost 900% increase in TVL during this time, making it the fastest-growing Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain in terms of TVL.

However, when put in comparison against other established Layer 2 networks, Base still has a long way to go. It is currently the 5th-largest Layer 2 in terms of TVL, lagging well behind the likes of Arbitrum, Polygon, and Avalanche. Nevertheless, Base’s bull case continues to grow with over $203 million already bridged to the blockchain and daily active users sitting above 100,000 over the last four days. Given Coinbase’s backing and Base’s growing popularity, it may not be long until it becomes one of the most prominent Layer 2 blockchains in the space.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin mining has been up by a considerable fraction this year, as the blockchain network recorded a new all-time high in hash rate in the second quarter of the year. Mining revenue is also up, as the bitcoin Bitcoin recorded a spike in transaction volume.  As a result, Riot Blockchain, one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies in the US, has recorded an increase in operations in the second quarter. According to its 2023 second-quarter financial results, the mining company recorded a new all-time record hash while ramping up its Bitcoin mining operations. Solid Second Quarter 2023 According to its financial report, Riot has seriously ramped up its Bitcoin mining operations. As a result, the mining company produced 1,775 BTC during the second quarter of 2023, a 27% increase compared to the 1,395 BTC it produced during that same period in 2022.  In May 2023 alone, the company produced 676 BTC at an average of 21.8 BTC per day. The average cost to mine each bitcoin was $8,389, beating Q2 2022&#8217;s average of $11,316. Related Reading: More Selling? Bankrupt Voyager Sends Millions In SHIB And ETH To Coinbase Riot also witnessed an increase in mining revenue, as Bitcoin miners generated a remarkable total revenue of $2.4 billion. Although the price of Bitcoin during the quarter was 15% less than what it was in Q2 2022, Riot saw a total revenue of $76.7 million, as compared to $72.9 million in Q2 2022. Mining revenue ($49.7 million), engineering revenue ($19.3 million), data hosting revenue ($7.7 million), and power curtailment credits ($13.5 million) were also higher than in Q2 2022.  Not only has RIOT’s revenue from bitcoin mining increased, but their actual bitcoin holdings have also grown substantially. As of June 30, Riot held 7,264 BTC with the price of each BTC at $30,477. In total, Riot finished the quarter with $408.4 million in working capital, including $289.2 million in cash on hand and $221.4 million in Bitcoin, while also reducing its net loss to $27.7 million compared to $353.6 million in Q2 2022. BTC price remains volatile &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com  Increase In Bitcoin Mining Power Riot Blockchain also drastically increased its hash rate throughout the quarter, reaching an all-time record hash rate capacity of 10.7 EH/s. However, the company is also looking to enhance its computational power.  Related Reading: Want A Bitcoin Spot ETF? Then Prove BTC Is Not Manipulated, Says SEC During the quarter, the company signed a long-term purchase agreement with MicroBT to acquire 33,280 next-generation miners.

However, Riot&#8217;s power strategy contributes to the stability of the energy grid in Texas at times of high demand by selling extra power back to the grid. At the time of writing Riot&#8217;s stock is up by 1.53% in a daily timeframe and 158.14% in the past six months. Featured image from PYMNTS, chart from Tradingview.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In the dynamic realm of Bitcoin, the ability to discern patterns and trends from raw data is invaluable. Glassnode&#8217;s latest report, &#8220;Exhaustion and Apathy,&#8221; serves as a beacon, illuminating the intricate nuances of the current state of the market. Let&#8217;s delve deeper into the numbers and their implications. Historic Lows In Bitcoin Volatility The overarching theme of Glassnode&#8217;s findings is the unprecedented stagnation in Bitcoin&#8217;s volatility. The data reveals that the digital asset has been trading within a remarkably narrow $29,000 to $30,000 range. Historically, Bitcoin has been synonymous with volatility, making this current phase an anomaly. The report underscores this by highlighting the Bollinger Bands&#8217; tightness, noting, &#8220;The upper and lower Bollinger Bands are currently separated by just 2.9%.&#8221; Such constricted movement has been a rarity in Bitcoin&#8217;s tumultuous history. Related Reading: Goldman Foresees Q2 2024 Fed Rate Cut: A Boost For Bitcoin? Meanwhile, the dynamics between short-term holders (STH) and long-term holders (LTH) offer a captivating narrative. Glassnode&#8217;s data indicates a significant shift in wealth between these two cohorts. The STH&#8217;s wealth has burgeoned by +$22B this year, while the LTH has witnessed a near-identical reduction of -$21B. This shift is not merely about numbers but also about market sentiment and strategy. The cost basis further elucidates this dynamic. The STH cost basis has surged by +59% YTD, settling at $28.6k. In stark contrast, the LTH cost basis lingers considerably lower, around $20.3k. This divergence suggests that recent market entrants might be paying a premium, potentially due to FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) or speculative behavior. Glassnode&#8217;s exploration into spending patterns in this low volatility environment is also particularly enlightening.

Segmented View Of BTC&#8217;s Supply The report&#8217;s segmented analysis of Bitcoin&#8217;s supply, based on &#8216;investor holding time,&#8217; offers a layered understanding of market behavior.

In conclusion, Glassnode&#8217;s data-driven insights paint a nuanced picture of the Bitcoin market. The dominance of long-term holders, the historic lows in volatility, and the evident investor apathy all converge to suggest a market in a state of stasis.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the dynamic realm of Bitcoin, the ability to discern patterns and trends from raw data is invaluable. Glassnode&#8217;s latest <a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1691052457139355648" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report</a>, &#8220;Exhaustion and Apathy,&#8221; serves as a beacon, illuminating the intricate nuances of the current state of the market. Let&#8217;s delve deeper into the numbers and their implications.</p>
<h2>Historic Lows In Bitcoin Volatility</h2>
<p>The overarching theme of Glassnode&#8217;s findings is the unprecedented stagnation in Bitcoin&#8217;s volatility. The data reveals that the digital asset has been trading within a remarkably narrow $29,000 to $30,000 range. Historically, Bitcoin has been synonymous with volatility, making this current phase an anomaly.</p>
<p>The report underscores this by highlighting the Bollinger Bands&#8217; tightness, noting, &#8220;The upper and lower Bollinger Bands are currently separated by just 2.9%.&#8221; Such constricted movement has been a rarity in Bitcoin&#8217;s tumultuous history.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the dynamics between short-term holders (STH) and long-term holders (LTH) offer a captivating narrative. Glassnode&#8217;s data indicates a significant shift in wealth between these two cohorts. The STH&#8217;s wealth has burgeoned by +$22B this year, while the LTH has witnessed a near-identical reduction of -$21B. This shift is not merely about numbers but also about market sentiment and strategy.</p>

<p>The cost basis further elucidates this dynamic. The STH cost basis has surged by +59% YTD, settling at $28.6k. In stark contrast, the LTH cost basis lingers considerably lower, around $20.3k. This divergence suggests that recent market entrants might be paying a premium, potentially due to FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) or speculative behavior.</p>
<p>Glassnode&#8217;s exploration into spending patterns in this low volatility environment is also particularly enlightening. The data suggests that in such periods, the majority of coins moved on-chain have a cost basis that hews closely to the spot rate, resulting in minuscule realized profits or losses.</p>
<p>The Sell-Side Risk Ratio, a pivotal metric in this context, is languishing at an all-time low. To put it in perspective, fewer than 27 trading days (0.57%) have recorded a value lower than the current one, signaling a market teetering on the edge of a potential volatility resurgence.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[XRP has recently witnessed a remarkable surge in trading volume, with an impressive increase of $3 billion reported by Messari. This surge reflects the cryptocurrency&#8217;s enduring appeal, adaptability to market trends, and potential to disrupt traditional finance. Speculations abound about the factors driving this surge, sparking discussions on its implications for both XRP&#8217;s future trajectory and the broader cryptocurrency market. Despite this surge in trading activity, the expected correlation between volume and price failed to materialize, leaving market analysts puzzled by the intriguing phenomenon. XRP transaction volume. Source: Messari The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to unexpected fluctuations, but the recent surge in XRP&#8217;s trading volume has brought forth a unique puzzle. Unlike the traditional market dynamics, where a surge in volume often corresponds with a significant price movement, XRP&#8217;s price remained relatively muted.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Steals The Spotlight, Leaving Bitcoin Behind In A Week Of Price Surges This divergence has led experts to speculate that the surge in volume might not primarily represent genuine buying support for the asset. XRP Buyers&#8217; Attempt To Reclaim Higher Ground In a separate report, it was highlighted that the XRP price had staged a minor recovery attempt from the $0.6 support level the previous week. In an endeavor to regain higher ground, the coin price exhibited a short-lived 11.4% jump, only to encounter immediate resistance at $0.665.  The subsequent rejection candle at this crucial barrier spoke volumes about the prevailing market sentiment.

Anticipating A Potential Turnaround Amidst the price volatility, a key question emerges: can the falling XRP price rally once more? If the price does indeed witness another surge in buying pressure that propels it to the $0.6 support level, it could signal a concerted effort by buyers to accumulate the asset at a discounted rate. All eyes are now on the critical resistance level of $0.665. Should the XRP price manage to break through this barrier, it could serve as the initial sign of a broader recovery trend.

					<description><![CDATA[Argentine libertarian Presidential candidate and Bitcoin enthusiast Javier Milei has shocked the world by emerging victorious in Argentina’s recent primary elections. The pro-Bitcoin advocate scored the majority of the votes, making a stinging win during the Primaries on August 13. Javier Milei Demolishes Electoral Competition Javier Milei, an outspoken Argentine economist, is known for his sharp criticism of traditional politics and his fervent support of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin.

SHIB, PEPE, And APE Have Enjoyed An Uptrend Recently Bitcoin has been going through a major phase of stagnation recently as the number 1 cryptocurrency&#8217;s price has remained stuck between the $29,000 and $30,000 levels.

However, the meme coins have especially stood out. Shiba Inu, Pepe, and Apecoin, in particular, have all pulled away from BTC. Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin, also saw bullish momentum earlier, but the asset has slowed down recently.

SHIB and others haven't seen too high social volumes &#124; Source: Santiment The &#8220;social volume&#8221; here is a metric that keeps track of the degree of discussion that an asset is receiving on the major social media platforms. When this indicator has a high value, it&#8217;s a sign that a large number of users are talking about the coin and that there may be FUD or hype present around the coin. In uptrends, this metric reaching very high values is generally not a good sign, as it shows that FOMO is on the rise among social media users, which is something that has historically had an opposite effect on the price and has led to top formations. Since these metrics have risen for SHIB and the other meme coins, it means that social media users haven&#8217;t been paying too much attention so far to the pumps that these cryptocurrencies have been going through.

					<description><![CDATA[The journey of Cardano (ADA) toward reclaiming the $0.3 price level seems to be growing more challenging in the days ahead, as the cryptocurrency grapples with persistent bearish pressure. After successfully managing to hold the line at $0.3 during the latter part of July, the digital asset encountered a setback in early August when this crucial support level split, potentially paving the way for further price declines. The $0.3 mark not only signifies a March low but also acted as a pivotal resistance point during the months of June and July. This level demonstrated its resilience by transforming into a support level in late July and early August. Nevertheless, the breach experienced in early August did not immediately send ADA into a downward spiral.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Steals The Spotlight, Leaving Bitcoin Behind In A Week Of Price Surges However, recent price analysis reveals a concerning development: a retest of this level followed by a price rejection has formed a bearish order block (OB) on the daily chart. Founder&#8217;s Jab At Ethereum Adds Intrigue Amidst ADA Struggles Meanwhile, Charles Hoskinson, the visionary founder of Cardano, has thrown shade at Ethereum, a primary rival in the cryptocurrency landscape. I remember when we were brutally mocked by the ETH Devs about the design of Ouroboros.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The journey of Cardano (ADA) toward reclaiming the $0.3 price level seems to be growing more challenging in the days ahead, as the cryptocurrency grapples with persistent bearish pressure. </p>
<p>After successfully managing to hold the line at $0.3 during the latter part of July, the digital asset encountered a setback in early August when this crucial support level split, potentially paving the way for further price declines.</p>
<p>The $0.3 mark not only signifies a March low but also acted as a pivotal resistance point during the months of June and July. This level demonstrated its resilience by transforming into a support level in late July and early August. Nevertheless, the breach experienced in early August did not immediately send ADA into a downward spiral. </p>

<p>However, recent <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/what-to-expect-as-ada-retests-0-3-as-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">price analysis</a> reveals a concerning development: a retest of this level followed by a price rejection has formed a bearish order block (OB) on the daily chart.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In a recent note that has caught the attention of both traditional financial markets and the Bitcoin community, Goldman Sachs economists, including the renowned Jan Hatzius and David Mericle, have made a significant prediction regarding the Federal Reserve&#8217;s monetary policy. The note suggests that the Federal Reserve may commence a series of interest rate cuts by the end of June 2024. “The cuts in our forecast are driven by this desire to normalize the funds rate from a restrictive level once inflation is closer to target,” the Goldman economists wrote. This statement underscores the bank&#8217;s belief that the Federal Reserve&#8217;s current stance on interest rates may be too restrictive, especially if inflation rates continue to trend towards the central bank&#8217;s target. The note further elaborates: “Normalization is not a particularly urgent motivation for cutting, and for that reason we also see a significant risk that the FOMC will instead hold steady.” This cautious tone suggests that while Goldman Sachs is predicting a rate cut, they also acknowledge the unpredictability of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s decisions. Related Reading: US Bitcoin ETF Approval Could See North America’s ETF Volume Rise To 99.5% The recent data, which showed US inflation rising at a slower-than-expected rate of 3.2%, with the core consumer price index at a 4.7% annual pace, further complicates the picture. With the Fed&#8217;s benchmark rate currently set between 5.25% to 5.5%, Goldman Sachs expects it to stabilize around 3 to 3.25%. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin Price? Expectations of a rate cut from Goldman Sachs are in line with market expectations according to the CME FedWatch Tool. In May 2024, 68% already expect there to be at least a 25 basis point (bps) rate cut. However, it remains to be seen whether macro events will influence the Bitcoin price again. In the last few months, BTC increasingly decoupled from macro events while the stock market rallied towards all-time highs and stagnated around the $30,000 mark.

The high expectations for these two events, coupled with a dovish monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, could be a massive catalyst for the Bitcoin price. At press time, BTC traded at $29,426 and saw another calm weekend amid the liquidity summer drought.
