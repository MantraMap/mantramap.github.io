<p>The eagerly awaited Shibarium layer-2 scaling solution for Shiba Inu (SHIB) is nearing its beta launch, with the lead developer Shytoshi Kusama hinting in his Twitter bio that Shibarium may come as soon as February or earlier.</p>



<p>On Friday, Kusama inadvertently exposed a likely date for the beta launch, veiled in a word puzzle, through his Twitter profile, which reads;</p>



<p><em>“Tending the Pine Tree of Life. Quickly learning to play the flute before putting Shibarium in a heart-shaped box with a bow.”</em></p>



<p>Following the profile update, the<a href="https://zycrypto.com/explosive-moves-in-the-offing-for-shiba-inu-bonk-and-dogecoin-as-trading-volume-tops-25-billion/"> Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a> community has been trying to decode the message, with some concluding that Shibarium will be released on Valentine’s Day, February 14.</p>



<p><em>“Hints from the core developer suggest a Beta release on February 14th, based on tweets from Shytoshi Kusama and the SHIB HOLDER,”</em> one tweep wrote, echoing the thoughts of thousands of Shiba Inu adherents.</p>



<p>Late last week, Kusama issued another hint when he mysteriously tweeted;</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>During fall, the tree may have only a few leaves, but then spring appears…Luckily, Shibarium, in this context, is a Pine Tree. Still, it needs water, sunlight and proper soil. But pines survive and thrive during the harshest winters. (I also hear the needle tea is good for you.)</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>On Saturday, Kusama launched an official Telegram Group for Shibarium, which has over 12,000 members at the time of writing. He then stated that the channel would not communicate until the Layer-2 network is released, thus furthering speculation that it will be launched soon.</p>



<p>The latest developments have piqued the interest of the crypto community, with many speculating about the project’s potential and impact on the industry. Shibarium’s launch is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-renews-bullish-momentum-for-0-001-shib-as-massive-token-burn-expected/">expected</a> to scale performance for the Shiba Inu ecosystem and signals a shift in the industry as more projects are now looking to layer-2 solutions to boost scalability, privacy, and security. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Shib army has been eagerly awaiting the launch, with some speculating that it will cause the prices of SHIB and BONE to increase, potentially sending SHIB past $0.001.</p>



<p>In the last 48 hours, SHIB has jumped by over 5% and in the last week by a remarkable 21%, with the current price at $0.00001209. SHIB is trading at its highest level since November 2022, with a 43% increase from the start of the year.</p>

<ul>
<li>The developers of UDPN describe it as equivalent to SWIFT.</li>



<li>Some of the major banks expected to participate in the pilot phase include HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Deutsche Bank.</li>
</ul>



<p>A Chinese firm is developing a new payment system interoperable with stablecoins and CBDCs &#8211;  that acts as a link for central banks to transfer and swap regulated digital currencies &#8211; recently unveiled at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.</p>



<p>Dubbed the Universal Digital Payments Network (UDPN) and developed by Red Date Technology, the new system would reportedly work with the private sector, unlike the rival Ripple network, which mostly serves central banks. According to the announcement, several major banks, including HSBC, Deutsche Bank, and Standard Chartered, have been selected to participate in the pilot phase.</p>



<p>UDPN, in particular, noted that it would not work with decentralized public cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, perhaps underscoring its efforts to comply with the ongoing Chinese ban on cryptocurrencies. Beijing is keen to prevent any form of capital outflow in the form of stablecoins or digital assets.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-commercialization-of-udpn-is-scheduled-for-mid-2023"><strong>The Commercialization of UDPN is Scheduled for Mid-2023</strong></h2>



<p>Per the project’s whitepaper, UDPN is planned to debut with two separate stablecoins, with the pilot commercialization set for mid-year. In the near term, the project team expects the network to support most of the global CBDCs and regulated fiat-based stablecoins. The system would also be extended to include the interoperability of the traditional messaging networks.</p>



<p>UDPN has a common messaging standard in multiple digital currency systems, which is essential in enhancing interoperability in CBDC and stablecoins. The system will also accelerate access to a fully decentralized economy by commercial banks with a system managed by an alliance of financial institutions and fintech firms.</p>



<p>Technically, UDPN would have four main nodes – the validator nodes and the transactions nodes – all operated on-chain. The validator nodes would have a hyperledger and governance systems. The next set of nodes, which would operate off-chain, is the business and the transaction nodes. Compared to the SWIFT network, which has led to an increase in cross-border and inter-bank transactions, UDPN is touted by its developers as an important link in the future of digital currencies.</p>

<ul>
<li>The fork is a test environment for the upcoming Shanghai upgrade.</li>



<li>Shanghai is expected to unlock the withdrawals of the staked ETH in the Beacon chain.</li>
</ul>



<p>Blockchain developers successfully launched a ‘shadow fork’ for the upcoming <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereums-next-big-upgrade-slated-for-2023-heres-why-its-super-bullish-for-eth/">Shanghai upgrade</a> in the Ethereum blockchain. The shadow fork – a test model for the actual mainnet that lets developers check if the code for the proposed upgrade functions well on a real blockchain – happened Monday at 5:30 am ET.</p>



<p>Shanghai upgrade is expected to take place by March, and among the proposed amendments is to allow for the withdrawals of the staked coins, which happened during the proof of stake transition. Ethereum developers have also noted that more shadow forks will be released in the coming week in the run-up to the network upgrade.</p>



<p>Amidst the upgrade, technical problems were reported for some of the Ethereum’s nodes using Geth clients, according to developer Marius Van Der Wijden, who said that the network was working to have the clients synchronized with the rest of the network.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-next-update-a-testnet-is-expected-before-the-end-of-february"><strong>The Next Update, a Testnet, Is Expected Before the End of February</strong></h2>



<p>Also in the offing is a public testnet proposed by the developers to take place before the end of February. The test network is set to bring on board the staking firms to test the Shanghai upgrade. Ahead of the update, the blockchain developers have also noted that additional forks would copy the network&#8217;s data to the testing environment or the shadow fork.</p>



<p>The Ethereum community has been concerned about how soon they can access their staked assets. There have been delays in the past for such forks in Ethereum, including the most recent PoS merge. On-chain data shows that the number of staked Ether in the validator contract to be unstaked is 16,167,572.</p>



<p>In November, the team behind the Shanghai update introduced the Shandong testnet but later replaced it with an enhanced alternative. Ahead of last year&#8217;s big change to the Ethereum network, the Merge, the blockchain underwent several test forks before the final deployment.</p>

<p>Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, recently released a <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2023/01/20/stealth.html">guideline</a> for bringing privacy to transactions on the Ethereum network.</p>



<p>In a comprehensive blog post tweeted on Friday, the 23-year-old billionaire broke down the concept of stealth addresses, adding that Ethereum is working to develop the concept as a solution to the &#8216;last remaining challenge&#8217; for the blockchain.</p>



<p>Given the transparent nature of public blockchains, all transactions are easily viewable and traceable by default. &#8220;Anything that goes onto a public blockchain is public….and as such &#8220;, using the entire suite of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/report-shows-growth-in-multiple-ethereum-layer-2-networks-polygon-leads-the-pack/">Ethereum</a> involves making a significant portion of your life public for anyone to see and analyze.&#8221;</p>



<h2 id="h-stealth-address-system-explained"><strong>Stealth Address System Explained</strong></h2>



<p>Vitalik describes a stealth address as an address generated by either party in a transaction, with the power of control in the hands of only one party. Using a hypothetical Bob and Alice, a stealth address will depend on the creation of a secret key comprising elements of both party addresses to veil transactions from public notice.</p>



<p>The central idea, according to Vitalik, is to have the transaction registered on the blockchain, but the knowledge of the receiver is totally unknown through a method akin to OTPs that generate a unique validation code for a user with every transaction.</p>



<p>The stealth address system will serve as an impressive upgrade from the methods used by the asset-mixing platform Tornado Cash, which uses a mixing smart contract to mash multiple transactions together, making tracing difficult.</p>



<p>To solve the problem of settling Transaction fees which automatically makes the identity and destination of transactions public, Vitalik proposes either cost-intensive Zero Knowledge Proofs, also known as ZK-Snarks or the employment of &#8220;specialized transaction aggregators.&#8221;</p>



<h2 id="h-privacy-and-regulations"><strong>Privacy and Regulations</strong></h2>



<p>Brilliant as it seems, experience has shown that the concept of masking identities and hiding recipients may pose a challenge to regulatory compliance. Last year, key programmers for Tornado Cash became targets of government bodies over the mechanism of the platform, which is believed to encourage the escape of bad actors.</p>



<p>Ethereum, since migrating over to Proof-of-stake, many analysts have expressed concern about the network&#8217;s potential to tilt towards centralization and become susceptible to control.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen how Vitalik will tackle these challenges while promoting blockchain privacy. ETH has since gained over $100 in the last three days and is currently trading at $1638. The top-tier token netted 0.76% worth of intraday gains and is still on a cruise following the breath of fresh air sweeping across the crypto market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, has made some notable comments about <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripples-brad-garlinghouse-tells-where-crypto-market-is-headed-as-xrp-lawsuit-heads-for-conclusion/">Ripple’s ongoing case</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>As the 2023 World Economic Forum kicked off in Davos, Garlinghouse, amongst the many cryptocurrency CEOs present at the summit, spoke about emails from the SEC Director,&nbsp;Bill Hinman.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Garlinghouse explains that the emails, which will soon be handed over to the judge, who ordered that they be turned over to him, might help give Ripple another upper hand in the ongoing case.</p>



<p>Garlinghouse asserts with certainty that said emails might be harmful to the SEC&#8217;s case, as the content contained in the emails could be condemnatory.</p>



<p>In his words;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“When those come to light, I think that we will see more kind of like &#8216;How is it possible the SEC decided to bring a case against Ripple given what they were saying within their walls.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>He also expresses optimism about the case closing in its favour. He added that although the judges might spend a lot of time on the case, he’s sure of a resolution within the first half of 2023.</p>



<p><em>“Judges take however long the judges will take. We&#8217;re optimistic that this will certainly be resolved in 2023, and maybe [in] the first half. So we&#8217;ll see how it plays out from here. But I feel very good about where we are relative to the law and the facts.&#8221; the CEO said while speaking to CNBC at Davos.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-ongoing-lawsuit-fails-to-deter-ripple-from-hitting-new-milestones"><strong>Ongoing lawsuit fails to deter Ripple from hitting new milestones</strong></h2>



<p>Even though market players have maintained that the ongoing SEC vs Ripple case has cost Ripple a lot, the network can still boast about hitting some notable milestones.</p>



<p>Garlinghouse noted that Ripple still sits on billions of dollars, thanks to its revenue skyrocketing in the past years.</p>



<p>Ripple has partnered with a handful of leading companies over the past years. More recently, Ripple partnered with Palau to launch its national stablecoin.</p>



<p>With Ripple <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripples-win-in-xrp-lawsuit-against-sec-proves-pivotal-what-to-expect-from-the-market-this-year/">scoring major wins</a>, despite the ongoing lawsuit, market players are predicting that XRP is primed for a bullish eruption once the case comes to a close, especially if the verdict plays in Ripple’s favour.</p>



<p>However, if Ripple doesn’t emerge victorious, key figures like attorney John Deaton sights the downfall of many other cryptocurrencies and crypto platforms.</p>

<ul>
<li>SEC’s Commissioner Hester Pierce points out loopholes in the popular Howey’s test used to classify assets as securities.</li>



<li>Disgruntled with the back and forths in the regulatory framework, she calls for actual positive movements in the digital asset space.</li>



<li>Crypto enthusiasts on Twitter users see this as a step in the right direction by the SEC while they hope for a better year ahead.</li>
</ul>



<p>The Howey test has been used by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to determine if assets are to be classified as securities since 1946, but it is not without its flaws.</p>



<p>SEC’s Commissioner Hester Pierce has concurred with the point of most digital asset executives for the greater part of the year concerning the shortcomings of the Howey test. According to her, the test does not address the true status of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) when scrutinized holistically.</p>



<p>She explained that the test works with anticipated profits from an “investment contract” dragging in digital assets because of the expected profits by users at the initial purchase of tokens with a promise by creators to “<em>build a better network.”</em></p>



<p>Pierce argues that the investment contract should not be lumped together with the asset as they are meant to be exclusive though related.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Just because I sold you the orange grove as part of an investment contract doesn&#8217;t turn the orange grove into a security,” Well, look, a lot of these initial sales sure look like securities offerings, but then the question is, is that token, is the crypto asset itself, a security?” </em>she added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Pierce and many others, digital assets should not be lumped as securities in perpetuity but particular transactions singled out when they breach Security laws. Pointing to transactions rather than digital assets is imperative because Howey’s test alone is insufficient to place cryptocurrencies as securities.</p>



<h2 id="h-sec-must-find-positive-movements"><strong>SEC must find positive movements</strong></h2>



<p>For the SEC to grasp the digital asset market, there must be a proper regulatory framework to guide crypto executives and users. In 2018, SEC’s director on Corporate Finance, William Hinman, stated that BTC and ETH cannot be classified as securities because they are “<em>sufficiently decentralized.”</em></p>



<p>This benchmark has shifted with SEC’s chairman Gary Gensler hinting that ETH can be <a href="https://zycrypto.com/post-merge-concerns-heres-why-eth-could-be-viewed-as-a-security/">classified</a> as a security after its Merge. Pierce believes that this back-and-forth created by the lacuna in Howey’s test has slowed positive movements by the Commission in the sector. She went further to criticize the overall lack of clarity surrounding several aspects of the industry hoping for a change of events in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“The wheels of regulation and legislation move very slowly, and I think that can be both good and bad. In the crypto world, we&#8217;ve seen for a long time that there&#8217;s been a lack of clarity, which I think has led people to do things that they wouldn&#8217;t have done had there been clear guidelines.”</em></p>

<p>Yesterday, Cardano suffered an outage, with multiple Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) reporting that at least 50% of the network’s nodes went offline over the weekend.</p>



<p>According to a Telegram post by Input Output Global-the developer firm behind the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-is-buzzing-with-super-bullish-activity-as-ada-adoption-expands-to-new-realms/">Cardano blockchain</a>, the anomaly happened at approximately 00:09:00 UTC (between block 8300569 and 8300570) on Sunday, causing approximately 50% of Cardano nodes to disconnect and restart.</p>



<p>Developers pointed the outage to a “transient anomaly” affecting nodes, noting that while it impacted relay and block-producing nodes, edge nodes were unaffected.</p>



<p><em>“This appears to have been triggered by a transient anomaly causing one of two reactions in the node; some disconnected from a peer, others threw an exception and restarted”, </em>the post read.</p>



<p>The incident caused a brief interruption in the production of new blocks, resulting in some nodes becoming out of sync with the rest of the network. Nodes are network stakeholders responsible for processing and validating transactions. They are essential to the health and upkeep of any blockchain network.</p>



<p>According to the developers, “such transient issues”-even if they were to affect all nodes, were considered in the design of the Cardano node and consensus. Notably, they noted that “the systems behaved exactly as expected”, which explains the short period before the network’s recovery.</p>



<p><em>“It’s software, bugs happen, but it appears that Cardano’s design allows for things of this nature to happen and the blockchain will simply restart itself to keep going. This is what decentralization and smart software design are about &#8211; no single point of failure.”</em></p>



<p>And although the network sync had recovered to almost 100% at noon on Monday, the IOG team promised to conduct further investigations into the incident and implement further logging measures alongside their regular monitoring procedures.</p>



<p>Network outages have been a big issue for networks such as Solana. Validators on Solana have severally been forced to restart the network after <a href="https://zycrypto.com/after-over-10-network-outages-solana-proposes-a-genius-solution-to-solve-debacle/">outages persisted</a>, at times for several hours.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, despite the incident, the community has praised Cardano, particularly for the network’s ability to recover in minutes without any external help.</p>



<p><em>“Very glad to see how the network reacted to this incident, makes me believe in the project even more,”</em> one Redditor commented.</p>



<p>Another said, <em>“What makes me confident is that Cardano is built solid and without shortcuts. The fact that these kinds of problems were thought of and handled long before they occur is impressive.”</em></p>



<p>Notably, ADA, the native token for Cardano, continued to hold up strongly during and after the incident. At press time, the crypto asset was trading at $0.37, down 1.62% in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.</p>

<p>This week, Brazil and Argentina are set to declare the initiation of preparations for a shared currency, a move that could result in the formation of the world’s second-largest currency bloc.</p>



<p>According to a report by Financial Times, the two countries will discuss the concept at an upcoming summit in Buenos Aires and invite other Latin American nations to join. Further, they will discuss how the new currency, which <a href="https://zycrypto.com/brazils-congress-passes-bill-legalizing-bitcoin-ether-payments/">Brazil</a> suggests calling “Sur”, could help reduce reliance on the US dollar and boost regional trade.</p>



<p><em>“There will be  a decision to start studying the parameters needed for a common currency, which includes everything from fiscal issues to the size of the economy and the role of central banks,” said Sergio Massa,</em> Argentina’s economy minister.</p>



<p><em>“It would be a study of mechanisms for trade integration. I don’t want to create any false expectations. It’s the first step on a long road which Latin America must travel,”</em> he added.</p>



<p>Mr Sergio further confirmed that, although the project would initially be bilateral, they would invite other nations in Latin America. </p>



<p>The development comes even as the two economies fight to stay afloat amid a gloomy global economic outlook. Apart from its annual inflation approaching stubbornly high levels, Argentina has also been struggling to get funding from international debt markets since 2020, with its <a href="https://zycrypto.com/imfs-hidden-role-in-argentinas-crypto-pushback-rattles-crypto-community/">debts to IMF</a> alone standing at more than $40B.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the upcoming meeting has sparked discussions in the crypto community, with some observers proposing Bitcoin as the best option for the two Latin countries.</p>



<p><em>“Wonder if they would consider moving to Bitcoin &#8211; that would probably be the right long-term bet,”</em> Brian Armstrong, the CEO of crypto exchange Coinbase, wrote early Monday. Others called on the two countries to follow El Salvador’s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-officially-becomes-legal-tender-in-el-salvador-country-secures-first-400-btc-purchase/">footsteps</a> by making Bitcoin legal tender.</p>



<p><em>“Definitely would be a risky bet financially; El Salvador seems to be doing well for themselves since buying BTC daily. I’d be curious to see if Brazil will ever convert to BTC,” </em>another wrote.</p>



<p>However, some members seemed opposed to the idea, with Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal casting doubt on the cryptocurrencies volatility. According to the businessman, “<em>no one can have a national currency with 100% volatility that declines 65% in the down part of the business cycle and rises 10x in the upcycle.”</em></p>



<p>He was, however, quickly reminded that onboarding a combined population of 265M million people with hopes of expanding to other Latin American countries would help considerably with volatility. Moreover, unlike Bitcoin, fiat currencies were at risk of losing their value to zero due to external pressures.</p>



<p><em>“That (BTC) still sounds better than using the peso that has 90% annual inflation, controlled by a government that has a history of 9 debt defaults in the last 80 years. Argentina needs Bitcoin,”</em> one tweep told Pal.</p>

<p>Dante Mossi, the Chairman of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI), has claimed that El Salvador’s exposure to cryptocurrencies is “minimal”.</p>



<p>Speaking to Bloomberg Friday, Mossi noted that whereas Bitcoin’s popularity and adoption had grown since the top cryptocurrency was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-officially-becomes-legal-tender-in-el-salvador-country-secures-first-400-btc-purchase/">made legal tender</a> in El Salvador about two years ago, the population’s exposure to it was too small.</p>



<p><em>“We have seen that exposure, and we consider it very small “- it is a not significant one,”</em> said Mossi<em>. “We are interested that investors also know the real situation of El Salvador.”</em></p>



<p>The banker’s comments come amid growing criticism and uncertainty about El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment, especially after the crypto asset’s price plunged by over half its value in recent months. On September 7, 2021, El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/el-salvadors-losses-swell-even-as-president-nayib-bukele-adds-another-1-5-million-bitcoin/">purchasing</a> the crypto asset severally. As of July 2022, the President Bukele-led government had purchased 2,381 Bitcoin, according to his announcements on Twitter.</p>



<p>Bukele has been criticized for failing to disclose the country’s holdings officially, particularly after a November 17 announcement that they would continue buying one Bitcoin daily. Assuming that Bukele has lived up to his announcement, the Nayib Bukele Portfolio Tracker estimates that the country has spent more than $109 million on bitcoin but is down over $51 million based on current prices.</p>



<p>El Salvador’s unrealized paper losses have also been weighing down on the nation’s ability to access capital from lenders. Last month, Mossi’s multinational lender recently gave El Salvador a $450 million loan, most of which is expected to be used in repaying a bond next week. According to the banker, El Salvador was barred from using the financing to buy crypto assets, noting that the use of proceeds will be audited in six months.</p>



<p>CABEI has been working with the nation to compile information, which is expected to include disclosures on cryptocurrencies, before presenting it to the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/imf-issues-fresh-warning-to-el-salvador-over-bitcoin-adoption-but-president-bukele-focuses-on-the-positives/">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) for review and recommendations.</p>



<p>Recently, Cristosal, a human rights group in Central America, also called out Bukele’s administration for its “absolute opacity about the use of public funds” related to bitcoin.</p>



<p><em>“The lack of transparency leaves citizens without knowing the beneficiaries, quantities or reasons for granting the funds,”</em> Cristosal said.</p>

<ul>
<li>Recent data shows an astonishing growth of users and transactions among Ethereum’s growing list of layer 2 networks.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum have recorded increased daily user activity by 30%, 180%, and 40%, respectively. </li>



<li>Polygon has been tipped for massive successes this year with several network upgrades and more web3 projects before Q2 2023.</li>
</ul>



<p>The importance of Layer 2 solutions is becoming much more glaring as web3 adoption continues to grow, paving the way for developers to launch without compromising speed for scalability.</p>



<p>Layer 2 solutions have recorded a significant rise in the past three months in major metrics, including daily users, transaction volumes, and increased network fees. According to a report by blockchain analysis provider Token Terminal, the amount of assets locked in these networks is also rising. </p>



<p>Data from Token Terminal shows that Polygon has seen a surge in daily users since Oct 2022. As of October, daily users stood at 313,400 a figure that has nearly doubled to over 600,000 daily users. The increased transaction has led to nearly $55,000 in daily network fees for Polygon.</p>



<p>According to the data, Arbitrum One has grown by 40% and now has 41,695 daily users making daily fees over $40,000. Arbitrum also dominates the market share in terms of total value locked (TVL) on its network. TVL on Arbitrum is at $2.5 billion, accounting for 52% of the total assets locked on Ethereum’s layer 2 platforms.</p>



<p>Optimism has recorded gains of over 180% in daily network fees, which is a significantly higher increase than Polygon. The last three months have also seen daily users on Optimism spike by 190%. TVL on Optimism currently stands at $1.46 billion with a market share of 30%.</p>



<h2 id="h-polygon-s-developers-are-working-round-the-clock"><strong>Polygon’s developers are working round the clock</strong></h2>



<p>Among layer 2 networks, Polygon is tipped to have a more robust development in 2023. The network’s recent <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polygon-successfully-completes-performance-boosting-hard-fork-as-matic-targets-2-price-high/">hard fork</a>, which will reduce gas fees and improve its overall performance, can be described as an early sign of future developments.</p>



<p>Multiple projects are also set to migrate to Polygon from rival networks, including Solana’s yOOTs. Polygon has partnered with Xternity to migrate Synergy Land, a web3 game, from Solana. Last week Mastercard announced a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polygon-to-host-mastercards-web3-artist-accelerator-and-a-limited-time-release-nft/">partnership with Polygon</a> as it launched its web3 musician accelerator program aimed at helping artists build their brands leveraging on web3.</p>



<p>Polygon climbed back into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization after it was pushed out briefly by Solana this week.</p>

<ul>
<li>Trump’s NFT rises from the dead, with massive volumes soaring more than 800%.</li>



<li>The rise in trading volumes resulted in an increase in the price of the trading cards, with prices almost up by 100%.</li>



<li>Experts point to the news of the former President’s reinstatement on Twitter and Facebook as factors responsible for the surge.</li>
</ul>



<p>The Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which depict former US President Donald Trump as a superhero and cowboy, have had a bumpy ride in the market since their launch on Dec 15.</p>



<p>After several weeks of poor trading and slumping prices, Trump’s digital trading cards are now rebounding. Daily sales of the NFTs are now up 800% after volumes rose from $34,000 to over $306,000 last week.</p>



<p>Data from Cryptoslam also shows increasing numbers, with an additional $241,000 worth of sales in 20 hours. As the total number of NFTs traded continues to rise, the price is also making a huge leap in the same period. </p>



<p>CryptoSlam recorded 115 Trump NFT trades yesterday at an average price of $296 worth of Ethereum (ETH) compared to 704 NFT trades in just under 24 hours at an average price of $490. </p>



<p>Trump <a href="https://zycrypto.com/former-us-president-donald-trump-is-selling-superman-themed-nft-trading-cards/">launched</a> his NFT collection of 45,000 digital trading cards minted on Polygon on Dec 15. The cards, which depicted him as an astronaut, superhero, and cowboy, were worth $99 on the first release, with each coming with special perks like meeting and diners with the former President. </p>



<p>Despite criticisms from several quarters, the trading cards sold out within days before crashing in prices and recording low volumes. The former US Commander in Chief <a href="https://zycrypto.com/i-love-the-art-not-the-money-donald-trump-praises-his-first-nft-collection/">stated</a> that he released the NFTs because “<em>they looked super cute”,</em> and he loves digital art. </p>



<h2 id="h-trump-s-return-to-twitter-and-facebook"><strong>Trump’s return to Twitter and Facebook </strong></h2>



<p>While the reasons for the resurgence of Trump’s NFTs may not be concrete, many experts have pointed at the news of his possible return to social media giants, Facebook and Twitter as key factors. NBC News reported that the former President’s team had petitioned Facebook to reinstate his account following new documents it reviewed.</p>



<p>Trump’s Twitter ban recently was reversed after a poll conducted by new CEO Elon Musk although the former President is yet to come back on the platform. A re-appearance on top socials like Twitter and Facebook will be huge for the holders of the Trump trading cards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>XRP adherents remain confident that Ripple will trump the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the ongoing legal brawl. Attorney John Deaton, moderator of over 75,000 XRP holders participating as amici curiae in the case, recently reiterated this sentiment.</p>



<p>In a Twitter thread, the Crypto Law founder wrote that Ripple&#8217;s victory is certain thanks in part to the SEC stretching its arguments &#8220;too far.&#8221; He explains that the SEC claims the disputed XRP token &#8220;was, is, and always will be a security.&#8221;</p>



<p>The regulator also maintains that XRP sales make Ripple, exchanges, and XRP holders participants in a common enterprise. According to Deaton, this argument means that XRP satisfies all three prongs of the Howey test.</p>



<p>However, the attorney notes that the SEC has not presented evidence to back its later claims. Instead, Ripple has forced the regulator to admit that owning XRP does not give holders any rights in the company. XRP holders have also proven that they majorly purchased XRP without knowledge of Ripple&#8217;s involvement and for non-investment purposes.</p>



<p>Similarly, Deaton states that the SEC&#8217;s stance on XRP satisfying Howey is impossible to define in space or time. Based on this, Deaton asserts that those predicting XRP is doomed are overstating the SEC&#8217;s chances.</p>



<h2 id="h-ripple-coasting-to-victory-after-the-last-day-of-filing"><strong>Ripple coasting to victory after the last day of filing? </strong></h2>



<p>Deaton&#8217;s analysis comes after he opined that the SEC&#8217;s strongest argument would be to establish that Ripple sold XRP to fund itself. However, he notes that this path, too, will fail the securities watchdog. This is because it will lead to convincing the judge that the entire XRP ecosystem is the common enterprise.</p>



<p>He also pointed out that the SEC has attempted the argument through an expert witness. But it abandoned the witness following rebuff from Ripple and XRP holders.</p>



<p>Notably, the case has dragged on since December 2020 and finally reached the summary judgment stage. Experts in the XRP community speculate that this ruling may come <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-sec-suit-did-xrp-sales-violate-securities-laws-judge-could-declare-verdict-as-soon-as-june/">before June 2023</a>.</p>



<p>The general market sentiment is also anticipating the case&#8217;s outcome. The consensus is that a ruling in <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripples-win-in-xrp-lawsuit-against-sec-proves-pivotal-what-to-expect-from-the-market-this-year/">favour of Ripple</a> will cause the price of XRP to explode. XRP trades at around $0.41 at press time, up 3.62% in the daily chart.</p>



<p>However, there is also some concern as a ruling in favour of the SEC is expected to give the regulator more impetus to go after other crypto projects massively.</p>

<p>Cardano’s ADA is one of the major cryptocurrencies that led gains this week, rising 9% to an intraday high of $0.377 with weekly gains of 22%, per data provided by CoinMarketCap. The upsurge has driven ADA’s market capitalization to more than $13 billion, with the daily trading volume topping $700M.</p>



<p>Although there is not one specific reason behind ADA’s bull run, increasing decentralized finance (DeFi) activity could be one of them. Onchain data by Defillama shows a rise in transaction volumes across most NFT, lending, gaming, and DEXs built on Cardano.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides, Cardano&#8217;s enthusiasts <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ada-leads-weekend-gains-as-cardano-eyes-super-bullish-milestones-for-2023-bitcoin-ether-little-changed/">are optimistic</a> about the ongoing developments in the blockchain, including lace wallet and Hoskinson Health &amp; Wellness Clinic based in Wyoming. Lace is a Web 3 wallet platform on Cardano, released as a testnet for managing digital assets, NFTs, and DeFi services.</p>



<h2 id="h-cardano-is-pushing-ada-adoption-in-healthcare-and-entertainment-joints"><strong>Cardano Is Pushing ADA Adoption in Healthcare and Entertainment Joints</strong></h2>



<p>Hoskinson Health &amp; Wellness Clinic is a healthcare centre that is perceived as one of the ways Cardano is pushing for the adoption of its native token, ADA. The platform’s co-founder, Charles Hoskinson, recently announced that the new facility would accept ADA as payment. The centre offers medical services, including mental health care, health screening, nutrition, and women’s health. Last year, Cardano also announced the launch of Nessie’s restaurant and a whiskey lounge in Wyoming, also accepting ADA.</p>



<p>The surge can also be related to the activities around non-fungible tokens in the cryptocurrency space. The recent debut of the Shiba Inu-themed token <a href="https://zycrypto.com/explosive-moves-in-the-offing-for-shiba-inu-bonk-and-dogecoin-as-trading-volume-tops-25-billion/">BONK</a> equally caused a pump in the value of Solana’s SOL token. The macroeconomic factors also show that the inflation rate could be easing, and investors could jump in and drive crypto prices higher sooner than later.</p>



<p>Cardano’s positive sentiment happens amid an uptick in cryptocurrency market capitalization, up 6% to $1.05 trillion at press time. Bitcoin has reclaimed the $23k level, while ETH is also on the green, hovering above $1,650.</p>

<p>“I didn’t realise it would ask for contributions”, Sam Bankman-Fried responded as a Twitter user (@Compound248) pointed out the paywall to the embattled FTX founder’s newly opened Substack. Over the past few weeks, Sam has taken time to reiterate his innocence, pointing accusing fingers at rival Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao for the fall of FTX and claiming his company would have survived if it was allowed to live a few weeks longer.</p>



<p>“I am not aware” was another famous response to many questions prodded at the Bahamas-based founder as regards fraudulent operations between FTX and its money laundering sister arm, Alameda. Caroline Ellis, the now-defunct manager of Alameda who turned on Sam by pleading guilty, had disclosed to the government that Sam had knowledge of and in most cases, was in control of the multiple decisions to syphon user&#8217;s deposit. Sam and co-founder Gary Wang together owned Alameda.</p>



<p>Now broke and under house arrest with a pile of legal fees stacking higher than the empire state, poor Sam has turned to Substack to journal his own side of the story—or another swathe of implicative evidence. His lawyers are fighting hard to reclaim Sam’s $450 million Robinhood shares, which currently remain under government forfeiture, citing the need for their client to foot his legal defence as a necessary right.</p>



<p>In what looks like an interesting tell-all narrative on Substack, Sam declared to offer his total Robinhood shares towards settling aggrieved customers in turn for recognition of his directors and officers (D&amp;O) liability insurance. The ex-Forbes billionaire goes on to declare that FTX had approximately “$350 million in cash in excess of customer funds” when filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy. He further explained that potential funding offers to the tune of $4 billion were already in the pipes and could have injected more health into the ailing exchange, providing enough financial covering for customers—had it been allowed to stay a little longer.</p>



<p>What seemed puzzling to readers is that Alameda magically wiped off 80% of its $100 billion valuation in less than 48 months, per Sam’s calculations.</p>



<p>Sam has hired five lawyers and a spokesperson for the legal tussle ahead. Chief among them is Ira Sorkin, who represented the late Bernie Madoff—a popular American Ponzi conman who fleeced nearly $68 billion victims—in 2009. The number is oddly well-justified for a case of bankruptcy in two countries, multiple civil lawsuits from private and government institutions and a potential jail time in multiple decades. </p>
