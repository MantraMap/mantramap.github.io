<h2>Iran Condemns Unipolar World Order</h2>
<p>Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said on Tuesday that Iran plans to join the BRICS group to participate in the creation of a multipolar world, Russian news outlet Tass reported, citing his interview with Lebanese television channel Al Mayadeen.</p>
<p>He explained that after joining the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), Iran is “getting prepared to join” the BRICS group. The Iranian president was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>We condemn the unipolar world order which makes it possible for the United States and some three to four other countries to feel the rulers of the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said this week that the multipolarity trend will <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/putin-says-multipolarity-trend-will-intensify-warns-those-who-do-not-follow-will-lose/">intensify</a> and those who do not follow this trend &#8220;will lose.&#8221;</p>
<p>The SCO was established in 2001 as a political, economic, and defense alliance; it is the world’s largest regional organization. Iran recently became the ninth full member of the SCO, joining China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The group also has observer states (Afghanistan, Belarus, and Mongolia) as well as dialogue partners (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia).</p>

<p>Noting that the U.S. &#8220;sought to isolate Iran and hinder its participation in the SCO, but failed,” President Raisi stressed that the SCO membership has brought many benefits to Iran, including increased trade and access to new markets. Recently, the group revealed its plan to move away from the U.S. dollar and settle trades in the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/worlds-largest-regional-organization-to-switch-to-settlements-in-national-currencies/">national currencies</a> of its member countries.</p>
<p>As for the BRICS, Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said in June last year that Iran had applied to join the economic bloc, which comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The group is pushing to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-push-to-expand-global-influence-to-counter-the-wests-destructive-actions/">expand global influence</a>, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-getting-applications-to-join-every-day-attracts-19-requests-before-summit/">19 countries</a> have either filed an application to join the BRICS or have expressed interest to join.</p>
<p>The Iranian president stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are extending a friendly hand to any country that wants to cooperate with us. Iran wants to have constructive relations with all states on the basis of common interests.</p></blockquote>
<p>The BRICS nations have been ramping up their <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-de-dollarization-push-china-and-crypto-threaten-us-dollars-dominance-analyst/">de-dollarization</a> efforts and settling trades in national currencies. The group is also working to create a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-official-expects-agreement-on-brics-currency-this-year/">new common currency</a> that is expected to be discussed at the group’s next leaders’ summit.</p>

The law is expected to boost the country&#x2019;s technology sector, generate more jobs for its population, and attract foreign investment.</strong></p>
<h2>Bukele Signs Law to Boost Technology Industry in El Salvador</h2>
<p>The president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, announced Thursday on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#x2019;ve just signed into law the Innovation and Technology Manufacturing Incentives Act that eliminates all taxes (income, property, capital gains, and import tariffs) on technology innovations, software and app programming, AI, computer and communications hardware manufacturing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Commenting on the new tax law, Salvadoran Minister of Economy Mar&#xED;a Luisa Hayem described: &#x201C;El Salvador is ready to attract new investments in the technology sector, and thereby generate more jobs for our population.&#x201D;</p>
<p>El Salvador&#x2019;s director of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI), Luis Rodr&#xED;guez, was quoted by Diario El Salvador as saying: &#x201C;We welcome this commitment to the future of El Salvador, we are ready as CABEI to accompany this entire process.&#x201D; CABEI is a regional entity established with the objective of promoting economic integration and balanced economic and social development in Central America.</p>
<p>&#xC9;rick Chac&#xF3;n, president of the Salvadoran Fintech Association expressed his excitement about the bill to the publication when it was still being discussed in the Legislative Assembly weeks ago. He said that the new tax incentives would allow the ecosystem to expand and that these are important steps to position El Salvador as a technology and innovation hub.</p>

<p>El Salvador&#x2019;s new tax law is welcomed by many on social media. Venture capitalist Balaji Srinivasan commented on Twitter: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not about first world and third world anymore. It&#x2019;s about ascending world and descending world. And under @nayibbukele&#x2019;s leadership, El Salvador has entered the ascending world.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Dr. Rafael Fonseca, director for Innovation and Transformational Relationships at Mayo Clinic&#x2019;s campus in Arizona, tweeted:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you are not paying attention to what is going in El Salvador you should. The sound of business moving there will be loud.</p></blockquote>
<p>In September 2011, El Salvador became the first country to make bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. Since then, the country has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/el-salvador-buys-80-more-bitcoin-as-btc-fell-below-19k-president-insists-bitcoin-is-the-future/">accumulated</a> thousands of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/el-salvador-to-buy-bitcoin-every-day-starting-tomorrow-president-says/">regularly buying</a> bitcoin for its Treasury.</p>

According to its head of information security, the AI-based chatbot is “the new crypto” for bad actors and the social media giant is preparing for various abuses. </strong></p>
<h2>Malware Inspired by Chatgpt Is on the Rise, Facebook’s Parent Company Says</h2>
<p>Meta, the corporation behind Facebook, has found that malware purveyors are now exploiting public interest in Chatgpt, Openai’s chatbot powered by artificial intelligence (AI), to entice users into downloading malicious apps and browser extensions.</p>
<p>The company has identified around 10 malware families and over 1,000 malicious links that have been promoted as tools featuring Chatgpt since March, according to a report quoted by Reuters. On Wednesday, its representatives likened the phenomenon to crypto-themed scams.</p>
<p>In some of the cases, the malware delivered working Chatgpt functionality alongside abusive files, Meta noted. At a press conference on the findings in the report, its Chief Information Security Officer Guy Rosen remarked that for the bad actors “Chatgpt is the new crypto.”</p>
<p>During the briefing on Wednesday, Rosen and other Meta executives also pointed out that Facebook’s parent company is preparing its defenses for a variety of potential abuses related to generative AI technologies like Chatgpt.</p>

<p>The rising popularity and rapid development of platforms like the Microsoft-funded chatbot have raised concerns among authorities around the world, including that such tools are likely to make online disinformation campaigns easier to propagate, Reuters noted.</p>
<p>Meta executives believe it’s still early for examples of generative AI being used in information operations, although Rosen commented that he expects some bad actors to employ such technologies to “try to speed up and perhaps scale up” their activities.</p>
<p>In a statement issued after their meeting in Japan at the end of April, digital ministers of the G7 countries agreed that their developed nations should adopt AI regulations that are “risk-based” while enabling the development of AI technologies.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, entrepreneur and investor Elon Musk <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/musk-to-launch-truthgpt-says-microsoft-backed-chatbot-is-trained-to-lie/">accused</a> Openai, the developer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chatgpt</a> which he helped found, of “training the AI to lie.” He also announced plans to create a rival to the offerings of tech giants which he called “Truthgpt.”</p>

This unusual tactic exploits a legal loophole that allows the Treasury Department to mint platinum coins of any value. By delivering such a coin to the U.S. central bank, the Treasury would create enough funds to settle its debts. Though this proposal might sound bizarre, it&#8217;s gained traction as a potential escape route from the impending debt catastrophe.</strong></p>
<h2>The Trillion-Dollar Platinum Coin Idea to Stave off U.S. Debt Default Returns</h2>
<p>Devotees of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) will be thrilled to learn that the trillion-dollar coin concept is making headlines once more as America edges ever closer to defaulting on its debt. Just three days ago, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-warns-us-could-default-on-its-debt-by-june-1/">cautioned</a> that a U.S. debt default could likely result in an &#8220;economic and financial catastrophe.&#8221; As tensions rise over the debt ceiling, talk of the Treasury forging a trillion-dollar platinum coin has experienced a resurgence.</p>
<p>Insider reporters Juliana Kaplan and Ayelet Sheffey <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/debt-ceiling-solution-mint-a-trillion-dollar-platinum-coin-2023-5">quote</a> Rohan Grey, a professor at Willamette University College of Law and MMT advocate, as proclaiming the idea&#8217;s feasibility. Grey contends that &#8220;at this point, if any of the other solutions, the so-called more serious solutions would work, then they would&#8217;ve been used by now,” but they continue to disappoint. &#8220;The coin&#8217;s the only one that&#8217;s strong enough,&#8221; he asserts.</p>
<p>Back in 2020, during the initial stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, Grey collaborated with Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib on <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/basic-income-lawmaker-asks-treasury-trillion-coins/">a proposal</a> allowing for the U.S. Treasury to mint not one but two trillion-dollar coins for basic income purposes. Acclaimed journalist Joe Weisenthal <a href="https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1241382925817577475?s=20">hailed</a> it as just &#8220;the kind of break-the-glass thinking we need to address the scale of the crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even former President Barack Obama <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/obama-mint-trillion-dollar-coin-scariest-night-debt-ceiling-2017-1">touched on the idea</a> during a 2017 interview and suggested officials mull over this concept if financial turmoil engulfs the nation. In October 2021, U.S. lawmakers also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmakers-float-idea-of-minting-a-trillion-dollar-platinum-coin-to-avoid-sovereign-debt-crisis/">suggested</a> minting a $1 trillion platinum coin in order to magically bolster the treasury with cash for the same reasons.</p>
<p>Despite the buzz, Insider&#8217;s Kaplan considers the trillion-dollar coin plan &#8220;unlikely to fly,&#8221; noting that “Biden aides are looking at other legal workarounds.” The concept has elicited both ridicule and bewilderment on social media, with some commentators poking fun at the claim that this fabled trillion-dollar coin would be no larger than a standard one.</p>
<p>Shapeshift founder Erik Voorhees <a href="https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees/status/1653935801338822663?s=20">quipped</a>: &#8220;Thank god it would be no bigger than a regular coin.&#8221; Meanwhile, Wall Street Silver&#8217;s Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/WallStreetSilv/status/1653805219623448577?s=20">chimed in</a>: &#8220;They are starting to talk about the magical $1 trillion platinum coin again. This is really an &#8216;end of empire&#8217; type of economic strategy here. Why can&#8217;t they rationally discuss reasonable budget cuts to get things under control?&#8221;</p>

<p>Oddly enough, Nobel laureate <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-paul-krugman-criticizes-florida-gov-ron-desantis-opposition-to-central-bank-digital-currency/">Paul Krugman</a> maintains that adopting the trillion-dollar coin approach would not constitute an implementation of MMT. “I keep seeing people saying that this would be MMT, that we&#8217;d just be printing money to cover the deficit,” Krugman <a href="https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1653737642238832641?s=20">said</a>. “But it wouldn&#8217;t be that at all. The Fed would surely sterilize any impact on the monetary base by selling off some of its huge portfolio of U.S. debt.”</p>
<p>The Keynesian economist <a href="https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1653884390919876608?s=20">added</a> that “minting the coin is just borrowing through the back door. It&#8217;s not financing the deficit through seigniorage, it&#8217;s not a way to avoid interest payments. It&#8217;s just a bookkeeping trick to avoid extortion.”</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about the trillion-dollar platinum coin proposal as a solution to the United States&#8217; impending debt default? Do you believe it&#8217;s a viable option or just a bookkeeping trick? Share your thoughts in the comments below.</strong></em></p>

<h2>Bitcoin Difficulty Takes a Dip After Five Straight Increases</h2>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s difficulty level finally dropped on May 4, 2023, after increasing five times since the February 24 increase of 9.95%. The five difficulty increases combined equated to a 22.62% increase, and the latest drop brings it down <a href="https://btc.com/stats/diff">1.45% lower</a>. The change occurred at Bitcoin block height 788,256. At the time of writing, the network&#8217;s hashrate is 355.90 exahash per second (EH/s).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-586350 size-full" title="Bitcoin Miners Breathe a Sigh of Relief as Difficulty Drops 1.45% After Five Consecutive Increases" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/48.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Miners Breathe a Sigh of Relief as Difficulty Drops 1.45% After Five Consecutive Increases" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/48-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/48-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/48-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/48-190x107.jpg 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/48-380x214.jpg 380w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/48-760x428.jpg 760w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/48.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Just two days ago, the Bitcoin network hit a major milestone as its hashrate soared to an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-hashrate-reaches-all-time-high-of-491-eh-s-close-to-half-a-zettahash-as-network-preps-for-next-difficulty-change/">all-time high</a> of 491 EH/s at block height 787,895. But with the next difficulty adjustment just around the corner on May 18, 2023, and less than 2,000 blocks away, miners are bracing themselves for what&#8217;s to come. While the recent downward difficulty drop has given them some much-needed relief, current block times are still hovering above the ten-minute average. In fact, the last block interval was a lengthy ten minutes and 49 seconds.</p>

<p>In addition, the Bitcoin network is currently grappling with a mempool with over <a href="https://mempool.space/">200,000 unconfirmed transactions</a> waiting to be processed by miners. To expedite the process, users are shelling out a high-priority fee of $5.05 per transaction, while a medium-priority transfer will set them back $4.61. As for the <a href="https://btc.com/stats/pool">top mining pools</a> on May 4, Foundry USA takes the cake with 96.62 EH/s of hashpower, accounting for 27.17% of Bitcoin&#8217;s total hashrate. Trailing behind are Antpool (80.38 EH/s), F2pool (48.72 EH/s), Binance Pool (38.16 EH/s), and Viabtc (27.61 EH/s).</p>

The bill explicitly states that should the U.S. central bank, a federal agency, or a foreign government issue a CBDC, its use as a &#8220;digital medium of exchange&#8221; will be strictly forbidden in Florida.</strong></p>
<h2>Florida Aims to Protect Privacy with Ban on Central Bank Digital Currencies</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, the Florida House of Representatives endorsed the anti-CBDC bill <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/7054/?Tab=BillHistory">SB 7054</a> with an overwhelming <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/7054/Vote/HouseVote_s07054__377.PDF">116-1 vote</a>. This backing comes on the heels of the Florida Senate&#8217;s approval last week, which saw a <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/7054/Vote/SenateVote_s07054__020.PDF">34-5 majority</a>. Governor DeSantis has been vocal in his criticism of CBDC initiatives and asserting Florida&#8217;s refusal to accept &#8220;woke politics.&#8221; Unsurprisingly, he is eager to sign the bill, having <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fl-gov-desantis-proposes-ban-on-central-bank-digital-currency-use-as-money/">initially requested</a> its drafting in March.</p>
<p>Upon DeSantis&#8217; signature, SB 7054 provisions will come into effect on July 1, 2023. The bill offers a comprehensive definition of CBDCs and outlines its primary objective: &#8220;to safeguard Floridians by banning central bank digital currencies.&#8221; The author of the legislation confirms that these regulations would have no bearing on state and local revenue or any indeterminate impact on Florida&#8217;s private sector.</p>

<p>Florida&#8217;s Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis has championed the bill and maintained that the Biden administration&#8217;s priorities will not find fertile ground in the Sunshine State. He <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/609337-legislature-passes-gov-desantis-backed-ban-on-central-bank-digital-currency-with-democratic-support/">argued</a> on Wednesday that &#8220;The last thing our country needs is a federally controlled centralized bank digital currency (CBDC) weaponized by the Biden administration,&#8221; adding that it would merely enable unwarranted government surveillance of Floridians&#8217; financial data. He emphatically declared:</p>
<blockquote><p>Florida won&#8217;t let it stand.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, several Democratic lawmakers in Florida also supported the anti-CBDC legislation. While opposition to CBDCs has been primarily associated with Republicans, U.S. presidential candidate <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kennedy-jr-warns-of-mega-economic-crisis-says-its-not-just-the-banks/">Robert Kennedy Jr.</a> has cautioned against the potential for political suppression via CBDCs. &#8220;CBDCs grease the slippery slope to financial slavery and political tyranny,&#8221; Kennedy <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kennedy-jr-government-could-ban-seize-bitcoin-cbdcs-could-lead-to-financial-slavery-political-tyranny/">proclaimed</a> just last month. Florida&#8217;s Republican representative Wyman Duggan expressed pride in witnessing the bill&#8217;s passage and its subsequent arrival at Governor DeSantis&#8217; desk.</p>
<p>Duggan emphasized, &#8220;With this bill, we are looking to protect the privacy of Floridians, and I am so proud that we have seen support from leadership in our State that clearly cares about the wellbeing of our citizens.&#8221;</p>

The collapse of three major banks has sent shockwaves through the financial world, with their combined assets surpassing the top 25 banks that crumbled in 2008. The following is a closer look at what has triggered a &#8216;great consolidation&#8217; in the banking sector, a recurring theme in the industry&#8217;s history over the past century.</strong></p>
<h2>A Listicle of Bank Consolidation, Failures, and Issues Facing the U.S. Banking Sector</h2>
<p>The U.S. banking industry has taken a beating in 2023, with the market capitalizations of dozens of banks across the country dropping considerably in recent months. The reasons for this struggle are varied, with some blaming poor choices by financial institutions and others pointing fingers at the U.S. central bank. While it&#8217;s important to consider different opinions, a comprehensive listicle of information can shed light on the country&#8217;s &#8216;great consolidation&#8217; in the banking sector and the largest bank failures in the United States. So, let&#8217;s take a closer look at these developments and what they mean for the country’s banking industry.</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">In the year 1920, <a href="https://www.aba.com/about-us/our-story/aba-history/1900-1924">historical data</a> reveals that the United States boasted a grand total of approximately 31,000 banks. However, by the year 1929, this number had dwindled down to <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/about/history/timeline/1920s.html">less than 26,000</a>. Since that time, the number of banks has experienced a precipitous decline, plummeting by a staggering 84%. As a result, fewer than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_banks_in_the_United_States">4,160 banks</a> remain in operation today.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Out of the 4,150 U.S. banks, the top ten hold <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1372699/us-banks-share-of-fdic-insured-deposits/">more than 54%</a> of FDIC-insured deposits. The four largest banks in the country have amassed a whopping <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeConsorti/status/1653450092475449360?s=20">$211.5 billion</a> in unrealized losses, with Bank of America bearing the brunt of a third of that amount.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li aria-level="1">A recent Stanford study shows U.S. banks collectively had <a href="https://siepr.stanford.edu/news/many-us-banks-face-same-risks-brought-down-silicon-valley-bank">$1.7 trillion in unrealized losses</a> at the end of 2022 which is awfully close to their total equity of $2.1 trillion. American banks also hold nearly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-08/a-1-5-trillion-wall-of-debt-is-looming-for-us-commercial-properties">$1.5 trillion in debt</a>, which is due by the end of 2025. American financial institutions have also amassed a significant amount of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/charlie-munger-raises-concerns-over-troubled-commercial-property-loans-at-us-banks/">commercial real estate</a> that’s been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/10/business/commercial-real-estate-banks-offices/index.html">decreasing in value</a>.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The collapse of First Republic Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_bank_failures_in_the_United_States">third, fourth, and fifth largest</a> bank failures in the United States. <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/bank/index.html">Data</a> shows the combined assets of all three banks outpaced the top 25 bank failures of 2008.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/01/first-republic-bank-failure.html">provided</a> JPMorgan Chase a $50 billion credit line and noted it lost $13 billion from the First Republic Bank fallout. The FDIC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/flagstar-bank-acquires-signature-banks-assets-and-branches-excluding-cryptocurrency-operations/">estimated</a> the cost of Signature Bank’s failure to its Deposit Insurance Fund to be around $2.5 billion and the Silicon Valley Bank collapse <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/27/business/fdic-announces-first-citizens-purchase-silicon-valley-bank/index.html">cost the FDIC</a> $20 billion, bringing the total to $35.5 billion.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li aria-level="1">In addition to the recent First Republic Bank collapse, Pacwest Bancorp’s shares have been <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-PACW/">sinking steeply</a>. Over the past six months, Pacwest has lost 73% of its market capitalization value. Presently, Pacwest is weighing strategic options and a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-03/pacwest-said-to-weigh-strategic-options-including-possible-sale">possible sale</a>, according to people familiar with the matter.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Western Alliance Bancorp is also struggling with shares <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-WAL/">down 57%</a> lower during the last six months. While several of the failed banks saw significant withdrawals like First Republic’s $100 billion outflow in March, Western Alliance <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/04/western-alliance-says-no-unusual-deposit-outflows-after-first-republic-sale.html">claims</a> it has not seen any unusual deposit outflows.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/real-estate/2023/04/13/banks-making-loss-on-mortgages/11655704002/">Sources</a> and <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-sharp-rise-in-mortgage-rates-didnt-just-hurt-homebuyers-banks-are-now-losing-money-on-loans-d2d669ed">statistics</a> show that U.S. banks that provide mortgages lost an average of $301 for every loan that originated in 2022, down 87.13% from the $2,339 profit per loan in 2021.</li>
<li aria-level="1">In the second quarter of 2021, banks acquired a record amount of government debt by obtaining <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/25/business/banks-government-bonds.html">$150 billion</a> worth of 10-year Treasury notes. However, thanks to the Fed’s ten consecutive rate hikes, 10-year and 2-year treasury bonds in the U.S. are currently inverted. This means the banks with excessive reliance on long term bonds are struggling because the yields on the 2-year Treasury note are actually higher than the 10-year Treasury.</li>
<li aria-level="1">On May 3, 2023, the U.S. Federal Reserve <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-raises-interest-rate-by-25bps-insists-us-banking-system-is-sound-and-resilient/">raised</a> the benchmark bank rate and it is now at a <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/FRED-FEDFUNDS/">16-year high</a>.</li>
<li>In March, the four biggest U.S. banks by assets held, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo collectively lost <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-news-today-03-09-2023/card/four-biggest-u-s-banks-lose-47-billion-in-market-value-8fmAmiqs4PDb1F60OSFg">$52 billion of market value</a>.</li>

While analysts state that the purchases will be small and symbolic in the beginning, these will supposedly demonstrate a turnaround in the economy of the country.</strong></p>
<h2>Russia to Purchase Chinese Yuan for Reserves</h2>
<p>Russia will start purchasing Chinese yuan for the first time since the invasion of Ukraine, according to reports from local economists. The move marks a departure from the sell-off that the Russian Federation began executing at the start of 2023, cutting its numbers since February.</p>
<p>The purchase of these funds in Chinese yuan will help the country to keep piling up on its reserves, which had been cut by the seizures of more than $300 billion in assets due to Western sanctions enacted as a consequence of the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. About these purchases, Bloomberg economist Alexander Isakov <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-02/russia-nears-milestone-of-buying-yuan-soon-as-sanctions-oil-cap-hit-eases?leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The volumes of FX purchases will be small initially, but highly symbolic as they will show that the country instead of eating through reserves is building them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, other economists believe that the yuan purchases will start in June, like Dmitry Polevoy, an economist at Locko-Invest in Moscow, who also stated the buys will be very small at the start. This is seen as positive by some analysts, as it is seen as a good signal for the stabilization of the Russian economy.</p>
<p>Natalia Milchakova, an analyst at Freedom Holding Corp., stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It will be important for the market that the state is starting to accumulate reserves again instead of spending them. This may even positively affect the ruble.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Building Sanction-Free Reserves</h2>
<p>The report comes after the governor of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-russia-has-stockpiled-reserve-comprised-of-non-us-sanctioned-assets-governor-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on April 21 that the bank had focused on building a bank reserve comprised of non-sanctioned assets, but without specifying the nature of these assets. While the sanctions have affected some of its trading structure, Russia has survived and even thrived under these restrictions, managing to build a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-14/russia-built-80-billion-offshore-cash-pile-in-year-of-sanctions#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stash</a> of $80 billion in reserves held abroad, according to March reports.</p>
<p>This is, in part, thanks to the collaboration of allies like China and India, also members of the BRICS bloc, that have absorbed the oil production of Russia. There are also reports that suggest some of these countries are acting as proxies for Russian oil companies, buying large quantities of this sanctioned oil and &#8216;<a href="https://energyandcleanair.org/publication/the-laundromat-how-the-price-cap-coalition-whitewashes-russian-oil-in-third-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laundering</a>&#8216; it — shipping it to countries that have cracked down on Russian oil imports.</p>

<h2>U.S. Banking Crisis Continues</h2>
<p>The managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Kristalina Georgieva, talked about the U.S. banking crisis and a growing de-dollarization trend Monday at the 2023 Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California.</p>
<p>The IMF chief warned of more vulnerabilities in the U.S. banking sector, noting that the Federal Reserve&#8217;s rapid interest rate hikes have exposed weaknesses at some banks and that the pain may not be over. She said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It doesn&#8217;t mean that we have a free pass. It doesn&#8217;t mean that there wouldn&#8217;t be more vulnerabilities to come.</p></blockquote>
<p>Several major banks in the U.S. have failed in recent months, with the latest being First Republic Bank. On Monday, regulators <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-chase-assumes-control-of-first-republic-bank-following-seizure-by-california-regulators/">seized</a> the bank and sold virtually all of its assets to JPMorgan Chase. This was the largest U.S. bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>Georgieva praised U.S. regulators for their swift action in dealing with the collapse of First Republic Bank, emphasizing that she expects to see &#8220;new regulatory and disclosure thinking around how we deal with this.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Georgieva Sees Gradual De-Dollarization Trend</h2>
<p>The IMF managing director also talked about a growing de-dollarization trend globally. While Georgieva does not see any viable alternative among global currencies to replace the U.S. dollar as the world&#8217;s reserve currency in the near future, she acknowledged:</p>
<blockquote><p>There has been a gradual shift away from the dollar, it was 70% of reserves, now it is slightly under 60%.</p></blockquote>
<p>She believes the euro is the biggest competitor to the U.S. dollar while the British pound, the Japanese yen, and the Chinese yuan “play a very modest role.”</p>
<p>The BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are among the most notable advocates of de-dollarization. In addition to promoting the use of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-to-promote-national-currencies-before-issuing-common-one/">national currencies</a>, the economic bloc is working to create <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-working-on-creating-new-currency-to-be-discussed-at-next-leaders-summit/">a new currency</a> that will help its member countries reduce their reliance on the USD. A Russian official recently stated that he expects an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-official-expects-agreement-on-brics-currency-this-year/">agreement</a> on a BRICS currency to be reached this year.</p>

Token Prices and user bases are plummeting and revenue streams of such projects are no longer functioning. So, is this it for the P2E, and is there a way out?</span></i>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<b>May 4, 2023, MAH&#xC9;, SEYCHELLES</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#x2013; After a tumultuous two years, the market cap for GameFi tokens stood at a staggering $27 Billion USD at the start of 2022. Fast forward to 2023, and that amount stands at a much cooler figure of just over $3 Billion USD. </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Experienced game developers like Red Pill Company put this down to one simple fact &#x2013; that these games did not focus on creating sustainable project revenue streams and engaging mechanics for the players. As a result, a project&#x2019;s revenue streams become non-existent, and the project dies. When there is a significant decline in the crypto space, the benefits become much less attractive for players &#x2013; and that is what has been seen in the industry this past year. </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply put, not enough focus has been put on creating mechanics that attract and retain players and diverse and functional revenue streams. Now that the classic P2E games are not earning well, they have become defunct. The P2E market as we know it has died. </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<b>How ScapesMania Takes the Best from the Casual Market</b>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the flip side, there has been a notable increase in the casual Web2 gaming market in the same time period. Sidestepping the difficulty of fluctuating markets and relying instead on fantastic and engaging gameplay, Web2 casual gaming has stormed ahead of the competition. What&#x2019;s more, the crucial parts of casual projects are the engaging gameplay that keeps players coming back, as well as well-established and functioning project revenue streams that allow the projects to prosper.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#13;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#13;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Precisely in this vein, the experienced blockchain game dev studio Red Pill Company has designed their newest project, </span><a href="https://scapesmania.io/?utm_source=Bitcoincom&utm_medium=mmedia"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ScapesMania</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to capture some of the growing casual gaming market that has already reached $15.51 Billion in revenue in 2022 and is projected to hit $24.9 Billion by 2027. </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With a hybrid-casual approach, </span><a href="https://scapesmania.io/?utm_source=Bitcoincom&utm_medium=mmedia"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ScapesMania</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sidesteps the issues of the dying P2E market by, to put it simply, not being a P2E and focusing on the gameplay and functioning project revenue streams. ScapesMania will appeal to the mass audience of Web2 casual players with its engaging mechanics and colourful art style.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For Web3 users, the benefits are numerous &#x2013; token holders can influence the project&#x2019;s direction through DAO Governance and make decisions on various events and features, such as buyback, burn and token staking, and receive game engagement benefits, as well as impact the development of an entire ecosystem of different games connected through the $MANIA token.
