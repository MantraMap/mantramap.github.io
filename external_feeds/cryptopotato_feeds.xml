			            <description><![CDATA[The SEC is seeking to appeal the Ripple ruling, while applications for a Bitcoin ETF are piling up. It seems the CFTC is doing the actual securities enforcement.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is leaving securities enforcement up to the CFTC when it comes to cryptocurrency. While the commission rushes ahead of Congress to write the entire federal crypto policy by lawsuit, the CFTC is going for more clear-cut violations.</p>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission took the lead late last week and filed charges of securities fraud against a cryptocurrency business in Florida. It <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8766-23" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">filed the</a> charges in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida.</p>
<h2>CFTC Charges Florida Residents for Crypto Scam</h2>
<p>The CFTC <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/4-people-charged-for-allgedly-defrauding-investors-in-crypto-and-precious-metal-scam/" data-wpel-link="internal">charged</a> four individuals in three states and their unregistered entity &#8220;Fundsz&#8221; with allegations of securities fraud Friday:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The complaint charges them with fraudulent solicitation from clients to purportedly trade in cryptocurrencies and precious metals.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The commission&#8217;s Director of Enforcement, Ian McGinley, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The CFTC continues to root out individuals who defraud customers in the cryptocurrency and precious metals markets.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>But the allegations faced by defendants in this case are actually within the purview of the SEC, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-xrp-cto-david-schwartz-breaks-down-howey-test-following-sec-appeal/" data-wpel-link="internal">according</a> to the Howey test in the recent Ripple court case.</p>
<h2>Commodity Futures Doing SEC&#8217;s Job</h2>
<p>This case is kind of like what <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/a-closer-look-at-what-sam-bankman-fried-is-accused-of-exactly/" data-wpel-link="internal">FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried</a> is in trouble for with the law. It&#8217;s not that they the defendants were selling Fugazi and claiming it&#8217;s Rolex. It&#8217;s that they were selling Rolex and claiming it&#8217;s a really great Fugazi.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not so great when people lose their money to something they thought was less risky during a 75% Bitcoin price plunge.</p>
<p>These are clear cut allegations of selling unregistered and unregulated securities. It&#8217;s the sort of thing the SEC could actually be effective at enforcing.</p>
<p>McGinley warns crypto investors seeking online brokerages and crypto exchanges:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Though the products fraudsters purport to trade and their methods of attracting victims—in this case through social media—may have changed, the old adage ‘if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is’ remains as valid as ever.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That advice is just as good for considering a rare <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-to-judge-crypto-is-baseball-cards-not-stocks/" data-wpel-link="internal">baseball card purchase</a> as a high flying stock buy.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[While Bittrex Global remains exempt from any financial obligation, its US division has agreed to pay a $24 million settlement with the SEC.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bittrex reached a $24 million settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under this arrangement, Bittrex and Bittrex Global have settled with the federal regulator, agreeing to make payments totaling $14.4 million for disgorgement (repayment of unjust profits), $4 million for prejudgment interest, and $5.6 million in civil penalties to resolve the legal conflict.</p>
<p>Even though both parties were able to avoid the effort and cost of litigation, Bittrex CEO Oliver Linch said that &#8220;now is not the time for a victory lap.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Bittrex&#8217;s Statement After $24M Settlement</h2>
<p>While Bittrex&#8217;s US arm agreed to pay $24 million in the settlement, it will refrain from acknowledging or refuting the accusations and is also restricted from issuing any public communication that could imply the absence of a factual foundation for the SEC&#8217;s allegations.</p>
<p>Deeming the resolution to be a quick one, considering pending lawsuits against Binance, Coinbase, etc., Bittrex&#8217;s boss Linch said in a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230816932630/en/Bittrex-Global-Reaches-Successful-Settlement-with-the-SEC" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">statement</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are delighted that a settlement on these terms has been quickly reached. While it is good news for Bittrex Global, now is not the time for a victory lap. Instead, with this matter behind us, we can concentrate on building our vision for the future of crypto, as a regulated, mature, and sophisticated part of the wider financial ecosystem.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Linch asserted that Bittrex Global dedicated significant resources to ensure that they do not accept US customers. The exec went on to state that the company solely caters to clients and provides services exclusively outside the US.</p>
<p>He further added that Bittrex Global is a non-US-regulated digital assets exchange that market participants around the world should engage with &#8220;who are increasingly wary of having any connection to the United States given its regulatory uncertainty.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Lawsuit and Subsequent Backlash</h2>
<p>In an April filing, the SEC alleged that Bittrex&#8217;s US arm and its co-founder and former CEO, William Shihara, were involved in operating an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. The financial regulator also initiated a distinct enforcement action against Bittrex Global for its management of a shared order book in conjunction with Bittrex.</p>
<p>The crypto exchange filed for <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-exchange-bittrex-files-for-us-bankruptcy-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bankruptcy</a> in Delaware on May 8th, months after announcing it would shut down its operations in the country and weeks after being <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bittrex-receives-wells-notice-from-sec-for-violating-investor-protection-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">sued</a> by the SEC. The regulatory authority&#8217;s enforcement actions <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/paradigm-criticizes-secs-actions-against-bittrex-in-new-amicus-brief-filing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">prompted</a> severe backlash from industry players.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; San Francisco, USA, August 16th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>Linera reaches a total of $12M in seed funding. The new round of funding was led by Borderless Capital with contributions from a16z crypto, Laser Digital Ventures, Matrixport, Flow Traders, GSR Markets, and more</p>
<p><a href="https://linera.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Linera</a>, the first blockchain network scalable via microchains, has successfully closed an additional $6M round, led by Borderless Capital. Founded by Mathieu Baudet, former Meta researcher on the Novi digital payments wallet and a cryptographic protocols specialist, Linera&#8217;s pioneering technology aims to bring web2 scalability to web3 applications by introducing an unlimited number of user chains powered by an elastically scalable network.</p>
<p>Linera has now secured a total of $12M in seed funding, with the most recent $6 million follow-on investment round led by Borderless Capital. Notable participants include Laser Digital Ventures, DFG, Cadenza, Block1, Eterna Capital, MH Ventures, Matrixport, L2IV, ArkStream, Flow Traders, GSR Markets, and Open Web Collective (OWC), alongside continued support from a16z crypto, Tribe Capital, and Cygni Capital, who participated in the initial seed round.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Among new web3 architectures emerging like the move away from a single monolithic blockchain, Linera’s microchains are a completely new and necessary evolution. Further, Linera’s capacity for linear scaling is designed to support millions and conceivably billions of simultaneous transactions. And, while unprecedented, this kind of performance and reliability is essential for web3 to actually scale applications like payments, messaging, trading, AI, and more to billions of users around the world,&#8221; <strong>said Alpen Sheth, Senior Partner at Borderless Capital. </strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Linera has made significant progress since we led their initial seed round last year, and we&#8217;re excited to expand our support for the project. Mathieu and the Linera team have designed a truly innovative multi-chain architecture that unlocks a broader design space for developers and their end users. We can&#8217;t wait to see how the ecosystem takes shape and the utilities it enables as Linera advances into the devnet and testnet phases,&#8221;<strong> said Ali Yahya, General Partner at a16z crypto.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Linera recently made its initial software development kit (SDK) available for testing, targeting Rust developers. Thanks to the new funding, Linera will be expanding the team, launching a devnet and a testnet for the protocol and fostering a strategic presence in the APAC region while continuing to grow their developer academy.</p>
<h2>From Microchains to Mass-Scalable Applications</h2>
<p>The competition for blockspace in traditional Layer 1 blockchains, coupled with limited production rates and block sizes, creates a bottleneck during traffic peaks, leaving users outpriced or delayed, rendering the infrastructure effectively unavailable.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’ve taken a step back to completely redesign a blockchain infrastructure that scales from the start,” <strong>said Mathieu Baudet, founder and CEO of Linera.</strong> “Linera’s unique multi-chain architecture ensures predictable performance, responsiveness, and robust security at Internet scale.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Linera empowers developers to create high-speed web3 applications used by a large number of active users in parallel, revolutionizing decentralized infrastructure for a variety of use cases, including retail payments, gaming micro-payments, messaging, proprietary trading, and blockchain bridges.</p>
<p>The Linera system scales by adding chains, not by increasing the size or the production rate of blocks. Its groundbreaking microchain model grants each individual user their own lightweight chains, which integrate into browser extensions or mobile devices for streamlined web3 app interactions within their wallets. During times of high demand, Linera&#8217;s validators expand dynamically like elastic web services.</p>
<p>Linera&#8217;s innovative design is rooted in the expertise that Mathieu Baudet acquired at Meta while contributing to the Libra (now Diem) blockchain and co-authoring the academic paper &#8220;FastPay&#8221;, which laid the foundations for the Linera protocol. Bernadette Cay, Linera&#8217;s COO, brings extensive experience in launching products from Google and MoPub, the mobile ad exchange acquired by Twitter.</p>
<h2>About Linera</h2>
<p>Linera is the first low-latency blockchain designed to scale elastically like web2 applications. Founded by Mathieu Baudet, a former Meta Novi engineer and researcher, with a PhD in cryptographic protocols, Linera revolutionizes blockchain scalability by introducing microchains, removing mempools, and minimizing validator interactions. Linera optimizes performance for web3 applications used by a large number of active users in parallel, enabling unprecedented horizontal scalability for use cases such as retail payments, gaming micro-payments, messaging, proprietary trading, and blockchain bridges.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Christian Bale might have a new movie contract soon.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michael Burry, one of the Tradfi banking industry&#8217;s most notorious bears, just put a $1.6 billion hit out on the U.S. stock market. What happens to bitcoin while the grownups are fighting?</p>
<p>The Scion Capital founder, who famously shorted mortgage-backed securities before the 2007 housing crisis, just gave the stock market a $1.6 billion shove of puts in SPY and QQQ!</p>
<h2>Michael Burry Bets $1.6B on Stock Market Crash</h2>
<p>Steve Anderson <a href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-big-short-redux-michael-burry-shorts-market-big" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">writes at</a> TipRanks:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Michael Burry made a name for himself by shorting the market to the point where they made a movie about him called &#8216;The Big Short.&#8217; But is he preparing for a time when lightning will strike twice?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>During the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis, big bets against Wall Street&#8217;s housing market earned Burry $100 million in personal profit. His big contrarian trade made some $700 million in profits for his clients.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, he <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/big-shorts-michael-burry-says-he-was-wrong-to-say-sell/" data-wpel-link="internal">flipped bullish</a> and bought a bunch of finance stocks, but the market wizard behind Scion Capital is apparently very certain of a near-term stock market crash.</p>
<p>The sheer percentage of his portfolio Burry has devoted to this trade shows far more conviction than his long positions in banks earlier this year.</p>
<h2>How Would a Stock Market Crash Affect BTC?</h2>
<p>What could it mean for bitcoin&#8217;s price?</p>
<p>Stocks and bitcoin have followed <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-correlation-with-us-equities-at-2-year-low-potential-bullish-signal/" data-wpel-link="internal">various correlation</a> regimes, but it&#8217;s clear there&#8217;s some correlation. An event as massive as one Burry&#8217;s trade anticipates would be so global it would undoubtedly impact <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">BTC</a>.</p>
<p>Most likely, a sell-off would ensue on the net as investors go for cash to make up for equities losses or go bargain hunting for stocks. But it could result in a rocketing resurgence of bitcoin&#8217;s price when stocks recover.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history?period1=1577836800&amp;period2=1609372800&amp;interval=1d&amp;filter=history&amp;frequency=1d&amp;includeAdjustedClose=true" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">what happened in</a> 2020, when gains on Wall Street were matched by bitcoin gains, only with massive leverage in the percentages.</p>
<p>While the market does digest news faster than ever, Scion&#8217;s big short is no cause for immediate alarm. It took years for the housing market to unwind, so a bear market as bad as Burry is predicting could be some time off yet. Additionally, he has had quite a few wrong predictions in the past.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple&#8217;s price is yet to show any sign of bullishness after a decisive rejection from a significant resistance level. However, the market has currently reached a point where a rebound is probable.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>Against USDT, the cryptocurrency has been correcting since failing to break above the $0.9 level earlier in July. The 50-day moving average is broken to the downside, and the market is currently testing the significant $0.6 support level.</p>
<p>If this area holds, the investors may be optimistic about the price rallying towards the $0.9 resistance zone in the coming weeks. On the other hand, a breakdown of the mentioned support level would lead to a deeper drop toward the 200-day moving average, located around the $0.5 mark.</p>

<h3>Against BTC</h3>
<p>Looking at the chart against Bitcoin, things look worse. The price has broken below the 2200 SAT level, and the 50-day moving average located around the 2100 SAT mark.</p>
<p>Things seem worse, as the price is seemingly targeting the 200-day moving average and the nearby static support level at the 1800 SAT mark. Yet, this scenario could be invalidated in case the market climbs back above the broken 50-day MA.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dogecoin ($DOGE) and Shiba Inu’s ($SHIB) prices have tanked in the past week, sending meme coin enthusiasts searching for stability.</p>
<p>However, as uncertainty looms over these well-established tokens, the crypto community’s eyes are now turning to emerging meme coins that promise potential gains.</p>
<p>In that regard, Sonik Coin ($SONIK) and Wall Street Memes ($WSM) have gained significant traction, capturing the attention of both beginners and veteran traders.</p>
<h2>$DOGE &amp; $SHIB’s Sudden Decline Surprises Meme Coin Investors</h2>
<p>Meme coin investors watched in awe as $DOGE and $SHIB produced impressive returns throughout June and July – yet this bullishness now appears to be a thing of the past.</p>
<p>The recent price downturn has sparked concern among their communities, raising questions about their long-term viability.</p>
<p>Dogecoin, which touched the $0.105 level earlier this year, has seen a sharp decline, now languishing around the $0.069 mark.</p>
<p>The $DOGE price has fallen 9% in the past three days alone, erasing most of the gains made in the first week of August.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-24.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266920" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-24.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="304" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-24.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-24-300x151.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-24-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Shiba Inu, not to be outdone by its predecessor, also soared earlier this year to $0.0000157 but has since dropped 38% to $0.0000096.</p>
<p>$SHIB also breached the psychological level of $0.000010 to the downside in its recent bearish leg, with the token now tapping the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) as support.</p>
<p>Perhaps more worryingly, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CoinMarketCap data</a> for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu shows that trading volumes have actually increased significantly in the past 24 hours, suggesting that the recent price drops may be due to large investors liquidating their positions.</p>
<h2>Numerous Factors Play into Dogecoin &amp; Shiba Inu Headwinds</h2>
<p>Several factors have contributed to this downward spiral in the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices.</p>
<p>Firstly, regulatory concerns continue to weigh over the broader crypto market, with the SEC’s appeal against the favorable Ripple court ruling putting a downer on investors.</p>
<p>Although this appeal has nothing to do with Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, its implications for the crypto market could be far-reaching.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-23.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266919" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-23.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="264" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-23.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-23-300x132.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-23-50x22.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>As a result, the prevailing mood of doubt has bled into the meme coin space, affecting $DOGE and $SHIB.</p>
<p>Secondly, the meme coin space&#8217;s volatile nature means that there&#8217;s always a search for the &#8220;next big thing,&#8221; meaning that support for older coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu could be waning.</p>
<p>As newer coins with more promising prospects emerge, the allure of $DOGE and $SHIB has taken a hit – resulting in the recent price declines.</p>
<h2>Sonik Coin Presale Zooms Past $29k Thanks to Early Buzz &amp; Staking Rewards</h2>
<p>As legacy meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu falter, the new meme token <a href="https://cryptopotato.care/box_3bb03a9e65107f306e2760608ad07313?referrer=dogecoin-shiba-inu-prices-tank-as-crypto-market-turns-bearish-but-traders-are-backing-these-new-meme-coins-to-explode" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sonik Coin ($SONIK)</a> has rapidly built momentum.</p>
<p>The project recently launched a presale for its $SONIK token, raising over $29,000 in the first two days.</p>
<p>Investors have been clamoring to get involved in the Sonik Coin presale, given that tokens are on offer for just $0.000014.</p>
<p>Moreover, the presale has a low hard cap of just over $2 million, meaning that it&#8217;s unlikely to last for an extended period if the current momentum is sustained.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-17.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266918" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-17.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="197" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-17.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-17-300x98.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-17-50x16.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Much of this momentum is driven by the potential of Sonik Coin’s staking protocol, which currently offers an estimated APY of 2,451% for stakers.</p>
<p>As outlined in <a href="https://www.sonikcoin.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sonik Coin’s whitepaper</a>, 40% of the total $SONIK supply has been set aside for staking rewards, attracting long-term holders, and ensuring a robust incentive structure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvmP-hBy_cM" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Crypto influencer Jacob Bury</a>, who has over 20,000 YouTube subscribers, has already endorsed Sonik Coin, praising its staking protocol and growth potential.</p>
<p>Bury’s backing, combined with Sonik Coin&#8217;s unique branding and community-centric tokenomics, has primed the project for a possible rally in the crowded meme coin market.</p>

<h2>Wall Street Memes Presale Nears Final Stage Ahead of Major Exchange Listings</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=dogecoin-shiba-inu-prices-tank-as-crypto-market-turns-bearish-but-traders-are-backing-these-new-meme-coins-to-explode" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes ($WSM)</a> is another meme coin traders are backing amid Dogecoin and Shiba Inu&#8217;s price volatility.</p>
<p>This trending meme coin project has made headlines in recent months thanks to the unprecedented success of its presale phase.</p>
<p>Wall Street Memes’ presale is now in Stage 29 out of 30, having raised a remarkable $24.2 million in funding from early investors.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-9.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266917" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-9.jpg" alt="Picture5" width="602" height="196" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-9.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-9-300x98.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-9-50x16.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>With one stage left before the $WSM token makes its open market debut, potential buyers now only have a limited chance to take part in the presale for just $0.0334 per token.</p>
<p>Many in the <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes Telegram community</a> believe this could be the last opportunity to acquire $WSM at a bargain price before a potential surge in value post-listing.</p>
<p>Although the specific exchanges have not yet been announced, Wall Street Memes&#8217; roadmap notes plans for Tier-1 CEX listings, further fueling anticipation among community members.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEOKwkWIpsw&amp;pp=ygUYd2FsbCBzdHJlZXQgbWVtZXMgY3J5cHRv" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">prominent YouTubers like Zach Humphries</a> already discussing the potential of $WSM on their channels, the project is receiving a sustained boost in visibility – setting the stage for an exciting few weeks ahead.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The recently-revealed book of Shytoshi Kusama costs a whopping 1 ETH if you want it signed.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shytoshi Kusama, Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) pseudonymous lead developer, has announced the release of a book, “44 Tenets of Crypto,” set to come out in March 2024.</p>
<ul>
<li>While the Kindle edition can be pre-ordered for $9.99, a special signed and authenticated version will likely go for 1 Ether (ETH), which is about $1,824 at current rates.</li>
<li>It is quite a premium to pay for a book. Still, in comparison, Insider reports that the <a href="https://www.alux.com/most-expensive-e-books-ever/5/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">most expensive</a> book on Kindle, the “International Encyclopedia of Social and Behavioral Sciences,” costs an eye-watering $16,870.</li>
<li>44 Tenets of Crypto is described as the “crypto bible,” and judging from the blurb available online, it is expected to have a mix of ancient knowledge and modern crypto insights, given from the unique point of view of a respected crypto personality like Kusama.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shiba_inu_book_cover.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266899" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shiba_inu_book_cover.jpg" alt="shiba_inu_book_cover" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shiba_inu_book_cover.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shiba_inu_book_cover-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shiba_inu_book_cover-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shiba_inu_book_cover-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shiba_inu_book_cover-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>However, Kusama’s announcement wasn’t without its share of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/shiba-inus-leash-token-plunges-on-underwhelming-announcement-but-theres-more/" data-wpel-link="internal">disappointment</a>.</li>
<li>Some SHIB community members seemed to have expected a different revelation, possibly related to the Shiba Inu token or the upcoming Shibarium launch.</li>
<li>This sentiment caused a sharp dip in LEASH’s price across the board. At the time of going to press, LEASH was trading at $564, 12% below its price from 24 hours before.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[An official from Shiba Inu's team has shared a stark warning prior to the much-anticipated announcement today.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The community is eagerly anticipating today&#8217;s announcement, and many seem to believe that it will be related to the up-and-coming layer 2 scaling solution developed by Shiba Inu &#8211; Shibarium.</p>
<ul>
<li>Meanwhile, Shiba Inu&#8217;s marketing strategist took it to X to warn users of potential fraudulent actors, outlining one of the popular attack vectors.</li>
<li>Lucie emphasized that Shibarium is open for anyone to build on, akin to Polygon, Ethereum, and other blockchains. Herein lies the issue.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Regrettably, this also provides an avenue for bad actors to develop scam dApps and rug-pull tokens, among other things.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The official stressed that the incorporation of terms like &#8220;Shib&#8221; and &#8220;Shibarium&#8221; in the names of such projects holds no credibility, <a href="https://twitter.com/LucieSHIB/status/1691784869628555764" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">urging</a> users to prioritize their safety.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Prioritize research: delve into their Telegram and Discord channels, gauge the community&#8217;s atmosphere, scrutinize their social media posts, and check Etherscan.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The warning comes at a critical moment because the community is eagerly anticipating a major announcement today during the conference in Toronto.</li>
<li>Many believe Shytoshi Kusama will reveal the launch of the much-anticipated Shibarium, but just as many are skeptical of it.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase Global announced securing regulatory approval to enable retail customers in the United States to trade crypto futures.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the National Futures Association, which happens to be a CFTC-designated SRO, has greenlighted Coinbase Financial Markets as a registered Futures Commission Merchant (FCM). The approval comes almost two years after the initial application was submitted.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Obtains Futures Commission Merchant Approval</h2>
<p>The regulatory clearance makes Coinbase the first in the industry to directly offer traditional spot crypto trading alongside regulated and leveraged crypto futures on an integrated trading solution for its verified customers.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Today, we are pleased to announce that approval has been secured, which will allow eligible US customers to access regulated derivatives products through Coinbase Financial Markets and alongside our spot market for a seamless experience subject to the oversight of the CFTC and the NFA.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Designated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the NFA functions as a self-regulatory entity. The San Francisco-based crypto exchange filed to become a member of the National Futures Association and register as an FCM back in September 2021.</p>
<p>While embroiled in a legal dispute with the SEC, Coinbase has <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-financial-markets-inc-secures-fcm-approval-to-bring-regulated" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">characterized</a> the approval as a &#8220;significant milestone.&#8221; The company said it views this development as a notable step towards establishing federal regulatory supervision within the crypto markets, a move aimed at safeguarding consumers and maintaining the United States as a hub for digital innovation.</p>
<h2>Expansion and More</h2>
<p>With mounting regulatory uncertainties back home, Coinbase is intensifying its expansion strategy across the North American market. Earlier this week, the firm <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-continues-its-global-expansion-by-entering-the-canadian-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> officially launching operations in Canada, as part of which, the crypto exchange introduced Coinbase One to local users &#8211; a 30-day trial offering zero trading fees and priority support.</p>
<p>Coinbase&#8217;s recent expansions in the region also include the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-officially-launches-platform-for-non-us-institutional-investors-in-bermuda-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">launch</a> of a platform in Bermuda that serves non-US institutional clients.</p>
<p>The company public <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbases-base-notches-4th-rank-in-daily-tps-among-layer-2-solutions-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">launched</a> its Base mainnet recently, which witnessed significant user activity in a span of less than a week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, its CEO, Brian Armstrong, had previously <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-is-exploring-best-way-to-integrate-bitcoin-lightning-network-says-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">revealed</a> exploring the best possible way to integrate the Bitcoin Lightning Network (LN) scaling solution.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The spotlight in the crypto market is firmly on Shiba Inu, with investors expecting strong volatility in light of the imminent Shibarium launch. So far, $SHIB has disappointed the bulls as it has plummeted 3% over the past day.</p>
<p>The past week’s meme coin rally has come to an absolute halt as other top tokens like Dogecoin, Pepe, and Bone ShibaSwap are also seeing a strong depreciation.</p>
<p>However, on-chain data suggests that the recent bearishness in $SHIB can be attributed to a sell-off from the bankrupt crypto platform Voyager and the token can soon see another bullish resurgence.</p>
<p>The continued support from Tier-1 exchanges like Binance and Crypto.com can also provide fresh legs to a Shiba Inu rally.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, newly-launched Sonik Coin has begun turning heads in the meme coin market, while Wall Street Memes token continues to gain strong traction and is emerging as an alternative to Shiba Inu.</p>
<h2><strong>Shiba Inu Slides Despite Upcoming Shibarium Launch</strong></h2>
<p>After experiencing a remarkable 22% bull rally, Shiba Inu is now facing significant bearish forces, as it has incurred the most substantial losses of any top 20 crypto assets in the past day.</p>
<p>$SHIB has plunged just over 3% in the past 24 hours and is now below the $0.000010 price level. Its market capitalization has also fallen below the $6 Billion mark, highlighting the bearish momentum.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-22.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266862" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-22.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="331" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-22.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-22-300x165.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-22-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://in.tradingview.com/symbols/SHIBUSD/technicals/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">TradingView</a>, a technical analysis platform, gives a Sell signal to the token in the daily time frame, which further deteriorates to a Strong Sell when considering only the moving average indicators.</p>
<p>The on-chain data from Lookonchain reveals that the <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1691272802077429761?s=20" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SHIB’s bearish trajectory</a> over the past few days could be a result of a sell-off originating from Voyager. The bankrupt crypto exchange has sold $14.4 million worth of Shiba Inu tokens over the past 7 days in an effort to return client funds.</p>
<p>The good news for the bulls is that Voyager does not have any substantial amount of $SHIB tokens remaining. Thus, experts remain bullish on Shiba Inu’s short-term prospects, with crypto trader Andrew Griffiths believing that the recent correction has, in fact, presented <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewGriUK/status/1690985626412171264?s=20" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">excellent buying opportunities</a>.</p>
<p>Popular crypto analyst @army_shiba believes that if the meme coin could target and hold the $0.0000108 price mark, it could see a <a href="https://twitter.com/army_shiba/status/1690984253251571712?s=20" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">strong surge of whale interest</a>, resulting in another strong pump.</p>
<p>$SHIB investors would hope that a successful Shibarium launch can kickstart another bullish wave.</p>
<p>Major exchanges are also jumping on the Shibarium bandwagon. Crypto.com announced yesterday that it has listed <a href="https://twitter.com/Shibtoken/status/1691400569347252226?s=20" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$LEASH</a>, another token from the Shiba Inu ecosystem, on its platform. Binance also gave a major boost to $SHIB when it approved it as a collateral asset and increased its OTC trading limit.</p>
<h2>Sonik Coin Presale Kicks Off with Discounted Entry Price &amp; Low Hard Cap &#8211; Could it be a Shiba Inu Alternative?</h2>
<p>Although Shiba Inu dominates the headlines, it&#8217;s not the only coin attracting attention from meme coin investors.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.care/box_3bb03a9e65107f306e2760608ad07313?referrer=heres-why-the-shiba-inu-price-has-dipped-as-traders-back-these-new-meme-coins-to-pump" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sonik Coin ($SONIK)</a> is a new meme token that has just launched its public presale phase, allowing early investors to get involved at just $0.000014 per token.</p>
<p>$SONIK’s creators have allocated 50% of the total token supply to the presale, with the hard cap set at just over $2 million.</p>
<p>Additionally, the creators have set aside 10% of the token supply to provide DEX liquidity post-launch – a strategy designed to minimize slippage and price volatility.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-23.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266861" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-23.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="292" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-23.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-23-300x146.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-23-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>As its name implies, Sonik Coin is inspired by the popular video game character Sonic the Hedgehog, featuring meme-friendly branding that looks set to capture the interest of investors.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s not just $SONIK&#8217;s branding playing into the token&#8217;s value – the creators have also implemented a staking protocol and set aside 40% of the total token supply for rewards.</p>
<p>According to Sonik Coin’s website, the current APY on offer is a whopping 3,392%, although this is expected to decrease as more holders stake their $SONIK.</p>
<p>While $SHIB continues experiencing volatility, Sonik Coin&#8217;s fair presale structure and staking incentives make it one to watch as the meme coin market continues evolving.</p>

<h2><strong>Wall Street Memes Also Bullish as Token Nears $24 Million in Presale, Experts Expect A 10x Surge</strong></h2>
<p>Another meme coin that generated headlines is <a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=heres-why-the-shiba-inu-price-has-dipped-as-traders-back-these-new-meme-coins-to-pump" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes</a>, as its presale continues to generate tremendous hype and excitement. The token has now breached the $24 million mark in less than 3 months.</p>
<p>Experts believe that the token will continue its explosive growth even after its launch, with popular YouTubers like Crypto Dose calling it the <a href="https://youtu.be/Kfe1aPsjZcU" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">next 10x meme coin</a>.</p>
<p>The bullish price action would not be surprising as the meme coin is already catching the eyes of big-money investors. One whale recently purchased 460 ETH worth of $WSM tokens, making a total cumulative investment of over $1 million.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-16.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266859" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-16.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="297" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-16.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-16-300x148.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-16-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>The Wall Street Memes token continues to receive promising backing from its community, in part due to its strong association with the Wall Street Bets Reddit group that led the ground-breaking GameStop bull run in 2021.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Memes group has since become the trendiest online trading community, boasting a million-strong internet army and farming 40 million impressions monthly across its social media. Even Elon Musk enjoys its edgy and on-point humour.</p>
<p>$WSM is aiming for a $1 billion market capitalization after its launch. After all, the developer team behind the token has a strong track record of building successful Web3 projects &#8211; its Wall St Bulls NFT collection sold out in just 32 minutes.</p>
<p>Investors can purchase the token through bank cards by swapping ETH, USDT or BNB in exchange for it.</p>
