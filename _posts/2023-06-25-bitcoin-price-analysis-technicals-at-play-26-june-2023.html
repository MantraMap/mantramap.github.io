<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) added to ongoing range expansion early in the Asian session as the pair was softer after peaking around the 31057.86 area, a move that represented a test of the 61.8% retracement of the recent depreciating range from 31443.67 to 30330.61.&nbsp; Prior to the move higher, buying pressure emerged around the 30330.61 area, right around the 61.8% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 29539.57 to 31443.67.&nbsp;&nbsp; BTC/USD continues to orbit the 38.2% retracement of this range while awaiting technical guidance.&nbsp;&nbsp; The recent rapid appreciation to the 31443.67 area was its strongest level in twelve months and represented a test of the 31488.23 area, an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were also recently elected above the 30127.80 area during the ongoing appreciation, an upside price objective associated with historical buying pressure that emerged around the 15460 and 19568.52 areas.&nbsp; Stops were also triggered above additional upside price objectives around the 29068, 29159, 29458, 30088, 30200, 30292, and 30477 levels.&nbsp;</p>
