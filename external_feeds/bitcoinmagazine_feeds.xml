You’re at a social event and a friend, acquaintance or relative comes up to you and says “you were into Bitcoin, right?” You know you only have a brief period of their attention to give them an overview and pique their interest. So how can you give them an intelligible take on such a complex, multifaceted subject? </p><p>Here are a few ideas for you to pick and choose from for the next time you find yourself in that situation! </p><h2>Centralisation Is The Enemy Of Property </h2><p>Any currency which is centralized can be taken away from you in two ways. It can be done directly, by simply skimming it off your bank account as happened in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis">Greece</a> when people lost 20% of whatever was on their account to a government haircut in 2015 and 16, or by cutting your access to your own assets, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/29/doj-says-allies-have-frozen-30-billion-of-russian-oligarch-assets.html">as has just been shown</a> by America and the U.K. doing this to Russian corporations or individuals during the current crisis in relations around the Ukraine. Secondly, because all our fiat currencies are centralized, this can be done through inflation — the government simply prints more money which means that whatever you have in your bank account will lose its value — also effectively robbing you of your purchasing power. </p><p>Bitcoin is a new kind of digital money that will never be issued or controlled by a corporation or government. It is a new form of money, unlike anything we’ve ever seen before and is a 21st century hedge against inflation and central bank money printing. Unlike the US dollar, it is a provably scarce digital asset that is backed by a wall of encrypted real world energy. These coins reached parity with the U.S. dollar ten years ago and are now worth 20,000 times <em>more</em> than the dollar. </p><p>Because it is both scarce and totally decentralized, it is deflationary, and no one can take it away from you as long as you keep it in a storage which is not connected to the internet.</p><h2>What Is Bitcoin?</h2><p>The term bitcoin can really mean two things: <em>bitcoin the asset</em> (currently worth 20,000 times more than the USD) and <em>Bitcoin the network</em> which is growing faster than the internet or Facebook or Amazon. Bitcoin the asset travels along digital rails (a shared distributed ledger where a record of all the Bitcoin transactions is kept) that are decentralized onto tens of thousands of devices and computers. This digital asset is a 21st century savings technology which uses military grade encryption and permits you to store value and wealth on a smartphone or hardware device called a wallet. </p><p>It allows those who buy it to store the fruit of their labor (or life force) and wealth using software, math and energy that is almost impossible to steal directly or indirectly (through inflation) Once you learn the language of bitcoin, you realize that anyone holding government issued currency (which is all of us) is watching their wealth melt like an ice cube in the sun as the fiat value inflates, and hyperinflated when measured against bitcoin. Anyone who cares about keeping their wealth in the future ( and that should be all of us, especially those of us who have children and intend to leave them an inheritance) needs to wake up and smell the coffee. Fiat currencies are losing their value fast, and although Bitcoin is still volatile, everything points towards it holding its value long term. </p><h2>The Bitcoin Network Has Never Been Hacked</h2><p>In 13 years. The Bitcoin network is rock solid. </p><h2>How Bitcoin Works In A Nutshell</h2><p>Bitcoin runs on a blockchain. As its name suggests, a blockchain is made up of blocks. Each time a new block is confirmed it gets added to the blockchain. Bitcoin blocks are confirmed by computers known as miners and each time a miner solves the math problem which confirms a block, it gets a reward in new Bitcoin, a process written into the original Bitcoin code. This takes a lot of energy and is the system which keeps the Bitcoin blockchain safe. </p><p>Bitcoin mining is the energy intensive process which both creates new coins and maintains a log of all transactions performed on the bitcoin network since its inception. Bitcoin miners take real world energy (stranded and renewable) and convert it into monetary energy that will outlive your grandchildren. The more energy used by bitcoin miners, the more secure and unhackable the network becomes. </p><p>The protocol has a fixed supply schedule that issues 6.25 coins into the network about every 10 minutes. In 2024 the supply issuance will be cut in half to 3.125 coins every 10 minutes. </p><p>Each time a Bitcoin transaction is made, it’s recorded into the next block. Once that block is confirmed and added to the blockchain it can never be deleted.</p><h2>Who Uses Bitcoin?</h2><p>More and more individuals are using Bitcoin. It’s been estimated that in the first half of 2021, the number of people using Bitcoin grew by just under 165 per minute (“<a href="https://medium.com/original-crypto-guy/how-fast-is-bitcoin-growing-1b8f9fac97b7">How Fast Is Bitcoin Growing?</a>”). That’s a lot of people and a lot of growth.</p><p>Bitcoin is the first and only digital asset to be named as legal tender by a nation state. Bitcoin is the first and only asset in history to be named a primary treasury reserve asset by a Fortune 500 company, Microstrategy, an intelligence software company. </p><p>Here’s what their CEO, Michael Saylor, had to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/microstrategy-ceo-michael-saylor-interview-the-predator-prey-dynamics-of-bitcoin">say about</a> it:</p><blockquote><p>“We converted our balance sheet from a depreciating asset to an appreciating asset. So we have two businesses. One is enterprise software business and the other is digital property business. So why did we do it? Defensively, I don’t want to lose money or destroy the value of the company. Wealth is destroyed. Stage two is opportunistic, we could buy high quality property. Digital property is better than analog property. Stage three is strategic. It’s a good idea to buy up cyber Manhattan before everyone else moves here. If bitcoin is appreciating at 100% per year and I can borrow fiat at 5% then my arbitrage is 95%. Why would I NOT do it?” </p></blockquote><h2>There’s A Lot Of Negativity About Bitcoin In The Press</h2><p>If we look back at history, it's been pretty rare for a king to be deposed from his throne by a newcomer without putting up a bit of a fight. The fiat banking system has been king almost since its invention by the Medici. It's not going to go quietly. The fiat system has been able to dictate the terms and its employees profit massively from doing so. Until, that is, Bitcoin came along, the upstart King Arthur who, against all odds, has pulled the sword from the stone. And do the central banks and the governments like that? They do not. </p><p>It’s a key reason why central bankers attack and spread untruths about bitcoin. </p><p> What are those lies? It’s not backed by anything. It wastes energy. It’s volatile. It is controlled by billionaires. It has no practical uses. It’s primarily used by criminals and terrorists. It’s a Ponzi scheme. </p><p>Rubbish. Bitcoin has the potential to upset the current status quo — hence why it’s so maligned by those currently holding the microphone. </p><h2>You Can Buy A Fraction Of A Bitcoin</h2><p>Sure, most of us don’t have 20,000 odd dollars just lying around which we could spare to buy a whole Bitcoin with. One Bitcoin divides into one hundred million Satoshis – which means that you can invest 10 dollars in Bitcoin as a start investment, should you so desire. </p><blockquote><p>“Bitcoin is our peaceful weapon of choice against central bank driven time theft.” — Ross Stevens</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Bitcoin is a currency for the people backed by the people.” — Sylvain Laurel</p></blockquote><p><em>This is a guest post by Mark Maraia and Holly Young.

This comes with an endorsement from the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), the oversight body of the Basel Committee, which is the “<a href="https://www.bis.org/press/p221216.htm">primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks.</a>”</p><p>Investopedia <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tier1capital.asp">defines Tier 1 capital</a> as “the core capital held in a bank's reserves [that] is used to fund business activities for the bank's clients. It includes common stock, as well as disclosed reserves and certain other assets.” <br><br>The policy includes bitcoin in its definition of Group 2 crypto assets, saying that “In addition to any tokenised traditional assets and stablecoins that fail the classification conditions, Group 2 includes all unbacked cryptoassets.” It later describes that “a bank’s total exposure to Group 2 cryptoassets should not generally be higher than 1% of the bank’s Tier 1 capital and must not exceed 2% of the bank’s Tier 1 capital.”<br></p><p>The BIS had previously considered a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/basel-banks-crypto-currency-idCNL5N2NR51V">policy of 1%</a> for global banks. In turn, the banks <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/jpmorgan-deutsche-bank-oppose-strict-basel-rules-for-banks-holding-bitcoin">requested a 5% reserve limit</a>. This 2% appears to be a compromise between the two. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/421215/banks-assets-globally/">data from 2020</a>, if applied to all banks in the world, who collectively custody approximately $180 trillion, this would amount to a limit of $3.6 trillion in bitcoin held by such entities. <br><br>Tiff Macklem, Chair of the GHOS, <a href="https://www.bis.org/press/p221216.htm">stated that</a> “Today's endorsement by the GHOS marks an important milestone in developing a global regulatory baseline for mitigating risks to banks from cryptoassets. It is important to continue to monitor bank-related developments in cryptoasset markets. We remain ready to act further if necessary.”<br></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MzI5NzY4OTU4MTA5MzYx/bitcoin-code.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin And The Cardinal Virtues: How The Rabbit Hole Instills Virtuous Behavior]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bitcoin’s mission and incentives point its community toward classically virtuous behavior.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-instills-cardinal-virtues</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-instills-cardinal-virtues</guid><category><![CDATA[philosophy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[religion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Mitchell Askew]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2022 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwNTQxOTQxNDY3Nzg0MzE2/silver-or-orange-lining-in-the-clouds-hope-freedom-storm.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Bitcoin’s mission and incentives point its community toward classically virtuous behavior.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Mitchell Askew, a Christian, conservative Bitcoiner who produces Bitcoin-related research and social media content for Blockware Solutions.</em></p><p>“You don’t change Bitcoin, Bitcoin changes you.”</p><p>This is one of many mantras circulating around the Bitcoin community. I am two years removed from the start of my Bitcoin journey and can personally attest to the legitimacy of this statement. While my experience in Bitcoin is relatively short-lived, people can grow a great deal in two years, especially those in their early 20s. Bitcoin is a never-ending quest for knowledge and anyone who joins the expedition will in due time find themselves embracing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_virtues">cardinal virtues</a>.</p><p>The cardinal virtues, deeply rooted in Christianity and among philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle, represent a universal foundation of moral guidance. The virtues are prudence, temperance, justice and fortitude. They were dubbed “cardinal” from the Latin root “cardo,” which means “hinge,” as in: all other virtues hinge (rely) upon the four cardinal virtues.</p><p>I have outlined how anyone in honest pursuit of the Bitcoin mission to separate money and state is strongly incentivized to behave according to the cardinal virtues.</p><h2>Bitcoin Instills Prudence</h2><p><em>Acting with or showing care and thought for the future.</em></p><figure>

    </figure><p>You will not understand what Bitcoin is the first time you hear about it. Nor will you have a firm grasp the second, third or fourth time. In today’s fast-paced world, few have put in the hours necessary to have a solid understanding of how Bitcoin functions, technically. Of those that have, even fewer have taken the time to study all of the encompassing domains of Bitcoin, including but not limited to economics, personal finance, computer science, energy markets, the history of money and geopolitical game theory.</p><p>To say that Bitcoin will have a profound impact on the world is an understatement. To begin having the slightest understanding of what the impact will be requires prudence. In the words of Michael Saylor “<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/microstrategy-ceo-michael-saylor-interview-the-predator-prey-dynamics-of-bitcoin">there are no informed critiques</a>.” Those who immediately dismiss Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme no different than those of Bernie Madoff or Sam Bankman-Fried, are simply exposing their intellectual sloth.</p><p>A common theme among Bitcoiners, popularized by Austrian economists such as Saifedean Ammous, is the concept of time preference. To have a low time preference means that you are willing to place more emphasis on your future wellbeing relative to your present wellbeing; this quite literally is the definition of prudence. Those who engage in the speculative markets of altcoins, or attempt to trade bitcoin’s unpredictable short-term volatility, rather than HODL the least uncertain asset of all time, are inherently imprudent.</p><p>By putting in the hours necessary to have a basic understanding of Bitcoin’s technical fundamentals and its broad implications on society, you have exhibited prudence.</p><h2>Bitcoin Instills Temperance</h2><p><em>Habitual moderation in the indulgence of the appetites or passions.</em></p><p>Similar to prudence, Bitcoiners achieve temperance through low time preference behavior.</p><p>Contrary to common FUD propagated among no-coiners, Bitcoin is not full of whales seeking to dump their positions in pursuit of fiat-denominated profit. Moreover, the exponentially-increasing adoption of Bitcoin coupled with its immutably scarce supply means that each wave of newcomers are met with the realization that it is wise to acquire as much bitcoin as possible before the rest of the world catches on.</p><p>When bitcoin becomes your individual unit of account, you begin weighing every potential purchase or experience against the opportunity cost of acquiring more bitcoin. This has led to many Bitcoiners, including myself, embracing minimalist lifestyles. The key point here is that this declination of materialistic goods in pursuit of more bitcoin, though perhaps initially sparked by a desire to satisfy future greed, brings forth the realization that an abundance of materialistic goods is unnecessary.</p><p>By eliminating many of the “wants” from your personal budget, i.e., moderating the indulgence of appetites or passions, and limiting yourself to “needs” in order to save wealth in bitcoin, you are embracing the cardinal virtue of temperance.</p><h2>Bitcoin Instills Justice</h2><p><em>Just dealing or right action; giving each person his or her due.</em></p><p>The biggest financial fraud of all time is the fiat monetary system. For far too long, the existence of central banks has provided governments with the ability to fund the ideals of the ruling class at the expense of cash savings and future economic productivity. Prior to the rapid acceleration of inflation during the past couple of years, most Westerners were completely unaware of the backdoor thievery that occurs with the expansion of the money supply.</p><p>Bitcoin grants inalienable property rights to all of its users. No government agency or corporation has the power to dilute the value of each unit in the network and, when stored properly, BTC is virtually impossible to confiscate. Bitcoin is an open, neutral network that does not discriminate based on religion, ethnicity, sex, race or vaccination status. Nobody is restricted from running a node to audit the authenticity of each transaction on the ledger.</p><p>By guaranteeing irrefutable access to an unconfiscatable and undilutable form of property, Bitcoin represents the most just asset and monetary network in the history of mankind.</p><h2>Bitcoin Instills Fortitude</h2><p><em>Courage in pain or adversity.</em></p><p>Bitcoiners develop fortitude in two ways.</p><p>The first way is by encouraging HODLing through volatility. At the time of this writing, bitcoin is <a href="https://bitcoin.zorinaq.com/price/">down by over 70% from its all-time high</a>. This is the fourth time in Bitcoin’s thirteen-year history that we have experienced a drawdown of this magnitude. Bitcoiners are clearly exhibiting courage in the face of this adversity as evidenced by on-chain data. An all-time high of over <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/over-66-of-the-total-bitcoin-supply-hasnt-moved-in-the-last-one-year-setting-a-record/#:~:text=66%25%20of%20Bitcoin's%20circulating%20supply,illiquid%20bitcoin%20supply%20ever%20recorded.">66% of Bitcoin’s supply has not moved in one year or longer</a>. This fortitude is not unprecedented either, as this metric has hit all-time highs during previous bear markets as well.</p><p>I sense that a positive feedback loop is occurring here. When you can see for yourself that other bitcoin holders are undisturbed by the extreme drawdowns in price, it enables one to become more confident in the future of the network, and thus continue HODLing themselves.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The second way in which Bitcoiners develop fortitude is by encouraging Bitcoiners to take an action akin to the founding fathers signing of the Declaration Of Independence. While holding bitcoin is not outright illegal in most countries, it certainly does not put you in a favorable standing with the most powerful entities in the world.</p><p>History has shown that regimes in control of the global reserve currency do not take kindly to that position being usurped. As such, there is a non-zero chance that Bitcoiners could be declared treasonous in a dramatic, last-chance attempt by the United States government to maintain control over the monetary system. </p><p>However, this extremity can be avoided by winning the race of adoption as Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, <a href="https://www.swanbitcoin.com/the-race-to-avoid-the-war/">eloquently describes in this article</a>.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Mitchell Askew.

After only having 7.82% market share of the bitcoin supply on exchanges in 2018, their share is now 27.50% despite a much broader trend of bitcoin supply leaving exchanges. The bitcoin balance on Binance now totals 595,864 BTC, which is 3.1% of outstanding supply, worth $10.58 billion. This bitcoin belongs to their customers and reflects a growing trend in market share over the last few years that has made Binance the largest bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange in the world. </p><p>Binance now controls approximately <a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/the-exchange-war-binance-smells-blood">60% of the spot and derivatives volume</a> in the entire market. It’s hard to see how any exchange in the space can be a “winner” in the current market conditions, but one could make the case for Binance, with the exchange’s growing strength in a decimated industry. On top of that, Binance’s BNB token, the native currency of Binance’s own Ethereum-competing Layer 1 blockchain, is still one of the better performing tokens when valued in bitcoin terms this year. </p><p>Yet, is this recent “strength” everything that it seems or is it a facade? We’ve learned over the last month that no company is safe in this industry right now (especially exchanges) and questions are growing around Binance’s practices, solvency, BNB token value and the overall state of their business over the last few weeks. Is it FUD or legit? Let’s try to break some of it down, addressing the concerns through an objective and skeptical lens. </p><h3>Binance Flows</h3><p>We’ve seen significant outflows from Binance across different various tokens and bitcoin when looking at both <a href="https://twitter.com/themlpx/status/1602567600483205125?s=20&amp;t=O5hgOya8eEjD2QUHMv6Mcg">Nansen</a> and Glassnode tracking. Across ETH and ERC20 tokens, Binance saw <a href="https://twitter.com/nansen_ai/status/1602673823651864577?s=20&amp;t=O5hgOya8eEjD2QUHMv6Mcg">$3 billion</a> leaving the exchange in its largest single-day outflow since June. Across Nansen total wallet tracking, all Binance balances are estimated at $62.5 billion with around 50% of those balances in stablecoins across BUSD and USDT.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>According to Glassnode, the total bitcoin exchange balance on Binance is down around 6-7% over the last day, after reaching a peak on December 1. Although balances remain above 500,000 bitcoin and Binance has shown a rising trend of bitcoin balances on the platform this year, this is a significant move for outflows in just 24 hours. As a general comparison, the trend of bitcoin exchange balances was a much different story for FTX, whose balance had been falling heavily since June. Binance outflows over the last couple days are a bit alarming and raise questions: Is this a one-off event and just business as usual or is this the start of something more?&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The coming weeks will be full of headlines around the state of global crypto regulation in a post-FTX world. In a 48-hour period, Reuters published news stating that the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-justice-dept-is-split-over-charging-binance-crypto-world-falters-sources-2022-12-12/">U.S. Justice Dept is split over charging Binance</a>, Binance withdrawals for bitcoin and aggregate stablecoin pairs have hit all-time highs and the BNB exchange token has fallen 10% relative to bitcoin.</p><p>Out of an abundance of caution, we will continue to urge readers operating on any centralized exchange — of which Binance is most definitely included — to look into self custody solutions. There have been far too many instances of incompetence and/or misconduct from exchanges.</p><p>It’s not that we don’t trust CZ or Binance, it's the fact that <em>we don’t trust anyone.</em> </p><p>The whole point of bitcoin is we now have an asset that is truly the liability of no one. Verify the ownership of an open distributed network with cryptography; don’t trust permissioned IOUs. With the mix of regulatory concerns about the global crypto derivatives industry, a questionable exchange token with unbelievable relative performance over the last two years and a shaky proof-of-reserves attestation — that was incorrectly claimed to be an audit and had industry CEOs raising eyebrows — we find the need to urge our readers to evaluate their counterparty risk.&nbsp;</p><figure>

Nick Szabo wrote an interesting anecdote about how in his essay “<a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/">Shelling Out: The Origins of Money</a>.” When homosapiens displaced <a href="https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-neanderthalensis">homo neanderthalensis</a> in Europe circa 40,000 to 35,000 B.C., population explosions followed. It's difficult to explain why, because the newcomers, homosapiens, had the same size brain, weaker bones and smaller muscles than the neanderthals. The biggest difference may have been wealth transfers made more effective or even possible by collectibles. Evidence shows homosapiens sapiens took pleasure in collecting shells, making jewelry out of them, showing them off and trading them. <br></p><p>It follows that the capability to preserve wealth is one of the foundations of human civilization. Historically, there have been a variety of wealth preservation technologies that have constantly changed and adapted to the technological possibilities of the time. All wealth preservation technologies serve a specific function: storing value. Chief among the early forms is handmade jewelry. Below I will compare the four most commonly used wealth preservation technologies today (gold, bonds, real estate and equities) to bitcoin to show why they underperform and how efficiently bitcoin can help us save and plan for our future. For equities, I focus specifically on ETFs as equity instruments used as a means of long-term savings.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>What Makes A Good Store Of Value?</p><p>As explained by <a href="https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1">Vijay Bojapati</a>, when stores of value compete against each other, it is the unique attributes that make a good store of value that allows one to out-compete another. The characteristics of a good store of value are considered to be durability, portability, fungibility, divisibility and especially scarcity. These properties determine what is used as a store of value. Jewelry, for example, may be scarce, but it's easily destroyed, not divisible, and certainly not fungible. <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/fintech-startup-rupeek-gives-out-1-billion-in-gold-backed-loans-122011101614_1.html">Gold fulfills these properties much better</a>. Gold has over time replaced jewelry as humankind's preferred technology for wealth preservation, serving as the most effective store of value for 5,000 years. However, since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, gold has faced digital disruption. Digitization optimizes almost all value-storing functions. Bitcoin serves not only as a store of value, but also as an inherently digital money, ultimately defeating gold in the digital age. </p><h2>Bitcoin Versus Gold </h2><p><strong>Durability:</strong> <a href="https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1">Gold is the undisputed king of durability</a>. Most of the gold that has been mined remains extant today. Bitcoin are digital records. Thus it is not their physical manifestation whose durability should be considered, but the durability of the institution that issues them. Bitcoin, having no issuing authority, may be considered durable so long as the network that secures them remains intact. It is too early to draw conclusions about its durability. However, there are signs that, despite instances of nation-states attempting to regulate Bitcoin and years of attacks, the network has continued to function, displaying a remarkable degree of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility">anti-fragility</a>”. In fact, it is one of the most reliable computer networks ever, with nearly <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-downtime/#:~:text=Conclusion,has%20maintained%20very%20stable%20uptime.">99.99% uptime</a>. </p><p><strong>Portability:</strong> Bitcoin's portability is far superior to that of gold, as information can move at the speed of light (thanks to telecommunication). Gold has lost its appeal in the digital age. You can't send gold over the internet. Online gold portability simply doesn't exist. For decades, the inability to digitise gold created problems in our monetary system, historically based on gold. With the digitization of money, over time it was no longer comprehensible whether national currencies were actually backed by gold or not. Also, it is difficult to transport gold across borders because of its weight, which has created problems for globalised trade. Due to gold's weakness in terms of portability, our current fiat-based monetary system exists. Bitcoin is a solution to this problem as it is a native digital scarce commodity that is easily transportable.</p><h2>Storing Gold Versus Storing Bitcoin</h2><figure>

    </figure><p><strong>Divisibility: </strong><a href="https://breedlove22.medium.com/money-bitcoin-and-time-part-1-of-3-b4f6bb036c04">Bitcoin is purely digital, so its divisibility is much better compared to gold. Information can be subdivided and recombined almost infinitely at almost zero cost (like numbers).</a> A bitcoin can be divided into 100,000,000 units called satoshi. Gold on the other hand is difficult to divide. It requires special tools and carries the risk of losing gold in the process, even if it's just dust.</p><p><strong>Fungibility:</strong> Gold can be distinguished for example by an engraved logo, but can be melted down and is then fully fungible. With bitcoin, fungibility is “tricky”. Bitcoin is digital information, which <a href="https://breedlove22.medium.com/money-bitcoin-and-time-part-1-of-3-b4f6bb036c04">is the most objectively discernible substance in the universe (like the written word</a>). However, since all bitcoin transactions are transparent, governments could ban the use of bitcoin that has been used for activities deemed illegal. Which would negatively impact bitcoin's fungibility and its use as a medium of exchange, because when money is not fungible, each unit of the money has a different value and the money has lost its medium of exchange property. This does not affect bitcoin's store-of-value function, but rather its acceptance as money, which can negatively impact its price. Gold's fungibility is superior to bitcoins, but gold's portability disadvantages make it useless as a medium of exchange or a digital store of value.</p><p><strong>Scarcity:</strong> Gold is relatively scarce, with an annual inflation rate of <a href="https://www.seabridgegold.com/the-case-for-gold/basic-facts-about-gold-prices-elasticity-and-uses">1.5%</a>. However, the supply is not capped. There are always new discoveries of gold and <a href="https://www.mining.com/web/the-golden-asteroid-that-could-make-everyone-on-earth-a-billionaire/">there is a possibility that we will come across large deposits in space</a>. Gold's price is not perfectly inelastic. When gold prices rise, there is an incentive to mine gold more intensively, which can increase supply. In addition, ​​physical gold can be diluted with less precious metals, which is difficult to check. Furthermore, gold held in online accounts via ETCs or other products often has multiple uses, which is also difficult to control and negatively impacts the price by artificially increasing supply. The supply of bitcoin, on the other hand, is hard-capped, there will never be more than 21,000,000. It is designed to be disinflationary, meaning there will be less of it over time. </p><p>Bitcoin's annual inflation rate is currently <a href="https://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-inflation/">1.75%</a> and will continue to decrease. Bitcoin mining rewards are halved roughly every 4 years, according to the protocol’s code. In 10 years, its inflation rate will be negligible. The last bitcoin will be mined in 2140. After that, the annual inflation rate of bitcoin will be zero. <br><br><strong>Auditability:</strong> This is not a unique selling proposition for a store of value, but it is still important because it provides information about whether a store of value is suitable for a fair and transparent financial system.<br><br>Bitcoin is perfectly audible to the smallest unit. No one knows how much gold exists in the world and no one knows how much US dollars exist in the world. As pointed out to me by <a href="https://twitter.com/samabbassi">Sam Abbassi</a>, bitcoin is the first perfectly, publicly, globally, auditable asset. This prevents rehypothecation risk, a practice whereby banks and brokers use assets posted as collateral by their clients for their own purposes. This takes an enormous amount of risk out of the financial system. It allows for proof of reserves, where a financial institution must provide their bitcoin address or transaction history in order to show their reserves. </p><figure>

    </figure><p>Bitcoin Versus Bonds</p><p>In 1949 Benjamin Graham, a British-born American economist, professor and investor, published „The Intelligent Investor“, which is considered one of the founding books of value investing and a classic of financial literature. One of his tenets is that a "balanced portfolio" should consist of 60% stocks and 40% bonds, as he believed bonds protect investors from significant risk in the stock markets. <br><br></p><p>While much of what Graham described then still makes sense today, I argue that bonds, particularly government bonds, have lost their place as a hedge in a portfolio. Bond yields cannot keep up with monetary inflation and our monetary system, of which bonds are a part, is systematically at risk. </p><p>This is because the financial health of many of the governments that form the heart of our monetary and financial system is at risk. When government balance sheets were in decent shape, the implied risk of default by a government was almost zero. That is for two reasons. Firstly, their ability to tax. Secondly, and more importantly, their ability to print money to pay down its borrowings. In the past that argument made sense, but eventually printing money has become a “credit boogie man”, as explained by <a href="https://rockstarinnercircle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Why-Every-Fixed-Income-Investor-Needs-To-Consider-Bitcoin-As-Portfolio-Insurance.pdf">Greg Foss</a>, </p><p>Governments are circulating more money than ever before. Data from the Federal Reserve, the central banking system of the US, shows that a broad measure of the stock of dollars, known as M2, <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=Onyz">rose from $15.4 trillion</a> at the start of 2020 to $21.18 trillion by the end of December 2021. The increase of $5.78 trillion equates to 37.53% of the total supply of dollars. This means that the dollar's monetary inflation rate has averaged well over 10% per year over the last 3 years. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us">U.S. Treasury Bonds are yielding less.</a> </p><figure>

In addition, there is the risk of a systematic failure. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/de/podcast/read-516-conclusion-of-the-long-term-debt-cycle/id1359544516?i=%201000517163396">The global financial system is irreversibly broken</a> and bonds as a foundation of it, are at high risk.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjGd9jHDy3a/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y%3D">There is an irresponsible amount of credit in the market</a>. In recent decades, central banks have had very loose debt policies and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjGd9jHDy3a/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y%3D">nation states have incurred large amounts of debt</a>. Argentina and Venezuela have already defaulted. There is a possibility that more countries will default on their debt. This default does not mean they can’t pay back their debt by printing more money. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FusKoeWmDzY">However, this would devalue a national currency, causing</a> inflation and making most bonds with their comparatively low yields even less attractive. </p><p>For the past 50 years, when equities have sold off, investors fled to the “safety” of bonds which would appreciate in “risk off'' environments. This dynamic built the foundation of the infamous 60/40 portfolio — <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/united-states-will-back-dollar-with-bitcoin">until that reality </a>finally collapsed in March 2020 when central banks decided to flood the market with money. The attempt to stabilize bonds will only lead to an increased demand for bitcoin over time. </p><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/07/grahamprinciples.asp">Graham's philosophy was first and foremost, </a>to preserve capital, and then to try to make it grow. With bitcoin it is possible to store wealth in a self sovereign way with absolutely zero counterparty or credit risk. </p><h2>Bitcoin Versus Real Estate </h2><p>Given the high levels of monetary inflation in recent decades, keeping money in a savings account is not enough to preserve the value of money. As a result, <a href="https://businessday.ng/business-economy/article/two-reasons-real-estate-is-worlds-most-preferred-store-of-wealth/#:~:text=Over%2067%20percent%20of%20the,to%20a%20consulting%20firm%2C%20McKinsey.">many hold a significant portion of their wealth in real estate</a>, which has become one of the preferred stores of value. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/why-bitcoin-is-digital-real-estate#:~:text=As%20digital%20property%2C%20bitcoin%20has,can%20buy%20and%20hold%20bitcoin.">In this capacity, bitcoin competes with real estate</a>, the properties associated with bitcoin make it an ideal store of value. The supply is finite, it is easily portable, divisible, durable, fungible, censorship-resistant and noncustodial. Real estate cannot compete with bitcoin as a store of value. Bitcoin is rarer, more liquid, easier to move and harder to confiscate. It can be sent anywhere in the world at almost no cost at the speed of light. Real estate, on the other hand, is easy to confiscate and very difficult to liquidate in times of crisis, as recently illustrated in Ukraine, where <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/23/ukrainian-flees-to-poland-with-2000-in-bitcoin-on-usb-drive.html">many turned to bitcoin to protect their wealth, accept transfers and donations, and meet daily needs</a>. </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=mP0f2s39GDs">In a recent interview with Nik Bhatia, Michael Saylor</a> detailed the downsides of real estate as a store of value asset. As explained by Saylor, real estate in general needs a lot of attention when it comes to maintenance. Rent, repairs, property management, high costs arise with real estate. Commercial real estate for example, is very capital intensive and therefore uninteresting for most people. Furthermore, attempts to make the asset more accessible have also failed, with second tier real estate investments such as real estate investment trusts (REITs) falling short of actually holding the asset.</p><p>As Bitcoin (digital property) continues its adoption cycle, it may replace real estate (physical property) as the preferred store of value. As a result, the value of physical property may collapse to utility value and no longer carry the monetary premium of being used as a store of value. Going forward, bitcoin's return will be many times greater than real estate, as bitcoin is just at the <a href="https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/bitcoin-fundamentals/bitcoin-adoption-curve-w-croesus/">beginning of its adoption cycle</a>. In addition, we will most likely not see the same type of returns on real estate investments as we have in the past. Since 1971, house prices have already <a href="https://frisby.substack.com/p/what-really-causes-inflation-heres?r=1o6vt&amp;s=w&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">increased nearly 70 times</a>. Beyond that, as Dylan LeClair points out in his article-turned podcast, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/de/podcast/read-516-conclusion-of-the-long-term-debt-cycle/id1359544516?i=1000517163396">“Conclusion Of The Long-Term Debt Cycle”</a>, governments tend to tax citizens at times like this. Real estate is easily taxed and difficult to move outside of one jurisdiction. Bitcoin cannot be arbitrarily taxed. It is seizure and censorship resistant outside of the domain of any one jurisdiction. </p><figure>

    </figure><p>Bitcoin Versus ETFs<br></p><p>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) emerged out of index investing, which utilizes a passive investment strategy that requires a manager to only ensure that the fund's holdings match those of a benchmark index. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_bogle.asp">In 1976, Jack Bogle,</a> founder of the Vanguard Group, launched the first index fund, the Vanguard 500, which tracks the returns of the S&amp;P 500. Today, ETFs manage well over $10 trillion<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_bogle.asp">.</a> Bogle had a tenet: active stock picking is a pointless exercise. I recall him stating multiple times in his interviews that over a lifespan, there is only a 3% chance that a fund manager can consistently outperform the market. He concluded that average investors would find it difficult or impossible to beat the market, which led him to prioritize ways to reduce expenses associated with investing and to offer effective products that enable investors to participate in economic growth and save. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_bogle.asp">Index funds require fewer trades to maintain their portfolios than funds with more active management</a> schemes and therefore tend to produce more tax-efficient returns<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_bogle.asp">.</a><em> The concept of an ETF is good, but bitcoin is better. </em>You can cover a lot of ground through an ETF, but you still have to limit yourself to one index, industry, or region. However, when you buy bitcoin, you buy a human productivity index. Bitcoin is like an “ETF on steroids”. Let me explain : <br><br>The promise of Bitcoin should at least be on everyone's lips by now. A decentralized computer network (Bitcoin) with its own cryptocurrency (bitcoin), which, as a peer-to-peer network, enables the exchange and, above all, the storage of value. It is the best money we have and the base protocol for the most efficient transaction network there is (Lightning Network). It is very likely that Bitcoin will become the dominant network for transactions and store of value in the not too distant future. At that point, it will act as an index of global productivity. The more productive we are, the more value we create, the more transactions are executed, the more value needs to be stored, the higher the demand for bitcoin, the higher the bitcoin price. I've come to the conclusion that instead of using an ETF to track specific indices, I can use bitcoin to participate in the productivity of all of humanity. As you might expect, bitcoin's returns have outperformed all ETFs since its inception.<br><br></p><h2>Bitcoin Returns Versus ETFs Returns</h2><p>The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust is the largest and oldest ETF in the world. It is designed to track the S&amp;P 500 stock market index. The performance over the last decade (October 26, 2012 to October 25, 2022) was 168.0%, which translates to an average annual return of 16.68%. Not bad, especially given that all an investor had to do was hold.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>However, over the same period, bitcoin‘s performance was: 158,382.362%. More than 200% per annum. We've all heard the phrase that past performance is no indicator of future performance, that may be true. But that is not the case with bitcoin. The higher a stock goes the riskier it becomes, because of the P/E ratio. Not bitcoin. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/de/podcast/read-516-conclusion-of-the-long-term-debt-cycle/id1359544516?i=1000517163396">When bitcoin increases in price,</a> it becomes less risky to allocate to, because of liquidity, size and global dominance. The Bitcoin Network has now reached a size where it WILL last (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect#:~:text=The%20Lindy%20effect%20(also%20known,proportional%20to%20their%20current%20age.">Lindy Effect</a>).</p><p>We can therefore conclude that bitcoin is likely to continue to outperform ETFs going forward. </p><p>Bitcoin has other advantages over an ETF. First, it has a lower cost structure. Second, the latter is a basket of securities held by a third party. You are not free to dispose of your ETFs. If your bank, for whatever reason, decides to close your account, your ETFs are gone too. Bitcoin, on the other hand, cannot be taken away from you or denied access so easily. Additionally, bitcoin can be moved across the internet at will at the speed of light, making confiscation nearly impossible.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Bitcoin is the best wealth preservation technology for the digital age. An absolutely scarce digital native bearer asset with no counterparty risk that cannot be inflated and is easily transportable. A digital store of value, transferable on the world’s most powerful computer network. Considering that the Bitcoin network could theoretically store all of the world’s wealth (Global wealth reached a record high of $530 trillion in 2021, <a href="https://www.bcg.com/press/9june2022-global-wealth-grew-double-digits-to-530-trillion">according to the Boston Consulting Group</a>), it may well be the most efficient way we humans have found to store value ever. By holding bitcoin your wealth is going to be protected, likely increasing it by 10x,100x, maybe 500x, during this early monetization process.<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/de/podcast/read-516-conclusion-of-the-long-term-debt-cycle/id1359544516?i=1000517163396"> If you hold out for the next few decades</a>. </p><p>In closing, I'd like to revisit Jack Bogle, who was a huge influence on me. As described by <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/the-express-podcast-episode-87-5322901">Eric Balchunas</a>, Bogle‘s life work is addition by subtraction. Getting rid of the management fees, getting rid of the turnover, getting rid of the brokers, getting rid of the human emotion and the bias. His entire life's work had been in a similar direction, and as such, I think bitcoin fits well with his investment ethos. Bogle’s primary philosophy was “common sense” investing. He told Reuters in 2012. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/jack-bogle-founder-of-vanguard-group-and-creator-of-the-index-fund-dies-at-age-89.html">“Most of all, you have to be disciplined</a> and you have to save, even if you hate our current financial system. Because if you don’t save, then you’re guaranteed to end up with nothing.<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/jack-bogle-founder-of-vanguard-group-and-creator-of-the-index-fund-dies-at-age-89.html">”</a> Bitcoin is very similar to what Bogle envisioned with passive mutual funds. A long term savings vehicle for investors to place their disposable income with low cost and little risk. Don't be distracted by bitcoin's volatility or negative press, to quote Jack Bogle: <a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/John-C-Bogle/dp/1119404304">stay in the course</a>. We're just getting started, stay humble and stack sats.

Money is required to store wealth, calculate revenue and losses and trade for goods and services that you couldn't acquire through barter. </p><p>Although Bitcoin drastically improves humanity's relationship with both <a href="https://forkast.news/bitcoin-mining-has-become-good-for-planet/">energy</a> and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/11/bitcoin-breaking-up-money-and-state/">money</a>, the problems that plague both energy and money are likely to survive a Bitcoin standard, even if they become lesser in severity. With respect to energy, government regulations, subsidies and bans will continue to have sway. With respect to money, governments will, in all likelihood, continue to employ second-layer fiat money that citizens are forced to use.</p><h2>Government Meddling In Energy</h2><p>The United States government has been trying to centrally plan the energy sector since 1789, well before fiat currency reached its “final form” in the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/gold-standard.asp#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20abandoned%20the%20gold,redeeming%20their%20dollars%20for%20gold.">fateful year of 1971</a>. <a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/89/i51/Long-History-US-Energy-Subsidies.html">In extensive research</a> on the topic of the U.S. government’s history of subsidizing the energy sector, DBL Investors managing partner Nancy Pfund and economics graduate student Ben Healey made several sober discoveries (though they favor government intervention in the energy sector, to be sure):</p><p>Although not a direct subsidy, the U.S. government raised a tariff on the sale of British coal in 1789 to benefit the American coal industry. This was only two years after delegates at the Constitutional Convention explicitly fought to include the “<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-10/#:~:text=No%20State%20shall%20enter%20into,Contracts%2C%20or%20grant%20any%20Title">gold and silver clause</a>” in the U.S. Constitution. This clause made its way into Article One of the founding document, where it lives on as stating that individual states were not allowed to “make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts.” In other words, the political apparatus of the time, though far more monetarily constrained than our present-day Leviathan State, was still able to exert its will over the energy sector.</p><p>To be fair, tariffs are easier for a government to enact than subsidies, since only the latter requires the government to have money to spare. But history shows subsidies, too, have existed before the fiat standard went into full effect in 1971. For example, the <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10821#:~:text=Congress%20responded%20in%201957%20by,readily%20available%20within%20those%20limits.">Price-Anderson Act of 1957</a> forced the federal government to subsidize nuclear energy by paying for the damages incurred by a nuclear disaster. </p><p>Hydropower, too, has been federally subsidized since at least the 1890s, though quantifying the size of these subsidies is challenging. Earth Track, a think tank that works to standardize energy subsidy data, estimates that the <a href="https://www.dbl.vc/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/What-Would-Jefferson-Do-2.4.pdf">U.S. federal government has provided about $2.7 billion (in 2010 dollars)</a> to hydropower from the nation’s inception until 2010. Naturally, this timespan covers a range of different monetary regimes.</p><h2>Government Meddling In Money</h2><p>As much certainty as many in the Bitcoin community have about bitcoin becoming the next global reserve asset, governments are unique institutions and can damage our relationship with money, <em>even after bitcoin becomes the new gold</em>.</p><p>Governments also wield the threat of violence and incarceration via the military-industrial complex to retain economic power.</p><p>For example, imagine that the U.S. government/central bank accepts the new bitcoin monetary regime and even holds it on its balance sheet. Surely by this time, the global economic order will have vastly changed for the better — however, if governments are still around, they are likely still using the threat of violence and/or incarceration to collect taxes. To keep some <em>Layer 2</em> fiat currency alive, all they have to do is mandate that taxes be paid in said fiat currency. People will then have no choice but to obtain this currency in order to hand it over to the tax man. </p><p>To be sure, there are several reasons that such a scheme may not work. For one, “competition” between governments might pressure them to ease up on forcing fiat currencies on citizens who are using Bitcoin and Bitcoin-based Layer 2 technologies in their daily lives. Secondly, ideological pressure from citizens might pressure politicians to give up on creating their own fiat currencies for fear of career suicide. And finally, governments themselves may view such a scheme as being more trouble than it is worth, since a Bitcoin-based economy has the potential to grow at a much greater rate than a Bitcoin-fiat hybrid economy would.</p><h2>We Must Remain Vigilant</h2><p>With respect to both energy and money, the government may still intervene after bitcoin has become the next global reserve asset and after Bitcoin mining has forever improved our relationship with money. In this sense, Bitcoin’s inevitable victory is only the beginning — we may still have to fend off meddling bureaucrats. To be sure, freedom-loving Bitcoiners will be in a much better position to do so then than we are now. Nevertheless, we must not rest on our laurels.</p><p>What can we do to truly exorcize the State from money and energy? The same thing that we do now: <em>explain </em>our ideas. </p><p>We want a free market in energy so that the most cost-effective forms of energy are discovered and made profitable over inefficient alternatives. Furthermore, subsidies, tariffs and regulations in the energy sector hamper innovation. For all we know, absent so much intervention throughout the centuries, our world would be powered by cold fusion, oceans and nuclear energy by now. </p><p>And government-imposed money, even if somehow backed by bitcoin, would throw sand in the gears of capital accumulation and economic calculation. The cost of accumulating capital would rise, since we’d need to keep some garbage money in our back pocket for tax season. In other words, the production of all sorts of goods and services would never come to pass, since they’d no longer be affordable. And entrepreneurs' ability to calculate profits or losses becomes more difficult, since there is no longer a single immutable measuring stick (bitcoin), but also an unpredictable fiat currency still trading alongside Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation.</p><p>Our job will not be finished, even after Bitcoin wins the money game and Bitcoin mining wins the energy game, as <em>governments</em> won’t quit. But our ideas will be so much easier to sell by that point, that I, for one, am looking forward to the battles ahead.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Will Szamosszegi.

    </figure><p>After many years of development and the successful routing of socialists, evil CIA proponents of “Democracy”, cowards and soft-skinned, fat, virtue-signaling infiltrators, Bitcoin is stronger than ever, growing in many surprising and encouraging ways and confounding people who can’t think.</p><p>The stage is now set for Bitcoin to totally replace fiat online and offline as the main way people spend. The infallible Bitcoin network and consumer-grade Bitcoin tools are spreading like wildfire in every direction as people wake up to what this new network can do for them and how fiat is inflating under their feet, just as people woke up to what the web could do, and that they didn’t need the post office any more.</p><p>The greatest explosion of Bitcoin users will be on mobile phone platforms where Wallet of Satoshi, Samourai Wallet, Breez, Muun, Phoenix, Pine, and BlueWallet are the vanguard of a new class of applications in the emerging <em>“Consumer Bitcoin”</em> sector.</p><p>Very few people understand the enormous impact <em>Consumer Bitcoin</em> is going to have on the way things are ordered in the world, and certainly, the list of selfish and ignorant bad actors listed above are either incapable of imagining it, and if not, are actively against it under orders to prop up the unethical, unsustainable, and evil fiat status quo.</p><p>Thankfully not all people are driven by fear of the new, or take their marching orders from violent psychopaths. This is manifestly clear in the case of El Salvador, the surprise market leader that is forging ahead fastest and most effectively to switch from the money of mass murder to the money of peace, “Bitcoin”. Not only are they embedding Bitcoin deeply into the economy there, they are actively educating other countries to help them remove the yoke of fiat and the murderous democracy boosters.</p><p>One of the countries attending the historic summit in San Salvador was the mighty Nigeria, which, should it heed the advice and learning accumulated there, could take its rightful place as the economic center of the continent of Africa. Rather than settling on the racist-inspired “Afro” currency, it could settle on bitcoin as the unifying, provably fair, and economically sound “lingua franca of money” for all citizens in African nations — bringing extraordinary economic benefits to all the people who live on that continent, as well as the long-overdue permanent removal of toxic Western influences.</p><p>Democracy created fiat. It is that fiat philosophy (created by <a href="https://www.conservapedia.com/John_Maynard_Keynes_and_pederasty">a pedophile, John Maynard Keynes</a>) that was a key factor in the ruin of the economies of the African continent. By adopting bitcoin, fiat will cease to have power over 1,404,827,471 people, setting them on a path to prosperity and proper order. Bitcoin has the power to defang the unnatural blood-sucking viper that injects poison into the economies of Africa and drains blood from the people.</p><p>Voting doesn’t make fiat ethical. Voting doesn’t trump math. Anyone who is for voting as the way to select how a monetary system should work is anti-Bitcoin, and certainly, no Nigerian should listen to a Washington wonk who desires all nations to be Cargo Cult copies of the West and its unethical, evil, unbalanced, and unworkable systems of control.</p><p>“Democratic” doesn’t equal fair, proper, or right. It doesn’t ensure just outcomes, or restrain the State from committing mass murder. Democratically overproduced fiat is the fuel that powered the mass murder “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg-jvHynP9Y&amp;ab_channel=USNationalArchives">Military Industrial Complex</a>” that ravaged the 20th century. Now, with bitcoin in place as the world’s money, outrages like this cannot happen again because there simply and literally is no money for it.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Everyone who understands Bitcoin and what it was designed to do does not argue about this. There is no argument to be made against it. The time of arguing is over. The lying, mass-murdering, racist democracy boosters (some of whom pretend to be “for Bitcoin”) will not be able to change the inevitable outcome. The producer of the form and arbiter of the function of money has been the root problem for generations. There will be no more debate. The die is already cast. Anyone arguing about Keynesianism vs Bitcoin, democracy vs free markets or any other distraction is delusional; reality is going to be asserted and imposed on the market and there is nothing you can do about it.</p><p>How and why is this so, and what is it about Bitcoin in particular that makes any of this predictable? Doesn’t the price of bitcoin and how it fluctuates refute these extravagant claims? <em><strong>Are they</strong></em><em> extravagant claims?</em></p><p>Bitcoin is a very new technology, even though the software and math concepts that it brings to life are decades old. The double-spending problem has been solved; this means that it is possible to use a digital “certificate” to stand in the place of money and be sure that as long as you hold it no one else can spend that “certificate” other than you. This is an unprecedented paradigm shift, the implications of which are not yet fully understood, and for which the tools do not yet exist to fully take advantage of this new idea.</p><p>This new technology requires some new thinking when it comes to developing businesses that are built upon it. In the same way that the pioneer providers of email did not correctly understand the service they were selling for many years, new and correct thinking about Bitcoin is needed, and will emerge, so that it reaches its full potential and becomes ubiquitous.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>The original Hotmail Interface.<br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>Hotmail used familiar technologies (the web browser and email) to create a better way of accessing and delivering email; the idea of using an email client like Outlook Express has been completely superseded by web interfaces and email “in the cloud” that provides many advantages over a dedicated client with your mail in your own local storage.</p><p>Bitcoin, which will transform the way you transfer money, needs to be understood on its own terms, and not just as an online form of money. Thinking about bitcoin as money is as absurd as thinking about email as another form of sending letters by post; one not only replaces the other but it profoundly changes the way people send and consume messages. It is not a simple substitution or one-dimensional improvement of an existing idea or service.</p><p>As I have explained previously, <a href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=3135"><strong>Bitcoin is not money</strong></a>. Bitcoin is <a href="http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=3166"><strong>a protocol</strong></a>. If you treat it in this way, with the correct assumptions, you can start the process of putting Bitcoin in a proper context, allowing you to make rational suggestions about the sort of services that might be profitable based on it.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Every part of Bitcoin is text. It is always text, and never at any point ceases to be text. This is a fact, and as text, it is protected under the free speech provisions of the constitutions of civilized nations with guaranteed, irrevocable rights.<br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>If Bitcoin is a protocol and not money (it is), then setting up currency exchanges that mimic real-world money, stock and commodity exchanges to trade in it is not the sole means of discovering its price. You would not set up an email exchange to discover the value of email services, and the same thing applies to Bitcoin.</p><p>Staying with this train of thought, when you type in an email on your Gmail account, you are inputting your “letter”. You press send, it goes through your ISP, over the internet, into the ISP of your recipient and then it is outputted on your recipient’s machine. The same is true of Bitcoin; you input money on one end through a service and then send the bitcoin to your recipient, without an intermediary to handle the transfer. Once Bitcoin does its job of moving your <a href="http://www.weusecoins.com/globe-Bitcoin/">value across the globe</a> to its recipient it needs to be “read out”, i.e., turned <em>back into money</em>, in the same way that your letter is displayed to its recipient in an email.</p><p>In the email scenario, once the transfer happens and the email you have received conveys its information to you, it has no use other than to be a record of the information that was sent (accounting), and you archive that information. Bitcoin does this accounting on the blockchain for you, and a good service built on it will store extended transaction details for you locally, but what you need to have as the recipient of bitcoin is <em>services </em>or <em>goods </em>not bitcoin itself.</p><p>Bitcoin’s true nature is as an instant way to pay (despite not being money) anywhere in the world. It is not an investment, and holding on to it in the hopes that it will become valuable is like holding on to an email or a PDF in the hopes it will become valuable in the future without simultaneously investing in the companies that provide access to it for consumers doesn’t make any sense. Of course, you <em>can</em> hold on to bitcoin and watch its value go up, and its value <em>will </em>go up, but you need to have guts to weather the violent waves of selling and buying as the transition to an all-bitcoin economy gets under way.</p><p>Despite the fact that you can’t double spend them and each one is unique, bitcoin have no inherent value, unlike a book or any physical object. They cannot appreciate in value. Mistaken thinking about Bitcoin has spread because <em>it behaves like money</em>, due to the fact it cannot be double spent. Misrepresentation of Bitcoin’s true nature has masked its dual nature of being digital and not double-spendable.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Razzles. They start as a candy, and then end as a gum. Before you chew them, which are they? A candy, or a gum?<br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>Bitcoin is digital, with all the qualities of information that make information non-scarce. It sits in a new place that oscillates between the goods of the physical world and the infinitely abundant digital world of information, belonging exclusively to the digital world but having the characteristics of both. This is why it has been widely misunderstood and why a new approach is needed to design businesses around it.</p><p>All of this goes some way to explain why the price of buying bitcoin at the exchanges <strong>doesn’t matter for the consumer</strong>. If the cost of buying bitcoin goes to 1¢, this doesn’t change the amount of money that comes out at the other end of a transfer. As long as you redeem your bitcoin immediately after the transfer into either goods or currency, the same value comes out at the other end no matter what you paid for the bitcoin when you started the process.</p><p>Think about it this way. Let us suppose that you want to send a long text file to another person. You can either send it as it is, or you can compress it with zip. The size of a document file when it is zipped can be <a href="http://file-compression-software-review.toptenreviews.com/file-compression-software-compression-test.html">up to 87% smaller</a> than the original. When we transpose this idea to Bitcoin, the compression ratio is the price of bitcoin at an exchange. If bitcoin trades for $100, and you want to buy something from someone in India for $100 you need to buy 1 bitcoin to get that $100 to India. If the price of bitcoin is 1¢ then you need 10,000 bitcoin to send $100 dollars to India. These would be expressed as compression ratios of 1:1 and 10,000:1 respectively.</p><p>The same $100 value is sent to India, whether you use 10,000 or 1 bitcoin. The price of bitcoin <em>is irrelevant to the value that is being transmitted</em>, in the same way that zip files do not “care” what is inside them; Bitcoin and zip are dumb protocols that do a job. As long as the value of bitcoin does not go to zero, it will have the same utility as if the value were very “high”.</p><p>Bearing all of this in mind, it’s clear that <a href="https://medium.com/@beautyon_/azteco-bitcoin-for-the-masses-fc17f8ca1df0">new services to facilitate the rapid, frictionless conversion into</a> and out of bitcoin are needed to allow it to function in a manner that is true to its nature.</p><p>The current business models of exchanges are not addressing Bitcoin’s nature correctly. They are using a twentieth-century model of stock, commodity, and currency exchanges and superimposing this onto Bitcoin. Interfacing with these exchanges is non-trivial, and for the ordinary user a daunting prospect. In some cases, you have to wait up to seven days to receive a transfer of your fiat currency after it has been cashed out of your account from bitcoin. While this is not a fault of the exchanges, it represents a very real impediment to Bitcoin acting in its nature and providing its complete value.</p><p>Imagine this; you receive an email from across the world, and you are notified of the fact by being displayed the subject line in your browser. You then <em>apply </em>to your ISP to have this email delivered to you and you have to wait seven days for it to arrive in your physical mailbox.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The very idea is completely absurd, and yet, this is exactly what is happening with bitcoin, for no technical reason whatsoever.</p><p>It is clear that there needs to be a rethink of the services that are growing around Bitcoin, along with a rethink of what the true nature of Bitcoin is. Rethinking services is a normal part of entrepreneurship and we should expect business models to fail and early entrants to fall by the wayside as the ceaseless iterations and pivoting progress, just as it was in the early days of the web.</p><p>Bearing all of this in mind, focusing on the price of bitcoin at exchanges using a business model that is inappropriate for this new software simply is not rational; it’s like putting a methane-breathing canary as a detector in a mine full of oxygen-breathing humans. The bird dies even though nothing is wrong with the air; the miners rush to evacuate, leaving the exposed gold seams behind, thinking that they are all about to be wiped out when all is actually fine.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Day traders speculating on bitcoin from home cause the price to oscillate. It’s an artificial signal that has nothing to do with demand for bitcoin and its circulation as an economic tool to facilitate commerce.<br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>Bitcoin, and the ideas behind it are here to stay. As the number of people downloading the client and using it increases, like Hotmail, it will eventually reach critical mass and then spread exponentially through the internet. When that happens, the correct business models will spontaneously emerge, as they will become obvious — in the same way that Hotmail, Gmail, Facebook, cellular phones, and instant messaging seem like second nature.</p><p>In the future. I imagine that very few people will speculate on the value of bitcoin, because even though that might be possible, and even profitable, there will be more money to be made in providing easy-to-use Bitcoin services that take full advantage of what Bitcoin is.</p><p>One thing is for sure; speed will be of the essence in any future Bitcoin business model. The start-ups that provide instant satisfaction on both ends of the transaction are the ones that are going to succeed. Even though the volatility of the price of bitcoin is bound to stabilize, since it has no use in and of itself, getting back to money or goods instantly will be a sought-after characteristic of any business built on Bitcoin.</p><p>The needs of Bitcoin businesses provide many challenges in terms of performance, security, and new thinking. Out of these challenges will come new practices and software that we can only just imagine as they come over the horizon.</p><p>Finally, when there is no more fiat, and <a href="https://medium.com/@beautyon_/bitcoin-adoption-and-conway-s-game-of-life-54ca71db7b88">the chaotic transition zone between fiat and Bitcoin</a> has been abolished, then everything will be priced in bitcoin, and there will be no volatility, because no one uses anything other than bitcoin to buy or sell. If you know any chemistry, this will be like a reaction’s reagents reaching equilibrium; you can shake it and stir it all you like; the reaction is over and you’re left with the inert product.</p><p>Right now, compared to the amount of fiat in the world, bitcoin can expand and contract very rapidly over a large range, because it is small in volume. It can expand to what for many is an unimaginably high price, and then shrink down again. As it gets bigger and accumulates more mass (its price expressed in fiat), these fluctuations will become smaller and smaller. Through all of this, bitcoin remains exactly the same; it is its users that are publishing numbers as a signal to react upon that are changing.</p><p>In its essence, this is a struggle between Bitcoiners and liars. The liars who promote democracy and who believe that morality and even rights can come out of a vote.</p><p>The ideas of socialism and democracy are diametrically opposed to the core philosophy of a voluntary peer-to-peer system like Bitcoin. Peer-to-peer systems disintermediate the transfer of information and eliminate the need for an arbitrary governing authority or service provider. Bitcoin, like math, has no philosophy and is neutral.</p><p>Socialism’s basic premise is that “property is theft”, and that all property, goods, and services should be collectively owned for the benefit of all people in a coercive State with no opt-out. Under a socialist system of forced organization, individuals do not have free use of their inherent rights, which are violently suppressed.</p><p>This is an inherently immoral proposition, where one group of people inevitably coalesce into an illegitimate ruling class to control and administer other people “for their own good” — the good of the collective. Even if this aggregation of power were not the case, no man or group of men has the right to force another man to relinquish his property.</p><p>Libertarians understand that there is no such thing as “the rights of the collective” and that only a living individual human has rights. Chief among these rights, the “root right”, is the right of <strong>property</strong>. Anyone who contends that Bitcoin is a socialist idea is fundamentally mistaken about how Bitcoin works and its true nature, or is trying to redefine socialism so that it can fit in with and be the standard-bearer of the inevitable rise of Bitcoin. You can detect this when you read the phrase, “my idea of socialism is”, which means that the speaker wants to abandon the bad smell of socialism and rebrand the word to mean something that it is not, so that he can remain “a committed socialist” and be a part the real world at the same time.</p><p>Bitcoin is the antithesis of socialism. Bitcoin transfers, and the ownership of bitcoin and the rules governing exchanges are not administered by a central State authority — unlike a system designed by a socialist, where who can own what, how much of it, and what can be done with it is absolutely regulated by a group of violent bureaucrats.</p><p>Bitcoin is a strict peer-to-peer protocol, and not a centralized system under the control of arbitrary rules or fallacious economic ideas like Keynesianism. In its essence, Bitcoin acts like a law of nature (powered by cryptography) and it does not and cannot care about your philosophy or ideology. By dint of this alone, Bitcoin cannot be called socialist or have a political philosophy attributed to it any more than an inanimate object or a fundamental force of nature can. It is designed to do one thing, it does that one thing, and that one thing is not inherently political; only Bitcoin’s users have political ideas that they try, and fail, to superimpose upon it. Bitcoin is neutral, like a hammer or a neutron or a handgun.</p><p>Bitcoin is a stateless tool that is purely voluntary. You may or may not use bitcoin at your own discretion. No one forces you to be a part of the Bitcoin ecosystem or to abide by its rules. How much bitcoin you accumulate in exchange for goods and services is entirely up to you and your trading partners, and what you spend your bitcoin on is entirely up to you.</p><p>The users of Bitcoin do not “have a say” in what you can or cannot do with them. There is no State, statist, or socialist that can tell you that you may not collect as many bitcoin as you can, or that your bitcoin belong to the collective, or that you must hand over a percentage of them to the State “for the good of the people”.</p><p>Users of Bitcoin, by default, are freely associating people, choosing freely to accept the rules of the Bitcoin system. This is the complete opposite of socialism, which is the negation of individual liberty, the abolition of free choice, and the elimination of property rights.</p><p>Anyone who claims to be a socialist while advocating for the widespread adoption of bitcoin is de facto acting against their socialist principles and desire to create a world where collective property ownership and centralized direction of capital is enforced by violence.</p><p>In a world where money transfers are made entirely through bitcoin, a socialist state will at the very least have a huge amount of trouble compelling people to hand over their money to the State by force. As usual, the socialist collectivists will resort to threats, violence, imprisonment, confiscation of real property, and any other immoral and disgusting means they can come up with to steal money from people. This prompts the question, “how can an avowed socialist advocate the adoption of bitcoin when it has the potential to destroy his violent Statist utopia from the inside out?”<em>.</em></p><p>It’s an interesting question. I suspect that many socialists who advocate the adoption of bitcoin are having a profound internal struggle with the emergence of not only Bitcoin but of the internet itself and its astonishing, undeniable example of stateless cooperation between men that has changed the world and had the effect of benefiting everyone.</p><p>The internet has brought the entire body of human knowledge to everyone who uses it, at a cost that is near zero. It has also rendered practically redundant the state monopoly over telephone systems and postal systems. Anyone who still believes that “we” need the State in the face of these revelations is completely insane, or is on the road to abandoning socialism, or is sticking his fingers in his ears, unable to face the facts of this matter.</p><p>Mankind is better off in every way without the State. The paradigm shifts brought about by the internet in publishing, music distribution, postal mail, telephony, and the new, unprecedented services created by the connectivity of the internet are proof of this. Each of these industries has been regulated by the State in the offline world, and now that they are running in the online world without State regulation they are more efficient and beneficial by orders of magnitude. The only people who are against this are the vested interests, the buggy whip makers and the socialists, and every time they try and exert their influence they inconvenience and damage people and cause them to expend time and money where they would otherwise not have to.</p><p>The next great shift on the internet is going to be the complete disruption of the sclerotic bank-mediated money transfer systems in favor of internet-facilitated money transfers that remove banks entirely from the process flow. This event will cause a great acceleration in the transaction rate of commerce worldwide, will defund the socialist states and be of great benefit to everyone, everywhere.</p><p>All the attempts the banks are making now to embrace the internet and peer-to-peer payments systems will eventually fail, as long as people are free to develop software, release it, and freely interface with money at will. This is why PayPal had banned transfers that touch bitcoin in any way; they knew that Bitcoin is completely superior to PayPal, and that it constituted an existential threat to their business. PayPal allowing its system to be used to make payments in exchange for bitcoin is allowing blood vessels to feed a cancerous tumor. Bitcoin is cancer to PayPal and they must kill it at any cost.</p><p>The PayPal response to the inevitable peer-to-peer payment ecosystem in the form of their “Blue Dorito” suffers from the fatal elixir of powdered friction, arbitrary rules, suppression, and regulation by the State, all made soluble with a profound lack of imagination — none of which Bitcoin suffers from… but that is beyond the scope of this post. PayPal (and Coinbase) will eventually become the MySpace of moving money because they’re both wedded to a pre-internet mode of thinking when it comes to payments, and they are in an abusive shotgun wedding with the State.</p><p>Bitcoin is going to be the vehicle for services that make this disruption come to pass. Once critical mass is reached, Bitcoin will be completely unstoppable. We need only look at the French restrictions on 128bit SSL and the way they dropped them when it became the standard protection for e-commerce transactions. The first sign of this shift will be the adoption of Bitcoin as an accessory service on one of the major money transfer service providers, offering bitcoin transfers to the computer illiterate.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Bitcoin, <em>by design</em>, is not democratic. No matter how many times you try and assert that it is, it is not, <em>and it never will be</em>. And it is also not socialist, as I just clearly explained.</p><p>Removing all of the fascinating, revolutionary technical details, the core of Bitcoin is that it is <em><strong>voluntary</strong></em> and the transactions and ledger entries made with it are mediated by a computer program. <em><strong>You choose</strong></em>, as a free human being, to download the required software, use Bitcoin and be bound by the network’s fixed rules.</p><p>There is <strong>no voting</strong> involved, <strong>no coercion</strong>, <strong>no obligation</strong>, social or otherwise to use it. You are not even required to donate your CPU and bandwidth to the Bitcoin network in exchange for using it. When you use Bitcoin, you <em>volunteer</em> to use it on its terms. It is as simple as that.</p><p>Lest you have any un-clarity about this, making a choice in and of itself <strong>is not “democratic”</strong>. More on that below, but to understand why Bitcoin is not democratic, we need to understand what democracy is.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDYzMDEwNjU0Mzk3OTU3/image4.jpg" height="426" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p><strong>What is “democracy”? </strong>Democracy is a coercive political system where people in a geographic area are “enfranchised”. This means that they all have a “vote”, allocated one vote per man, that they can cast in “elections”, where the accumulator of the most votes wins, and then that person takes “office”. No matter what the winner thinks or his plans are, he gets extraordinary, unconstrained, extra-judicial, extra-ethical powers over the “electorate” and near total immunity from the law.</p><p>That is <strong>all</strong> that democracy is.</p><p>I shall leave out that once in power, these people steal, murder, lie, corrupt, and poison to their black heart’s content, with almost absolute certainty that they will get away with whatever evil they do, no matter what the scale. In fact, the bigger the scale of their crimes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_expenses_claims_in_the_United_Kingdom_parliamentary_expenses_scandal">the less likely they are</a> to face any justice of any kind, and the more likely they are to be rewarded. And of course, the sole monopoly on the dispensing of justice belongs to the same “democracy” which in effect, polices itself. In civil litigation the guiding principle is that no one may be a judge in his own cause, but in democracy, this is the default. It is an open scandal.</p><p>Now back to Bitcoin. At no point in the Bitcoin process do you have a vote over any aspect of how Bitcoin works, who owns what bitcoin, how they are distributed, transferred, their value, or anything whatsoever to do with its operation. If you don’t like it, you’re free to decline to use it.</p><p>The fact that you can choose one good over another does not mean you are participating in democracy or acting “democratic”. You cannot say that, “Ice cream is democratic”, because you can choose whatever flavor you like in Baskin Robbins or Carvel. Or choose Baskin Robbins over Carvel. You cannot say that choosing a Volkswagen over a Ford Fiesta is, “a democratic choice”. Democracy means only the hermetically sealed one-man-one-vote inherently corrupt and unethical political system. That is it. <em>That is all.</em></p><p>Because millions of people have been brainwashed in government schools to believe that the system of government that educated them is the best, they have been encouraged to misuse the word “democracy” as a synonym for everything good or anything that is beneficial. I have even heard people saying, <em>“that’s very democratic of you”</em> when someone does another person a good turn. This is how distorted the meaning of the word “democracy” has become.</p><p>Bitcoin is a beneficial technology, so quite naturally, these uneducated and dangerous people will use the word “democracy” in association with it, despite it having no relation of any kind, way, shape, or form to democracy. Thinking about it, it is <em>rather good</em> that these people think Bitcoin is democratic. If they understood its <em>true</em> nature, they would hysterically rail against its mass adoption, as they have been trained like dogs to do against any threat to the violent system that has them in a hypnotic spell.</p><p>And these people are <em>very</em> well trained. And totally hypnotized. It should come as no surprise then, that Bitcoin, the software that is going to be of benefit to billions of people on Earth, is being called “democratic”. Sorry to shatter your mesmeric delusions, democracy lovers; Bitcoin <strong>is not democratic,</strong> and using it has <strong>nothing to do with majority rule, force, voting</strong>, or <em>anything</em> that touches democracy in any way. Bitcoin is without your greasy taint or fetid stink.</p><p>The nonsense that a choice in the market is “democratic” stems from the fallacious idea that consumers spending money is somehow a “vote”. It is not. It is an <em>economic choice</em>, <strong>that does not impose any rule over others</strong>, has nothing to do with achieving a majority, etc. Note also how some deranged thinkers misuse the word “voice”. This is the only way that the delusional democracy booster can make an argument — by distorting English until words lose all their meaning. People spending money do not “have a voice” (or as they say in the U.K., <em>“have their say”</em>); they have a <em>choice</em>. Even if they are using fraudulent central-bank-printed paper money, their voice, opinion, or sentiment is <em>irrelevant</em> at the moment of choice and exchange.</p><p>Even if you were to repurpose “the Blockchain” to act as a voter registration and voting system (ironically, it would then <em>truly</em> become a <em>chain</em>; a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGAiW5dOnKo">Chain of Fools</a> that holds people as slaves to morally repugnant, violent, and unethical mob rule). This would not make Bitcoin <em>the money-transport system</em> democratic, it would simply be another “creative” use of the blockchain software — this time for an antisocial and completely evil purpose: enforcing the hold, coercion, and violence of democracy.</p><p>In this nightmare scenario, the miners would become de facto gaolers. Stealing bitcoin would mean that the political system could be bought — literally — for bitcoin. The idea is as nauseating as it is wrong.</p><p>All of this absurd posturing and conflating of Bitcoin with democracy (or socialism), however, is now nothing more than faintly amusing noise. The people who are doing it are as irrelevant as dead men.</p><p>The people who love democracy are going to find out <strong>first-hand</strong> what democracy really means and what it did to them, by virtue of its abrupt absence and the contrast of life before and after democracy. Bitcoin is going to defund the State by absorbing and extinguishing all the fiat currency in the world, so that eventually the the deluded slaves of democracy can vote all day and all night without the votes cast having any effect whatsoever. <a href="https://medium.com/bitcoin-think/the-bitcoin-future-super-cell-london-4505eea1129f">The libertarian society, protected and powered by Bitcoin</a>, will not allow the violent, deluded, and sick devotees of democracy to wage war, steal money, or interfere with voluntary contracts and exchange.</p><p>Bitcoin is not democratic; it is <strong>voluntarist</strong>. No matter what you say or believe, the nature of Bitcoin does not change. You can call it a fruit cake, a leprechaun, cotton candy, a joke, <a href="http://dexterslab.wikia.com/wiki/Koosalagoopagoop">Koosalagoopagoop</a>, or anything else that you fancy. As it is with the ocean, if you dive into it, you <strong>will get wet</strong>. What you <em>want</em> does not come into it. If it is your desire to stay dry, don’t jump in, but you cannot expect to stay dry and go swimming <em>at the same time</em>. Calling Bitcoin democratic when it is not is utterly absurd, and insulting. The world has had quite enough of it and its virus-like variants.</p><p>Finally, Bitcoin doesn’t care what you think. It can’t care about anything. What you think doesn’t matter; that is the ultimate power of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is like a force of nature. You must conform to ethical standards of behavior in the Bitcoin-mediated world, or starve, since the option of violence is taken off of the table. The implications of all of this will only become clear once it is too late for the democracy lovers to stop it, who will be left scratching their heads wondering what happened, why democracy died, and crucially, why everything has not fallen apart…</p><p>…but is now<strong> </strong><em><strong>infinitely better</strong>.</em></p><p>No government on Earth can change Bitcoin. They can either fail or adapt to Bitcoin. By allowing themselves to be transformed by Bitcoin, in a counter-intuitive and astonishing result, they will become more powerful than they ever have been. The benefits Bitcoin will bring to every economy will give unprecedented new tools to governments, not to oppress and destroy, but to do right by the explicit permission of the populace.</p><p>As people adopt Bitcoin, they will be “voting with their money” and moving to a space where the thin-skinned, lying boosters of democracy have no power over anything.</p><p>Bitcoin will eventually absorb all fiat currency in the world as consumer Bitcoin clients like <a href="https://pine.pm/">Pine</a> are installed globally. The jurisdictions that allow companies that facilitate this transformation to work unencumbered are going to be the new financial centers of the 21st century. And if they don’t, the absorption is going to happen in any case.</p><p>Whether or not your aim is to dominate in Bitcoin services as a nation, there is no other rational way to approach this other than abandoning KYC/AML, and Conway’s “Game of Life” provides a neat illustration of why this is so.</p><p>The <strong>Game of Life</strong>, also known simply as <strong>Life</strong>, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">cellular automaton </a>devised by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">British</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician">mathematician</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">John Horton Conway</a> in 1970.</p><p>The world in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a> is a two-dimensional grid of square <em>cells</em>, each of which is in one of two possible states, <em>alive</em> or <em>dead</em>. Every cell interacts with its eight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood"><em>neighbors</em></a>, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:</p><ol><li><em>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by underpopulation.</em></li><li><em>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</em></li><li><em>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</em></li><li><em>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</em></li></ol><p>Let us now superimpose this simple idea on Bitcoin adoption. Imagine a world where there is total KYC/AML, and it has been running for years, with steady growth in Bitcoin adoption. The illustration below is a picture of this world; it is a grid with one billion cells in it. Each cell is a human being who uses money or bitcoin. If the cell is black, they use bitcoin as money. If the cell is white, they use fiat currency as money.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDYzMDEwNjU0MjY2ODg1/kyc-absorption-zone.png" height="526" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>For a cell to turn from white to black (a person starting to use bitcoin), fiat must be converted into bitcoin at a KYC/AML entry point. This happens in a thin line at the <strong>edge</strong> of the fuzzy gray mass, via compliant companies that provide this conversion service.</p><p>Everyone <strong>outside</strong> in the white zone is either unbanked or using only fiat currency and banks. Everyone <strong>inside</strong> the mass in the black zone uses bitcoin. Those in the black zone do not ever engage with KYC/AML, because they <em>already have bitcoin</em>, and regularly send it anywhere, to any person, globally <em>without further permission of any kind.</em></p><p>The central mass increases in size as it absorbs fiat currency. It will keep growing until either it absorbs all fiat currency, or a lower-than-total absorption equilibrium point is reached. A lower-than-total absorption equilibrium could be caused by the Bitcoin network reaching a technical upper limit (like the transaction rate limit, which is now impossible on a practical level thanks to Elizabeth Stark’s Lightning Labs “Layer-2” network) or a psychological or political distortion (banning, taxation, FUD, usability, or some other artificial pressure).</p><p>We can see from this illustration and thought experiment that eventually, there will be a huge number of users who will <strong>never again</strong> need to be KYC-/AML-verified, <em>because their money exists and circulates freely only as bitcoin</em>. This means that inside the Bitcoin ecosystem, KYC/AML is <strong>worthless</strong> after the first conversion. It also becomes immediately clear that any bitcoin <em>leaving</em> the mass <strong>on a peer-to-peer basis</strong> when new bitcoin users are brought in, creates more mass without KYC/AML, and this amount will be very large once the central mass is large.</p><p>This simple illustration shows what will happen as bitcoin absorbs fiat currency. KYC/AML will have a short life, after which it will be worthless as a tool to track people, since a large number of users are in bitcoin and never touch fiat.</p><p>Rather than go through this completely pointless stage of KYC/AML, <a href="https://medium.com/bitcoin-think/our-submission-to-the-british-governments-digital-currencies-call-for-information-160fbf103bbc#.82d3qyz40">a nation with competent leaders will understand the inevitable, and race to attract companies into their jurisdictions by eschewing the regulation of Bitcoin services.</a></p><p>The benefits of the virtuous circle of Bitcoin firms all incorporating and working in the same small area of the same city cannot be overstated. As a long-term strategy, abandoning KYC/AML is the only logical path.</p><p>Inside the absorption zone is where all the businesses touching Bitcoin will operate. That is where Bitcoin “pure play” businesses will flourish, and that means software companies, providing the very important wallet and merchant services, new classes of services built on multisig and the other tools in Bitcoin; powered escrow services, time-triggered conditional payments, and many other things.</p><p>All people, institutions, and governments in the future will be equal peers on the Bitcoin network where no person or entity has any more control over Bitcoin than any other, and everyone has access on the same, provably fair, equal basis.</p><p>Bitcoin is the pure, level playing field where no one can cheat and everyone is guaranteeing the network for the benefit of everyone else. This is not “democratic” as some very stupid people might want to convince you; this is <em>voluntarism in motion.</em></p><p>All corruption comes from the law produced by crony capitalism and democracy and unethical companies using it to distort economics. Under a Bitcoin regime, it will not be possible to print money for any reason whatsoever. That former privilege of the State is permanently revoked in Bitcoin. Now money is allocated by merit alone; you cannot accumulate money if you don’t serve other people. That is true on an individual level, the business level, and the governmental level also. Everyone will have the absolute power to refuse to pay for anything they would rather not pay for. This will become a universal law under Bitcoin.</p><p>In Bitcoin, everyone will have a free choice to be a slave or not, but not with other people’s money. You can <em>voluntarily choose</em> to subordinate yourself to liars, democracy boosters, and warmongers, but y<em>ou can’t forcibly enlist other people and their money</em>. Since most people are not interested in “Spreading Democracy”, demonizing and murdering brown-skinned strangers and other vile, disgusting things, you can be sure that the ills of the 20th century spread by democracy and its evil boosters will come to a sharp, abrupt, permanent, and most welcome end.</p><p>Naturally the question that follows is, “Which of the current nation-states has the best chance of dominating in this Bitcoin-mediated world?”. Oddly enough, the country whose government behaved the worst in the 20th century has the best chance of turning itself around and becoming a beacon of light again. <strong>The United States of America</strong>.</p><p>The Founding Fathers of the greatest country in the history of the world, the United States of America, gifted that nation a system borne of genius, ethics, and subtlety. That astonishing system, when combined with and constrained by Bitcoin, will create a nation that will last longer than the Roman Empire and be more prosperous. All that is required is that it follows the law as laid down by the Founders.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CCqCsmCDdw">Hearings on Bitcoin</a> and its derivatives are being held in the USA on a regular basis, and invariably the expert witnesses fail to properly describe the actual processes going on. If they used the correct language and excluded all analogies, the only possible conclusion would be that <strong>America cannot regulate Bitcoin under its current legal system</strong>. The Constitution guarantees the inalienable rights of American citizens, and therefore Bitcoin is a protected act or practice by virtue of it being a form of published text. The only way Bitcoin can be made regulable is if the Constitution is changed; and that does not mean adding a new Amendment — it means <strong>removing the First Amendment entirely</strong>.</p><p>Inevitably the anti-Bitcoin “protagonists” will face a robust and ultimately successful legal challenge that will remove the possibility of any sort of “BitLicense” or interference from the CTFC, FinCEN, or any other agency. It will also remove any possibility of interference at the State level. The consequence of adhering to the basic law of the United States will cause America to become the center of all Bitcoin business for the entire world, and will cause trillions of dollars worth of e-commerce to flow through the USA.</p><p>Let me explain why this is the case.</p><p>Some say that Bitcoin is money. Others say that it is not money. It doesn’t matter. What does matter are three things: that Bitcoin is, that the Bitcoin network does what it is meant to do completely reliably, and what the true nature of the Bitcoin network and the messages in it are.</p><p>Bitcoin is a database, maintained by a network of peers that monitors and regulates which entries are allocated to what Bitcoin addresses. This is done entirely by transmitting messages that are <em>text</em>, between the computers in the network (known as “nodes”), where cryptographic procedures are executed on these <em>messages in text </em>to verify their authenticity and the identity of the sender and recipient of the message and their position in the public ledger. The messages sent between nodes in the Bitcoin network are human readable, and printable. There is no point in any Bitcoin transaction at which Bitcoin ceases to be <em>text. </em>It is <em>all</em> <em>text</em>, all the time.</p><p>Bitcoin can be printed out onto sheets of paper. This output can take different forms, like machine-readable QR codes, or it can be printed out in the letters A to Z, a to z, and 0 to 9. This means they can be read by a human being, just like “Huckleberry Finn”.</p><p>At the time of the creation of the United States of America, the Founding Fathers of that new country in their deep wisdom and distaste for tyranny, haunted by the memory of the absence of a free press in the countries from which they escaped, wrote into the basic law of that then-young federation of free states, an explicit and unambiguous freedom, the “Freedom of the Press”. This amendment was first because of its central importance to a free society. The First Amendment guarantees that all Americans have the power to exercise their right to publish and distribute anything they like, without restriction or prior restraint.</p><blockquote><p><em>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</em></p></blockquote><p>This single line, forever precludes any law that restricts Bitcoin <strong>in any way</strong>.</p><p>In 1995, the U.S. Government had on the statute books laws that restricted the export of encryption software products from America without a license. These goods are classified as “munitions”. The first versions of the breakthrough Public Key Encryption software <em>“Pretty Good Privacy”, </em>or “PGP”, written by Philip Zimmerman had already escaped the USA via bulletin board systems from the moment it was first distributed, but all copies of PGP outside of the United States were “illegal”. In order to fix the problem of all copies of PGP outside of America being encumbered by this perception, an ingenious plan was put into motion, using the First Amendment as the means of legally making it happen.</p><p>The source code for PGP was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#Criminal_investigation">printed out</a>.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDYzMDEwNjU0MzMyNTkz/image5.jpg" height="465" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><em>The original print-out of the PGP source code.</em></figcaption>
    </figure><p>It’s as simple as that. Once the source code for PGP was printed in book form, it instantly and more importantly, <em>unambiguously</em>, fell under the protection of the First Amendment. As a binary, the U.S. government ridiculously tried to assert that immaterial software is <em>a device</em>, and not <em>text (software or “binaries” is text that can be run </em><em>on</em><em> devices). </em>Clearly the idea that software is a device is patently absurd, but rather than waste money arguing this point in court, printing out PGP removed all doubt that a First Amendment act was taking place.</p><p>The printed source code was shipped to another country, perfectly legally and beyond challenge, and then transferred to a machine by OCR (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition"><em>Optical Character Recognition</em></a><em>, a software tool that can turn a printed page into a text file, removing the need for a person to manually type out a printed page</em>), resulting in a PGP executable that was legally exported from the United States.</p><p>The direct analogy to Bitcoin should be vividly clear to you now. PGP and Bitcoin are both:</p><ol><li>Pieces of software that can be rendered as printed text on paper.</li><li>Software that generates unique blocks of human readable text.</li><li>Designed to generate text that is 100% covered by the First Amendment.</li></ol><p>The purpose of PGP is to absolutely verify the identity of the sender of a message and ensure that the message was not read or changed in transit. The purpose of Bitcoin is to absolutely verify the ability of the owner of a cryptographic key (which is a block of text) that can unlock a ledger entry in the global Bitcoin network. Both of these pieces of software are <em>messaging systems and services </em>that absolutely fall under the First Amendment in every aspect, from the source code used to generate the software clients that do the message signing to the text the compiled clients generate, send, receive, and process.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDYyOTA2NTAxMzc1NjY1/bitcoin-is-text.png" height="465" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>Bitcoin is <strong>text</strong>. Bitcoin is <strong>speech</strong>. It cannot be regulated in a free country like the USA with guaranteed inalienable rights and a First Amendment that explicitly excludes the act of publishing from government oversight.</p><p>Bitcoin and PGP generate messages that are initiated by their users. Each of the messages that are generated by these two pieces of software are unique. The only bodies of law that could possibly be invoked regarding their output and source code are copyright and patent law respectively. The Bitcoin source is not copyrighted and the core idea of it is not patented, and in any case, none of this has anything to do with the nature of Bitcoin messages, or your right to publish. Typewriters can include patented methods in their construction, and those patents have no bearing on your First Amendment right to publish what you create with a patented tool.</p><p>Copyright gives the generator of these texts privileges under the law imposing fines on someone copying your message without your permission, but copyright law has nothing to do with exporting, regulating, or imposing a tax <em>on the messages themselves</em>, and of course, forbidding the copying of your Bitcoin payment message rather negates the purpose of using Bitcoin.</p><p>Taking all of this into account, if any legislator, regulator, three- or six-letter U.S. agency or other bureaucrat dares to try and regulate Bitcoin, they will be on a hiding to nothing. A legal challenge <a href="https://t.co/HfGxuOmyt6">will be mounted</a>, and will have to be mounted, because if the State can legislate against a single piece of software that generates messages, a legal precedent will be created allowing the U.S. government to regulate <em>all software no matter what it does</em><em>.</em></p><p>Bitcoin’s operation is fundamentally no different to what all email, text messaging, and internet-connected software do: relay messages. The only difference is in the software that tracks how the messages of the sender and recipient relate to each other. Email is no different to Bitcoin, save for the fact that a record of the sender and recipient and content of your email is not stored in a public ledger one against the other. We know it’s stored in a <em>private </em>database, but that’s another story. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=edward+snnowdn&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8"><em>Wink wink</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Here is <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/bernstein-v-us-dept-justice">another example</a> of case law proving that this reasoning is correct.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDYzMDEwNjU0NjYwMTAx/image12.png" height="314" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>In Bernstein v. U.S. Department of Justice, it was established that code is speech and is protected by the First Amendment. This absolutely and unambiguously applies to Bitcoin, with eerie parallels to KYC/AML in Bitcoin. The unconstitutional ITAR requirements are exactly the same as asking Bitcoin traders to register as “Money Transmitters” and seek licenses before they can be paid to transmit text to the Bitcoin network for publication on the public ledger. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found in Bernstein’s favor, and ruled that software <em>was speech</em> protected by the First Amendment and that the government’s regulations preventing its publication were unconstitutional. It is clear to see that Bitcoin falls squarely into the category of protected speech, there is no way around any of this, and the U.S. courts must come to the same conclusion for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is protected speech, and the case law says so explicitly.</p><p>The position that Bitcoin is money is fundamentally wrong, and systems like it have existed for many years without gaining the attention of any three-letter agencies. Take for example <em>FarmVille,</em> the massively popular farm simulation game on Facebook.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDYzMDEwOTIyNzAyMzQx/image13.png" height="297" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>From Wikipedia’s entry on FarmVille.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>This hugely popular game is no different to Bitcoin in nature. <em>FarmBucks</em> exist in a closed system, just as bitcoin does. The only difference is the size of the space where the messages are being sent, and in the case of <em>FarmBucks</em>, the number of users and transactions (messages sent) was large. FarmVille had 83,760,000 monthly active users and <strong>not a single one</strong> was subjected to KYC/AML to exchange fiat for FarmBucks or FarmCash. Why not? What happened to that money? Why weren’t FinCEN or SEC all over that game as they are on ICOs? No one can explain this adequately. This example is very useful as a tool to pull back the curtain on the people who assert that bitcoin is a money and is <strong>fundamentally</strong> different to a money kept in a game. All the rationales they use (mostly in the form of run-on sentences) to explain that the differences are inaccurate, and never address the fundamental processes; if they did, they would have no choice but to conclude that Bitcoin is no more subject to regulation than FarmBucks or PGP are.</p><p>Clearly, allowing legislation to touch Bitcoin means that any software <em>of any kind </em>will suddenly be liable to arbitrary and unconstitutional restriction. It will set a precedent that will be devastating to all software development in the USA, and software is the means by which everything is run, communicated, exchanged, and ordered in modern society. In fact, it is impossible to run a modern society without software.</p><p>Twitter for example, could find itself being regulated; it transmits messages that are no different in nature to the messages that Bitcoin transmits; the only difference being the publicly maintained ledger and application of the messages. In fact, Twitter could turn itself into a Bitcoin company quite easily by adding a few fields to its message <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Example">JSON schema</a> to include a Bitcoin address for each of its users, adding a page to its client, and running its own Bitcoin server pool. Would that extra text suddenly transform Twitter into a bank? Would that suddenly change the nature of each Tweet that is sent on their network, and cause them to be “Money Transmitters”? How is having a Bitcoin address integrated into your Twitter account different to making a promise by hand on Twitter to your followers or in a direct message?</p><p>Essentially, Bitcoin allows you to make written contracts with people without knowing them or signing paper; the network and software takes care of identifying and fulfilling the promise, all with cryptographically signed pieces of text. What the people calling for “BitLicenses” and the absurd, insulting, and totally anti-American “Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act”, are asserting is that because Bitcoin right now has a particular use, it should be exempted from the basic law of the United States of America. That is <strong>completely insane</strong>, and will have unintended consequences that would be <strong>absolutely disastrous</strong> for the American economy since almost everything today is mediated by or touches software.</p><p>On the other hand, if Bitcoin is left to flourish and the market allowed to define its services, means of setting the value and resolving disputes, Bitcoin as an ecosystem will be extremely robust and widespread, just like the internet is today, after having grown for decades without any regulation or oversight from the State.</p><p>Furthermore, as I have said previously, the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/our-submission-to-the-british-governments-digital-currencies-call-for-information-160fbf103bbc">country that does not enact Bitcoin legislation will become the starting point and end points of all Bitcoin transactions</a> globally by first-mover advantage. All other jurisdictions will see Bitcoin passing through them untaxed, and there will be nothing they can do about it, as Bitcoin is an unassailable peer-to-peer network.</p><p>We have seen a similar phenomenon with the legal position of encryption in France. SSL was regulated in France until <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/1999/01/15/france_to_end_severe_encryption/">Dominique Strauss-Khan, former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, removed the restrictions</a>. They knew that “French e-commerce” would take place inside <em>“le pays Roosbeef” </em>if it were not possible to secure French websites with SSL on demand without friction. American Bitcoin businesses (since the end points will be in their jurisdiction) will be taxed on their profits, and this will be a percentage of the trillions of global transactions made on the network for every conceivable and inconceivable purpose.</p><p>The same is true for any other country. The United States looks set to cripple itself by enacting “BitLicenses” and declaring by fiat that bitcoin is a currency, or a commodity, or legal tender. As I describe above, Bitcoin is none of those things by nature, and the myriad number of applications it can be put to is only just being discovered. Our project <a href="https://azte.co/">Azteco</a> is but one of them, with the potential to reach the billions of unbanked people in the world, and provide them with an easy way to access internet e-commerce, worldwide, with a system that makes payment fraud impossible. The potential benefit to the unbanked and the websites that sell goods online and the jurisdictions where those websites operate is without precedent. Only a <em>fool </em>would do something that could harm the advent of this transformation, or shun this new technology and the business building on it.</p><p>No legislature will be able to keep up with the advances in software that are taking place; there are too many developers and efficient tools in the wild all over the world, all with equal access to the market. The best the State can possibly hope for is to tax new businesses that use the new tools as they emerge, and encourage entrepreneurs to incorporate in their jurisdictions. If America wants to drive away Bitcoin developers, exchanges, and new businesses, by all means, do so and take the consequences. There are many other places in the world where fast internet pipes have been laid and where the government is not so backward. Skype was founded in Estonia, not Silicon Valley, and this is for a reason. All the big bitcoin exchanges are outside the USA. There is a reason for that. No one wanting to start a Bitcoin business is planning to move to New York from anywhere, because they know that their business models will immediately come under attack.</p><p>For those of you who are frightened of a free market in Bitcoin, rest assured, all the laws that currently exist to do with fraud, theft, misrepresentation, and everything else, continue to apply to all people and corporations who use bitcoin. Bitcoin does not make laws or your personal or corporate obligations moot. When you deal with a company, you retain access to the law and recourse to it. When someone makes a promise to sell you goods with bitcoin, that promise is not nullified because you are paying with bitcoin. Good Bitcoin businesses will build dispute resolution systems the way that eBay and Amazon have, so that you never have to go to court to obtain justice if there is a problem. Online, reputation is everything, and bad reputations can destroy your credibility and customer base overnight. This is a far more powerful incentive to behave correctly and fulfill promises, which most people do by default in any case, rather than some arbitrary and absurd “BitLicense”.</p><p>All the “BitLicenses” and “Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Acts” in the world could not stop Mt. Gox from having a software problem, and no law can bring back the money lost either directly or through the disruption caused by the software error. Once again, it is entrepreneurs powered by the internet that make life easier and better, not laws and regulations. Regulation does not make software correct; developers do.</p><p>I have one recommendation for anyone advocating that there should be a “BitLicense” or that the reprehensible “Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act” should become law. Don’t waste everyone’s time, money, and resources proposing this anti-American idea. The EFF has better things to do with their time than teach the PGP “Munitions Case” lesson all over again. If it goes to court, your side will lose, and as a consequence, America will lose its head start as all Bitcoin entrepreneurs flee the USA for environments that will allow them to innovate, grow, and prosper.</p><p>And what can the business people who want a “BitLicense” forced on the software industry say? <em>That they don’t trust themselves</em>? That’s patently absurd. That they do not trust their competitors? If it’s the case that their competitors are not good actors, then the good actors have a market advantage. Remember, a license cannot protect the public from fraud or provide any guarantee of any kind; it can only distort the market.</p><p>What these “BitLicense” and Lummis-Gillibrand advocates actually want is <em>a guaranteed market advantage</em>. They are anti-American crony capitalists. They want to prevent the emergence of a “Golden BB” entrepreneur that might destroy their business, they want to slow down and stifle innovation, so that they can become the entrenched and unassailable gatekeepers. They want to bar new entrants to the market. It simply will not work. <strong>And it’s un-American</strong>.</p><p>The American legislature must let the American dream flourish and extend its power to Bitcoin, or it will be compelled to obey the law, and this has started to happen. Two judges in the USA have now found that bitcoin is not money, and have thrown out “Money Laundering” charges against two men:</p><blockquote><p>U.S. Magistrate Judge Hugh B. Scott ruled in a money laundering case in Buffalo, N.Y., that bitcoin is more like a commodity and is not a form of currency, according to a local news report.</p><p>He recommended the money laundering charge be dropped against the defendant since bitcoin isn’t money.</p><p>In another money laundering case last year, Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Teresa Mary Pooler stated it is very clear, even to someone with limited knowledge in the area, that bitcoin has a long way to go before it is the equivalent of money.</p><p>–Archive: <a href="https://archive.is/pKQJ2">https://archive.is/pKQJ2</a></p></blockquote><p>Bitcoin is not money. KYC/AML should not apply to it at all. The Hugh B. Scott ruling is highly significant, because it directly contradicts the idea of BitLicence and Lummis-Gillibrand. And lest there be any doubt, all of this, including legal remedies for breach of promise, applies to “ICOs” and “NFT”s (so called, “Digital Collectibles”), which are also nothing more than <strong>text</strong> stored in a database. The fact that they are called, “Initial Coin Offerings” or “Digital Collectibles”<strong> is irrelevant</strong> to the underlying processes, and it is not illegal to parrot the language and terms of finance, which are not trademarked or copyrighted. The Hollywood Stock Exchange wasn’t deceptive because it called itself a “Stock Exchange”. Opponents of Bitcoin and ICOs have no good arguments, and the threadbare pretexts for regulation they’re able to synthesize are as flimsy as fiat.</p><p>The longer-term effects of bitcoin becoming the only money will be a total collapse in the public’s belief in the Political Class, who, having had the power to steal and redistribute money revoked from them, will have literally nothing to offer anyone anymore. If a ceremonial class of apratchicks (entirely at their own personal cost of course) should remain, it will attract only the most hard-core and mentally ill participants and spectators.</p><p>And these evil people will not have stormtroopers on tap to raid citizen’s houses and steal from them with “Civil Asset Forfeiture” and other measures. All security will be provided by the free market, where the only rule enforced is Natural Law.</p><p>This is, of course, anathema to democracy addicts, who will be forced to go cold turkey.</p><p>Incompetence will also be permanently deprecated and suppressed by the market, because all money is accounted for in a fine-grained way, and people will only pay for services and goods that actually serve them correctly.</p><p>All of this may sound like the most “out there” fantasy, but so did Bitcoin before Bitcoin. And now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXebE1eEMGOTe6ipH9n2AmUE3uLaKEfXE">Bitcoin is</a>, and the effects it will have are what we, the people who predicted it will be, not what some idiotic democracy booster believes or wants it to be. The evil people never saw the need for Bitcoin in the first place; why should anyone believe that they have the crystal ball? We do, they don’t.</p><p>And as for the imbeciles that believe that only the State can keep people safe, the facts are against this also. The story of the incandescent light bulb is a perfect example of a scenario that will be absolutely forbidden in the Bitcoin-mediated world.</p><figure>

type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act Of 2022 from Elizabeth Warren proposes unconstitutional privacy restrictions for bitcoin users.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by L0la L33tz, a privacy and security researcher and hacking advocate.</em></p><p>Yesterday, the U.S. Senate proposed the <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/DAAML%20Act%20of%202022.pdf">Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act Of 2022</a> — a bill that is not only deeply concerning to international human rights, but unconstitutional and in direct opposition to current U.S. consumer privacy regulations. </p><h2>What’s In The Bill?</h2><p>The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act Of 2022, proposed by Senator Elizabeth Warren, proposes the following regulations, among others:</p><ul><li>Section three, part a: The classification of custodial wallets and “unhosted wallet providers,” likely meaning developers of non-custodial wallets, as well as cryptocurrency miners, validators or other nodes that may act to validate or secure third-party transactions, independent network participants and other validators with control over network protocols as money service businesses.</li><li>Section three, part d: Promulgation of a rule that prohibits financial institutions from handling, using or transacting with digital asset mixers, privacy coins and other anonymity-enhancing technologies, as specified by the secretary of the U.S. Treasury; and handling, using or transacting business with digital assets that have been anonymized.</li></ul><p>Section three, part a of the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act Of 2022 would deem anyone developing non-custodial wallets as money transmitters, requiring them to obtain a license. The problem: “unhosted wallet providers” do not exist. “Unhosted wallets,” or non-custodial wallets, are simply software. </p><h2>Infringing On The First Amendment</h2><p>The enactment of section three, part a would hence require anyone writing software which enabled the sending, receiving and signing of bitcoin transactions to obtain a money transmitter license. This attempt at restricting the writing of code is nothing new and a directly unconstitutional approach, as the <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt1-7-1/ALDE_00013537/#:~:text=First%20Amendment%3A,for%20a%20redress%20of%20grievances.">U.S. constitution clearly states</a> that “Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.” </p><p>Under these circumstances, attempts at regulating the writing of software have been struck down by U.S. courts <a href="https://brownpoliticalreview.org/2022/03/decoding-speech/#:~:text=City%20Studios%2C%20Inc.-,v.,is%20unrelated%20to%20constitutional%20inquiry.">numerous times</a>. </p><p>In Universal City Studios vs. Corley, 2001, for instance, the second circuit <a href="http://digital-law-online.info/lpdi1.0/treatise50.html">addressed</a> the attempted restriction on computer code with the following arguments:</p><ul><li>Communication does not lose constitutional protection as “speech” simply because it is expressed in the language of computer code. If someone chose to write a novel entirely in computer object code by using strings of ones and zeroes for each letter of each word, the resulting work would be no different for constitutional purposes than if it had been written in English.</li><li>Computer programs are not exempted from the category of First Amendment speech simply because their instructions require use of a computer. A recipe is no less “speech” because it calls for the use of an oven, and a musical score is no less “speech” because it specifies performance on an electric guitar. The fact that a program has the capacity to direct the functioning of a computer does not mean that it lacks the additional capacity to convey information, and it is the conveying of information that renders instructions as “speech” for purposes of the First Amendment.</li><li>Limiting the First Amendment protections of programmers to descriptions of computer code (but not the code itself) would impede discourse among computer scholars, just as limiting protection for musicians to descriptions of musical scores (but not sequences of notes) would impede their exchange of ideas and expression. Instructions that communicate information comprehensible to a human qualify as speech whether the instructions are designed for execution by a computer or a human (or both).</li></ul><p>The court further cited that the limiting of free speech under the U.S. constitution is permitted if, and only if, it serves a substantial governmental interest, the interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression and the regulation is narrowly tailored, which, in this context, requires that the means chosen do not burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government’s legitimate interests.</p><h2>The Key Moving The House Around</h2><p>That section three of the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act serves any other purpose but the direct restriction of free expression is yet to be proven by Senator Warren. And even so, the section appears much too broad in scope to be legally applied without directly violating constitutional rights, particularly as developers of non-custodial wallets serve no purpose in the transmission of money. </p><p>Non-custodial wallets transmit bitcoin the currency as much as the key to one’s door moves the house around. Non-custodial wallets function as signing devices, which transfer the <em>access rights</em> to bitcoin — while the asset itself never moves. The attempt at restricting the development of non-custodial wallets would therefore constitute a regulation of public-private key cryptography, which, too, <a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1212&amp;context=uclf">has been attempted before and struck down</a> due to violation of the first amendment of the U.S. constitution. </p><p>Similarly nonsensical as framing developers of non-custodial wallets as money transmitters is the idea that “nodes who may act to validate or secure third-party transactions” and “independent network participants” must be defined as money service businesses, consequently constituting that anyone who runs a Bitcoin node must obtain a license to do so.</p><p>By definition, Bitcoin nodes do not secure third-party transactions. Rather, Bitcoin nodes validate one’s own version of the blockchain against copies obtained through other nodes in the network. Nodes neither secure nor transmit third-party transactions. No other user’s funds are affected if a Bitcoin node goes down. </p><p>The attempt of ruling Bitcoin node operators as money transmitters can therefore be seen as the attempt at regulating which individuals are allowed to compare information. Again, the proposed bill is unable to sufficiently prove that section three is narrow enough in scope to sufficiently warrant the approval of such a bill without infringing on further aspects of free speech and the freedom of information. </p><p>Section three further attempts to regulate bitcoin miners as money service businesses. Here, too, the bill exhibits an embarrassing level of misunderstanding of the inherent technology it attempts to restrict. </p><p>A bitcoin miner is nothing more than a computer, meaning a machine which processes code as speech. In no scenario does a bitcoin miner transmit bitcoin from A to B. Rather, a bitcoin miner propagates blocks of information to the network. A regulation of bitcoin miners does not hold up from a technological point of view. In addition section three again fails to prove that the permissioned use of bitcoin miners would not constitute further violations on anyone using a computer, particularly to access and broadcasting speech as protected under the U.S. constitution. </p><h2>Violating Well-Established Human Rights</h2><p>By attempting to restrict the handling, using or transacting of business with digital assets that have been anonymized as declared under section three, part d, the Digital Assets Anti-Money Laundering Act further infringes on aspects of the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/statutes/fair-credit-reporting-act">Fair Credit Reporting Act</a> (FCRA), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_privacy_laws_in_the_United_States#California_Privacy_Act">California Privacy Act</a>, the U.S. constitution’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privileges_and_Immunities_Clause">Privileges and Immunities Clause</a>, as well as Article 12 and Article 13 parts a and b of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>. </p><p>The FCRA of 1970 is a U.S. federal legislation which regulates the accuracy, fairness and privacy of consumer information as handled by credit reporting agencies in the scope of the collection, dissemination and use of consumer information, including consumer credit information. Under the act, credit reporting agencies are required to remove negative information seven years after the date of first delinquency, except for bankruptcies (10 years) and tax liens (seven years from the time they are paid). </p><p>Bitcoin transactions provide an immutable history of themselves. The restriction of privacy services and tools as defined under the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act as services “designed to conceal or obfuscate the origin, destination, and counterparties of digital asset transactions” directly violate FCRA regulations, as credit reporting agencies would be enabled to maintain indefinite records of any user’s financial information and transactions without the possibility of deletion. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/privacy-security/gramm-leach-bliley-act">Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</a> is a U.S. constitutional act guiding the regulation of banking companies, insurance companies and securities companies. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, companies are required to provide consumers with privacy notices at the time of the establishment of consumer relationships, documenting the scope of use of financial information. In accordance with the FCRA, users must be given the right to opt out of the sharing of information.</p><p>Because the blockchain is a public ledger, with the restriction of privacy protecting tools and services, users would be unable to opt out of the sharing of information, as financial information regarding bitcoin transactions is shared with everyone and anyone able to view the Bitcoin blockchain by default. The restriction of privacy tools and services therefore constitutes a direct violation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. </p><p>The California Privacy Act is a state-level privacy act which governs the handling of consumer information, including financial information. It is often seen as <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/Gramm-Leach-Bliley-Act">a more strict implementation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</a>. The act herein constitutes that financial information must be maintained within one financial entity, restricting access to other financial entities based on affiliation. </p><p>In the case of bitcoin transactions, any financial business conducting transactions on the blockchain on behalf of customers unavoidably shares customer’s financial information with other financial entities — namely anyone able to view a block explorer — as, again, the blockchain is a public ledger. Restricting the use of privacy technologies such as blinded e-cash or CoinJoin for businesses herein directly violates the relevant sections of the California Privacy Act. </p><p>The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act further violates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Privacy_Rights_Act">California Privacy Rights Act of 2020</a> which constitutes that businesses must obtain permission through a parent or guardian to collect data on individuals below the age of 16; a regulation unenforceable with the restriction of privacy tools as the age of Bitcoin users cannot clearly be distinguished in the bulk collection of chain analysis data. </p><p>The Privileges and Immunity Clause is part of the U.S. constitution, governing the freedom of movement. In 1869’s Paul v. Virginia, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement_under_United_States_law#:~:text=In%20Paul%20v.,to%20protect%20freedom%20of%20movement.">court ruled that</a> U.S. persons must retain the “right of free ingress into other States, and egress from them,” leading to the creation of this clause. With the restriction of the obfuscation of the origin of funds, as well as restrictions regarding the obfuscation of senders and receivers, the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act directly opens individuals up to arbitrary restrictions on their freedom of movement, as no individual is able to cross state lines without purchasing the necessary means, such as gas or train tickets. </p><p>The ramifications of fully surveillable means of payment on individuals’ freedom of movement have been clear most recently through <a href="https://qz.com/1642441/extradition-law-why-hong-kong-protesters-didnt-use-own-metro-cards">protests in Hong Kong</a>, during which protestors were identified by the times and places where their train tickets were purchased with digital means of payment. </p><p>For these reasons, it can further be argued that the Digital Assets Anti-Money Laundering Act infringes on articles 18, 19 and 22 of the 1966<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights"> International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>, which govern individual’s right to protest and freely assemble, as well as Article 11, which governs the right to free association, and Article 9, which governs the freedom of religion, as neither of these rights are effectively enactable by the individual’s side without a private form of payment.</p><p>In addition, for the reasons above, the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act violates Article 13 of the Universal Declaration Of Human Rights, which constitutes the right to freedom of movement, stating that any human must retain the right to leave any country and return to their own countries, as well as Article 12, which states that no one should be made subject to arbitrary interference with their privacy. </p><p>Section three, part d of the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act proposes the enabling of total surveillance of anyone using bitcoin as a currency under the pretense of anti-money laundering regulations. Yet, the <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">Chainalysis crypto crime report of 2021</a> found that illicit activity in cryptocurrency use had reached an all-time low as volumes reach all-time highs, clearly rendering the proposed prohibitions of privacy technologies in cryptocurrency as arbitrary, therefore constituting a clear violation of Article 12. </p><p>It additionally violates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Financial_Privacy_Act">Right to Financial Privacy Act</a> (RFPA), a federal law under which governments must obtain consent of the customer to access financial information, another regulation which would become virtually non-enforceable with the restriction of privacy tools and services and the enabling of bulk surveillance of Bitcoin users. While the RFPA was amended by the Patriot Act in 2001 to include the compelling of disclosures of requested information to intelligence and counterintelligence agencies for any investigation related to terrorism, the bulk surveillance of all cryptocurrency users can hardly be argued under the Patriot Act, in light of a $15.8 trillion market cap at a rate of an associated <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">illicit transaction volume of 0.15%. </a></p><p>As pointed out by the non-profit research and advocacy center Coincenter, the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act may additionally be in violation of the fourth amendment of the US constitution, as it orders the warrantless surveillance of cryptocurency users through developers and miners while serving no purpose towards their operations.</p><p>It can be suggested that Sen. Warren spends less time attempting to regulate technology that she clearly does not understand and more time learning about existing financial regulations. She would further be well advised in refraining from attempting to violate her constituents’ constitutional rights and instead put her effort toward protecting them. After all, that’s what we pay her for.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by L0la L33tz.

Core Scientific currently has an existing loan with B Riley totaling $42 million. The new $72 million loan would be “on favorable terms,” and aim to provide two years of runway before anticipating profitability from the company.<br><br>In the lender’s <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/b-riley-financial-issues-open-letter-to-core-scientific-investors-301703337.html">released statement</a> it described how, “We believe that there is a path forward and have been proactive in working through a solution, specifically by providing debt on a number of unencumbered assets.” </p><p>The mining firm has faced various headwinds in recent months. Bitcoin Magazine PRO <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/public-miner-capitulation-takes-and-core-scientific">detailed these back</a> in late October of this year, describing how “Core Scientific is halting all debt service payments; Bitcoin holdings are now 24 — they sold 1,027 over the last month; Cash resources will be depleted by the end of the year or sooner; and Core Scientific claims Celsius owes them $5.4 million.” <br><br>In addition to these, last week a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221208006081/en/Kirby-McInerney-LLP-Announces-the-Filing-of-a-Securities-Class-Action-on-Behalf-of-Core-Scientific-Inc.-CORZ-Investors">lawsuit was filed</a> by Kirby McInerne LLP on behalf of Core Scientific investors. </p><p><br>Despite this and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rosemariemiller/2022/10/27/core-scientific-unable-to-pay-bills-warns-of-bankruptcy/?sh=b2565565c4b6">statements</a> by the mining firm that bankruptcy was not off the table, B Riley states that they believe “bankruptcy is not necessary at all.” <br><br>The lender explains that the miner’s previous loans “were made when the price of Bitcoin was significantly higher than it is today and the theoretical payoff on miners was significantly faster. These debts were incurred as part of an aggressive, ill-conceived strategy by the Company to continue to build out power facilities and expand miners while never selling Bitcoin on hand and never hedging prices … This decision combined with the fast maturity associated with mining has led the Company to its current position.”<br><br></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5NzMwNDMwMjE0MjE5NDUy/immersion-cooling-bitcoin-miner.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Visiting El Salvador’s Slums, It’s Clear Bitcoin Country Must Go Further]]></title><description><![CDATA[A visit to Soyapango, one of El Salvador’s most impoverished slums, shows that the Bitcoin experiment isn’t reaching those who need it most.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/el-salvador-slums-need-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/el-salvador-slums-need-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[Poverty]]></category><category><![CDATA[Violence]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nayib Bukele]]></category><category><![CDATA[el salvador]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rikki]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 18:11:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwOTE3NzExNjQ2MTcyNzU3/aa-btc-4.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">A visit to Soyapango, one of El Salvador’s most impoverished slums, shows that the Bitcoin experiment isn’t reaching those who need it most.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Rikki, author and co-host of the “Bitcoin Italia,” and “Stupefatti” podcasts. He is one half of the Bitcoin Explorers, along with </em><a href="https://twitter.com/Lorinaura"><em>Laura</em></a><em>, who chronicle Bitcoin adoption around the world, one country at a time.</em></p><p>A few days before this writing, El Salvador's president Nayib Bukele announced an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/el-salvador-deploys-10000-troops-gang-run-capital-suburb-2022-12-03/">immense police operation</a>. San Salvador's satellite city of Soyapango was surrounded by 8,500 military and 1,500 police officers, who went searching from house to house for gang members still hiding in the area. <a href="https://insightcrime.org/news/true-cost-el-salvador-war-on-gangs/">More than 150 arrests were counted</a>.</p><p>Soyapango represents one of the most difficult realities for the country. With <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/12/05/watch-el-salvador-troops-surround-entire-city-part-war-gangs/">300,000 inhabitants</a>, it is home to several "comunidades," the name used locally to define slums or “favelas,” if you prefer.</p><p>The news of the police operation hit me hard because, only two days before, I had visited two different neighborhoods in that very city: the extremely poor Ciudad de Dios, which stands on an old garbage dump, and the violent Santa Lucia, one of the historical lairs for criminal gangs.</p><p>My visit was carefully planned well in advance and the only reason it was possible for me to even enter these places was that the "pandilleros," the gangsters, have been hit hard by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Salvadoran_gang_crackdown">government crackdown in recent months</a>, a direct result of the upsurge in clashes between rival gangs that had bloodied the country again earlier this year. </p><p>Had I tried to enter a year ago, my own life would have likely been in danger. Nevertheless, as a precaution, I had a local driver, only rarely was I allowed out of the car, and we were escorted by a person known in the neighborhood who rode ahead of us on a motorcycle. Our guide was from those streets, had lived for five years under a bridge and had a history of drug addiction, from which he recovered with the help of the community.</p><p>It was an enlightening day for me and a necessary one.</p><h2>Solving Extreme Poverty</h2><p>My reason for visiting these places to report on them comes from a conversation I had recently with a rather famous Bitcoiner: a developer who is well educated and highly intelligent and has been in the industry for many, many years. Well, his thesis is that El Salvador is not really as poor as people would have you believe, but rather an economically-backward country where the incidence of extreme poverty is not unlike that of far more developed nations.</p><p>This viewpoint, frankly, left me in shock.</p><p>According to official data in El Salvador, <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/SLV/el-salvador/poverty-rate">26% of the population</a> lives below the poverty line. That is <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/el-salvador-population/">1.7 million people</a>. </p><p>Yet it is true that many of the Bitcoiner tourists who come here believe it is the lady selling pupusas on the street corner who is poor. She is not. That lady is an entrepreneur. She has a store, a business. The lady, despite the plain clothes creased by hard work, is lower-middle class in El Salvador. Poverty, the real kind, is hidden in huge neighborhoods made of tin houses, without running water, sewage or electricity. Invisible cities, where no one goes and that no one talks about.</p><p>This is a serious mistake.</p><p>If we want Bitcoin to succeed here, we must also improve the living conditions of these people. Because they are the ones who need it the most and because it is their poverty, as the police operation of the last few days showed us, that directly fuels crime.</p><p>The Bitcoiners who come to El Salvador dreaming of a freer nation than the one from which they escape, the entrepreneurs who want to invest here, must understand that among their priorities must be the inclusion of those living in the slums of Soyapango, otherwise it is their very future here, it is their very investments, that are in danger. Indeed, the military solution to the gang problem can only be a temporary palliative. Crime feeds on the slums. This is where bosses recruit new thugs, this is where they sell drugs and profit, this is where they live, rule and hide. If we don't solve the problem of extreme poverty in El Salvador, the gangs will keep coming back, more dangerous and better organized than before, and El Salvador will never be a truly safe country.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmBLOOJAvxs">footage I shot in the slums of Soyapango</a> is a blow to the stomach. But I think it was also necessary to show our community this side of El Salvador, which is too often forgotten.</p><section><figure>

It is time, therefore, to take some stock.</p><p>As I have <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/rikki">extensively documented</a>, Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador is slowing down. There are many merchants who have stopped accepting BTC as a form of payment. The reasons they always give have been twofold: Bitcoin is too complicated and there is a lack of volume. Very few want to pay this way.</p><p>While we have already shown how too much complexity is to blame for the shortcomings of the Chivo wallet, the second problem is far more serious and delicate. On the one hand, there are the citizens of El Salvador who earn and spend dollars — a strong currency, not a victim of serious inflation — and they view digital payments with suspicion. On the other, however, there are the encouraging data that tell of a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2022/el-salvador-weekly-tourism-minister-says-bitcoins-led-to-spike-in-visitors/">strong increase in tourism in this country</a>, also related to the many Bitcoiners who come here to visit the country of BTC legal tender.</p><p>But if there are thousands of Bitcoiners coming to visit, how is it possible that the volume of BTC transactions in the streets is not increasing? Maybe we are not numerically sufficient?</p><p>Maybe. But I think the problem is also another one.</p><p>Let me give you an example: A few weeks ago, outside the Mi Primer Bitcoin graduation ceremony in the small town of Ataco, I met a Spanish gentleman who had come to the country specifically for Bitcoin. Tall and grizzled, in his 40s, he was helping this association that educates very young people in El Salvador about Bitcoin. He was an examiner, one of the "experts" called upon to assess the children's preparation. Wearing a Bitcoin Beach cap and Bitcoin t-shirt, with a lean and tanned physique, he appeared to be a typical fanboy, in appearance.</p><p>We lingered talking outside of the school and I happened, almost by accident, to mention how I was a bit disappointed with the worsening adoption of Bitcoin among people there.</p><p>It was at this point that he started telling me how he himself, strong, in perfect Spanish, always asks whenever he buys something if he can pay in bitcoin. But when he gets an affirmative answer, he starts investigating with the merchant to figure out exactly what they are going to do with the satoshis he would be sending him. Basically, it’s an interrogation. If the poor merchant responded that they wanted to keep the sats for the future, then they will receive some from the experienced Western Bitcoiner via a Lightning transaction. But if they instead admits that they want to exchange or receive the bitcoin directly in dollars, then this Westerner gives up using bitcoin and pays directly in fiat.</p><p>Can you see how idiotic that is? It makes no sense at all.</p><p>I thought that our mission in El Salvador was to incentivize adoption as much as possible, to help these people through a new and alternative economic system. But no! Now we even demand that they be HODLers. Otherwise they are not worthy of our bitcoin. This is a creepy mindset and pure selfishness.</p><p>When I pointed out to him that the future of these people also depends on the success of bitcoin in the country and that perhaps his attitude is a bit selfish — because after all, we can sacrifice a few thousand satoshi to incentivize adoption, even if they are converted to dollars — he went on a rampage and started screeching that he lives in El Zonte and that all of his friends are the poor in the village and that he cares about the fate of them all.</p><p>Evidently, however, not enough to sacrifice a few dollars in sats. </p><p>And, mind you, there are many other people who think like this. I have seen plenty of Bitcoiners here paying in cash or with their flaming credit cards. We are all familiar with the narrative behind this gesture: "Bitcoin are not to be spent. HODL to the death. Bitcoin will be worth billions, it's not like they're being spent today. We wouldn't want to end up like that fool <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-man-behind-bitcoin-pizza-day-is-more-than-a-meme-hes-a-mining-pioneer">Laszlo</a>!"</p><p>Too bad that Bitcoin's success in El Salvador is also linked to transaction volume and that if we win our battle in this country, the value in bitcoin's markets will be positively affected, to the benefit of our entire community. So evidently, we all want bitcoin to gain in value, but only a few are willing to sacrifice a handful of satoshis to really contribute to the ultimate victory. How boorish and selfish.</p><p>I mean this in no uncertain terms: At the risk of angering someone, if you come to visit this country for Bitcoin and you are not willing to pay in bitcoin, do El Salvador a favor, stay home.</p><p>PS</p><p>I saw the guy again a few weeks later in El Zonte, comfortably seated, eating a shrimp cocktail, peering out to sea at Palo Verde, one of the most exclusive resorts in the village. It is one of those places that his "so many poor friends" cannot even afford to look at from a distance.</p><p>PPS </p><p>Laszlo Hanyencz is a hero and has gone down in the history books, unlike all of those who consider him a fool.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Rikki.

It would also prohibit financial institutions from interacting with privacy tools such as CoinJoin in an effort to limit the ability of users to maintain their privacy. While the bill focuses on such measures in order to curb money laundering, tools such as CoinJoin simply restore the users’ ability to use bitcoin in a way that more closely resembles physical cash. That is, the bank knows when a client withdraws cash at an ATM, but has limited knowledge of what any user does with it afterwards. This cash-like attribute is only realized in cryptocurrencies through tools such as CoinJoins. In addition to this, regulating bodies would be allowed to file reports and surveil users without need for a warrant or government request. <br></p><p>According to the bill, it also calls for a “rule classifying custodial and unhosted wallet providers, cryptocurrency miners, validators, or other nodes who may act to validate or secure third-party transactions, independent network participants, including MEV searchers, and other validators with control over network protocols as money service businesses,” which would imply that Bitcoin nodes would be classified as such as well.<br><br>The bill seeks for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to implement the guidance which, according to <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/the-digital-asset-anti-money-laundering-act-is-an-opportunistic-unconstitutional-assault-on-cryptocurrency-self-custody-developers-and-node-operators/">blockchain advocacy group CoinCenter</a>, “is the most direct attack on the personal freedom and privacy of cryptocurrency users and developers we’ve yet seen.”<br><br>Senator Elizabeth Warren has previously expressed her desire to regulate the cryptocurrency industry, <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senator-warren-in-wall-street-journal-op-ed-ftxs-implosion-should-be-a-wake-up-call">most recently</a> after the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">collapse of FTX</a>. The bill would likely face extensive scrutiny as, amongst many other issues, it would force unhosted wallets providers to register before publishing their products, effectively placing limits on free speech, as code has been <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/remembering-case-established-code-speech">proven to be free speech</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzNTEyMTIxODA2MzY2MTQ3/bitcoin-code.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Japan’s Largest Power Company, TEPCO, To Mine Bitcoin With Excess Energy]]></title><description><![CDATA[TEPCO Power Grid is deploying bitcoin mining operations across Japan in a partnership with a local semiconductor company to capitalize on excess power.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tepco-to-mine-bitcoin-with-excess-power</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tepco-to-mine-bitcoin-with-excess-power</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Japan]]></category><category><![CDATA[Power grid]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Renewable Energy]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Namcios]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 12:43:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMDI2MTUyOTY3Nzc1NDUz/green-sustainable-bitcoin-mining.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">TEPCO Power Grid is deploying bitcoin mining operations across Japan in a partnership with a local semiconductor company to capitalize on excess power.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Japan’s largest electric power company is about to start mining bitcoin.</p><p>Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) Power Grid is partnering with TRIPLE-1, a local semiconductor designer and developer, to mine bitcoin with excess energy across the country, CoinDesk first reported. TEPCO is the country’s largest electric power company in total assets, per <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/868685/leading-companies-electricity-industry-by-total-assets-japan/">Statista</a> data.</p><p>TEPCO is the utility behind the Fukushima nuclear reactor, which in 2011 was struck by an earthquake and huge tsunami that knocked out some of its cooling systems, allowing three reactors to melt down. The power company later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/13/world/asia/tepco-admits-failure-in-acknowledging-risks-at-nuclear-plant.html">admitted</a> that it had failed to take stronger measures to prevent such disasters. TEPCO is still suffering from the accident, as compensation for victims is <a href="https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14610645">taking a toll on its profitability</a> to this day. Now, its power transmission and distribution company, TEPCO Power Grid, is seeking ways to monetize surplus power with bitcoin mining through its wholly-owned subsidiary Agile Energy X.</p><p>TEPCO is joining major global energy companies in jumping on the bitcoin mining bandwagon. And a common denominator for most of them is a need to monetize excess power, something BTC mining does very well. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/conocophillips-is-selling-extra-gas-to-bitcoin-miners">ConocoPhillips is selling stranded gas to bitcoin miners</a> in the Bakken, an oil-abundant region in the U.S. –– a similar strategy to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/exxon-is-mining-bitcoin-with-excess-gas-report">what Exxon is doing</a>. The oil giant reportedly has an agreement with Crusoe Energy Systems to redirect gas that would otherwise be wasted from an oil well pad to mobile bitcoin mines. TEPCO's setup also goes along those lines.</p><p>According to a translated version of a Wednesday <a href="https://www.tepco.co.jp/pg/company/press-information/information/2022/pdf/221214a.pdf">statement</a> by the Japanese energy giant, Agile Energy X signed a memorandum of understanding with TRIPLE-1 on November 11 to build a constructive strategic partnership. Through the collaboration, Agile aims to deploy distributed data centers throughout Japan that repurposes surplus electricity from renewable energy with semiconductors from TRIPLE-1.</p><p>A pilot project has already been set up on the premises of TEPCO Power Grid’s office in the Tokyo metropolitan area, per the statement. “We have started experiments to confirm the system behavior and the impact on the power grid when equipment is operated with a large amount of power on the scale of 1,500 kW, and have confirmed that the equipment can operate normally.”</p><figure>

I also offer some cost mitigating suggestions to hopefully encourage more participation on the bitcoin network.</p><p>Before exploring the costs involved: <strong><em>What is a bitcoin node</em>?</strong></p><p>A<a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-bitcoin-node/"> bitcoin node</a> is software that connects to the Bitcoin peer-peer network. A node receives, validates and broadcasts transactions/blocks to other nodes on the network, according to the network rules.<a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-bitcoin-node/"> Ted Stevenot</a> concisely described nodes as <em>the messengers and rule keepers of Bitcoin.</em></p><p>The broadcast blocks are part of a distributed ledger which contains records of each transaction, keeps track of bitcoin ownership and the corresponding amount owned. This publicly shared ledger is generally known as the Bitcoin <em>blockchain</em>.</p><p>A Bitcoin node is usually run on portable single-board computers (SBCs) like the<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/"> Raspberry Pi</a>, or on a <a href="https://umbrel.com/">personal computer</a>. However, a node can also be run in a virtual machine or on a smartphone. Bitcoin Core is the most widely used bitcoin node software and can be downloaded<a href="https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/"> here</a>.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDI3NjY0Njg0Mjk1Njg1/image6.jpg" height="427" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>Nodes can either be full or light:</p><ul><li>A full node stores a full copy of the blockchain and verifies every transaction and block, from the first block — the genesis block — against the consensus rules.<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Consensus"> Consensus rules</a> are specific rulesets enforced by full nodes to determine the validity of a block and its transactions.</li></ul><p>There are two types of full nodes: <em>archival nodes</em> and <em>pruned nodes</em>. Archival nodes store the entire blockchain locally and relay it to other nodes, this also helps to bootstrap new ones. Meanwhile, a pruned node only saves a specified minimum number of blocks as it verifies transactions and blocks. Therefore, more computer disk is saved by pruned nodes compared to archival nodes. However, pruned nodes are unable to serve the entire blockchain to other nodes.</p><ul><li>A light node does not enforce the consensus rules and relies on third party run full nodes to receive block data, which involves a privacy trade-off.</li></ul><p>Full nodes will be the main focus of this article — any mention of <em>“node”</em> hereafter implies a full node unless explicitly stated.</p><h2>Why Run A Node?</h2><p>There are personal and network benefits to running a node. Some of these include:</p><ul><li>Privacy when broadcasting transactions, verifying bitcoin received in your wallet, and exploring blockchain data, without third parties logging your personal information.</li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/">Enforcing the consensus rules</a> which helps uphold bitcoin’s integrity and your investment in it. Furthermore, running a node enables you to either reject or support any proposed changes — <a href="https://blog.trezor.io/may-the-forks-be-with-you-e02d00366ae3">soft or hard forks</a> — to the consensus rules. Reciting Raspiblitz’s slogan:<a href="https://shop.fulmo.org/"> <em>Not your node, not your rules</em></a> .</li></ul><ul><li>Strengthening the Bitcoin network. The more nodes on the network, the more decentralized and resilient Bitcoin is against malicious parties, jurisdictional restrictions or black swan events.</li></ul><ul><li>Increasing your understanding of how the bitcoin network operates and sharing this acquired knowledge with others. </li></ul><p>With some of the benefits outlined, let’s analyze the costs of running a node from a Nigerian perspective.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><p>The common hardware, that meet the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node">minimum requirements</a>, used to run a bitcoin node on are either:</p><ul><li>Plug and Play nodes or</li><li>Do-It-Yourself (DIY) nodes.</li></ul><h3>Plug And Play Node</h3><p>Some bitcoin companies offer plug and play full node products that run on SBCs like the Raspberry Pi, <a href="https://www.pine64.org/rockpro64/">RockPro64</a> and <a href="https://rockpi.org/rockpi4">Rock Pi4</a>, and mini PCs like the<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/nuc.html"> Intel NUC</a> and<a href="https://puri.sm/products/librem-mini/"> Librem Mini</a>. Some of these node providers are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://mynodebtc.com/">MyNode</a></li><li><a href="https://shop.fulmo.org/raspiblitz/">Raspiblitz</a></li><li><a href="https://samouraiwallet.com/ronin">RoninDojo</a> and</li><li><a href="https://start9.com/">Start9</a></li></ul><p>Node prices range from $300 to $700 — excluding shipping ($100 minimum to Nigeria) and customs duty — dependent on hardware and storage size. Currently, international purchases made on most Nigerian Naira debit cards are limited to $20 per month, a reduction from a previous $100 limit. Your node purchase options are to use a dollar debit card — tied to a domiciliary account — with deposited dollars obtained from the black market (currently 70% above the official rate), use a virtual dollar card which offers convenience but at a higher rate than the black market, and bitcoin.</p><p>There are other obstacles you might encounter in purchasing a node. Firstly, not all node providers ship to Nigeria. Additionally, due to chip shortages, some of these products are out of stock. One way of surmounting some of these hurdles is employing the alternative availed by node providers of sourcing node components yourself, and installing their respective bitcoin core embedded software on your assembled node.</p><h3>DIY Node</h3><p>In sourcing hardware components, we’ll only consider SBCs as they are cheaper than mini-PCs. The hardware components required to run an SBC node are:</p><ul><li>SBC + power supply</li><li>SD card + reader</li><li>SSD + enclosure</li><li>Heatsink case/fan</li></ul><figure>

    </figure><p>The current chip shortages and high demand for single board computers have led to a massive increase in prices and supply deficits, Raspberry Pis in particular both locally (used and new) and <a href="https://rpilocator.com/">internationally</a>. However, some Raspberry Pis and RockPro64s are available on <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/">Aliexpress</a>. Regardless, there are some fake sellers on the platform, you need to be especially wary of newly created stores, read negative reviews and request a refund if an item does not arrive within the estimated period. </p><p>Considering the international purchase limit on Naira debit cards, these SBCs will need to be purchased using a dollar card — there is no bitcoin purchase option. The table below summarizes average hardware component costs from Aliexpress, for building new Raspberry Pi or RockPro64 nodes.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Data</h2><p>Before a node is able to perform its role as a messenger and rule keeper on the bitcoin network, it needs to be synchronized with other nodes on the network. This is done by downloading and verifying all the blocks from the genesis block in a process known as the Initial block download (IBD). Currently, the bitcoin blockchain is approximately <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_blockchain_size">440 GB</a> in size.</p><p>The following table summarizes the average data costs, from network providers, for the IBD and roughly <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_blockchain_size">5.3 GB</a> required monthly to sync your node with the blockchain. An assumption is made that you reside in an area with somewhat reliable 4G network coverage.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Power</h2><p>To simplify the power cost analysis, the assumption is made that you live in a region with no electricity (at least 80% of the time in my location) and will need a solar generator to power the node and router, which isn’t ideal as it’s weather dependent. Replicating something similar to Chimezie Chuta’s <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/16/one-mans-mission-to-deploy-solar-powered-bitcoin-nodes-across-africa/">Spacebox</a> incurs the subsequent mean costs.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Finally, the estimated full node setup costs is tabulated below.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>In Conclusion</h2><p>Running your own Bitcoin node has a lot of benefits, some of which were listed earlier on. However, with ongoing chip shortages, inflation and node setup costs (despite the assumptions and cost-cutting recommendations made herein), running a node might not be feasible for everyone. One practical solution would be to implement Arman The Parman’s <a href="https://armantheparman.com/why-should-you-run-your-own-bitcoin-node/">circle of trust</a> idea or Obi Nwosu’s <a href="https://blog.trezor.io/whats-fueling-bitcoin-adoption-in-nigeria-390dd37fde2f">guardians and users</a> model of having a technical individual run a node for a trusted group of people like close friends, a family or community. This approach does involve a trade off, but is much better than connecting to third party nodes and helps in easing bitcoin’s custody challenge.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by </em><em>Chinedu</em><em>.

On the other hand, if we look at their underlying open-source software, we see radical differences: </p><ul><li>Bitcoin’s protocol is specifically configured for minimizing uncertainty with conservative parameters and a constrained feature set, and its simple ledger architecture results in <a href="https://www.pierrerochard.com/auditing-bitcoin-supply/">supply auditability of BTC</a>. </li><li>Ethereum is optimized for cutting-edge experimentation and a wide range of programmable features, but its complex ledger architecture results in an <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinIsSaving/status/1505356218759528452">unauditable supply of ETH</a>.</li><li>Luna was <a href="https://mishtalk.com/economics/congratulations-to-luna-the-first-crypto-to-hyperinflate-now-worth-zero">programmed to automatically hyperinflate</a> to try to prop up the value of a stablecoin, Terra, and that’s exactly what it did. </li></ul><p>Putting all three of these assets into a single “crypto” bucket is reductive — they are different technologies optimizing for different outcomes. Bitcoin has accomplished long-term network stability — you could have run the same node software continuously for the past decade without any problems. The same cannot be said for Ethereum node software, which <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/">completely changed its consensus mechanism in September 2022</a>. This change was only able to occur because the Ethereum Foundation has a unique <em>centralized</em> role in designating the official staking contract. Ethereum has to be more centralized than Bitcoin to push through aggressive “upgrades” to its protocol. Bitcoin has no such centralized operator or authority, and its consensus rules are unofficial: a <a href="https://pierre-rochard.medium.com/bitcoin-governance-37e86299470f">spontaneous, inter-subjective, network-wide agreement</a> among the users. </p><p>To address the second element in Sixsmith’s line of reasoning: the intrinsic value of holding any form of money is that you are <a href="https://mises.org/library/yield-money-held-reconsidered">minimizing uncertainty by hedging</a> against unpredictable future cash flows. In the fiat system, the least-uncertain assets are physical cash and government-insured bank accounts; however, even those are subject to the fiat power of the governments issuing such currencies and insuring those bank accounts — that is, your money is only as good as the applicable government’s promises.</p><p>Setting aside Bitcoin’s exchange rate, on a fundamental engineering level, holding BTC with your own private keys and verifying the ledger with your own node results in less uncertainty than holding even physical cash or an insured bank account. <em>That is bitcoin’s intrinsic value</em>. While the spot price/purchasing power of BTC can be subject to the whims of market forces, the uncertainty-minimizing principles of how to receive, hold and send BTC have not changed since its inception. Thus, you can be <em>certain</em> that the smart contracts locking your BTC will execute as written, so that only a signature from your private keys can move your money.</p><p>The third element addressed in Sixsmith’s piece relates to the speculative trading of cryptocurrencies on exchanges. Exchanges operating in the United States are legal entities subject to U.S. laws governing exchanges and are subject to compliance with both state and federal money transmitter, custodian and investor protection regulations. They are regulated federally by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and/or the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and they have clear terms of service and user agreements. Even an “offshore” exchange in the Bahamas is accountable to the <a href="https://guides.law.fsu.edu/caribbean/bahamas#:~:text=The%20Bahamas&amp;text=It%20gained%20independence%20from%20the,Law%20as%20its%20legal%20system.">English Common Law</a>. To label these entities as “crypto” exchanges obfuscates their centralized fiat nature. </p><p>Sixsmith states, “...we knew that crypto-currencies were not a surefire route to freedom and independence when their value hinged on the good sense and morals of a bunch of weird nerds online.” </p><p>While humorous, this statement conflates Bitcoin’s value with the (mis-)management of fiat/crypto exchanges; akin to questioning the value of tomatoes because a supermarket went bankrupt. Furthermore, there’s nothing inherent about BTC that would necessitate leaving it at a fiat exchange, vulnerable to theft. It is harder and riskier to properly secure and use an exchange account’s password than it is to do so with BTC private keys. Furthermore, there are bitcoin-only brokerages that encourage or require the delivery of BTC directly to the client’s keys. Countless individuals and businesses receive BTC not as a trade for fiat, but as revenue for goods and services. The continued development of a circular economy will lessen the need to ever exchange for fiat.</p><p>In conclusion, despite adjacent cryptocurrencies and fiat exchanges that are centralized and unreliable, Bitcoin is a decentralized and reliable alternative monetary system. Bitcoin’s vision for the future is not utopian or idealistic, rather it is simply looking at the past decade of successful adoption, noting that Bitcoin’s fundamental properties have only improved, and projecting out continued growth. Perhaps the bottleneck in Bitcoin’s adoption is peoples’ understanding of what differentiates Bitcoin from fiat and crypto.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Pierre Rochard.

After two years of sustained inflation as a result of the Federal Reserve’s COVID-19 stimulus, the Fed was forced to aggressively hike rates in order to prevent runaway inflation. The latest CPI print confirms their aggressive actions have had an impact, although food and energy in particular maintain high levels of inflation (10.6% and 13.1% respectively). <br><br>Bitcoin, an asset often viewed as risk-on in traditional markets, benefits from low rate environments. The latest CPI print <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-powell-rate-hike-slowdown-possible-next-month-inflation-fight-far-over-2022-11-30/">reinforces the narrative</a> that the Fed will now shift to a slow down in its rate hikes, which could explain the current pump in bitcoin’s price.

    </figure><p>Is bitcoin volatile? How does one determine volatility? How can those with diamond hands so decisively say “no,” while those stuck in the fiat mindset so emphatically say “yes”? Which one is correct? Is it just that both sides have to agree to disagree, or can both of these seeming contradictions simultaneously be true? </p><p>To truly answer these questions, we should first analyze Albert Einstein’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity">special theory of relativity</a>…</p><h2>The Special Theory Of Relativity</h2><p>In Einstein’s attempt to better understand how the elapsed time of two clocks moved differently, we need to look at one of his thought experiments: Imagine two individual observers, one sitting as a passenger on a train and the other onlooking from a nearby platform. The train passenger sees two bolts of lightning strike each end of the train, the first bolt from the front of the train, and the second bolt from the rear. Meanwhile, the onlooker on the nearby platform sees the two bolts strike both the front and the rear of the train at the same time. The train passenger claims that the front strike happened before the rear strike, while the onlooker claims that the strikes happened simultaneously.</p><p>Whose perception is accurate? Can both of them be? Einstein believed that both interpretations are valid because they each have their own frame of reference. </p><p>This phenomenon led to Einstein’s theory of special relativity: different reference frames necessitate different perceptions on the simultaneity of events. Said more simply, having a different reference point changes one’s perception. Granted, this is a gross oversimplification and a narrow view of a much broader concept, but this limited scope will suffice for how it relates to the disparity in perceptions regarding bitcoin’s volatility.</p><h2>Bitcoin Is Not Volatile</h2><figure>

    </figure><p>In this analogy, let’s consider Bitcoiners as the passengers on the train. Due to the nature of the technology, we’re traveling at a consistent speed set by math and code. Inside this protocol, we see that one bitcoin equals one bitcoin. We can verify its scarcity with a supply hard cap of 21 million. We understand how the lack of need for trusted third parties or central authorities ensures a trustless and permissionless peer-to-peer system. We realize that a whale has no more clout over the control of the ledger than a shrimp. We know that every two weeks, the difficulty adjustment will continue to produce blocks at an estimated once every ten minutes; we grok the term “tick tock, next block.” </p><p>None of this speaks to volatility; just the opposite, in fact. All of this speaks to consistency; the consistency of the network. It speaks to our grounded perception from within a stable and secure system of value transfer over space and time. We passengers inside the train that is Bitcoin are better able to make economic decisions based on sound systemic fundamentals. This is one of the main reasons that Bitcoiners are able to have and maintain a low time preference; we’re not as susceptible to the distortions created by less-volatile systems, which leads to erratic economic behavior. Said differently, the predictability of the protocol perpetuates low time preference.</p><h2>Bitcoin Is Volatile</h2><figure>

Their main frame of reference is not the network, but simply the asset (specifically, the BTC/USD exchange rate). When the supply of the dollar fluctuates wildly, when the cost of capital is consistently manipulated — not to mention with the competing, equally-flawed currencies attempting to claw their way out of hyperinflation — the onlooker’s perception is distorted. </p><p>This is a real-world application of <a href="https://coffeeandjunk.com/wittgensteins-ruler/">Wittgenstein’s Ruler</a>, a concept which states that, “Unless you have confidence in the ruler’s reliability, if you use a ruler to measure a table you may also be using the table to measure the ruler.” </p><p>Fiat onlookers’ view of bitcoin the asset are obfuscated by their frame of reference, which is to say, an unnecessarily convoluted one.</p><p>What’s worse is that, because of this perceived volatility, onlookers are disincentivized to take a deeper look into Bitcoin the network. They find comfort in the known. They’re unwilling to do the work to understand why their arbitrarily-chosen system is flawed. As <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBooth/status/1592796329687715841">Jeff Booth</a> points out, “Perhaps the biggest impediment for people understanding Bitcoin is bringing their baggage from how the monetary system works today and in the past, versus how it will work in the future.” </p><p>All of the misinformation inside the fiat system pushes its constituents away from connecting the dots… while they are simultaneously seated on a sporadic and spastic merry-go-round. They’ve either consciously or otherwise accepted that the fate of their money (in its forms as a store of value, medium of exchange and a unit of account) will potentially change roughly every four years with election cycles. They’ve been conditioned to believe there must be a small group of elites who “know best” how to manipulate the growth of an economy (while also ignoring the elites’ inherent incentives). They overlook the fact that the currency they’re compelled to use has lost 99% of its value over its lifetime. </p><p>This last point nudges those inside the fiat system to adopt a high time preference, knowing the value of their time and efforts will be devalued over time. This further distorts their frame of reference, thus their ability to make sound, economic decisions; choosing between a volatile, alternative asset which requires a low time preference and a lot of effort to understand versus a new, gizmo gadget providing endless dopamine dumps… well, I can see how it’s an easy choice for them.</p><h2>The Theory Of Monetary Relativity</h2><figure>

    </figure><p>All of this can simply be stated as: Bitcoiners determine volatility based from the reference of its network and protocol while fiateers derive its volatility from the reference of bitcoin the asset. </p><p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/dergigi/status/1594297942974038016">Gigi says</a>, “Bitcoin isn't volatile. Humans are.” Therefore, we must continue to reframe the conversation from the asset to the network and protocol. The asset will continue to show volatility (to the upside over the long term), which is not due to Bitcoin the network or protocol, but due to the volatility of human nature.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Tim Niemeyer.

Check this: Money has no inherent value. And, besides being a special kind of money that allows for disintermediated transfers, the same applies to bitcoin. </p><p>As banal as it may sound, money <em>is </em>just a means to an end. As a matter of fact, it’s a means to any number of ends. And those ends are what matter. Money — whether dollars, satoshis or the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20180502-the-tiny-island-with-human-sized-money">rai stones of Yap</a> — is not valuable for what it is, but for what it lets us do. We transform money into experiences, and experiences are what make a life, not ledger entries. Everything else is <a href="https://youtu.be/fjg5TuXV09U">bank propaganda devised to generate interest</a>.</p><p>As long as it’s “just” a store of value, bitcoin is even further removed from the ends that matter (unless watching charts is your thing). At least by turning bitcoin into a medium of exchange that can be traded for those valuable experiences, the Lightning Network moves bitcoin closer to what matters.</p><p>In fact, here’s a general postulate: bitcoin’s value is inversely proportional to the friction between the blockchain and the experiences it enables. Lightning was one big step in reducing that friction, and Lightning itself has taken several steps in the last four or so years to diminish it further, including:</p><ul><li>Mobile Lightning nodes</li><li>On-the-fly channel creation</li><li>Zero-confirmation channels</li><li>LSPs to manage users’ connectivity and liquidity</li></ul><p>Still, though it’s painful to admit, there remains more friction in non-custodial Lightning than in the best custodial and fiat solutions, and users will choose whatever gets them to those experiences faster and easier. </p><p>Less friction means moving bitcoin closer to creating experiences, which means more value in bitcoin and <em>in life</em>.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>The First Key To Reducing Friction: P2P Interaction </h2><p>The peer-to-peer (P2P) economy refers to disintermediated exchange, like creative people trading the fruits of their creativity — podcasts, videos, fanfic novels, 3D-printed cosplay accessories — with users for cash, without the intervention of banks, payment processors or aggregators. </p><p>Each intermediary in an interaction induces friction and increases the distance from the desired experience, and they can’t help it. Banks have to placate shareholders and regulators and make a profit. Aggregation platforms have to placate shareholders and regulators and make a profit. Payment processors have to placate shareholders and regulators and make a profit. </p><p>Notice the pattern? While each intermediary claims to be giving people what they want, they’re actually serving different groups who want different things at the same time. That intermediaries always take a cut, induce friction and increase the distance between people and experiences isn’t the result of bad management or evil intentions, it’s just the nature of the beast.</p><p>So, why not create something far better for users? Let people interact directly, pay each other directly, exchange goods and services directly. There are even services out there — social networks, messaging services, content aggregators, gaming platforms — that would like to facilitate transactions among their users, but they can’t because legacy intermediaries induce too much (financial, regulatory, UX) friction. Worse still, the centralization induced by these large data networks increases their power over each user and, therefore, increases the risk of abuse to all users.</p><p>The P2P economy isn’t some billionaire’s pipe dream; it describes a world where we’re closer to the experiences we value and to each other. That’s what Lightning was made for. We just need to make it happen.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MjU0NzA3NDI0ODk2Njg5/p2p.jpg" height="413" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><em>Web 2.0 interaction is you paying a conglomerate with money controlled by someone else; the P2P economy is just two people trading ideas, goods or a laugh for some P2P cash.

    </figure><h2>The Second Key To Reducing Friction: Fitting The Right Application To The Experience</h2><p>A lesson we’ve drawn from developing Breez is that different kinds of experiences (ends) need different payment interfaces (means). For example, the point-of-sale (PoS) terminal and podcast player that are included in our app are meant to feel like their own little self-contained interfaces, tailor-made for their respective purposes (or as close as we could get with the technological limitations of running a node on a phone).</p><p>But you can only cram so many activities and experiences into a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/no-such-thing-as-lightning-wallet">non-custodial Lightning payment app</a>. And, however clever, charming and good looking a team behind the payment app may be, they’re not necessarily best placed to devise new ways of applying P2P payments to new types of experience. We know how to make Lightning mobile and how to improve its UX, but when it comes to commerce, music, video streaming or any other vertical solution, experts in those fields know better how to craft the best experience.</p><p>Indeed, the PoS mode and the podcast player are just scratching the surface of what’s possible. We implemented them according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">the KISS principle</a>. Though they have scaled and attracted new users, they’re basically demo versions implemented to showcase how people interface with the P2P economy.</p><p>Could others with fine-grained expertise of those and other kinds of experience come up with better ways to apply P2P money to P2P interaction? <em>Of course they could</em>. And would those better applications achieve scale that our neophyte, outsider attempts never could? <em>Absolutely</em>.</p><p>And that’s the point. The better we apply the tech, the closer people get to the experiences they want, the more they will use the tech, the faster Lightning will scale. The scale we’re aiming for is not X orders of magnitude; we’re shooting for a world where kids roll their eyes whenever an adult says “Back in the fiat days…”</p><p>Achieving scale is a matter of reducing friction, and multiple, tailor-made apps that apply Lightning technology optimally to life’s many worthwhile pursuits is the best way of minimizing friction and expanding the P2P economy. It’s not about making the best wallet that can do everything; it’s about adapting Lightning — the means — to whatever end users want and whatever kinds of experience they want in exchange.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>LaaS Liberates Lightning </h2><p>Those who understand the technical requirements of running a non-custodial Lightning app will have realized already that adapting Lightning payments to any number of existing and yet-unimagined applications is incompatible with running a node in a single app. Lightning is far too technically demanding to scale the P2P economy as we have described it. Running the kind of always-on node required is an experience that few users, developers, creators or vendors out there will relish. </p><p>We’re envisioning <strong>Lightning as a Service (LaaS)</strong>. LaaS is about using Lightning to remove friction from life, from the experiences we crave. The point isn’t to improve the user experience <em>in the app</em>, but to improve the users’ experience <em>of Lightning as a whole</em> that gives them more value in their lives.</p><p>And LaaS is doable. Our vision for LaaS has three major components:</p><h3>1. A Lightning Software Development Kit (SDK)</h3><p>As it stands, anyone seeking to integrate Lightning payments to their existing business faces a steep learning curve. Accepting payments over Lightning requires them to run a node, secure liquidity with a Lightning service provider (LSP), manage fiat exchanges, perform swaps on and off the Bitcoin blockchain, manage a wallet, and so on. A non-custodial SDK would give P2P entrepreneurs and existing web utilities access to those functions without having to start from scratch. </p><p>With a well-designed SDK, developers could select the Lightning functions they need from a menu and integrate them quickly and easily into their own applications. Instead of having to learn the Lightning tech stack, a Lightning SDK will let developers simply plug it into their own tech stacks.</p><h3>2. Hybrid Architecture</h3><p>Lightning needs to be immediately available wherever and whenever people want to make payments. Locking a user’s functionality into a single app or on a single device would require the user to adapt to the technology, which is backwards. That’s friction.</p><p>At the same time, though, KYC friction and global, cross-market expansion requires a P2P, non-custodial solution. As soon as LSPs start acting like banks, regulators will start treating them like banks. That’s friction too.</p><p>The solution is a hybrid architecture based on <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/get-ready-for-a-fresh-breez-multiple-apps-one-node-optimal-ux-519c4daf2536">sovereign remote nodes</a>, but that locates those nodes in the cloud rather than on users’ local devices. Any service could access these nodes from any device, but as long as the users’ keys are locally stored, users would maintain custody of their own funds, minimizing the operators’ regulatory profile. </p><p>P2P plus minimal friction equals scale.</p><h3>3. Decentralizing Liquidity</h3><p>There is no credit on Lightning. The liquidity to settle any transaction needs to be preloaded onto the network. While this imposes a significant liquidity burden on those seeking to process users’ payments, it also presents the rich opportunity of a snowball effect: the more liquidity the network contains, the more transactions it can process, the more transaction fees the operators can collect, the more liquidity they have to invest in the network, and so on.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/lightning-network/">Lyn Alden</a> recently put it:</p><p>“Once there are tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of participants, and with larger average channel balances, then routing a payment from any arbitrary point to any other arbitrary point on the network becomes exponentially easier and more reliable.”</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In order to get the snowball rolling, we must distribute the burden of preloading the network with liquidity by onboarding new LSPs. By attracting LSP collaborators, we will raise the liquidity level of the network overall, turning the snowball into an unstoppable avalanche of liquidity.</p><h2>A Postscript On Shortcuts And Friction </h2><p>A dear, old teacher of mine always used to say, “Doing it the right way <em>is</em> the shortcut.” Like so much wisdom gained from experience, this was infuriating to hear as a young person, which makes it no less wise.</p><p>The thoughts above about how to scale Lightning and catalyze the exponential growth of the P2P economy never even flirt with the idea of third-party custodians. And yet I would be the first to admit that connecting users via third-party custodians would make everything <em>so much easier</em>. Throw together a jazzy interface for an app in a few weeks or so, have your developers implement a database in the backend to manage users’ transactions, cut everything down to a single node and a handful of big payment channels, and you’re off. Less hassle for Lightning operators, a tighter network and a shallower learning curve for Lightning users.</p><p>We could push this even further. For all its revolutionary potential, bitcoin can be a pain in the neck. Private keys can get irretrievably lost or stolen. The network needs a certain amount of energy to run. A satoshi can only be in one place at any given time, limiting financial innovation. Why not just tell everyone that we’re moving their bitcoin around, when in fact they have no bitcoin … and neither do we? Same database, same interface, infinitesimal hassle, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/z82ktt/lambo_math_a_story_in_4_parts/">free Lambos for everybody</a>.</p><p>I'm joking, of course. It’s been tried. Repeatedly. FTX. BlockFi. Genesis. Solana. It’s already a cliché that “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-24/the-vaccine-is-not-a-competition">the story of cryptocurrency is in large part a story about rediscovering traditional finance.</a>” And not only will operators lose users’ money (or magic beans, as the case may be) sooner or later, but the network would consist of <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/why-bitcoin-needs-to-become-a-medium-of-exchange-80d5c9e1de65?source=collection_home---4------9-----------------------">a limited number of choke points</a>, begging to be regulated, throttled and censored.</p><p>At which point we’d have to learn from our mistakes, start over from scratch, and do it again the right way. Fortunately, it’s still early days, and we can still <em>do it right the first time</em>. An omniscient being able to view all possible timelines would assure us that the sometimes tedious path of sovereignty and self-custody is, in fact, the shortest route to our P2P future. Though LaaS envisions a slightly different network than we have now to realize the future of Lightning, the principles and technological integrity that make Bitcoin worthwhile must remain inviolate.</p><figure>

It's a distributed network of computer nodes and if you don't understand basic computer science then you’re not really allowed to have an opinion on this."</em></p><p>Other person: <em>“The government can shut down anything they want. They have the top hackers in the world working for them.”</em></p><p>You:<em> “Whatever, you just don’t get it and you’re going to miss out on Bitcoin with that mindset.”</em></p><p>Net: Nobody wins.</p><h2>The More Productive Approach:</h2><p>Other person: <em>"Bitcoin is going to get shut down by the US government."</em></p><p>You: <em>"I thought that at first too. You’d actually be really interested in it. Have you ever looked into distributed networks or cryptography before?</em>"</p><p>Other person: <em>“Not really. I’m not super tech savvy.”</em></p><p>You: <em>"Would you say the separation of money and state is a good or bad thing?</em>"</p><p>Other person: <em>“I’d say it’s a good thing. Inflation is really doing damage and pricing younger generations out of society. It’s funny how much money older generations paid for nice homes with land versus what the situation is now. It’s honestly super unsustainable in my opinion, but I’m no expert.”</em></p><p>You:<em> “Do you see that continuing or improving?”</em></p><p>Other person: <em>“At this point, probably continuing.”</em></p><p>You:<em> “What do you see as a viable alternative?”</em></p><p>Other person: <em>“I’m not sure. Maybe you could explain to me how Bitcoin works?”</em></p><p>Net: Other person talks themselves into Bitcoin.</p><p>Of course, it won’t always be straightforward. But this simple shift in your approach can be the difference between a newbie spending 8 months of their life shitcoining instead of starting out Bitcoin-only in the first place.</p><p>Robert Cialdini discusses in his book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Robert-Cialdini/dp/006124189X">Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion</a>,” which states that humans have a deep psychological need to be perceived as consistent.</p><p>How can we leverage this principle when explaining Bitcoin to others?</p><figure>

Aside from the occasional blind umpire, the rules are pretty fair and consistent. In our particular game though, let’s pretend I’m not only the opposition but also the umpire, rule maker and historian. When you score a run, I can overturn the call. After the game, I can change whatever rule could have prevented your run in my favor. Just for good measure, because I can, I strike your run from the record books. How long would you want to play before you chose to quit and play a different game?</p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>Bitcoin’s rules of the game are set and consistently enforced with no entity able to change the rules to benefit themselves.</em><br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>There may be some that prefer playing a game where a central authority makes the call. Seems legit — neither team has ultimate control, so it should be fair, right? In this situation, both sides must (should) agree to not only the rules but who makes and enforces said rules. Unfortunately, human nature creeps in; handshakes are made, backdoor agreements are done and, before you know it, one team has colluded with the central authority to gain some level of control over the ruleset. When a game like this happens, where one side benefits from being nearer to the source of control, we claim the game is rigged.</p><p>Everyone, regardless of political orientation, has witnessed numerous situations where the “other side” has seemed to rig the game in their favor. The easy route is to blame the other side and call them bad, evil or cheaters. The fault lies though in the way the game was set up in the first place. If two sides were playing a game, and I walked up wanting to play, what options would I have? If I had friends on one side, I could jump right in with them. If I were a little more opportunistic, I could watch an inning and determine which side is currently dominating, then join that side. This becomes an endless cycle of not playing the game, but playing the game inside the game — tug of war over the rulebook.</p><p>As I watch this game more intensely, I observe many players looking like they don’t even want to be playing. They look, by choice or unconscious habit, like they are just going through the motions because they either don’t realize that the game is rigged or they do in fact realize the game is rigged and they just keep playing and hoping their side somehow seizes control of the rulebook. It seems like there are a lot of disillusioned spectators. I wonder if they can sense it’s a rigged game.</p><p>The more I watch this game, I notice the players spending an unnecessary amount of time, not actually playing the game, but rather bickering over balls and strikes. Each inning is more about debating the rules than it is playing the game. I wonder why they choose to keep fighting over their game, then I see one of the multitude of rules posted — you must play this game only; players are not allowed to make their own game and rules.</p><p>At this point, I scoff and walk away. The game just loses its appeal. Why would I choose to play a game that I don’t have any say over if or how I get to play or not? Can I consider it a game if I’m coerced to play by an ever-changing rule set manipulated by players with clout and connections? Doesn’t seem fair. What’s not fair about it is not the outputs but the inputs. When the inputs are subject to change by whomever is the most politically connected, the outputs become increasingly distorted. This is not a game I’m willing to play.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>What if, when I first walked up to the game already playing, I was perceptive enough to notice it was already rigged. Then I looked across the way and noticed another game. As I watch this game, I notice all players are there voluntarily. Although they have friends playing in the rigged, top-down created game, they’ve chosen to play a game in a fair, bottom-up created game where the rules were set prior to gameplay, no one regardless of power, status, or hierarchy has the ability to change the rules, and the rules are enforced by an impartial observer. This new, fairer game is Bitcoin.</p><p>As venerable gigabrain <a href="https://twitter.com/breedlove22/status/1525969907380195328?s=46&amp;t=e0bG2k6FYtj09M48OxohoQ">Robert Breedlove states</a>, “<em>In games, fixed rules lead to peaceful gameplay. If you’re spending time fighting over the rules of the game, then you’re not playing the game, you’re engaging in politics. In economics, such fighting lessens aggregate wealth creation. Bitcoin is fixed rules fixing economics</em>.”</p><p>As far as this meager rules-based article is concerned, spoiler alert, Bitcoin is the ultimate tool to compensate us for our time and energy in a way that is moral, unconvoluted, incentivised, and unwaveringly enforced. On the other hand, fiat and now Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are in stark contrast.</p><p>While you may want a game’s rules to be set and consistently enforced with no entity able to change the rules to benefit themselves, the centralized ruleset of fiat and CBDCs are ever-changing, ever-growing, and immorally incentivised to benefit those with the control. While aiming for a monetary system that is equal is admirable, it presupposes the people creating the rules will not succumb to human nature and adjust the rules to benefit themselves and their immediate circle. Can you criticize fiat (and eventually CBDCs’) umpires without getting kicked out of the game? Well, you can just ask <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-fueled-canada-trucker-convoy">truck drivers in northern North America</a> or nonviolent <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/21/europe/europe-lockdown-protests-violence-intl/index.html">citizens in Europe</a>…</p><p>Furthermore, allowing a central authority to change the rules at their whim, we are allowing damaging incentives to enter into the game. This manipulates basic market economic signals, which distorts reality. When one small group has the ability to choose who plays (permission to spend), adjusting pitch clocks (money expiration), have only one scoring card (centralized “node”), inconsistently enforced (unpredictable policy), or scoring based on perceived “niceness” (social credit scores), you create a game that’s immoral, convoluted, incentively misaligned, and inconsistently enforced.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Bitcoin … well, fixes this. It’s a fair game. It’s ironic that early Bitcoiners were ones who disregarded legacy rules to opt into a fair, rule-based system; rules without rulers, ya know? Playing the game of Bitcoin, you can play knowing the rules are fair (spend without permission or expiration), you can have ownership over the rules (run your own node &amp; securely self-custody), and you can play the game more freely with predictable and set rules (fixed supply &amp; monetary policy). You can do all this by simply opting out of the current centralized game of fiat and its digital kissing cousin, CBDCs.</p><p>Thank you for reading.

Bitcoin is a cure for the economic calamities.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Conor Chepenik, a Bitcoin pleb.</em></p><p>When a doctor operates on a wounded patient, the first thing they do is make sure they can stop the bleeding. No point operating if you can’t get the bleeding under control because the patient will die. Money facilitates mutual exchange and helps market actors coordinate price discovery — it is the literal blood of the economy. As fiat currencies slowly bleed out in value, they incentivize fewer people to save. If you want to stop the bleeding in your financial life, you are going to need to find a way to store your wealth in something else. There are plenty of options, but only one that is programmed to stop all bleeding in 2140.</p><p>As peoples’ money bleeds out, so too does their education, time and, I’d even argue, their mental sanity. Blood isn’t oozing out egregiously, but rather being siphoned off from tiny cuts, so most people do not even realize it’s happening. This is a hard pill to swallow. Most Western societies teach people not to question authority: raise your hand if you want to ask questions, and trust the experts. Breaking out of this mentality is difficult. Watch this<a href="https://twitter.com/canindependent/status/1595460390045028352?s=20&amp;t=qIFHdHF4A-8z4nmfle5Mqw"> clip</a> of the White House press secretary to get an idea of how those at the top will treat people who dare question the narrative. </p><h2>Pain Is The Best Teacher</h2><p>Narrative is everything when trying to coerce the masses to accept a “Great Reset” (if you have no idea what the Great Reset is, you can read about it <a href="https://alilybit.substack.com/p/what-the-fuck-is-going-on">here</a>). The scope of this article won’t cover what the Davos elite is attempting to impose on the rest of the world, but rather why Bitcoin stops money from bleeding out. Trying to calculate all of the variables that bring about the emergent, complex behavior of society is futile. Governments stole <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/global-qe-tracker/">trillions of dollars via quantitative easing</a> and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/fed-response-to-covid19/#:~:text=Easing%20Monetary%20Policy&amp;text=These%20cuts%20lowered%20the%20funds,borrowing%20for%20households%20and%20businesses.">blamed their theft on COVID-19</a>. </p><p>It should not be a surprise that what followed has been chaos in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_responses_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic">protests</a> and <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/09/global-supply-chains-in-a-post-pandemic-world">supply chain issues</a>. The Federal Reserve is following up its quantitative easing with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-22/fed-s-new-normal-for-pace-of-tightening-may-be-hard-to-escape">tightening monetary policy at record paces trying to get inflation under control</a>. This demand destruction is wreaking havoc all over the economy but is necessary to weed out unprofitable businesses. </p><p>For better or worse, pain is the best teacher. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6CTHoTTMyo">Hard Money</a> recently reported that Trezor has seen a 300% increase in sales revenue after the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">FTX debacle</a>. The whole point of Bitcoin is to not trust ,but verify for yourself. Many ignored this because FTX had the stamp of approval from many mainstream news outlets, politicians and celebrities. </p><p>In the wake of its blow, FTX created tons of new Bitcoin maximalists who now understand why not verifying Bitcoin with your own node means that you are trusting potentially-corrupt third parties. The mainstream media is not doing itself any favors with puff pieces like the one below. Articles like this only serve to increase the pain of those who were robbed and convince more people that the mainstream narrative is corrupt:</p><figure>

Tools like Saylor.org, Udemy and plenty of others have lowered the barrier tremendously. It just requires a desire to learn. </p><p>For me, I found that desire by going down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. Ironically, answering one question would lead me to more questions and that number of questions grew exponentially. It made me wonder how much people are not taught intentionally during their traditional schooling. There is only so much time in the day and teachers must prioritize their curriculums accordingly. I just don’t understand why taxes, how to vote and basic financial literacy aren’t at the top of most public school curriculums. The reader can come to their own conclusions. What’s important is finding a teacher who speaks your language and a subject that brings out your natural curiosity. Learning becomes one of the most euphoric feelings in the world when those two needs are met.</p><p>The standard way of learning has horrible mental models for teaching people, like memorizing things for a test. Oscar Wilde is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/4829-experience-is-merely-the-name-men-gave-to-their-mistakes">quoted as saying</a>, “Experience is merely the name men gave to their mistakes.” People are so focused on learning from the experts that they forget that those who changed the world didn’t ask for permission to do so. They just did it. People want a hero to fix all of their problems but the truth is that no one is coming to save you. I’m not saying one should not find great mentors; it’s super valuable being able to listen to those who have become experts in their fields in order to learn. I’m saying one should not worship people like gods who can’t make mistakes. Just look at Sam Bankman-Friend, who many thought was a hero.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Despite all of the educational content out there, the reality is most people will come to understand the difference between paper bitcoin and bitcoin you actually hold the keys for via an expensive lesson. When the majority of Bitcoiners self custody their coins, and stop blindly trusting their heroes, that is when we will see fireworks in regards to bitcoin’s price action. Every person is different and has various forms of risk tolerance. For those who are discouraged by recent events, remember: Rome was not built in a day. Sometimes the only way to get a lesson through someone’s head is for them to suffer the pain of said mistake. </p><h2>FTX And Central Planners Are Not So Different</h2><p>What’s interesting about watching FTX fail so rapidly is that the same thing would happen with our traditional financial system if we didn’t have central banks acting as lenders of last resort. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/10/ftx-violated-its-own-terms-of-service-and-misused-user-funds-lawyers-say/">FTX violated its own terms of service by using customer funds to make bets</a>, but 99.9% of the world just turns a blind eye when banks do this because their terms of service legally allow fractional reserve banking. </p><p>In his book “<a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Mises/HmA/msHmA.html?chapter_num=6#book-reader">Human Action</a>,”<em> </em>Ludwig von Mises writes:</p><blockquote><p>“The rich, the owners of the already operating plants, have no particular class interest in the maintenance of free competition. They are opposed to confiscation and expropriation of their fortunes, but their vested interests are rather in favor of measures preventing newcomers from challenging their position. Those fighting for free enterprise and free competition do not defend the interests of those rich today. They want a free hand left to unknown men who will be the entrepreneurs of tomorrow and whose ingenuity will make the life of coming generations more agreeable. They want the way left open to further economic improvements. They are the spokesmen of progress.”</p></blockquote><p>Technology getting better should lead to massive deflation from productivity gains. Regulatory moats and monopolies prevent this. Fractional reserve banking creates an inflationary environment where tons of capital is misallocated. In a free market, most commercial banks would be insolvent. </p><p>FTX tried to create its own fractional reserve monopoly by <a href="https://www.grid.news/story/economy/2022/11/21/how-ftx-played-both-parties-and-almost-won-washington/">lobbying Congress</a> and creating a regulatory moat around its business which would’ve made it impossible for competitors to compete in the crypto ecosystem. The world is fortunate FTX’s system blew up before it was able to get its way with D.C. </p><p>Mises was right: It is not the incumbents who will create a more agreeable future, it is entrepreneurs and ideas competing in a free market. Bitcoin has over <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/number-of-cryptocurrencies">10,000 competitors</a>, and that number is growing every day. Many, if not all of these tokens, are Ponzi schemes in my opinion, but the idea that D.C could do a better job deciding this than the free market could is ridiculous. </p><p>I understand regulation is difficult when technology is changing things at such rapid rates. The little piece of glass in our pocket allows us to hail a ride, order food or listen to some of the greatest minds on the planet whenever we want. All of these things would seem magical to someone who lived before the creation of smartphones. There are going to be hiccups along the way as humanity tries to come to grips with these new tools. This is why I keep this Hal Finney quote as my Twitter header:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MzkzMTM0NDg5MTUwOTgx/hal-finney.jpg" height="206" width="620">

    </figure><p>For all of the wonders that technology can do for humanity, it can also drive a whole new level of control. Free markets lead to optimal price discovery. Too much central planning and markets start to break. Price discovery in a free market is like a hash function. It takes inputs of data and spits out an output that only goes one way. </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmtzX-NPFDc">With a normal hash</a>, the algorithm works so that it is unfeasible to reverse-calculate the data. You can verify a hash by making sure the same output is achieved based on the input, but you can’t take the output and figure out the input. In this same vein, a free market will set the price of a good, but you can’t figure out how all of the labor, work, travel and other variables created the price of the good. The function only goes one way. </p><p>Market actors get upset when the coercion variable is notched up and price increases happen. The blame is typically pushed on to the producers rather than the central planners who are causing such issues. Sound familiar? Like say the U.S. government, which is <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-oil-companies-unprecedented-profits/">calling out greedy fossil fuel companies</a> for raising the price of gas <a href="https://twitter.com/CurtisHouck/status/1582815157587435520?s=20&amp;t=ka4sWSFgn2gze-DdfIKBkw">while at the same time advocating for the end of fossil fuel use</a>. If price controls are imposed, price discovery completely breaks down, resulting in shortages. Until the creation of money is no longer heavily intermingled with politics these issues will continue to play out.</p><h2>Bitcoin Is More Important Now Than Ever</h2><p>As central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and digital identities are rolled out, it has never been more important to point out why Bitcoin is the remedy. Bitcoin allows the individual to go down a hero’s journey where they can keep the value of their labor in their head. CBDCs and digital IDs offer governments tools to enact monetary policy at the individual level, be at the center of every transaction and turn off people’s money as they see fit. </p><p>Bitcoin offers a better system, one that no one can cheat if they want to be in consensus with the rest of the network.<a href="https://twitter.com/PrestonPysh"> Preston Pysh</a> said it best: “Bitcoin is like the infinity stone.” It takes a great deal of faith to hold on to an asset that has had <a href="https://ca.rbcwealthmanagement.com/fjwealth/blog/2947128-Bitcoin-drawdowns-from-previous-all-time-highs/">multiple 70% to 90% drawdowns</a> before recovering to new all-time highs. Not many can hang on to their bitcoin but those who do over long periods of time are greatly rewarded. </p><p>The network effects of Bitcoin are insane. There is a<a href="https://bitcoin.rocks"> Bitcoin website</a> paying people 21,000 satoshis to post a sticker that it ships to you around their cities. Think about that. You can earn sats and increase the value of those sats by helping raise awareness. Bitcoin is full of these win-win scenarios. The tech is exciting, but the passion I see from Bitcoiners in real life is unlike anything I’ve ever seen before.</p><p>Bitcoin as a technology, a new form of money and an idea are bringing hope to humans around the world who have been disadvantaged because governments have a monopoly on violence. Bitcoin empowers the individual to fight back like never before. There will be growing pains along the way and more turmoil in the short term for those obsessed with measuring things in fiat. The way to fix that is to orient yourself around the new system. </p><p>The possibilities that will come out of this Bitcoin renaissance are endless. Grappling with what this new form of money means is difficult because the world is full of so many paradoxes. When you learn, you become smarter by ending up with more questions. Monopolies have brought about some of the most prosperous and technologically advanced times in human civilizations while also making George Orwell’s “1984” look like a very plausible path for the future. The internet is connecting people like never before and at the same time, <a href="https://www.psypost.org/2022/01/massive-meta-analysis-finds-loneliness-has-increased-in-emerging-adults-in-the-last-43-years-62377">loneliness is increasing</a>. Number go up technology is associated with greed and is what initially attracts people to Bitcoin, yet many stay because they realize Bitcoin is the true effective altruism movement. These paradoxes are a bit mind bending but I do think there is value to be had from chewing on these ideas.</p><p>It can be easy to get bogged down with all of the bleeding going on in the fiat world. Bitcoin is the Band-Aid to fix it. It gives me a lot of confidence knowing my money is secured by open-source software and math rather than <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/structure-federal-reserve-system.htm">12 individuals</a> who decide when it is okay to steal and when it’s time to practice fiscal austerity. </p><p>I’m glad the Fed has finally decided to do the right thing for the economy but it has manipulated the cost of capital for so long that it now risks destroying the entire system if it keeps tightening. The problem is that the Fed’s only other option is to lower rates again, which causes more bleeding via inflation. Bitcoin offers humanity a way out of this paradox where central planners try to fix the bleeding by siphoning more blood out of the patient. Every time central planners manipulate the cost of capital it becomes more clear that market participants are playing a rigged game. Bitcoin is the fairest game humanity has ever created and the best chance we have of separating money and state.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Conor Chepenik.

At the end of November, we saw a 13.1% decline in hash rate from all-time highs. However, of the major hash rate declines since 2016, that’s still relatively small compared to the handful of down periods over 15% during that time. </p><p>The latest 7.32% downward difficulty adjustment is a direct response to all of that hash rate going offline. As we stand today, the hash rate is right around 250 EH/s and down 7.84% from its all-time high of approximately 273 EH/s. This is the largest downward difficulty adjustment we’ve seen since July 2021, when we saw a series of downward difficulty adjustments following the Chinese mining ban. This should bring some temporary relief to current miners, but it's too early to say if this trend in declining hash rate has already concluded.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>The hash rate drawdown from all-time highs is less than the average bear market</figcaption>
    </figure><p>Even with the latest drawdown in hash rate, we’re not seeing announcements come from major public miners. Most public miners’ hash rate is either flat or is growing over the last month.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>From those who have provided monthly production updates so far, bitcoin holdings are largely rising from the biggest three treasuries across Riot, Marathon and Hut 8 accounting for 27,579 bitcoin. Bitfarms sold a meaningful amount from their treasury which is likely related to paying down their current debt facilities.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In bitcoin terms, miners' stock performance continues to fall this year when looking at year-to-date returns versus bitcoin performance. The hash price bear market is alive and well, which has been a core thesis for us when evaluating the current prospects of investing in public miners versus bitcoin. Any miner outperformance in bitcoin short-term has proven to be an opportunity in the market to reprice the equity lower. </p><p>Looking at the market caps of a proxy basket of six public bitcoin miners shows just how much value has been wiped out from 2021. After a 452% rise in value to its November 2021 peak of $19.1 billion, the market wiped out 90% of value in less than a year.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MzI2NzI5NzMxNDE3Nzc3/public-miner-market-cap.png" height="372" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>The market cap of public miners has fallen over 90% since all-time highs</figcaption>
    </figure><p>While the worst of the drawdown of public miner market capitalizations and hash price (miner revenue per tera hash) has already taken place, we expect that the tough conditions can last for a sustained period of time, squeezing many market participants along the way. The recent downward difficulty adjustment brought about some relief, but it is barely sufficient for many miners who purchased the bulk of their machines in 2021, expecting $30,000 as their “worst-case scenario.” </p><p>Throw in an environment where global energy prices and interest rates have skyrocketed and many operations are facing immensely difficult circumstances — particularly hosting facilities where companies serve as intermediaries for customers looking to reap the benefits of mining bitcoin. The elephant in the room for the state of the mining industry is the reality that some of the industry’s biggest hosting facilities are either already bankrupt, teetering on the edge of bankruptcy or are completely out of deployable hash rate for idle ASICs. </p><p>We will be intently watching hash rate and the state of the mining industry going forward. Although the industry has been bludgeoned over the course of 2022, we suspect it isn’t out of the woods quite yet. </p><p>The beauty of bitcoin and capitalism is that only the strong will survive. Regardless, blocks will continue to be mined every approximately 10 minutes.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/DylanLeClair_/status/1600880790493069314"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><figure>

Even though they got a late start because of snowfall the night before, there was a sense of eager anticipation in the air.</p><p>Ryan Brisch, a Denver Bitcoiner, had been frequently talking to his significant other about issues Bitcoin could help solve, or some new Bitcoin product that he was excited about. His wife, Nicole, is a sixth grade math teacher at STRIVE Prep and had started to respond that he should come and speak to her class about some of the basic mathematical foundations of Bitcoin. </p><p>In October, Nicole was telling Brisch about an enrichment class led by her coworker, Rawa Abu Alsamah, which was working with an outside group, <a href="https://teamwethrive.org/">We Thrive</a>. We Thrive offers entrepreneurial apprenticeships in which youth start their own ventures, earn real revenue and gain mentorship. Alsamah’s seventh- and eighth-grade students were creating their own businesses through the guidance of We Thrive and would be selling their products at a pop-up market later in the month. </p><p>When hearing about this event, Brisch’s first question was, ‘’Do you think they would be interested in being able to buy and sell their products in bitcoin?” </p><p>From there, the idea was in motion and Brisch reached out to his local Bitcoin Telegram group for the content experts that would be needed to make the idea work. Anthony Feliciano and Mark Maraia quickly volunteered not only their expertise on money, Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, but also their time, energy and sats. Over the next three weeks, Brisch, Feliciano and Maraia, met, spoke and quickly devised a plan of action. Maraia would teach the kids about money and Bitcoin and Feliciano would focus on the use of the Muun wallet and the Lightning Network. </p><p>The first week’s presentation was focused on getting the students to think about money, how it worked, who currently controlled it and then question them about how it could be different and how the Bitcoin network and monetary system worked. It ended with a little homework assignment: to download Muun wallet. The next week, the morning of the pop-up shop, the three men were back at the school, passing out sats that were fundraised over the previous week and showing students how to create and pay invoices. Needless to say, the digital-native students took to Muun wallet and Lightning payments like fish to water! </p><p>On that cold snowy morning, dozens of student vendors arrived before the pop-up event so they could learn how to receive sats in payment for their product or service from other students. The plan called for these students to use the Lightning Network exclusively and that meant the student entrepreneurs needed to know how to create an invoice.</p><p>These student entrepreneurs received $5 to start their day and were encouraged to let the other students know they would accept payment in sats. Within a few minutes, each student had learned wallet basics and went to their booth armed with the knowledge of how to accept bitcoin in payment for their product or service. (The week prior, they had raised about $500 in bitcoin as seed capital for this event with support from a generous group of Rocky Mountain Bitcoiners.)</p><p>Earlier that morning, these young entrepreneurs had set up their booth in the school gym featuring signage which advertised their product/service and a price list offering a wide variety of goods such as homemade cupcakes, cookies, waffles and other handmade goods as well as services such as neck shaves and shoe shines. </p><p>The event began with the students downloading Muun wallet and learning how to create invoices. Next, the students were all instructed to create Lightning invoices to receive $5 worth of sats, as they headed down to the pop-up shop in the gymnasium. Just over 80 students and a couple of teachers were loaded with sats to spend. Some of the boldest students came back to reload after they spent their first sats. It really was a sight to see, just a mere few hours earlier, students were downloading Muun. Sooner after, merchants were creating invoices for goods, kids were running around performing transactions, and through all of the excitement, you could hear merchants yelling “I accept bitcoin!”</p><p>The level of enthusiasm that the students showed toward learning how to send and receive sats was inspiring and would make any Bitcoiner optimistic about our future. The event was a huge success, with many of the students thanking our local Bitcoiners for the lessons and sats. The students, being digital natives, were able to grasp how to use the technology with incredible ease. They were all told of the importance of remembering their four-digit code and using the security features to backup and recover the Muun wallet as needed. This began their first, tentative steps toward owning a form of property with a level of responsibility that none had ever known. </p><p>By the end of the event, the most industrious vendors held more than 180,000 sats in their wallets and a growing awareness that this new kind of money spelled opportunity. </p><p>Our local Bitcoiners also took the time to educate a few of the teachers on how to download a wallet and receive sats. After receiving sats on her Muun wallet, one teacher was blown away with the idea that she didn’t have to provide a phone number, or an address, or a social security number and that it did not require permission from a bank or government. All it takes is a phone and an internet connection to send money to someone on the other side of the world.</p><p>And as our local Bitcoiners left the event, there were many shouts of thanks as they walked out confident that the rabbit hole was drawing near for a new crop of bitcoiners. At the very least, a cohort of seventh and eighth graders were much more curious about Bitcoin. </p><p>The only thing that can top that feeling is to see another million Bitcoiners march into a local school near them and do something similar.

Is that truly a victory for democracy and for the kind of psycho-spiritual wellbeing of all of us and the lives we want to live? Versus something like Bitcoin, that’s a definancializing force that basically says because we think a world might be better where you’re actually able to save money and you don’t just have to spend it or go invest or speculate on some stuff, would that unlock ways for you to feel more fulfilled or satisfied as a person and would you then be able to pursue other things? I think ultimately the end of Bitcoin is that we all think collectively less about money and more about other things that we’re interested in.”</em></p><p>I made these statements on a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRGhFW-a2mQ&amp;t=2096s">episode</a> of the “What Bitcoin Did” podcast in a discussion about Bitcoin and the ways I think it can catalyze positive changes in our interior lives, as contrasted with the contemporary state of Web 3.</p><p>We frequently discuss and theorize the ways in which Bitcoin can reshape or reconfigure our external realities, whether they be political, monetary, legislative, etc. But I don’t think enough attention is paid to how Bitcoin can initiate a similarly monumental reshaping of our interior lives, a process which, in the aggregate, can lead to a trickling <em>up </em>of priorities and values.</p><p>I want to talk about two different conceptions of freedom to illustrate why I think we fixate so much on one of them. When folks describe themselves as “freedom maximalists,” they’re primarily referring to the idea of negative freedom, a freedom <em>from</em> intrusive external constraints. This type of freedom is obviously of fundamental, paramount importance. Without freedom from certain external constraints, meaningful pursuit of self-realization, what we would refer to as positive freedom, is difficult, if not impossible to pursue.</p><p>We tend to get so focused on the negative freedom aspects of Bitcoin that we fail to fully appreciate the positive freedom that Bitcoin facilitates. Which is to say we get so fixated on the ways in which Bitcoin precludes external intrusions or constraints (freedom <em>from) </em>that we don’t explore the ways in which Bitcoin can create an environment that allows us to more rigorously pursue the fullest expression of our selves (freedom <em>to</em>).</p><p><em>[N.B. for my humanities/philosophy friends: Yes, I am drawing on the work of Isaiah Berlin with these positive/negative freedom terms]</em></p><p>I would argue that freedom maximalism is not sustainably fulfilling long-term, because it’s not really an end state. It’s a necessary liminal posture, a means to achieving a certain environment in which positive freedom can be productively exercised. However, negative freedom without positive freedom is like having an infinite number of TV channels but no idea what you want to watch. It’s like having the freedom to pursue anything you want without any way of determining what you actually want to pursue or what’s worth pursuing.</p><p>Americans are particularly attuned to ideas of negative freedom, but not particularly adept when it comes to positive freedom. We can see this everywhere, including in the Bitcoin space. If one makes a living, builds a following, or crafts an entire identity around being a “freedom maximalist,” one’s livelihood and sense of self depends on the continuing existence of external constraints for one to decry. One can unwittingly (and mostly subconsciously) become the bird that has grown to love its cage, as author Lewis Hyde once wrote of irony.</p><p>So while freedom maximalism (negative freedom) is vitally important, we should also pursue and prioritize what my wife has aptly coined <em>intentionality maximalism</em> (positive freedom), which is a perspective and a way of living in our interior lives. Bitcoin does not get enough credit for its ability and its potential to foster this type of inward-looking change.</p><p>What does intentionality maximalism look like in our everyday experience of life? One salient example is our relationship with the unbridled consumerism endemic in a fiat monetary system.</p><p>Allow me to share some statistics that illustrate just how warped this relationship has become:</p><p>Per the Los Angeles Times, there are 300,000 items in the average American home.</p><p>Per <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5525283">NPR</a>, the average size of the American home has nearly tripled in size over the past 50 years.</p><p>Nevertheless, one out of every ten Americans rent offsite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06self-storage-t.html?em&amp;_r=0">storage</a>, which is the fastest growing segment of the commercial real estate industry over the past four decades.</p><p>British <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/8074156/Ten-year-olds-have-7000-worth-of-toys-but-play-with-just-330.html">research</a> found that the average 10-year-old owns 238 toys but plays with just 12 daily.</p><p>The average American family spends $1,700 on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmajohnson/2015/01/15/the-real-cost-of-your-shopping-habits/?sh=236aaef41452">clothes</a> annually, while also throwing away, on average, 65 pounds of <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/closet-cast-offs-clogging_b_554400">clothing</a> per year.</p><p>You get the idea. There is practically no end to the data showing the absurd amount of shit we own and the growing space (physical and mental) that this shit occupies.</p><p>Americans are consuming more than ever.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>What explains this? One factor is that we measure our economic health by how much we spend, a singularly fiat and Keynesian way of gauging economic vitality. Consumer spending is roughly 70% of GDP. If we spend less, the metric we use to gauge economic health drops.</p><p>There’s also the fact that we see more ads than ever.</p><p>But, most importantly, there’s a widespread high time preference that is, I think, part of the very fabric of our culture.</p><p>Here’s where I think Bitcoin comes into play. So much of this rat-race orgy of consumption is high-time-preference behavior incentivized by the fiat monetary system, which ensures your money loses value over time. Since your purchasing power is sand in an hourglass, and since you work harder than ever just to keep up, consumer spending serves both a practical and a pacifying purpose. In other words, we are incentivized to spend because not spending or investing means our money just sits and loses value. And if we work so hard, many of us at jobs we don’t particularly enjoy, just to keep up, shouldn’t we also buy all the new cool stuff to make us feel like it’s all worth it?</p><p>If we remove ourselves from some of the rat race stuff it clears space for us to think less about money, which means we can be more intentional about everything else. Hence the idea of intentionality maximalism. We sort of reclaim our positive freedom, our freedom to pursue the highest expression of ourselves. Bitcoin, in my opinion, is ultimately about looking for a sustainable alternative to the rat-race model.</p><p>It’s really a contrast of values. Consumerism is a value of the fiat system. It is both literally a value, since we measure economic health in large part by measuring consumption, and also an ingrained mode of behavior. By disincentivizing mindless, reflexive consumption and incentivizing a lower time preference, Bitcoin, if it continues to grow in adoption, offers the promise of a cultural foregrounding of deeper things, like fulfilling pursuits, relationships, creativity, contribution to community, presence, etc.</p><p>When it comes to this interior transformation, this intentionality maximalism, and the ways in which Bitcoin moves us in that direction, I think Bitcoin shares some fundamental principles with minimalism, a movement that has deep, ancient roots, but has been gathering more popular momentum in the last decade or so. Proponents of minimalism, mindful of the constraints unchecked consumerism can place on our lived experience, pursue lives with fewer unused, unnecessary possessions in order to reclaim freedom and mastery over one’s life and the space to pursue what’s important. Which is to say the pursuit of a more intentional life.</p><p>Joshua Fields Millburn, co-founder of <a href="https://www.theminimalists.com/">theminimalists.com</a>, describes minimalism as “the thing that gets us past the things so we can make room for life’s important things—which aren’t <em>things</em> at all.”</p><p><strong>The promise of Bitcoin, to borrow Millburn’s articulation, is to be the money that, through its soundness, allows us to get past thinking about money all the time so that we can make room for life’s important things - which tend to get lost, neglected, and/or sacrificed in consumption and the systemically coerced pursuit of more and more money.</strong></p><p>We spend so much time thinking about money (how to get it, how to get more of it, how to make it grow, how to keep up with inflation, how to invest it, how to spend it, what to spend it on, how to get rich quick, how to pay the bills, etc). And to a certain extent this will always be true. I am not advocating for the Platonic form of communism here.</p><p>But when money does not hold its value, when it is continuously debased, when the sovereign debt is so massive it must be inflated away, and when the economic health of a country is measured by how much it consumes, it creates an environment in which money is practically all we think about.</p><p>This is why I have been so critical/skeptical of some of the proposals in other corners of the crypto world, many of which seem to be seeking to financialize every corner of our lives. I think this perpetuates, and perhaps intensifies, our high-time-preference environment.</p><p>In contrast, the implications and downstream effects of collectively lowering our time preference, which I think necessarily involves less consumerism, simply cannot be understated. Imagine an entire population finally able to save in a sound money and to spend more time and energy on the things that mean the most to them.</p><p>Now, again, I’m not envisioning a utopian end-state here where we’re all singing songs around the campfire (though I do enjoy songs and campfires). I’m talking about returning some headspace and some presence back to folks who have, by necessity, grown accustomed to spending every waking moment thinking about money and consumption. I’m talking about a transformation of our interior lives, one that clears space for more intentional living. And I think an under-appreciated aspect of Bitcoin is its potential to catalyze such a transformation.</p><p>So be a freedom maximalist, because it’s important. But don’t stop there, because that alone won’t keep you full, long-term. Be an intentionality maximalist, too.</p><p>Many people live lives like this - compelled, constrained, and unintentional within a fiat system:</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9dZQelULDk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9dZQelULDk"><em>Happiness</em></a></p><p>I think Bitcoin is about escaping this.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Logan Bolinger.

The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.” </em>In other words what really drives the fiat monetary to a great extent is trust, because without it the system as we know it wouldn’t be functional, however the trust is being placed in untrustworthy individuals and institutions. The Bitcoin monetary system is trustless and decentralized by design and is reliant on cryptographic proof instead, thus removing altogether the need for “trusted intermediaries” in every financial interaction, from the central bank all the way down to transactions between individuals.</p><p><a href="https://www.bitrawr.com/bitcoin-block-size-debate-explained">The Blocksize War</a> of 2015-2017 is one of the most significant events in Bitcoin’s history. This was really a battle between those that favored centralization of the protocol by a handful of developers, exchanges and miners (akin to what you have in Ethereum today) versus those that favored decentralization, security and resilience over the long term. For the first time in its existence Bitcoin faced a potential hostile takeover engineered by powerful corporate entities that wanted to capture and impose their will on Bitcoin. What started out as a disagreement on how to scale Bitcoin, whether the size limit of the blocks that make up the Bitcoin blockchain should be increased or not, eventually morphed into a two year long tug of war over the very soul of Bitcoin itself. Two camps emerged; the “big blockers'', who were in favor of increasing the<a href="https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/crypto-101/what-is-block-size/"> block size</a> as their priority was ensuring faster and cheaper transactions at the base layer thus making Bitcoin into a global payments system that would rival Visa (i.e. corporate control); and the “small blockers'' who were more focused on Bitcoin being a new form of money, which had to remain fully decentralized if it was to achieve the goal of separating money and state (i.e. individual control).</p><p>Jan3 CEO, Samson Mow, who was at the frontlines of the block size war, in a recent<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/the-first-major-bitcoin-civil-war"> article</a> made the following remark about the small blockers, <em>“They prioritized integrity, resilience and security, arguing that if blocks became big, it would become expensive for users to run a node and would thus incentivize hosting nodes in data centers; a one-way street towards centralization and control by a few, not much different from other systems like banks. This would mean the death of the dream of an apolitical, incorruptible, decentralized money.”</em> The small blockers foresaw a scenario in which overtime it would be expensive for users to run full Bitcoin nodes which would have led to further centralization and thus recreating the trusted third parties in another form; the very middlemen that Bitcoin was designed to disrupt. Satoshi designed Bitcoin with the intention of it remaining a technically and socially robust peer-to-peer (P2P) network which should never be “corrupted” through centralization. He summarized it<a href="https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/1/"> this way</a>, <em>“Digital signatures provide part of the solution, </em><em>but the main benefits are lost if a trusted party is still required</em><em> to prevent double-spending.”</em></p><p>In order for Bitcoin to remain user-controlled, every attempt or form of centralization has to be fiercely resisted, especially given the innate human tendency to lean more towards centralized systems with a leader. If a handful of business entities and developers could force such a significant change without consensus would that not be akin to how the Federal Reserve plans the economy by dictating interest rates and maintaining “price stability?” As stated earlier, it wasn’t just about block sizes anymore but it was now an ideological clash about control. Who had control, was it the users or the miners or the developers that would steer the protocol? In the book,<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blocksize-War-controls-Bitcoins-protocol/dp/B08YQMC2WM"> “The Blocksize War<em>,</em>”</a> the author accurately described this phenomenon and how it was an underlying driver for the big blockers when he noted;</p><p>“<em>In some people’s minds, the idea of a system controlled by end users is too difficult to grasp. Instead, they look for somebody or some entity who controls the system. Some people cannot fathom the idea of a system which has global consensus, but lacks a leader...As for whether Bitcoin really is the leaderless system it proclaims to be and whether this will always remain the case, the jury is still out. However, after the drama and shenanigans of the blocksize war, one thing is clear: there is still hope that the claim is true.”</em></p><p>Ultimately, it was the small blockers that prevailed and as a result Bitcoin remained firmly in the users’ control.</p><p>When it comes to Bitcoin most of the attention is focused on bitcoin the asset and less on the infrastructure required to maintain this global, decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network. While the small blockers’ victory in the blocksize war secured Bitcoin’s path towards future mass adoption, it still remains unclear to most people why running a node is so important that it was worth fighting for. Let’s start by defining what a node is. A full node is any computer that maintains and stores the entire Bitcoin blockchain; in order to verify and record new transactions as they happen, according to a common set of network consensus rules. In the absence of a central party, it’s these nodes that act as referees of the Bitcoin network by independently validating all transactions and blocks; and filtering out invalid transactions. This is how the Bitcoin network removes trust in any centralized entity and ensures the integrity of its 21 million supply cap. </p><figure>

    </figure><p>While running a full node is important, it’s still optional to do so. Running a full node, grants anyone the ability to broadcast transactions (or blocks) on a permissionless basis. The more nodes there are on the network, the more decentralized Bitcoin becomes. This not only increases redundancy, but it results in Bitcoin being more secure by making it increasingly harder to corrupt or censor. Each full node executes the consensus rules of the network, an important element being Bitcoin’s fixed supply. Bitcoin Core developer, Luke Dashjr,<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-independence-day%3A-luke-dashjr-on-the-lessons-from-segwit-that-were-forgetting"> perfectly summarized</a> it this way, <em>“All of Bitcoin’s advantages — including its security from outright theft and the 21 million BTC cap — stem from the assumption that the majority of the economy are using their own full nodes to verify payments to them. Centralized verification and third-party/custodial wallets are a bigger threat to Bitcoin than anything else.” </em>In other words, nodes are very important parts of the Bitcoin network’s defense mechanism with regards to processing transactions, and they are the last line of defense against centralization and malicious actors. More information regarding running your own node can be found <a href="https://armantheparman.com/why-should-you-run-your-own-bitcoin-node/">here.</a></p><p>Despite the critical role that nodes play in the Bitcoin ecosystem, it’s<a href="https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/historical.html"> estimated</a> that the number of Bitcoin nodes has dropped considerably from a peak of 200,000 in 2018 to less than 45,000 today as of time of writing according to Dashjr’s data. Given the fact that users being able to run full nodes was one of the biggest factors that culminated in the blocksize war, it’s definitely of great concern that we are seeing a reduction of nodes on the network in 2022 when compared with 2018. This could potentially make the Bitcoin network less secure and much more prone to centralization. Furthermore from a geographical standpoint, 32.8% of Bitcoin nodes globally are located in just seven countries — the United States, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Canada, Finland and the United Kingdom, as of time of writing according to<a href="https://bitnodes.io/dashboard/"> data</a> from BTC nodes analytics platform <em>Bitnodes.</em></p><figure>

    </figure><p>Ironically in the global south where there is a huge need for Bitcoin from a financial inclusion perspective, there is a paucity of Bitcoin nodes in that part of the world. There are numerous reasons that can explain the decrease of Bitcoin nodes or the lack thereof in other regions; firstly there are a lot of people that are not educated about the importance of running a full Bitcoin node, especially given the current obsession with number go up. Secondly, due to the significant bandwidth usage of Bitcoin full nodes especially as the network scales, the costs of doing so are prohibitive; especially in places with subpar internet connectivity. This is where Erlay comes in. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10518.pdf">Erlay</a> is a new efficient transaction relay protocol that aims to significantly minimize the bandwidth usage required to connect Bitcoin full nodes. </p><p>Approximately 50% of the bandwidth required to run a Bitcoin node is used just for announcing transactions. When a new bitcoin transaction is broadcast, it is sent to all nodes on Bitcoin’s p2p network and this occurs in two ways. Firstly, after receiving a transaction, a node sends a transaction identifier (i.e. transaction ID) to all of the peers it’s connected with. This transaction ID is subsequently verified by all these peers to ensure that they haven’t received the transaction in question from another peer. If not, the whole transaction is requested from the node that sent the transaction ID. This process repeats continuously and the end result is that there is a plethora of redundant messages being shared on the Bitcoin network, thus unnecessarily consuming a lot of bandwidth. It’s<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10518.pdf"> estimated </a>that 44% of overall bandwidth used between nodes consists of these redundant messages. The long and short of it is that this approach has high redundancy and poor bandwidth efficiency. The bandwidth costs therefore become a huge impediment for some users to run a full node, which severely limits the extent of decentralization of the network. <br><br></p><p>Secondly, the decentralized nature of the network gives rise to another critical issue with regards to Bitcoin’s node connectivity, which is that it also uses large amounts of bandwidth to keep the connection open with all the other nodes. In other words the current protocol increases bandwidth consumption as the number of connections between nodes increases. This also increases the costs to run a Bitcoin full node as the network scales, which would make the network more prone to centralization. Over and above that, since the security of the Bitcoin network is heavily reliant on the connectivity between nodes (i.e. higher connectivity results in a more secure network) fewer connections between nodes would be bandwidth efficient but would result in a less secure and borderline centralized network. According to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10518.pdf">white paper</a> that was co-authored by Gleb Naumenko, Bryan Bishop, Pieter Wuille, Greg Maxwell, Alexandara Fedorova and Ivan Beschastnikh; Erlay will reduce the amount of bandwidth required to maintain current levels of connectivity between<a href="https://coinrivet.com/dictionary/bitcoin/"> </a>Bitcoin nodes by 40%, while simultaneously maintaining bandwidth usage as the connectivity between nodes increases. To put this in perspective, currently a connection to 32 nodes utilizes approximately 17.3GB per month to relay transactions and Erlay drastically reduces this to a meager 0.94GB per month! This is a huge quantum leap for bandwidth efficiency as shown by the diagrams below:<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10518.pdf"></a></p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MzMxMTAyMDA4MDU5Mzk3/image2.png" height="239" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>The paper further states that; “<em>By allowing more connections at a small cost, Erlay improves the security of the Bitcoin network. And, as we demonstrate, Erlay also hardens the network against attacks that attempt to learn the origin node of a transaction.” </em> In other words Erlay significantly improves bandwidth efficiency by reducing bandwidth used for transaction relay as well as scalability of connections between peers thus making the network more resistant to <a href="https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~mohaisen/doc/icdcs19d.pdf">partitioning attacks</a> and fortifies single nodes against <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-an-eclipse-attack">eclipse attacks.</a> While Erlay protocol support signaling has successfully merged into<a href="https://blockchainreporter.net/bitcoin/"> </a>Bitcoin core, this was a development that took three and a half years to materialize, given the extensive review and testing that had to be done beforehand, because stability and security at the base layer are everything.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MzMxMTAyMDA4NTgzODU3/image4.png" height="400" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>While Bitcoin is a significant breakthrough in creating a trustless and decentralized monetary system with superior monetary properties, its success is not guaranteed unless we the users remain committed to defending the principles upon which it is anchored. The victory by the small blockers in the blocksize war wasn’t handed to them on a silver platter but it came about through relentless commitment to the goal of separation of money and state. It was all or nothing. Many more attempts to control Bitcoin at the protocol level will be launched, however they will be doomed to fail if we remain resolute and unwavering in preserving the network’s core tenets; of which decentralization is chief among them, in my humble opinion. By keeping the costs of running a node as low as possible,more individual users from around the world are able to participate in validating the network, this is what Erlay represents. It’s a defense against centralization of the network by larger players thus preserving Bitcoin’s identity as a fully decentralized, permissionless and trustless peer-to-peer monetary system. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Kudzai Kutukwa.

Short-term holder realized price (STH RP), as indicated by the report, is a more volatile, quick-to-move metric determined by the price of coins moved during a certain period, while long-term holder realized price (LTH RP) is a less volatile, more sticky metric determined by the price of coins held that have been unmoved for longer periods. When price dips below LTH RP, meaning that most long-term holders are underwater, it often coincides with previous bear market lows. The report suggests that the price of bitcoin is likely to flip both LTH RP and STH RP, which it is currently under, which could signal the low of the bear market.</p><figure>

A version of this article was originally published on </em><a href="https://jonathanleger.substack.com/p/how-i-came-to-understand-bitcoin"><em>Substack</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>I was raised in a doomsday cult that taught that God was getting ready to wage the war of Armageddon and bring about the end of the current world order. The governments, all ruled by the devil, would be replaced with the Kingdom of Heaven ruled by Jesus Christ. The cult discouraged any kind of real financial planning because of this worldview. After all, what was the point of investing in a system facing imminent destruction? </p><p>This extreme religious upbringing — and my eventual escape from it — helped me in my path to understanding Bitcoin Maximalism.</p><h2>Discovering Bitcoin</h2><p>My Bitcoin experience began with a losing trade in the summer of 2014. After reading a few articles about this “magic internet money,” I bought my first whole coin for about $500. I wasn’t prepared for how volatile the price swings would be, though, and sold at a loss later that year. If only I had known…</p><p>The last five years have been an intense learning experience for me. At the end of 2017, I left the cult with my wife, who is currently shunned by her entire family (as required by cult doctrine). I lost all of my “friends” as well. We had to learn how the real world worked and how to build a social network outside of the ready-made set of “friends” handed to us by the church, as getting close to non-members was deeply discouraged. All non-members were going to die by God’s hand at Armageddon anyway, so there was no point in getting too familiar. Plus, their wicked ways might rub off on you, so it was best to keep your distance for fear that you might get hit by a stray fireball when the end came.</p><p>After leaving the cult, I embraced life with the fervor of a wrongly-jailed prisoner embracing freedom upon exoneration. I studied politics for the first time, since members didn’t vote or participate in any form of campaigning due to the belief that all earthly governments were Satanic. I read books on how far humanity had advanced and how much better off we all are than in centuries past, however imperfect the current world may be. I was excited and optimistic for the future.</p><p>In 2004, I had started and grew a successful business as a software developer and internet marketing coach. The tools our team developed helped people compete with larger companies for getting websites to the top of the search results in Google, as well as other related use cases. For many years, searching Google for “coolest guy on the planet” returned my website as the number one result, demonstrating the importance of the Bitcoiner mantra, “Don’t trust, verify.”</p><p>Despite making millions of dollars in successful software product launches, I lost most of it through poor financial decisions coupled with intensifying competition from much better capitalized companies. On top of that, I went through a very expensive, acrimonious divorce. </p><p>“Love is grand,” they say, “but divorce is a hundred grand.” I grew up poor and had little formal or personal education in how to properly manage money or what money even really was, so when I finally “made it” I didn’t know how to properly handle it.</p><p>As you might imagine, it wasn’t all bad. The money afforded me many incredible personal experiences. But my personal and home life were a mess, I was still a true believer in the doomsday cult praying for the end of the world, and on balance was very unhappy. I felt like the wealthy writer of <a href="https://biblehub.com/kjv/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm">Ecclesiastes</a>, “I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.”</p><p>In 2019, I was 42 years old, had escaped the cult and was remarried to a wonderful woman whom I adore. I spent much of my time studying markets to prevent repeating past mistakes and working to develop a retirement plan. I did well with stocks that year but kept hearing about Bitcoin and how it was like nothing else. After reading “The Bitcoin Standard,” I finally understood why sound money was important and why fiat was doomed to fail. I again bought into BTC, this time at around $9,000.</p><h2>Contagion Hits</h2><p>When COVID-19 first reared its ugly head in early 2020, I did what many people did: listen to the “experts.” But as the scenes of pandemic theater played out, I began to understand that politics exhibited many of the same attributes as the cult I came out of. There were leaders that could not be questioned and members who would shame and shun anyone who dared to speak up. Their god was “The Science,” their Pope, Anthony Fauci, their clergy, the CDC and politicians. Rights were eroded and small businesses shut down while big box chains and mega-corporations raked in record profits, including Big Pharma. Trillions of dollars were printed out of thin air, proving true the Cantillon effect that says the largest beneficiaries of changes in money supply are the people and corporations closest to the money printers.</p><p>Unlike many hardcore Bitcoiners, my investment goals were purely financial, not philosophical. Like so many others in the crypto casino, I was chasing gains. Because of this, I sold my bitcoin at $45,000 and jumped into altcoins with the belief that I could multiply my investment, which I did. In fact, I did well enough to be able to stop writing software for about a year and a half, which was a much-needed hiatus and gave me even more time for the research I was doing.</p><p>Then came the market crash of 2022. With inflation clearly not “transitory,” the money printer was halted, and the Federal Reserve began to raise rates at a historically-unprecedented pace. Markets reacted negatively, bringing all cryptocurrencies down with them. The price of bitcoin cratered along with everything else. Low prices exposed the weakness of overleveraged schemes like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy">Celsius</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/fears-of-further-contagion-in-the-bitcoin-market">Three Arrows Capital</a>, sending them into bankruptcy. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/terra-collapse-teaches-about-crypto-and-bitcoin">Terra collapsed</a> along with a host of other smaller crypto operations.</p><p>The purportedly second-largest centralized crypto exchange in the world, FTX, stepped in with a promise to rescue the industry, only to turn out to be the<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns"> largest fraud of them all when its own balance sheet was leaked</a>. FTX’s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), was accused of stealing investors’ and users’ money and sending it to its trading arm, Alameda, where it was gambled away on high-risk trades that spectacularly failed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/10/23451484/ftx-customer-funds-alameda-research-sam-bankman-fried">to the tune of $10 billion</a>. </p><p>A massive “hack” of FTX followed shortly thereafter, the repercussions of which are still playing out. Evidence of political intrigue emerged, supported by the fact that most mainstream media coverage treated SBF with kid gloves, some even painting him as a victim rather than a predator. As of this writing, nobody has been arrested. By way of comparison, <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/billionaire-conman-bernard-madoff-arrested">Bernie Madoff was in handcuffs the day after his fraud was uncovered</a>.</p><p>Bitcoin began flying off exchanges while Bitcoiners shook their damn heads at how many people had again ignored one of their most basic truths, “Not your keys, not your coins.” While I was glad to see people finally listening, the damage done was tremendous, both in financial and reputational loss. Since my start with Bitcoin, I always self-custodied my bags and so was unaffected by any of the collapses, at least as far as losing any of my holdings.</p><p>Though I never lost my respect for Bitcoin or the principles of decentralization and sound money, these events returned them front and center to my consciousness. I resumed listening to Bitcoiner podcasts, reading long-form articles, watching videos and reminding myself just how badly off the current world financial system really is. </p><p>“It’s just math,” say the Bitcoiners, and I believe they are correct. There’s no stopping the debt spiral now. The end is indeed coming, just not in the way I had been taught growing up. </p><h2>I Finally Get It: ‘Don’t Trust, Verify’</h2><p>During the time I was trading and HODLing altcoins, I thought Bitcoin Maxis were too extreme. Even though I agreed with their views on sound money and decentralization and agreed that <em>most</em> cryptos were just vaporware rug pulls waiting to happen, I didn’t understand their disdain for <em>every</em> crypto that wasn’t bitcoin. This was especially true for projects that were actively being used in the real world to seemingly beneficial effect.</p><p>As a software developer myself, I am aware that there is no single tool that covers all use cases. There’s Windows, or MacOS X, or Linux for computers, Android or Apple’s iOS for phones, and countless different apps that run on all of those platforms that perform different functions, many of them competing for market share. This competition encourages innovation which ultimately makes all software better. That free-market principle is something Bitcoiners honor, so I didn’t understand why they jettisoned it when it came to cryptocurrencies. My assumption was they did so out of self-interest. If people invested in other projects, they wouldn’t put their money in bitcoin, which hurt the Bitcoiner’s own portfolio.</p><p>Then there was proof of work. It’s power intensive and comparatively slow, even if far superior to bank technologies like SWIFT in terms of speed and guaranteed settlement. Even if the “green” argument was just fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD), why stick with proof of work when other tech had proven far faster and more efficient, making it much more viable for payments systems?</p><p>Today, at last, after everything that’s happened over the past three years, I finally get it.</p><p>“Don’t trust, verify.”</p><p>The whole Bitcoiner philosophy comes down to those three words. Trust has always been abused, even if only by a small minority. But all it takes is a minority of people abusing and misusing your trust to cause you, and everyone else who trusts them, grave harm. So don’t trust, verify.</p><p>How does this relate to Bitcoiner’s referring to all other cryptos as “shitcoins” and dismissing them outright? It’s simple. The entire fiat currency system is a Ponzi scheme. Fiat is “money by decree” — it’s not backed by any real asset and only has value because the government says it does. Governments use fiat to rob citizens by printing money without citizens’ consent. This is, in effect, a tax that has not been approved by or voted on by the people. It’s theft.</p><p>For example, prior to fiat, governments would need actual hard currency (usually gold) to fund the wars they wanted to fight. If they didn’t have the money, they couldn’t fight the wars without raising taxes, which is never a popular proposition. With fiat, however, the government can print as much money as they want, pulling the money to fund their self-serving conflicts out of the pockets of the people who use that fiat currency: no permission necessary, and without most people realizing what’s happening.</p><p>Fiat also keeps people on a perpetual hamster wheel through inflation. If you know the money you have in the bank will be worth less next year than it is this year, you must keep trying harder to earn more money, year after year, just to keep your head above water. This keeps the majority of people as perpetual wage slaves, never quite able to get ahead, at least not enough to stop and enjoy their lives.</p><p>Without inflation you could live below your means, save your extra money, and trust in the deflationary effects of technology to make your money stretch much further once you decide to retire. After all, with technology constantly making supply chains more efficient through improvements in transportation and automation, everything <em>should </em>cost <em>less</em> over time, not more. And yet prices keep rising. Why? Inflation.</p><p>So what does fiat have to do with cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin? All other cryptocurrencies are working <em>within</em> the current financial system trying to improve it, make it more efficient, provide better privacy, etc. This has some positive effects. For instance, stablecoins give access to the U.S. dollar to people in countries whose currency is undergoing severe inflation and whose banking systems are corrupt or unreliable. <em>But it still requires the fiat Ponzi to function.</em></p><p>You can talk until you’re blue in the face about how a highly-efficient cryptocurrency could give access to the financial system to billions of unbanked individuals, improving their lives by helping them escape their own inflationary currencies and bypassing their corrupt governments. But it doesn’t matter because you’re only providing those people access <em>to another fiat currency, </em>and fiat is murdering the free market. You can talk about how issuing tokens give small businesses the ability to raise money without having to pay billions to big banks to IPO. Doesn’t matter. You’re still working <em>within the fiat system</em>, and the fiat system is the fundamental root of all the problems to begin with.</p><p>To the Bitcoiner, cryptocurrencies are decks being built onto the Titanic as it sinks, while Bitcoin is the life raft people need to get on to save themselves. The tech of some cryptos might be great, but it only delays the inevitable demise of the sinking ship. Maxis believe that bitcoin is destined to replace fiat, not shore it up, returning sound money to the world. As they often say, “Bitcoin fixes this.”</p><p>For Bitcoiners, this isn’t just about money. It’s a guidestone that influences every aspect of life. It’s a belief system, though I’ll stop short of calling it a religion, since people of every conceivable religion also subscribe to its tenants. To those who aren’t Bitcoiners, maxis can appear to be in some kind of cult, but it’s not a cult. Quite the opposite, in fact.</p><p>Bitcoiners are people who, like me, have <em>escaped</em> a cult: the cult of fiat. Once they were like everyone else, brainwashed into believing that the government could be trusted with control over the money printer, that the Fed was capable of central planning of the economy, and that inflation was necessary for economic growth.</p><p>Plato’s famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave">Allegory of the Cage</a><em> </em>describes a group of people who have lived chained to the wall of a cave for their entire lives. All they can see is a blank wall and the shadows cast upon it from a fire burning behind them. They give the shadows names, believing them to be actual representations of the real world. One of the prisoners escapes from the cave and, having experienced the actual world, realizes that the shadows are not true representations of it. He returns to the cave to try and convince the other prisoners, but they don’t believe him because the shadows are all they have ever known. Bitcoiners are the escaped man.</p><p>The Bitcoiner tribe can be rowdy and crass and harsh, but you must consider what they’re out to achieve and what they’re up against. Their endeavor is not for the faint of heart. It’s a real David and Goliath moment. The Bitcoiner stands, golden coins in hand, looking the giant in the eye with a defiance that onlookers usually perceive as madness. Maybe it is madness, but without that dauntless quality, Bitcoin wouldn’t have come as far as it has. And I, for one, will cheer them on as the giant collapses.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Jonathan Leger.

Many newcomers to bitcoin mining will consult the profitability of an ASIC on a mining calculator, expecting that that profitability will stay relatively the same going forwards in the future. This is a misunderstanding as the profitability of any given machine, trends downwards over time. Increases in difficulty should be understood before purchasing an ASIC. </p><p> A simple way of understanding this is comparing an ASIC to any other electronic device. The longer the device is in use, the less relevant it is as new software requires more computing power. If you were to use an iPhone from 6 years ago, its performance would be incredibly frustrating. The older the phone gets, the less utility it has. </p><p>A very similar process happens in mining. When you are mining, you are competing with all the other miners around the world. As more miners turn on machines, it gets more difficult to compete. Having newer and more efficient hardware makes you more competitive, but that hardware is quickly moving towards being less competitive.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Bitcoin Difficulty Adjustment</h2><p> Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment is something built into the Bitcoin protocol in order to ensure Bitcoin has a stable and predictable supply schedule. If there was no difficulty adjustment, all of the bitcoin likely would’ve already been mined and there would be little to no incentive for miners to secure the network. When more miners join the network, blocks are minted at a faster rate as a result of a hash rate increase. The network responds by adjusting the difficulty higher to ensure that blocks come in around 10 minutes. For miners, increased difficulty adjustments mean less profits. For the average Bitcoin user, it means more security for the monetary network they are using. </p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>Picture taken from insights.braiins.com</em><br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>Downwards difficulty adjustments mean that miners will be earning more profits as these are a result of hash rate coming offline. The famous example of this happening is when China banned Bitcoin mining and a large portion of the network hash rate went offline for a period of time. Downwards difficulty adjustments are not the norm as mining hardware is always getting more powerful and efficient. Even if there was a stagnation of machine efficiency and hash rate increases, more machines would be produced and plugged in. The Bitcoin mining industry is incredibly immature and there is a tremendous amount of room for growth going forward which means that hash rate is almost certainly going to increase at rapid rates going forward over the long run.</p><p>We are currently seeing a bull market in energy prices with a suppressed bitcoin price which means that miners are experiencing quite a bit of pain. There is a possibility that there could be a series of downward difficulty adjustments as hash rate comes offline, but this is not something that miners should put in their models. It is important to prepare for the worst case scenario which is what we have seen the last few months. </p><h2>New Machines Coming To Market</h2><p> Every couple years, ASIC manufacturers release a new machine with significant improvements in regards to hash rate and efficiency. Recent network hash rate increases are largely due to seeing Bitmain’s S19 XP and S19 Hydro being deployed. Another factor is that a large amount of older generation machines are finally being turned on as a result of infrastructure being built out.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MzA4ODIzMjA3Mzg4ODQ5/image2.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>This chart is an oversimplification just for visual purposes.<br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>When you buy an ASIC, its value will be constantly depreciating as both network hash rate increases and new machines come onto the market. The value will fluctuate depending on the Bitcoin price, but it’s safe to say the machine loses value over time. That is why it is incredibly important to have the machine running when you have it. Buying it to plug in later means you are throwing money away unnecessarily.</p><h2>Bitcoin Purchasing Power</h2><p> Bitcoin mining is like taking a long position on Bitcoin, but with a lot of headaches and execution risk. If done correctly, it can be incredibly lucrative. If done incorrectly, it is a fantastic way to get poor quickly. The income the machine makes is fairly consistent, but the purchasing power of that income varies tremendously. Power prices may be stable priced in dollars, but are very volatile when priced in the income you are making from that machine. A S19j Pro may make 38,000-40,000 sats a day in income, but if you are mining on $0.10 a kWh, your power costs will be 41,263 sats with bitcoin trading at $17,461. </p><p>This is why it is incredibly important to try and get the lowest possible electricity prices in order to be profitable and ROI on your equipment. Finding cheap electricity is neither straightforward nor easy. Oftentimes there are hidden fees or complications that cause miners to fail. All miners regardless of how big or small are subjected to these economics of variable purchasing power, network hash rate increases, and machine devaluation/obsoletion. </p><h2>ASIC Pricing</h2><p> There is a base cost for the manufacturers to produce new equipment. We are currently at or reaching that floor for new equipment coming from the manufacturer. As a result, they are either slowing down or halting production of certain models. Individuals choose to pay a premium for new equipment because they come with warranties. Used equipment on the other hand generally does not come with a warranty, and also uncertainty of conditions that it was run in. For this reason, used equipment is often sold at a substantial discount. </p><p>ASIC pricing is variable just like every other industry. Supply and demand are the major factors that determine price. Individuals buying ASICs have a million different reasons why they may want to purchase at a certain time, but Bitcoin price and difficulty are major influences. If the purchasing power of the income being earned by an ASIC is low, there will be less demand and the ASIC price will fall. Bear markets are generally good times to buy because the demand drops significantly. </p><h2>Moore’s Law And The Future Of ASICs</h2><blockquote><p><em>“Moore’s Law: an axiom of microprocessor development usually holding that processing power doubles about every 18 months especially relative to cost or size.”&nbsp;</em>— <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Moore%27s%20law">Merriam Webster</a></p></blockquote><p>We are coming to the end of the computer chip revolution as chip makers are pushing the boundaries of physics. In no way is this the end of massive increases in Bitcoin’s network hash rate. The mining industry is very rough around the edges in regards to very basic principles such as heat dissipation, software implementations, and relationships with energy producers. Computer chips may have slower leaps as far as increases in computing power, but we have barely scratched the surface in regards to other technological leaps forward that will ultimately lead to more power being consumed and more computing power expended in order to secure the Bitcoin Network.</p><p> As bitcoin becomes more widely adopted, and its value understood, the demand for mining is bound to increase globally. The result will naturally be an increase in Network hash rate. As a miner, this is a painful reality as it means the profitability of my hardware will decrease over time.

As of December of 2021, Canada <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/mining_map">had 6.48% of global hash rate</a> according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index.</p><p>A <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/in-canada-bitcoin-mining-is-thriving">Bitcoin Magazine article</a> from 2021 details the various regulatory challenges in Canada, as well as the successful operations that continue to prosper in the country despite these. Recently, the Manitoba province’s government set an <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/mining_map">18-month moratorium</a> on new mining operations. In the past, Canada has <a href="https://montrealgazette.com/business/local-business/crypto-craze-has-hydro-quebec-ceos-phone-ringing-off-the-hook">experienced large influxes</a> of miners seeking to take advantage of the abundance of power there. <br><br>According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/quebec-shuns-bitcoin-mining-in-bid-to-conserve-power-11670514921?mod=business_minor_pos13">a report</a> by the Wall Street Journal, “Hydro-Québec charges the lowest rates for industrial power in North America, with average prices as of April 1 of 3.93 cents per kilowatt-hour… The average cost in North America is 8.22 cents, according to Hydro-Québec.”<br></p><p>The request is up for approval by Québec’s energy regulator, Régie de l’énergie du Québec, which is believed to be completed within the next few months. The move would not restrict power to existing firms within the province, but could impact future development and investment into the region. </p><p>Bitcoin miners’ ability to move their equipment does make it possible for operations to shift out of the region to more friendly locations such as <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/texas-is-the-bitcoin-mining-capital">Texas</a> or <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/wyoming-aiming-5-bitcoin-mining-hashrate">Wyoming</a>, which could become prime examples of the power of favorable regulation.

The proposed eighth Directive on Administrative Cooperation was previously reported on by <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/30/eu-crypto-nft-providers-must-report-tax-details-under-leaked-eu-plan/">CoinDesk</a>, and could have wide-reaching implications including forcing non-EU based companies to have to register with tax entities there. <br></p><p>In a statement, the EU Commissioner for tax, Paolo Gentiloni <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/08/eu-to-make-crypto-companies-report-tax-details-to-authorities/">said</a>, “Anonymity means that many crypto-asset users making significant profits fall under the radar of national tax authorities. This is not acceptable.”</p><p>The enforcement of the measures was not made entirely clear, as the cryptocurrency industry has various entities and actors residing in various jurisdictions, including some who claim no base of operations. Beyond that, there should be concern for the honeypot of user data that registering user holdings creates. Often, holdings on centralized exchanges (<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sam-bankman-fried-and-ftx-largest-crypto-fraud-history">which are dangerous in their own right</a>) are paired with sensitive identifying information which could potentially be used by criminals to attach people to their holdings. </p><p>There have been various cases of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/ledger-hack-victim-scam-details">documented</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/20/revolut-cyberattack-thousands-exposed/">data</a> <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/11/8/data-security-incident">leaks</a> in and outside of the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/celsius-user-data-dump-crypto-tracing-scammers/">cryptocurrency industry</a>: and these are simply the ones that surface. Forcing companies to provide European tax authorities — including companies based outside of the EU — once again forces firms to collect copious amounts of data exposing user holdings, and then transmit them to tax authorities in Europe whom they must trust to keep them safe. <br></p><p>Concerns have also been voiced that this could have ramifications for the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) which is the “first all-encompassing effort to tackle cryptoassets and brings rules contained in Mifid, Market Abuse and the Prospectus Regulation to the cryptoasset industry,” according to the <a href="https://www.iflr.com/article/2a647jipe3beilngwqlmo/primer-markets-in-crypto-assets-regulation-mica">International Financial Law Review</a> (IFLR).</p><p>The European Crypto Initiative made a statement indicating <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/08/eu-to-make-crypto-companies-report-tax-details-to-authorities/">it was</a> “concerned that it would apply to a far wider range of obliged entities and individuals” than MiCA.</p><p>The EU has said it believes the move could generate as much as $2.5 billion (2.4 billion euros) through the introduction of the directive.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNjA3MTM2MjI2NzQ4MTUz/20220926_good-gdog-proof-collaborative-custody-multisig-by-will-schoellkopf_.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Future Of Venture Capital Is Investing In Bitcoin-Only Companies]]></title><description><![CDATA[Among the plethora of investors in the crypto world, there is a niche that shares common visions and strategies.

They are the Bitcoin-only venture capitalists.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>“The smartest people in the world are working on Bitcoin, they’re not working on some other project,” <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeJarmuz">Mike Jarmuz</a> told Bitcoin Magazine. “They’re not working on altcoins or selling real estate in a metaverse fantasy land. Your medical records are not going onto some other thing masquerading as a blockchain. We view these as ridiculous and completely uninvestable ideas.”</p><p>Jarmuz is the the managing partner of an investment fund called <a href="https://ltng.ventures/">Lightning Ventures</a>, whose peculiarity is that it focuses its investments solely on companies that develop products and services on bitcoin and no other cryptocurrency. </p><p>“The 21st century digital economy is being built on Bitcoin-native companies,” added <a href="https://twitter.com/mcshane_writes">McShane</a>, a venture partner at Lightning Ventures and employee at BTC Inc, which operates Bitcoin Magazine. “We invest in best-in-class Bitcoin founders who deliver focused, and differentiated, value to humanity. We are determined to return a multiple to our investors through Bitcoin companies that strive to make a positive impact on the world.”</p><p>And Lightning Ventures is not alone, but rather part of a growing niche, that of Bitcoin-only venture capitalists (VCs).</p><h2>The Fall Of Crypto Hedge Funds</h2><p>Last year, at the height of the bull market, it was the crypto VCs who dominated the headlines, pouring over <a href="https://docsend.com/view/pwgbawfj6sc8q7de">$33 billion</a> into crypto/blockchain/Web3 projects and startups. This golden age was very short-lived, as this year's market crash also claimed illustrious victims in the world of hedge funds: one in particular was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/06/27/three-arrows-capital-default-crypto-voyager-digital/">Three Arrows Capital</a>, which defaulted last June after being unable to repay a loan of over $670 million.</p><p>Such sudden gains and collapses are not very common for a venture capital fund, <a href="https://seraf-investor.com/compass/article/charting-course-building-winning-vc-fund-strategy-part-ii#:~:text=Most%20venture%20funds%20have%20a,but%20that%20is%20fairly%20standard.">which traditionally approaches investments with a 10-year time horizon</a>, not horizons of just a few months. When, however, the bet is in projects that issue tokens out of thin air, the moment these appreciate on the wave of enthusiasm, the temptation to turn investment activity into speculation is very strong — with the risk of getting burnt when the markets reverse their course.</p><h2>Low Time Preference</h2><p>The crypto hedge funds demonstrated the mentality of the short term — the opposite of that shared by VCs who believe in Bitcoin's long-term success, investing in those companies that, without issuing useless tokens invented on the spot, try to develop services that bring real value to the market.</p><p>“Early-stage Bitcoin startup or angel investing is definitely a low time preference choice,” Jarmuz specified. “Many ‘crypto’ projects choose to issue unlicensed, unregistered securities, in exchange for equity but you don’t end up with quality investors. What happens is that investors dump those ‘tokens’ or equity the minute they can. With our Lightning Ventures’ thesis and Bitcoin-only investments, we are committed for the life of the company and are not concerned with selling ‘tokens’ the moment we can. When we invest in a company, we back it and support it throughout its entire life cycle.”</p><p>On this same page is <a href="https://twitter.com/mecee">Christopher Calicott</a> of <a href="https://tvp.fund/">Trammell Venture Partners</a>, or TVP, who said that the idea of funding projects that attract customers by generating tokens is not only symptomatic of a short-term view, but is also inconsistent with the typical incentives of a venture capital fund.</p><p>“Investing in these tokens, said Calicott, is a fundamental misalignment of interest to really grow the company and achieve maximum success. Investors actually become speculators trying to get out of their position with the best timing.”</p><p>Moreover, while there used to be a feeling that it was difficult to build on Bitcoin — and so many moved to other cryptocurrencies — today things are changing:</p><p>"Bitcoin is becoming a platform and entrepreneurs are starting to realize that,” Calicott continued. “There’s blood in the streets being brought by the crypto industry, but despite this, there are now more entrepreneurs willing to build services on Bitcoin than ever before. We see ourselves as long-term investors. We are trying to make smart bets on companies that we think can usher a whole new global monetary order on a solid standard: Bitcoin.”</p><h2>Overcoming An Obsolete System</h2><p>A new monetary standard, a global store of value, a peer-to-peer payment method that renders the big traditional players obsolete. Whichever way you look at it, Bitcoin offers a vision of the future that completely overturns the paradigms to which we are accustomed: the idea of inflation necessary for growth, that of macro-economic control by states and central banks, that of having to entrust the management of savings and digital payments to intermediaries.</p><p>Is the old way of seeing things compatible with the Bitcoin future? According to <a href="https://egodeath.capital/intro#:~:text=For%20a%20new%20system%20to,a%20false%20sense%20of%20loss.">Ego Death Capital’s website</a>, it is not. </p><p>“For a new system to thrive, to bring abundance, opportunity and accessibility, the old system must self-destruct,” per the website for the VC firm, whose CEO is <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBooth">Jeff Booth</a>, author of “The Price of Tomorrow.” “For this to happen, it will require a phase of ‘self-surrender and transition.’”</p><p>Confirming the view are <a href="https://twitter.com/nico_lechuga">Nico Lechuga</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/1andipitt">Andi Pitt</a>, both general partners at Ego Death.</p><p>"The traditional system is already self destructing," they explained. “Banking systems fail billions of people around the world — it is very evident in emerging markets but even in Western countries. Meanwhile, the Visa and Mastercard duopoly holds back innovation and opportunity so as competition arises — including through the Lightning Network, providing very fast and low-cost transactions — they are already in the process of self-destructing.”</p><p>The Lightning Network is also seen as a payments gamechanger for <a href="https://twitter.com/olegmikh1">Oleg Mikhalsky</a> of <a href="https://fulgur.ventures/">Fulgur Ventures</a>, because, as he said, “almost-instant settlement with very limited counterparty risk is a feature of Lightning that is well positioned to reduce traditional payment overheads and lower counterparty risk existing in fiat rails.”</p><p>"For the digital economy to grow,” added Mikhalsky, “we need a native digital currency that has two features: velocity and the ability to make micro-transactions. We believe Bitcoin and Lightning will become the global monetary and payment standards. Some aspects of the Lightning Network adoption spectrum are yet to be explored: we see some adoption in video games, digital content monetisation, but there are other use cases such as machine-to-machine payments and micro-transactions for energy."</p><h2>More And More Bitcoin-Only Startups</h2><p>Contrary to what one might think, in a year when the market collapsed dramatically, the world of Bitcoin-only startups has experienced very indicative growth. As confirmed by all VCs surveyed for this article, the number of companies focused exclusively on Bitcoin has grown significantly over the past year. It is plausible to think that when the Pandora's box of the crypto world was discovered, at that point, entrepreneurs realized that it was wiser to focus on the one technology whose fundamentals have never stopped strengthening since the beginning.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/julian_liniger">Julian Liniger</a>, CEO of <a href="https://relai.app/">Relai</a> — a Swiss startup which allows users to buy and sell bitcoin in a non-custodial way — emphasized that future growth.</p><p>“In the long run, it is less risky to invest in Bitcoin-only startups than in crypto startups: investors see Bitcoin-focused companies as more profitable and a more sustainable business model,” he explained. “With Bitcoin-only VCs, we are 100% aligned. They see the future in 10 years, they understand where we are going, they understand that all the experiments that are happening on other blockchains will end up on Bitcoin.”</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Federico Rivi.

Here’s how it works and what you can do to get a bitcoin-backed loan.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>Loaning your bitcoin invites an element of risk that you may not need to incur. You should not make any financial, investment, trading or otherwise decision solely based on the information presented in this article.</em></p><p>Bitcoin lending will be the future of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-does-not-need-defi-but-defi-needs-bitcoin">decentralized finance (DeFi)</a>. Many DeFi projects are currently sitting on Ethereum due to its built-in support for smart contracts and network effects, but this is changing rapidly.</p><p>Smart contract platforms are being built on Bitcoin to create a new ecosystem that offers the highest protocol security and the sound money network only an established asset like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-bitcoin">bitcoin</a> can offer.</p><p>A bitcoin-backed loan is a type of secured loan that lets you easily borrow cash using your bitcoin as collateral. Due to their rising popularity, BTC loans facilitate the transition to decentralized finance based on a bitcoin standard, where intermediaries have little to no space and the protocol’s solid foundations ensure security. A new financial system opens up plenty of opportunities for everyone, with no censorship allowed.</p><p>Bitcoin’s total value locked (TVL) is <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Bitcoin">$108 million</a> as of October 2022, while Ethereum’s sits at $30.37 billion. Even though the potential of unlocking DeFi on Bitcoin is evidently enormous, there are reasons behind the extreme gap in such comparison.</p><p>One of them is Bitcoin’s true decentralization which prevents any central planning or venture capital funds from interfering with its prodigious independent development. While this is the best thing for Bitcoin, it also means that money for development is limited, making it slower than Ethereum, which is backed by big corporate money.</p><p>Furthermore, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-semantics-of-the-bitcoin-layers">Bitcoin’s base layer</a> is excellent for money transaction settlement, but smart contracts, which are the fundamental components of DeFi, need to be built on upper layers like the Internet is built upon the base TCP/IP layer.</p><p>This article will explore the opportunities that Bitcoin lending could open in DeFi, how it works and where you can look for the current services offered. </p><h2>DeFi vs. CeFi</h2><p>Centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) are fast-growing branches of the cryptocurrency space that will likely shape the future of financial services.</p><p>Not to be confused with TradFi (traditional finance), which is the customary way of borrowing and lending money through the banking system, CeFi is still provided by an intermediary while using cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to offer cheaper, faster and more secure financial products. People must still place trust in an intermediary; in this case, the centralized platform. </p><p>DeFi, on the other hand, is peer-to-peer financial services and lending where trust is placed in the protocol and smart contracts without an intermediary (other than, perhaps, an escrow service). This is important because third-party gatekeepers can make transactions inefficient while users lose control over their own money. </p><p><em>"To build DeFi on a centralized protocol, or one that is a protocol managed by rulers, is inherently broken from the start" </em>- @AlyseKilleen</p><p>Within the two branches, there are two main types of bitcoin lending platforms: decentralized and centralized lenders. They both offer high-interest rates for lenders and lower-than-usual rates for borrowers; they typically require borrowers to deposit bitcoin as collateral to access a loan.</p><p>However, there are several differences amongst lenders so borrowers should consider carefully when choosing the most suitable platform.</p><p>In particular, DeFi provides more privacy than centralized finance platforms, which usually require some form of verification to allow users to access their services. DeFi platforms work directly through smart contracts without having to trust a central authority.</p><p>User experience and custody are on the side of CeFi, which usually provides an efficient customer interface while taking custody of the users’ bitcoin. With DeFi, users must take responsibility and complete control over their bitcoin while facing the risk of technology hurdles.</p><h2>Why Get A Bitcoin-Backed Loan?</h2><p>Getting a bitcoin-backed loan will help you avoid selling bitcoin — and you’re actually putting your bitcoin to work. HODLing bitcoin is already the best thing you can do if you’re after sound money; however, as a lender or a borrower, you can give bitcoin an additional purpose with the help of DeFi loans. </p><p>Just like banks lend you money in exchange for cash, bitcoin DeFi loans allow you to borrow money from other bitcoin peers in exchange for fiat or stablecoins. However, you will only be able to access a bank loan or lend your money if you have an excellent credit score and provide additional guarantees. With bitcoin DeFi loans, everyone can become a lender or a borrower.</p><p>As a borrower, you won’t be giving up your bitcoin. Instead, you’ll be paying reasonable loan interest rates in order to purchase products and services using fiat — all while usually paying fewer taxes, depending on your jurisdiction. As a lender, you will earn interest on the bitcoin you’re lending. </p><p>In traditional finance, trust between borrowers and lenders must be necessarily ensured by financial institutions that face enormous risks in offering their money to customers. This is why banks and institutions must take strict verification procedures to minimize the chance of losing their money. </p><p>By lending cash in exchange for bitcoin as collateral, businesses do not need any other verification; they will hold the cryptocurrency until the loan is paid back entirely, either in installments or in one lump sum at the end of the term.</p><p>This type of loan will also satisfy the borrower who enjoys a service that is permissionless and is mostly a private matter. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PA5TvqD4bI">emerging countries</a>, ordinary people can’t easily get traditional loans from banks. With bitcoin ownership, they finally have the chance to use it as collateral for loans, which is a game changer for billions of people worldwide.</p><p>We’ll go into more detail in the “How Does It Work” section. However, what has been discussed up to here should already give you an idea of the impact bitcoin lending can have in the financial world.</p><h2>Risks</h2><p>Bitcoin lending is rapidly growing in the world of cryptocurrency finance. However, you should keep in mind that the industry is still in its infancy; there are risks associated with the early days of the technology, coupled with financial hazards.</p><p>Here are a few of the drawbacks to consider before using bitcoin as collateral to take up a loan:</p><ul><li>Collateral loss through bugs in the smart contract or peg.</li><li>Collateral loss through hacks, especially in CeFi platforms.</li><li>Collateral loss if capital dips below the threshold in the event of a bitcoin price drop. For example, in the case of a margin call, borrowers could lose all or part of their capital if they don’t top up the collateral with more bitcoin.</li><li>Some of DeFi lenders are decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), so if something happens and you lose your bitcoin, there is no corporation or entity you can sue.</li><li>Rehypothecation and eventual insolvency by the platform.</li></ul><h2>How Does It Work</h2><p>The Bitcoin base layer (also referred to as L1 or Layer 1) is the most immutable, trustworthy, robust and decentralized of all blockchains. This is achieved via a tradeoff: the base layer’s capabilities are very narrow by design and can only support a limited number of basic transactions. Bitcoin is unscalable if you’re limited to the base layer. However, its solid foundational structure is perfect for building upon, enabling development on top of its network to build DeFi and smart contract platforms. </p><p>Bitcoin was designed to scale in layers; even Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.msg28696#msg28696">suggested the possibility</a> in 2010, unlocking a new surge of innovation that can massively expand the Bitcoin economy.</p><p>Here we look to the future of Bitcoin and how this ecosystem will be built. We’ll highlight some projects that are bringing new use cases to Bitcoin.</p><p>The Bitcoin base layer was built to support settlements, not payments. So, for instance, payments are faster and cheaper on the Layer 2 Lightning Network or Liquid sidechain, but remain secure as they settle on Bitcoin’s base layer. Similarly, Layer 2 side chains like RSK or Stacks — they’ll be discussed later — provide functioning smart contract capability that settles on the base layer without changing it.</p><p>To sum up, the base layer is the foundation that ensures decentralization, censorship resistance and a sound environment, while experimentation occurs on the upper layers — along with increased risks.</p><h3>Improving Bitcoin Layers</h3><p>Major scripts’ improvements on the Bitcoin mainchain, like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/pros-cons-and-possibilities-for-bitcoin-discreet-log-contracts">DLCs (Discreet Log Contracts)</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/understanding-taproot-in-a-simple-way">Taproot</a> that allow more efficient and faster transaction verification, inevitably bring benefits to the interaction between the base layer and the multiple Bitcoin layers, too.</p><h3>How It Works For Individuals</h3><p>It would be best if you did your research to find the most suitable Bitcoin DeFi lending platform. You are giving your money to a centralized entity or an escrow that will hold it until you pay back the loan, so you should ensure your money is safe.</p><p>The lending or borrowing process is usually straightforward, supported by user-friendly interfaces and little to no verification required. Strategies exist to help you save money or reduce fees and the risks of being liquidated. For example, you should try to keep the total portfolio loan-to-value (LTV) ratio at 20% to better withstand a possible 50% drawdown in BTC price.</p><p>Your primary strategy should <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/what-i-did-to-fix-my-bitcoin-loan">work around the LTV element</a> because you risk getting liquidated if the loan’s bitcoin collateral falls in value, making it a margin loan unless you keep topping up with additional bitcoin. Exploring such strategies will better prepare you for facing loan challenges.</p><p>Read More &gt;&gt; <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/what-i-did-to-fix-my-bitcoin-loan">Learning From Bitcoin Loan Strategies</a></p><h2>Where To Get A Bitcoin-Backed Loan</h2><p>Bitcoin’s native Script language is technically capable of supporting some limited smart contracts; however, it is cumbersome and restricted to prioritize security over programmability. Hence, side chain solutions that settle on the main chain are preferred methods to manage smart contracts and enable DeFi services like borrowing or lending against bitcoin.</p><p>Here are some popular and efficient solutions to choose from if you are considering taking out a bitcoin-backed loan.</p><h3>Sovryn Zero</h3><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NDY1ODE1ODI3OTcz/sovryn-2.png" height="620" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p><a href="https://www.sovryn.app/">Sovryn</a> is a decentralized trading and lending protocol built on <a href="https://www.rsk.co/">RSK (Rootstock)</a>. RSK is a Bitcoin sidechain that is simultaneously merge-mined with Bitcoin for enhanced security. It has a native currency called RBTC, which is meant to be a 1:1 BTC peg. </p><p>BTC conversion to RBTC is required to access <a href="https://www.sovryn.app/zero">Zero</a>, a decentralized protocol that enables customers to borrow ZUSD — a USD-pegged stablecoin — with zero interest using BTC as collateral. People must still place trust in an intermediary, in this case, the centralized platform.</p><p>The Sovryn loan’s minimum collateral ratio (collateral/debt) is 110%, which means that you must keep your loan collateralized above 110% at all times, without exception. BTC must first be converted into RBTC and then transferred to the Rootstock bitcoin sidechain to be used as collateral. Sovryn claims that the Zero protocol is non-custodial, governed by stakers according to the <a href="https://www.rsk.co/solutions/sovryn">Bitocracy protocol rules</a>, and operated by smart contracts that users interact with in a KYC-free manner.</p><h3>FUJI Finance</h3><figure>

    </figure><p><a href="https://fuji.money/">Fuji</a> is a <a href="https://liquid.net/#:~:text=The%20Liquid%20Network%20is%20a,top%20of%20the%20Bitcoin%20timechain.">Liquid</a>-based non-custodial protocol that enables the borrowing of synthetic assets (tokens that are digital representations of derivatives), such as stablecoins and synthetic stocks or bonds, against over-collateralized bitcoin positions. </p><p>Anyone can use Fuji to borrow any asset offered on the platform after locking L-BTC (Liquid Bitcoin) as collateral in a smart contract. The smart contract creates 1 fUSD (Fuji USD) for each $1.50 worth of BTC locked. More collateral automatically decreases the risk of liquidation.</p><p>The borrower can always get the entire collateral back once the debt is settled. Repayment occurs upon burning the same amount of Fuji assets issued for this collateral, plus a small 0.25% payout for the redemption of the locked collateral.</p><h3>Ledn</h3><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NTA5ODM5MjQyNzU3/ledn.png" height="620" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p><a href="https://www.ledn.io/">Ledn</a> is a Canadian cryptocurrency platform that provides BTC and USDC savings accounts to its customers, who can earn interest on these assets or borrow against them. Ledn provides Proof-of-Reserve attestations overseen by an independent certified public accountant.</p><p>Clients’ privacy is preserved with a unique anonymized ID for every client reference number; the individual's identity is never revealed to the independent accounting firm. Moreover, Ledn uses <a href="https://www.bitgo.com/">BitGo</a> for cold storage of clients' deposited bitcoin and doesn’t rehypothecate their collateral assets (i.e. doesn’t lend them to other parties) to earn extra revenue.</p><p>Ledn bitcoin-backed loans require an initial LTV ratio of 50%. When it reaches 70%, Ledn starts warning the borrower that it will liquidate enough BTC to repay part of the debt. If the LTV hits 80%, then all of the collateral Bitcoin will be liquidated unless more collateral is added to the loan.</p><p>Ledn only requires one payment at the end when the client wants to close the loan and avoids monthly interest payments, which is more convenient for the borrower.</p><p>The company has also started rolling out bitcoin mortgages in Ontario, Canada, allowing borrowers to use BTC as collateral in addition to the property's value to secure the loan. Pairing it with the property's value, the mortgage becomes overcollateralized, meaning that the collateral backing a loan is worth more than the loan itself, drastically reducing the chances that a loan is liquidated.</p><h3>HODL HODL</h3><figure>

The platform already offers bitcoin-backed loans, but support by better liquidity providers such as banks should be an added benefit for Hodl Hodl and its customers.</p><p>Their current offer includes non-custodial P2P bitcoin-backed loans that both lenders and borrowers can benefit from anonymously, and by setting their own terms, including loan duration, interest rates, and currencies used. </p><p>The company creates a multisig escrow contract where the borrower’s bitcoin is held. The lender transfers the loan amount to the borrower according to the contract. When the loan is repaid, the lender releases the bitcoin back to the borrower's wallet.</p><h3>Unchained Capital</h3><figure>

Only bitcoin is accepted as collateral on Verify21, the platform has no token and the platform does not rehypothecate client bitcoin or lend out client collateral to other borrowers. Bitcoin collateral is stored with institutional custody partners. Verify21 undertakes a bi-annual proof of reserve audit.</p><p>Initial loans are offered for a one year term at an interest rate of 10%, with an origination fee of 2.5%. This brings the total APR on the loans to 12.5%*</p><p>The company will notify borrowers that they need to top up their collateral when the bitcoin price falls drastically and approaches a risky LTV ratio. If the bitcoin price continues to fall and no collateral top-up has occurred, Verity21 will be forced to liquidate client loan collateral, settle the loan and return any excess loan collateral to the client"</p><h3>Atomic Finance</h3><figure>

    </figure><p>An interesting project that is undergoing its Beta phase is <a href="https://atomic.finance/">Atomic Finance</a>, a bitcoin-only financial services business that wants to provide sound finance to bitcoin holders.</p><p>They are currently testing a way to earn a yield on bitcoin without giving up custody, using Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) that preserve users’ privacy and self-sovereignty. Such smart contract protocols do not need the creation or use of a native token different from bitcoin to unlock DeFi capabilities on the blockchain.</p><p>A DLC consists of two parties sending funds to a multisig address in order to bet on a particular outcome based on some pre-established condition being met. For example, bitcoin’s price at a certain point in the future. An agreed-upon oracle (a party that bridges smart contracts with off-chain data like the price of bitcoin, in this example) — or oracles — sign a transaction that attests the outcome of the event once the result is known. The DLC participant who bet correctly on that outcome will now be the only one who can claim the funds from the DLC multisig.</p><p>Other companies looking to follow the same model as Atomic Finance are <a href="https://www.dglab.com/">DG Lab</a> and <a href="https://suredbits.com/">SuredBits</a>. They are considered the purest forms of bitcoin finance as they allow DeFi to solely use bitcoin without other native tokens to function.</p><h3>ZEST </h3><figure>

    </figure><p><a href="https://www.zestprotocol.com/">Zest protocol</a> is an on-chain bitcoin capital market that allows clients to borrow cash from liquidity providers (LPs) who join professionally managed lending pools. LPs can earn 4-6% bitcoin yield this way, while borrowers can obtain on-chain bitcoin loans directly against their balance sheets. Zest is exclusive to institutional and corporate borrowers at this stage.</p><p>Strict KYC procedures are applied to borrowers who must be approved following a standard process. </p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Bitcoin’s Layer 2 DeFi lending platforms could shape the future of finance in a way that has never been experienced before. They are less dependent on the banking system and fairer to the participants, with no borders or censorship allowed in a permissionless environment.</p><p>All of this is being built before our eyes on top of the immutable, robust and trusted Bitcoin protocol. It’s opening opportunities that everyone will be able to seize.</p><p>That being said, to engage in DeFi is to relinquish control of your bitcoin. Losing access to your bitcoin permanently is a risk you must be comfortable with. So caution is advised. If you’re willing to take the risk, then let it be with a small portion of your bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0Mjk5NDE5OTEzMzY0OTk3/bitcoin_backed_loans_thumbnail-01.jpg"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NDY1ODE1ODI3OTcz/sovryn-2.png" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NDk2Njg1OTA1NTg1/fuji-finance.png" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NTA5ODM5MjQyNzU3/ledn.png" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NTIwODQ1MDk2NDUz/hodl-hodl.png" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NTI3NTU1OTgzMDI1/unchained-capital.jpg" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NTMzNzI5OTk4NTEz/verify-21.jpg" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NTQ0NDY3NDE2NzUz/atomic-finance.png" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NTUzODYyNjU3NTQx/zest.jpg" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why I Quit Investing In The Fiat Ponzi And Started Saving In Bitcoin]]></title><description><![CDATA[The tired argument that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme is really more applicable to fiat, which makes it impossible for us to retain savings.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/quit-investing-save-in-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/quit-investing-save-in-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Saving]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fiat]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Mickey Koss]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2022 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzNTEyMTIxODA2NDMxNjgz/bitcoin-dollar.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The tired argument that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme is really more applicable to fiat, which makes it impossible for us to retain savings.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Mickey Koss, a West Point graduate with a degree in economics.

The abject lack of intellectual curiosity is astonishing, yet somehow unsurprising given my recent stint in academia:</p><blockquote><p>“<em>The whole thing depends on even more people parting with their savings…</em>”</p></blockquote><p>Is this not true for the stock market? The housing market? The commodities market? By that logic, every market with fluidity of pricing based on supply and demand is a Ponzi scheme. I guess it’s time to go back to the barter economy? Or does the stock market go up on earnings alone without any buyers or demand?</p><p>In fact, It appears to me that prices have been going up faster than earnings since about 1980, even when taking inflation into account:</p><figure>

Can anyone say “<a href="https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/the-cantillion-effect">Cantillon effect</a>”? </p><h2>Fiat Is The Ponzi</h2><p>Crypto is a symptom, not the underlying problem. Years of pent up nihilism unleashed into get-rich-quick pump and dumps as the world seemingly falls apart around us. It’s not hard to see why.

    </figure><p>In what now feels like the blink of an eye, trillions of dollars were created to prevent the system from imploding. Suddenly, the stock market was booming while it seemed like everything was crumbling. I don’t even blame the central bankers. They responded to their incentives and did what they had to, but the effects were dire. If you weren’t already invested, you lost big, making it just that much harder to get your dollars to work for you, to escape inflation and eventually escape the rat race.</p><p>One of the most salient illustrations to me is the below graph. It demonstrates that you should buy a house, any house, it doesn’t matter. Because if you don’t already own a house, if you choose to save instead, you may never actually be able to afford one. It doesn’t take a lot of empathy to understand the financial desperation many are feeling today.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Now, I admit that I’m not a professional statistician, but the charts appear to have some significant correlation. Perhaps CPI inflation may not be the only problem. Perhaps asset price inflation may be forcing savers to become part-time investors. Supply and demand has a price impact on bitcoin, yes, but does the stock market not require new money to support prices as well?</p><h2>Bitcoin Is Savings</h2><blockquote><p>Savings: Money put by the excess of income over expenditures.</p><p>–<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/savings">Merriam-Webster</a></p></blockquote><p>So, why can’t we just save money anymore? The FRED graphs included here tell it all. If you don’t become an investor, you will never keep up. That is, until now. </p><p>Bitcoin is our savings in a world bereft of things worthy of investment. Even if it hits $1 million tomorrow, we’re not selling. What would we even sell it for? To diversify? Into what? A stock market completely dependent upon money printing? An investment property where our tenants won’t have to pay rent following the stroke of a politician’s pen? A shiny rock with “intrinsic value”?</p><p>You see, how could Bitcoin be a Ponzi when Bitcoiners don’t even want your dollars? What you don’t understand is that we’re playing a different game now. What you don’t understand is that we’re trying to build something new; a better future for our children and grandchildren. </p><p>So, if you think bitcoin is doomed to crash and burn then short it. Try to profit off our demise, though I don’t think you will.</p><p>We will just keep buying and holding, continuing to front-run you and Wall Street, and everyone else who refuses to even try to understand Bitcoin. We hold no anger or resentment toward you. We don’t want to eat the rich, or to burn the system down; we just don’t want to play by your rules anymore.

Sam Bankman-Fried, better known by the three letter acronym SBF, burst onto the scene at the peak of the 2017 bubble, founding Alameda Research that September, just four years after graduating from an internship into a full-time position at one of the world’s largest market makers, Jane Street Capital. </p><p>SBF is the son of Stanford Law professor and founder of left-wing super PAC Mind The Gap, Barbara Fried, and Stanford professor Joseph Bankman, an expert on tax shelter laws and government regulation. At the start of 2018, SBF had struck digital gold while taking advantage of the arbitrage opportunity presenting itself between a higher demand for bitcoin in the Asian market, colloquially known as the “kimchi premium”. By the end of the year, and after amassing a considerable fortune from this high-volume bitcoin/dollar spread, he officially moved to Hong Kong, formally founding the derivatives exchange FTX in the following spring. </p><p>The Bitcoin network that SBF rode from rags to riches and back again was partially launched in direct response to the fiat money experiment rearing its ugly head in the subprime mortgage, real estate and eurodollar crises that culminated into what is now known as the Great Financial Crisis of 2007 to 2009. </p><blockquote><p>“??EThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks%”</p><p>  - Satoshi Nakamoto, January 3, 2009</p></blockquote><p>This now infamous inscription in the genesis block made clear the inappropriate fractional reserve banking and predatory loan fiascos of our regulated banking industry was to be put to rest once and for all by this emergent monetary protocol; a completely transparent and decentralized ledger would de-incentivize fraud and prevent obfuscation of illicit activity. A new competitor to the dollar arose from the ashes of the meltdown, and with it, a new standard for financial fairness, complete with predictable issuance, controlled once and for all by the people for the people. Yet in any system made with good intentions, criminals like SBF and his bought-and-paid-for political and media allies manage to find a way to hurt innocent people for the advantage of an unknown few. Like most intriguing stories of fraudulent financial crimes, this one starts in the Bahamas, and ends with a tidal wave of asset liquidations and broken homes. </p><blockquote><p>“If you think the Bahamas has ruined your global tax system, you have a pretty terrible global tax system.”</p><p>  - Steven Dean, Summer 2020 [1]</p></blockquote><h2>Launching The Stablecoin, CBDC Race To The Bottom</h2><p>The Bahamas seems innocuous enough, and yet there is a long history of U.S. tax avoidance, complete with rum-running bootleggers during the prohibition era. Continuing this tradition, the Caribbean banking centers, including the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands, as of August 2022, were the fourth-largest foreign holders of treasury securities, behind only Japan, China and the U.K. Shortly after the time of its founding, FTX was fully taking advantage of the free money era that began with the 2008 crash and was sustained by low-to-zero interest rates brought upon by the Trump administration. </p><p>These rate cuts were started by the Trump-nominated and Biden-renominated Jerome Powell and were further exacerbated by both of their administrations’ COVID responses. An unprecedented pumping of all things dollar denominated occurred, with real estate, stock indexes, bitcoin and a whole bunch of unregistered securities known as altcoins reaching new highs across the board. In June 2019, one month after the founding of FTX, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg announced Libra, a digital currency based on a basket of international currencies; a novel take on stablecoins. This launched the stablecoin and CBDC race in earnest, and coincidentally enough, the Central Bank of the Bahamas became the first such institution to announce its own CBDC, the sand dollar, in October 2020. The sand dollar itself was pegged to the Bahamian dollar, which is itself pegged to the United States dollar, and thus with its government-sanctioned launch, the birth of the first central bank-issued stablecoin dollar came to be on the sandy beaches of SBF’s new home.</p><blockquote><p>"What is the reserve currency of the crypto economy going to be? Right now it's unambiguously the USD. And interestingly it's USD whether or not you're looking at the American crypto economy."</p><p>  - Sam Bankman-Fried, November 5, 2021</p></blockquote><p>While the U.S. government feigned fear of systemic risk at the time, the Chinese government understood the Libra project to be a backdoor dollarization of the G7 currencies rumored to be included in its basket. A Metaverse-held take on the 1985 Plaza Accord, this plan of coordinated central banking would spread USD network users across the internet’s biggest network, sped up by the high velocity available in centralized digital payments and globalized by the borderless nature of the Facebook user base. </p><p>The digital yuan was trialed in April 2021 with great haste in reaction to this development, and by the Winter Olympics 2022, had launched for foreign attendees in Beijing. Not to be outdone by these new-look, same-shit fiat cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin made its own financial history when President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador took to the stage at Bitcoin 2021 to announce the legal tender aspirations of his small but dollarized nation. On March 9, 2022 President Joe Biden signed Executive Order #14067–”Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets”, which included aspirations for mitigation of financial risks in digital asset markets, as well as a clause stating that within 210 days, the attorney general, in consultation with the secretary of the treasury and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, must provide a formal proposal for a government-issued CBDC.</p><p><br>By this point, the Bitcoin financial system had been utterly and properly dollar-ified, with billions of dollars in liquidity of dollar-denominated trading pairs making up the lion’s share of market activity. The same can be said for the Ethereum network, which has seen its compliance-driven perversion by non-native assets taking the wheel from its token Ether, as stablecoin and other dollar derivatives now uphold the majority of economic weight of the system. Both stablecoin giants Circle, issuer of USDC, and Tether came out in support of the merge, further ossifying their stake in the now-nearly-70%-OFAC-compliant blockchain. [2] As of this article’s writing, over 15.5 million ether are currently staked without active withdrawals in the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain, worth nearly $18 billion dollars.[3] Fortunately for Bitcoin, the consensus weight of its system is not manipulated by user stake, and thus the Bitcoin market has been seemingly unaffected – negatively anyway – by this decade-long development. At least until scammer Do Kwon and his ponzi-scheme Luna wreaked havoc on investors at the start of May of 2022.</p><blockquote><p>“[Crypto is] obviously serious…you want to do right by it in the regulatory space.”</p><p>  - President Bill Clinton, April 27, 2022 (Allegedly) [4]</p></blockquote><h2>Contagion Spreads</h2><p>Only a few weeks after SBF hosted a keynote with former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair and President Bill Clinton at the FTX-organized Crypto Bahamas conference, one of the largest-ever over-the-counter bitcoin purchases was announced by the LUNA team. </p><p>Terraform Labs and the non-profit Luna Foundation Guard, two entities headed by Do Kwon, had begun a campaign to purchase bitcoin as a reserve asset in the event that their algorithmic stablecoin, UST, deviated from its $1 peg. Shortly before their collapse, the plan had ballooned to the lofty goal of stacking over $10 billion in the hardest known digital commodity known to man. This purchase was financed with Three Arrows Capital, or 3AC, and was facilitated by cryptocurrency broker Genesis. </p><p>"Terra's remarkable growth has continuously reshaped crypto markets over the last two years”, said Joshua Lim, head of derivatives at Genesis. “Genesis is excited to be a liquidity partner to the Terra ecosystem, connecting it to a broader audience of institutional market participants." </p><p>With the bitcoin reserves of Luna Foundation Guard totalling 80,394 BTC, valued at over $3.1 billion on May 5, 2022, this purchase placed LFG among the top-10 bitcoin holders in the world. [5] But only for a moment, for while it might feel like a lifetime ago, what happened next should look awfully familiar; the peg was attacked, the recently-purchased bitcoin fortune was liquidated, Binance, led by CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), aptly halted all trading on LUNA and UST pairs – with notable exceptions to their own stablecoin BUSD – and Kwon seemingly fled to outside of U.S. jurisdiction to Asia. [6] </p><p>Thus begins our first of many repeatable points of inquiry; where exactly did this bitcoin go? According to an audit released in November 2022, over 33,000 bitcoin were transferred to Binance on May 10, 2022, and sold along with other assets while failing to defend the peg. [7] The same day the nearly $1 billion dollars worth of bitcoin hit Binance’s order books, bitcoin’s USD price broke below $30,000, falling from $40,000 just a week before. </p><p>On May 13, SBF purchased a 7.6% stake in Robinhood, the trading platform that came under scrutiny for halting trading during the GameStop fiasco in early 2021. Bloomberg had reported that around 40% of Robinhood’s revenue came directly from selling customers orders to firms such as Two Sigma Securities, and Citadel Securities. [8] Citadel had been fined $700,000 in July 2020 for front running trades placed by customers orders, and in September of that same year, Robinhood itself was questioned by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for improperly informing clients of selling stock trades to known high-frequency trading firms. </p><p>Previously in December 2020, Robinhood had agreed to pay $65 million to settle charges of repeated misstatements for failure to disclose their receipts of payments from said trading firms. [9] When newly-nominated Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen briefed newly-elected President Joe Biden on this conflict of interest in February 2021, she herself had to acquire an ethics waiver due to having received at least $700,000 in speaker fees from Citadel LLC the year prior. [10] SBF had disclosed this purchase via a filed Schedule 13-D form with the SEC, costing $648.3 billion dollars and giving him 2.8% voting power in their dual-class share structure, under the entity Emergent Fidelity Technologies; a name said to be randomly generated. [11]</p><blockquote><p>“On July 13, Coinbase Exchange will be unifying USD and USDC order books. As part of the unification process, USDC order books will be merged under USD order books to create a better, more seamless trading experience with deeper liquidity for USD and USDC.”</p><p>  - Coinbase Exchange Twitter, June 29, 2022 [12]</p></blockquote><p>Circle, the entity behind the increasingly utilized USDC stablecoin, had previously expanded their international offerings with a subsidiary operation based in Bermuda with an announcement made on July 22, 2019. [13] This entity, filed under the Digital Assets Business Act of 2018 (“DABA”) meant that Circle was the first major stablecoin issuer to receive a Class F (“Full”) DABA license that covered their operation of custody, payment services, exchange, trading and more financial services within the digital asset realm. Circle’s other banking partners, Signet, Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital had made USD loans to Celsius, Voyager, Block Fi, Three Arrows Capital and Alameda Research. By the time this article was written, all had filed for bankruptcy. Two of their other business affiliates, Galaxy Digital and Genesis, have also reported massive losses in the FTX collapse, with rumors of further contagion effects coming. Coinbase, a publicly-traded exchange under the ticker $COIN, announced in its Q2 2022 shareholder letter that nearly one third of total revenue was derived from interest on USD-denominated holdings, including a large USDC position: </p><p>“Interest income was $33 million, up 211% compared to Q1. The increase was primarily driven by our USDC activity, as well as higher interest rates as we generate interest on fiat customer custodial funds… at the end of Q2, we had $6.2 billion in total $USD resources. In addition, we had $428 million of crypto assets.” [14] </p><p>When the letter was released in late August 2022, interest on USDC holdings for 12 months was up to 4.7%, while one-month yields were an even 4%. By November 16, 2022, USDC yields were down to 0% across all time frames.[15]</p><blockquote><p>“1) Binance converts USDC --&gt; BUSD, and we see the change in supplies. Thus begins the Second Great Stablecoin War.”</p><p>  - @SBF, October 23, 2022 [16]</p></blockquote><p>On September 4, 2022, Binance announced that it would be auto-converting all USDC, USDP and TUSD, three major dollar stablecoins, into its self-issued BUSD, effective in just 25 days. [17] This led to continued concerns about Binance’s solvency with the preceding few months, especially July 2022, seeing the largest known outflows of bitcoin in the exchange’s history, eclipsing even March 2020’s black swan bottom. </p><p>On October 11, 216 days after Biden’s executive order with the aforementioned 210-day clause, BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custodian bank with over $43 trillion on the books, and coincidentally, the custodian of Circle’s reserves backing USDC, announced the launch of its digital asset custody program. [18] Involved with more than 20% of the world’s investable assets, the bank founded by the first secretary of the treasury, Alexander Hamilton, was also listed as a partner in the FedNow pilot. [19] </p><p>Despite these institutional developments, a continued bear market weighed heavily on the now-plummeting bitcoin price. Paradoxically, more and more Bitcoin hash rate poured onto the network. These concurrent movements saw Bitcoin’s hash price plummet to an all-time low, spurring a massive liquidation of bitcoin liabilities off mining operators books. On October 26, Core Scientific, then the largest Bitcoin mining operation in the world, filed for bankruptcy with millions of dollars in debt liabilities, thousands of ASICs, and yet in their filings, held only 24 bitcoin total when the circus came to town. [20] Where exactly did all this bitcoin go? On that same day, barely two weeks before the FTX collapse, Binance saw its largest single day outflow, with 71,579 coins, totalling over $1.1 billion in dollar terms. [21] This pushed net outflows to nearly 95,000 coins from the world’s largest exchange since just that July. Again, where exactly did all this bitcoin go? The very next day, October 27, 2022, SBF appeared on The Big Whale and announced future plans for FTX to launch its very own stablecoin. [22] </p><h2>More Sand Than Dollars</h2><blockquote><p>“CIA and Mossad and pedo elite are running some kind of sex trafficking entrapment blackmail ring out of Puerto Rico and caribbean islands. They are going to frame me with a laptop planted by my ex gf who was a spy. They will torture me to death.”</p><p>  - Nikolai Muchgian, October 28, 2022 [23]</p></blockquote><p>On October 24, 2022, the MakerDAO approved a community proposal to custody nearly $1.6 billion USDC with Coinbase Prime. [24] Four days later, Nikolai Muchigan, the co-founder of MakerDAO and inventor of Rai, a DAI-fork stablecoin, tweeted that his life was in danger due to a Caribbean island blackmail ring, supposedly backed by Israeli and U.S. intelligence agents. Three days later, on Halloween, the 29-year-old coder Muchigan was found dead, having drowned in the sea off Condado Beach in Puerto Rico. [25] </p><p>Two days later, on November 2, 2022, CoinDesk reporter Ian Allison released findings that over a third of all assets – around $5.8 billion of $14.6 billion – on the balance sheet of SBF’s Alameda Research was intrinsically, and soon to be fatally, linked to FTX’s exchange token FTT. A “bank” run commenced, and after three days of nearly $6 billion in withdrawals, FTX was left with literally one single bitcoin. Where exactly did all this bitcoin go? The next day in an interview with Fortune, Coinbase founder and CEO Brian Armstrong made note that USDC will become the de facto central bank digital currency in the U.S. [26]</p><blockquote><p>“The policymakers in the U.S. will set the framework that need to be followed so that the private market will actually create the solutions, and USD coin has been on a really rapid rise… the regulatory environment is one of the biggest unlocks we’re going to have in terms of growing this industry and perhaps even getting the prices to go back up in the right direction”</p><p>  - Brian Armstrong, November 3, 2022</p></blockquote><p>On November 6, CZ announced Binance would liquidate a remaining portion of FTT it had acquired from exiting FTX’s equity, having received around $2.1 billion in BUSD and FTT. Minutes after his announcement, Caroline Ellison, SBF’s partner and the CEO of Alameda Research, offered to purchase the tokens at $22 each, in an over-the-counter fashion. [27] By November 8, CZ and SBF had a phone call and seemingly came to a tentative deal for acquisition, reserving the right to back out of the deal at any time, while interestingly also leaving both U.S.-based proprietary exchanges, Binance.us and FTX.us, outside the scope of the deal. </p><p>“Things have come full circle, and FTX.com’s first, and last, investors are the same: we have come to an agreement on a strategic transaction with Binance for FTX.com (pending DD etc)”, SBF tweeted. [28] </p><p>Later that evening, FTX officially suspended all asset withdrawals. As part of the conditions of the acquisition, SBF was forced to open the FTX books and show the bottom of his pockets; seeing more sand than dollars, CZ backed out of the deal. A few important statements were made in the 48 hours or so that led up to this sudden cataclysm, including from the awfully-quiet U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission itself. </p><blockquote><p>“Liquidating our FTT is just post-exit risk management, learning from LUNA. We gave support before, but we won't pretend to make love after divorce. We are not against anyone. But we won't support people who lobby against other industry players behind their backs. Onwards.”</p><p>  - CZ, November 6, 2022 [29]</p></blockquote><p>On November 7, 2022, the SEC officially deemed LBRY, or Library Coin, an unregistered security offering, setting a devastating precedent throughout the extended cryptocurrency market. [30] In the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, the memorandum and order read, “The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contends that LBRY, Inc. offered and sold unregistered securities in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933”, the act colloquially known as The Howey Test.</p><p>Due to LBRY reserving a pre-mine of nearly 400 million LBC tokens, and the knowledge that the company to date had spent approximately half of its pre-mined LBC, the SEC determined common enterprise complete with a lack of disclosure and proper filing of its now alleged security offering through required channels in the Gary Gensler-chaired SEC. The implications of this filing sent shockwaves across the pre-mined token industry, including exchanges listing these tokens as well as the entities behind their issuance. Conveniently, the next day was November 8, the United States’ midterm elections, with the balance of the senate and the house — and perhaps the regulatory path of the digital asset industry — once again at stake. </p><p>Searching for FTX on FEC.gov brings up 456 individual campaign contributions from SBF, CEO Ryan Salame, and others. [31] Salame’s contributions total over $14 million towards GOP candidates, while SBF’s “effective altruism” contributed over $20 million in donations to DNC politicians. Having been the second leading donor to the Biden campaign, by the time the final tallies from election night rolled in, SBF’s bankroll had finally caught up with his morals, and he found himself nearly completely bankrupt. </p><p>By November 9, the day after the elections, SBF had reportedly lost 94% of his net worth, down to $1 billion from more than $15 billion, leaving him with the largest single-day loss by a person according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. [32] Early in the morning of November 10, SBF took to Twitter to explain what happened, writing “I'm sorry. That's the biggest thing. I fucked up, and should have done better”, before making a specific note that “THIS IS ALL ABOUT FTX INTERNATIONAL, THE NON-US EXCHANGE. FTX US USERS ARE FINE!” [33]</p><h2>Chapter 11</h2><blockquote><p>“The administration [...] has consistently maintained that without proper oversight, cryptocurrencies risk harming everyday Americans…The most recent news further underscores these concerns and highlights why prudent regulation of cryptocurrencies is indeed needed.”<br></p><p>  - White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, November 10, 2022 [34]</p></blockquote><p>On the eleventh day of the eleventh month, FTX and Alameda Research officially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and SBF stepped down as CEO. In addition, 130 affiliated companies connected or associated with FTX also commenced voluntary proceedings under Chapter 11. [35] The tide had gone out, and nearly everyone involved got caught swimming naked, as a near-endless tidal wave of dollar-denominated liquidations made quick work of SBF’s Caribbean empire. </p><p>While the first trickles of a dollar CBDC may have started in the Bahamas, the monsoon of coming regulation and contagion of the Second Great Stablecoin War is far from over. The dollar, having fallen 10% off 35-year DXY highs since September, looks for new ways to innovate and further dollarize markets across the globe. </p><p>On November 15, just four days after the SBF tsunami crashed to shore, BNY Mellon, as well as a dozen or so other banking institutions, announced the start of a twelve-week digital dollar pilot program with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. [36] On the very same day, BlockFi announced plans for bankruptcy filings, only five months after taking a $250 million loan from FTX, and Circle announced users would now be able to settle payments by accepting Apple Pay. [37,38] With a significant 43% discount now showing on the highly-regulated Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, further community requests for proof of reserves are growing around Genesis and Grayscale, both owned by the Digital Currency Group, and even their custodian, Coinbase Custody. [39,40] As of this writing, these requests have so far been denied for security reasons. </p><p>While appearing to be riding the wave of the booming digital asset revolution, gathering celebrity endorsements and political allies alike, it turns out SBF was drowning in debt and capital misallocation amongst the loud, mainstream praise. Later that month, on November 30, SBF was set to appear in person at a New York Times event, sponsored by Accenture, alongside Secretary Yellen, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, TikTok CEO Shou Chew, former Vice President Michael Pence, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, Netflix co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, and others; tickets for the event were listed at $2,499 per attendee.[41] The interview between SBF and Andrew Ross Sorkin was streamed as advertised, albeit with both parties shooting remotely.</p><p>Bitcoin tends to be a ballast of truth, bringing all sorts of ballooning fraud rushing to the surface. FTX and Alameda Research will take their place amongst the seemingly too-big-to-sink players that ended up doing just that. They will certainly not be the last. However the following weeks, months, and years play out, it is clear that SBF was but a small fish in an ocean-sized, dollarized pond. And as he quickly found out, there is always a bigger fish.</p><blockquote><p>“At some point I might have more to say about a particular sparring partner, so to speak. But you know, glass houses. So for now, all I’ll say is: well played; you won.” [42]</p><p>  – Sam Bankman-Fried, November 10, 2022</p></blockquote><hr><h3>ENDNOTES:</h3><p>[1]<a

--><p>Kazakhstan is moving forward with regulation that will further stifle its bitcoin mining industry.</p><p>The country’s federal parliamentary body has completed secondary <a href="https://yandex.ru/video/preview/14309848359203792774">approval</a> of a bill "<a href="https://online.zakon.kz/Document/?doc_id=38842072&amp;pos=5;-106#pos=5;-106">On Digital Assets in the Republic of Kazakhstan</a>." With a third approval, the legislation will introduce new licensing requirements for bitcoin miners based on their facility ownership and operational structure. It would also require that miners purchase their electricity from the energy provider Korem at market rates. <br><br>Previously, specific reporting and tax <a href="https://www.theblock.co/linked/145103/kazakhstan-formalizes-reporting-regime-for-cryptocurrency-miners">requirements were implemented</a>, including registration of names, locations and quarterly reports to the government. These occurred as a result of the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/is-kazakhstan-a-home-for-bitcoin-mining">major influx of mining</a> amidst <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/129152/following-energy-shortage-kazakhstan-is-reining-in-2021s-stampede-of-crypto-miners">energy shortages</a> and protests, all while bitcoin miners fled China as a response to the government’s banning of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/china-ban-bitcoin-is-a-good-thing">bitcoin</a>.<br><br>Kazakhstan’s close proximity to China and previously highly favorable energy access led to the large amounts of hash rate migrating to the country. Afterwards, Kazakhstan went as far as seizing up to <a href="https://www.theblock.co/linked/137902/kazakhstan-has-confiscated-nearly-200-million-in-mining-equipment-from-unregistered-miners">$200 million in mining equipment</a>&nbsp;who did not comply with regulation, and the country continues to try and absorb the benefits of the influx in bitcoin mining using legislation like this most recently approved bill. <br><br>Bitcoin Magazine <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/kazakhstan-to-establish-legal-framework-for-bitcoin-crypto">previously reported</a> on regulation in Kazakhstan, citing a <a href="https://tass.ru/ekonomika/16024131">report</a> from the Russian media outlet Tass. In the report, Ekaterina Smyshlyaeva, a member of the Committee on Economic Reform and Regional Development of the Majilis (Kazakhstan’s federal parliamentary body) detailed the government’s intentions, describing how, "Kazakhstan was used as a raw material appendage of the blockchain industry. [Through] bills, we oblige miners to license in Kazakhstan, that is, to create legal entities and become full-fledged subjects of taxation.”&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg4Mjc5NjUwMzkxMTcyMjE4/how-to-heat-your-home-with-bitcoin-mining.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[These Six Charts Show How Bitcoin Mining Is Enduring The Bear Market]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bear market history never repeats, but it often rhymes and these six datasets show how the bitcoin mining industry is faring today.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/six-charts-on-the-bitcoin-mining-market</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/six-charts-on-the-bitcoin-mining-market</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[bear market]]></category><category><![CDATA[hash rate]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Public Miners]]></category><category><![CDATA[Feature]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Zack Voell]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 17:35:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMjU1NjA1NDIxNjgwMTk1/bitcoin-bear-market.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Bear market history never repeats, but it often rhymes and these six datasets show how the bitcoin mining industry is faring today.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Bitcoin mining companies continue struggling to survive the ongoing bear market. Dreams of<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-price-hits-miner-profitability"> outperforming</a> bitcoin as a public mining company are long gone.<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/27/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-warns-it-might-go-bankrupt-stock-plunges.html"> Bankruptcies</a> and<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/21/riot-blockchain-sues-northern-data-over-disclosures-related-to-texas-bitcoin-mine-acquisition/"> lawsuits</a> make routine headlines. And even Wall Street analysts that were<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/07/01/good-time-to-buy-crypto-mining-stocks-says-da-davidson-as-it-slashes-hashrate-forecasts/"> once bullish</a> on bitcoin mining investment opportunities now say they’re “<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/21/wall-street-analyst-pulling-the-plug-on-bitcoin-miners-owing-to-bear-market-woes/">pulling the plug</a>” until the market improves. But exactly how bad is the current bear market?</p><p>It’s always darkest before dawn, as the adage says. And compared to previous bear markets, the mining industry looks much closer to the end of a turbulent market phase than the beginning of it. This article explores a bunch of data sets from the current and previous bear markets to contextualize the state of the industry and how the mining sector is faring. From hardware lifecycles and miner balances, to hash rate growth and hash price declines, all of these data tell a unique story about one of Bitcoin’s most important economic sectors.</p><h2>Mining Revenue Is Evaporating</h2><p>When bitcoin’s price drops, it’s not surprising that dollar-denominated mining revenue also drops. But it has – a lot. <a href="https://earthweb.com/how-many-bitcoins-are-mined-per-day/">Roughly 900 BTC are still mined every day</a> and will be until the next halving in 2024. But the fiat price for those bitcoin has plummeted this year, meaning miners have far fewer dollars for expenses like electricity, maintenance and the servicing of loans.</p><p>As the chart below demonstrates, in November, the entire bitcoin mining industry earned less than $500 million from processing transactions and issuing new coins. The bar chart below shows this monthly revenue compared to the past five years. November mining revenue marks a two-year low for monthly earnings.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MjgwMDA5MzQ1NjA3MzQ1/bitcoin-mining-monthly-revenue.png" height="395" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>This past month marked a two-year low for Bitcoin mining company revenue.</figcaption>
    </figure><h2>Potential Hash Rate Uptrend Reversal</h2><p>Comparing the current bear market to the previous one in 2018 offers some interesting insights into how the mining industry has changed and how it has remained the same. One such comparison is hash rate growth during downward price trends. It’s not uncommon to see hash rate grow during bear markets. The annotated line chart below shows normalized hash rate growth during the 2018 and 2022 bear markets from bitcoin’s price peak to the drawdowns’ history (or current) lows.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MjgwMDA5MzQ1NzM4NDE3/bear-market-daily-hash-rate-growth.png" height="393" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>So far in this bear market, Bitcoin hash rate has only grown.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>But one thing that is obviously missing from the above chart is a correction in hash rate growth during the later period of the bearish phase. In 2018, for example, the growth trend clearly changed course and dropped as the market eventually found a low for bitcoin’s price. But in the current market, hash rate has only grown. Perhaps a slight drop in hash rate through late November signals a trend change, but the question is still open.</p><h2>Collapse Of Public Mining Companies</h2><p>Perhaps the most brutal bitcoin mining chart of all shows the drawdowns of publicly-traded mining companies this year. It’s no secret that the past year has been brutal for bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, and the global economy in general. But mining companies in particular have been clobbered. Over half of these companies have seen their share prices fall over 90% since January. Only two — CleanSpark and Riot Blockchain — have not dropped more than 80%.</p><p>Mining companies in general are often considered to be a high-beta investment in bitcoin, meaning when bitcoin goes up, mining stock prices go up more. But this market dynamic cuts both ways, and when bitcoin falls, the downside for mining stocks is even more brutal. The bar chart below shows the massacre these stocks have endured.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Bitcoin mining stocks have been massacred.</figcaption>
    </figure><h2>The Rise And Fall Of Bitcoin Mining’s ‘AK-47’</h2><p>An underappreciated hallmark of the current bitcoin bear market is the precipitous decline in hash rate contributed by Bitmain’s Antminer S9 machines. This model of mining machine is occasionally<a href="https://kaboomracks.com/learn/how-to-setup-a-antminer-s9/"> referred</a> to as the “AK-47” of mining because of its durability and reliable performance. And at one point in the 2018 bear market, the S9 was king. Nearly 80% of Bitcoin’s total hash rate came from this Bitmain model during the depths of the previous bear market.</p><p>But the current bear market tells a completely different story. Thanks to new, more efficient hardware and a vice-grip squeeze on mining profit margins, the percentage of hash rate from S9s dropped below 2% in early November. The annotated line chart below shows the rise and fall of this machine.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MjgwMDA5MzQ1NTQxNjM3/antiminer-s9-bitcoin-hash-rate.png" height="416" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>The Antminer S9 has seen a remarkable fall.</figcaption>
    </figure><h2>Miner Balance Retraces Its Sell Off</h2><p>The past few months have been disastrous for the “crypto” industry as exchange wars, insolvent custodians and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/crypto-contagion-intensifies-more-dominoes-fall">other forms of financial contagion swept the market</a>. Many bitcoin investors like to assume their segment of the industry is mostly insulated from the chaos of the rest of “crypto,” but this is usually false. In the case of miners, who are notoriously bad at timing the market, some panic was evident as address balances and miner outflows appeared to drop and spike, respectively.</p><p>But this activity was short lived. The line chart below shows that miner address balances have almost fully retraced their drop from late September through October. In short, miners appear to be back in HODL mode, impervious to exogenous market events. Whether the bear market is over or not is unknown. But miners seem to be accumulating more than selling.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MjgwMDA5MzQ1ODAzOTUz/bitcoin-miner-one-hop-address-balances.png" height="413" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>Miners appear to be back in HODL mode.</figcaption>
    </figure><h2>Hash Price Drop Today Vs. 2018</h2><p>Hash price is one of the most popular economic metrics for miners to track, even though few people outside of the mining sector understand it. In short, this metric represents the dollar-denominated revenue expected to be earned per marginal unit of hash rate. And like everything else in the bear market, hash price has fallen significantly. But its decline is not unusual, especially when it's compared to the hash price decline in 2018.</p><p>Shown in the chart below are normalized hash price drawdowns from 2018 and 2022. Readers will notice the fairly similar slope and size of the drawdowns. 2018 was slightly steeper. 2022 to date has been shallower but longer. But both were and are brutal for fledgling mining operations.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>This 2022 hash price drawdown has been shallower but longer than its 2018 equivalent.</figcaption>
    </figure><h2>The Next Phase Of Mining</h2><p>Boom and bust cycles are a natural series of events for any properly functioning market. The bitcoin mining sector is no exception. For the past year, mining has seen its weaker, unprepared operators weeded out as the excesses from the bull market are brought to account. Now, in the depths of a bearish period, the real builders can continue to expand their operations and build a solid foundation for the next phase of euphoric bullishness. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Zack Voell.

Who to trust? How can one verify for themselves? It’s all very unclear. What does it bring for precoiners, casual bitcoiners and purists alike? Confusion, fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD). The state of bitcoin privacy is embarrassing with all this perpetual drama scaring away new users. Precious time is wasted by developers, educators and regular users who would probably be better off doing anything but trying to keep up with the drama. </p><p>It is obvious that no one agrees on “how to do CoinJoins right,” let alone, how CoinJoins should be implemented to optimize user privacy and block space efficiency on the Bitcoin network? What are the tradeoffs between different implementations? Are some implementations outright flawed? How do CoinJoins “cross the chasm” from early adopters to mainstream users when billions of people will turn to bitcoin in the coming years? </p><p>Let’s now take a look at CoinJoins by asking fundamental questions and raising some assumptions to build some sort of mental models, which will be useful in evaluating different implementations in future articles. </p><h2>Not All CoinJoins Are Made Equal </h2><p>Blockspace efficiency should be considered to make sure CoinJoin transactions scale as Bitcoin gets used by more people across the world. This is rarely discussed as a top priority. Any CoinJoin design that ignores blockspace scarcity is unnecessarily spamming the block chain while accumulating technical debt, which will be difficult to pay back as more users CoinJoin in the future. Having a minimal footprint on the block chain is one goal that seems very reasonable to aim for: a small number of transactions to get to an acceptable level of anonymity sounds ideal. </p><ul><li>What is an acceptable level of anonymity? </li><li>What does anonymity even mean in the context of bitcoin privacy?</li><li>How are particular CoinJoin designs dealing with blockspace scarcity?</li></ul><h2>Reclaim Your Privacy</h2><p>Anonymity in bitcoin would mean that there are no outstanding or unusual features that would make a given transaction remarkable from other transactions on the ledger. That, of course, is not by design on the Bitcoin network, which is a pseudonymous system where coins (UTXOs, which stands for Unspent Transaction Output in technical terms) are by default not fungible due to having unique transaction histories. </p><p>CoinJoins add a level of anonymity to the bitcoin network by breaking links between transaction inputs and outputs primarily making resulting UTXOs indistinguishable from each other. There are other heuristics that chain analysis companies use to watch the bitcoin network, such as common input ownership, self-spending, round amounts or timing analysis to name a few, which may or may not be obscured by CoinJoins. </p><p>CoinJoins help bitcoiners reclaim their privacy but are not the solution to everything. If privacy is understood as the choice to share information about oneself, great privacy can be achieved through CoinJoins but picking the right implementation is essential. </p><ul><li>What is my privacy goal using CoinJoins? </li><li>Which heuristics does a CoinJoin implementation protect me against?</li><li>What are the risks that I want to avoid?</li></ul><h2>Number Of Participants</h2><p>Existing CoinJoin implementations have very different ways of improving privacy. Irrespective of each CoinJoin implementation design, the anonymity set (one measure for the level of anonymity) seems to be the most traditional way to evaluate how much privacy one gets from a CoinJoin. There are other ways that will be discussed in other articles. The assumptions are that either a high anonymity set is achieved with a large CoinJoin transaction or that it is achieved over multiple smaller CoinJoin transactions. These two parameters are both important, but is there one that is more important than the other? </p><p>In terms of blockspace efficiency, the assumption would be that achieving a large anonymity set with a single very large transaction that has many participants is better than multiple very small transactions with a few participants. </p><ul><li>Is one single large CoinJoin or multiple small CoinJoins better for privacy?</li><li>How can that be verified truthfully and rigorously? How small is too small for a CoinJoin? </li><li>What is the right metric to evaluate how much privacy you can get from a CoinJoin? </li><li>What is the most blockspace efficient when it comes to the size and number of CoinJoins to reclaim your privacy?</li><li>Is it realistic to expect coins to participate in multiple CoinJoins over time as more people start using CoinJoins? How many CoinJoin rounds is enough or too much?</li></ul><p>In simple terms, CoinJoins allow bitcoiners to reclaim their privacy by giving them plausible deniability. Plausibility is a measure of probability. How likely is it that your bitcoins were spent or simply moved to another address you still control? How likely is it that one input is linked to a given output? </p><p>Obviously, the smaller the probabilities across many options, the better plausible deniability you get as a hodler. Plausible deniability is hard to preserve because errors are easy to make. Change outputs are often problematic for bitcoiners who care about privacy and are often a source of contentious discussions and criticism. Why is change output such a controversial topic in CoinJoins? </p><h2>Change Output</h2><p>It’s all about deterministic links. If bitcoin transactions had a spectrum of privacy, on one end would be a transaction with absolute plausible deniability, meaning 0% chance of knowing the link between inputs and outputs. This is also referred to as randomness or entropy in a CoinJoin. The assumption is that the more random or higher the entropy, the better. On the other end would be a transaction with 100% deterministic links between its only input and single output. </p><p>Unintuitively, a high entropy doesn’t necessarily mean that a transaction provides good privacy. A transaction with three inputs and three outputs of equal amounts technically has 100% entropy, meaning there is no way to distinguish each output from each other; and yet, there is a 33.33% chance that each input is linked to a particular output. High entropy does not necessarily mean good plausible deniability.</p><p>Change almost always has a very high deterministic link to its previous transaction. In other words, there is little doubt that a change output is not tied to the previous transaction that spent it. That can be a considerable privacy issue if a given change output were to be co-spent with other anonymous inputs following CoinJoins (though exceptions may apply in certain cases). This is usually referred to as UTXO consolidation and can be fatal to your privacy if done naïvely. </p><p>Change outputs can de-anonymize outputs that have gained some plausible deniability from CoinJoins if spent together. Errors are commonplace for bitcoiners and sometimes the realization comes too late, undoing years of diligent privacy enhancements in one single spend. How to get rid of this change output problem? </p><p>Existing CoinJoin implementations have three ways of dealing with change outputs: isolate the change into another wallet that is not CoinJoining, include the change output in the same wallet that is CoinJoining or get rid of the change output by not having change outputs at all. The latter seems to be the most advisable in terms of privacy and blockspace efficiency but further digging is required to validate or reject this assumption. </p><ul><li>Is a high entropy score enough to qualify a CoinJoin as good for your privacy?</li><li>Is it better to isolate change outputs in another wallet or should it be removed entirely?</li><li>Is a change output always bad for your privacy?</li></ul><h2>Coin Denominations</h2><p>Getting rid of change outputs in CoinJoins requires that coin denominations be variable in a CoinJoin. In other words, the inputs registered in a given CoinJoin cannot have a fixed size like 0.1 BTC, otherwise it becomes impossible (or at least very hard) to consume inputs without creating change outputs as most UTXOs don’t have round numbers (i.e. 0.19572394 BTC where 0.09572394 BTC would be the change in a 0.1 BTC fixed coin denomination CoinJoin). </p><p>Change outputs can be dangerous for your privacy, remember? Having multiple sizes for inputs and outputs in a CoinJoin seems to be a bad idea as it brings us closer to deterministic links between inputs and outputs, right? Well, yes and no. It depends. If a CoinJoin has a small number of participants (meaning few inputs and few outputs), then different denominations are a bad idea. But what if a large number of inputs and outputs are included in a given CoinJoin? </p><p>In a large CoinJoin, multiple denominations can bring a high level of plausible deniability to each resulting output without creating change outputs and requiring additional transactions, which is a highly efficient use of blockspace. It seems that many boxes could be ticked at this point. </p><ul><li>Is it better to have fixed or variable coin denominations in a CoinJoin?</li><li>How big should a CoinJoin be for variable denominations to make sense?</li><li>Are variable coin denominations the best way to get rid of change output in CoinJoins? </li></ul><p>It goes without saying that CoinJoin rounds interconnectivity should not be tolerable in any circumstances regardless of whether coin denominations are different or if the CoinJoin is a large or small transaction, right? Well, here again, there is an important nuance to understand. </p><h2>Coinjoin Rounds Interconnectivity </h2><p>It is claimed that registering inputs from past shared CoinJoins into new CoinJoins is ill-advised in all cases. Participants from mutually shared past CoinJoins do not seem to benefit from mixing together in other CoinJoins. It seems harmful to privacy, and is often criticized. </p><p>What if a CoinJoin is large and some registered inputs come from multiple other CoinJoins, each being also downstream from multiple other CoinJoins? In such a case, participants remixing together are still improving their privacy despite coming from a shared past CoinJoin. If each CoinJoin is large enough, the participants are not required to remix multiple times, though they can if they want to further increase their anonymity sets. </p><p>If many large intertwined CoinJoins are involved, the resulting anonymity set should provide plenty of plausible deniability, despite sharing past CoinJoins as origin of funds. </p><ul><li>Is CoinJoin rounds interconnectivity, which is sharing mutual past CoinJoins, a bad thing on its own?</li><li>How large should a CoinJoin be for remixing with other past inputs to be considered safe?</li></ul><h2>Personal Full Node</h2><p>Should you run your own bitcoin full node when participating in CoinJoins? On the surface, it seems like a great idea, and it usually is. Some CoinJoin implementations allow that, while others outright require it. Others won’t allow you to even use your own full node. Is that to condemn absolutely? If you’ve read until now, you should know that the answer is nuanced and opens up a deep rabbit hole to be explored later.</p><p>Running your own full node comes with usability tradeoffs, and may not add much privacy protection if not all users do it. Running your own node may even give you a false sense of security and privacy if few CoinJoin participants do it, which can be deeply harmful. If Tor is used as an anonymous way to CoinJoin (and we’ll leave it as that for now), then using a trusted full node to broadcast the CoinJoin transaction can be fine as the default. Lots of nuances, and of course, don’t trust, verify. </p><p>There are some essential questions to ask so as to not fall in the trap of privacy virtue signaling. </p><ul><li>Does the CoinJoin implementation allow to run full nodes, require them by default or don’t allow them? </li><li>If personal full nodes are not mandatory, what are the privacy shields in place? i.e. Tor, block filters, etc… </li><li>If I run my own full node, but expect most users to use a default trusted node to CoinJoin, how does that affect my privacy? Can the coordinator de-anonymize me?</li></ul><p>With privacy concerns, it is always important to understand what you’re trying to protect, and against whom. Running a full node and using it with your own wallet is the right way to use bitcoin as it allows you to verify your wallet balance and broadcast transactions to the network without trusting anyone. But when it comes to CoinJoins, there is usually a coordinator in charge. What does the coordinator do and how is it selected? Read on.</p><h2>The Coordinator</h2><p>The CoinJoin coordinator is in charge of having every participant register their inputs and outputs, and sign the collaborative transaction before broadcasting it. Most CoinJoin implementations default on a central coordinator, which is a single point of failure. Up until now, this has been an accepted tradeoff in most bitcoin communities. Can a central CoinJoin coordinator fail? Absolutely. Other implementations allow anyone to be a coordinator for each different CoinJoin, though there are other sets of trade offs here that will be discussed later. </p><p>Coinjoins being non-custodial, no loss of funds could occur if any coordinator would fail. The coordinator should never know more than what everyone knows publicly on the bitcoin network. Why? If a coordinator knows more than what is publicly available, a CoinJoin coordinator becomes a honeypot with highly sensitive data that can be exploited against bitcoiners trusting the service. </p><p>You should never trust a CoinJoin coordinator. If a CoinJoin coordinator cannot be evil, good. If it can be evil, it will be eventually, out of errors, omissions, coercion or outright dishonesty. </p><p>An example of sensitive user data would be XPUBs, which undeniably leak all the information about a wallet, its addresses, including past, current and future bitcoin transactions. Another example would be the ratio between users running their own full nodes and users trusting the coordinator’s full node to broadcast CoinJoins, as it could de-anonymize users running their own nodes, and therefore deterministically know the links between their inputs and outputs. This is yet another nuanced topic, which would require further investigation and discussion. </p><ul><li>Does the coordinator know more than what is publicly available on the bitcoin network? </li><li>Do users leak sensitive data to the coordinator, such as their XPUB or whether or not they run their own full nodes?</li><li>Does the coordinator claim that users should trust them using legal defense mechanisms? (i.e. warrant canaries, regulatory arbitrage, etc…)</li></ul><h2>Fees</h2><p>Bottom line, who pays for what in CoinJoins? These bitcoin transactions can be expensive and sometimes fee structures are unclear for bitcoiners. It’s hard to know how much good privacy will cost you or even if you are getting any privacy out of it. Some CoinJoin implementations allow a single input to buy its privacy from other inputs who only participate for free to increase their own anonymity set. Getting paid to CoinJoin? With patience, yes. </p><p>Some models rely on shared fees where only some UTXOs pay fees while others don’t. Other models rely on inviting an ever growing number of new clear inputs (not mixed yet) to fund the existing CoinJoins for remixing inputs that do not have high enough anonymity levels. Some models seem unsustainable over the long term while others are naïve, or way too expensive for most users. </p><p>And what fees are we talking about? Well usually, inputs participating in CoinJoins pay both a coordinator fee or taker fee, (the service fee to get some level of anonymity) and the bitcoin network fees. In particular CoinJoin models, these fees get waived in certain circumstances. The economics of CoinJoins is a deep rabbit hole which requires further investigation for a much deeper understanding. </p><ul><li>Who pays for what in a CoinJoin? What are all the fees? </li><li>What are the incentives of the CoinJoin coordinator? </li><li>Are all CoinJoin rounds paid for or is there any free remix?</li></ul><p>Having read thus far, the hope is that bitcoiners shopping around for CoinJoins would not necessarily have all of the answers, but the right questions to ask. A mental model or framework to evaluate different CoinJoin implementations can be quite helpful for anyone who is considering using CoinJoins to reclaim their privacy on bitcoin. Sorting through the noise of social media requires intellectual honesty and the right evaluation system rigorously applied. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Thibaud Maréchal.

Only 0.5% of Nigerian citizens are estimated to be using the digital Naira, per a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-25/shunned-digital-currency-looks-for-street-credibility-in-nigeria">Bloomberg</a> report. Now, it seeks to increase the usage of it through regulations like this. <br><br></p><p>Bitcoiners have been outspoken opponents of CBDCs, describing various weaknesses that point to Bitcoin being the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/rise-fall-central-bank-digital-currency">superior</a> alternative. CBDCs, Bitcoiners <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/the-dangerous-implications-of-cbdcs">argue</a>, can lead to outsized surveillance of the population, total <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/digital-dollar-threat-civil-liberties">control</a> of people’s money and complete lack of sovereignty when it comes to the debasement of value of a currency. <br><br>Beyond that, Bitcoiners have argued that not only are CBDCs inherently bad, but their success is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/us-cbdc-narrative-is-a-fantasy">entirely improbable</a>, as the infrastructure necessary to implement them as envisioned simply doesn’t exist and is not going to be made by incapable governments. Some <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/stablecoin-monster-cbdc-red-herring">have even pointed to stablecoins</a> as potential vehicles for carrying the attributes of CBDCs, while theorizing that CBDCs simply distract from the incentive perversion created by stablecoins. <br><br>Developments like these ATM limits point to the desperation of governments as they seek to hold their citizens within the boundaries of government monetary systems.

By looking at on-chain realized profit and loss data, we can see that this was true for many forced-sellers of bitcoin. Before any bitcoin price bottom, a hallmark sign that you want to see is extended periods of forced selling, capitulation and rise in realized losses. One way to view this is by looking at the sum of realized profit and loss for each month relative to bitcoin’s total market cap. We saw these bottom signals in November 2022, and similarly in the July 2022 Terra/LUNA crash, March 2020 COVID fear and December 2018 cycle bottom capitulation events.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Net realized profit/loss over market cap</figcaption>
    </figure><p>Looking at the 2018 cycle, the end was marked by excess realized losses, although this was much different with the forced liquidations and cascades of private balance sheet leverage and paper bitcoin unwinding that we saw this year.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>30-day cumulative net realized profit/loss</figcaption>
    </figure><p>We’ve talked about the current drawdown in bitcoin’s price and how that compares to previous cycles many times over the last few months. Another way to look at cyclical drawdowns is to focus on bitcoin’s realized market capitalization — the average cost basis of the network which tracks the latest price where each UTXO moved last. With price being more volatile, realized price is a more stable view of bitcoin’s growth and capital inflows. The realized market capitalization is now down 17.33% which is significantly higher than 2015 and 2018 cycles of 14.13% and 16.51%, respectively.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Bitcoin realized cap drawdown</figcaption>
    </figure><p>As for duration, we’re 176 total days into the price being below bitcoin’s realized price. Those aren’t consecutive days as price can temporarily go above realized price, but price trends below realized price in bear market periods. For context, trends in 2018 were short-lived at around 134 days and the trends in 2014-15 lasted 384 days. </p><p>On one hand, bitcoin’s realized market capitalization has taken a significant hit in the previous round of capitulation. That’s a promising bottom-like sign. On the other hand, there’s a case to be made that price being below realized price could easily last another six months from historical cycles and the lack of capitulation in equity markets is still a major headwind and concern.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Net unrealized profit/loss</figcaption>
    </figure><p>As per the net-unrealized-profit/loss (NUPL) ratio, we are firmly in the capitulation phase. NUPL can be calculated by subtracting the realized cap from market cap and dividing the result by the market cap, as described in this <a href="https://medium.com/@adamant_capital/a-primer-on-bitcoin-investor-sentiment-and-changes-in-saving-behavior-a5fb70109d32">article</a> authored by By Tuur Demeester, Tamás Blummer and Michiel Lescrauwaet. </p><p>There is no denying it: For bitcoin-native cycles, we are firmly in the capitulation phase. Currently, only 56% of circulating supply was last moved on-chain in profit. On a two-week moving average basis, under 50% supply was last moved above the current exchange rate, which is something that has only ever happened in the depths of previous bear-market lows.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>When thinking of the bitcoin exchange rate, the numerator side of the equation is historically cheap. The Bitcoin network continues to produce a block approximately every 10 minutes in an unabated fashion, as hash rate ticks higher and as the ledger offers an immutable settlement layer for global value. The speculation, leverage and fraud of the previous cycle is washing to shore and bitcoin continues to exchange hands.</p><p>Bitcoin is objectively cheap relative to its all time history and adoption phases. The real question over the immediate future is the denominator. We have talked at length about the global liquidity cycle and its current track. Despite being historically cheap, bitcoin is not immune to a sudden strengthening in the dollar because nothing truly is. Exchange rates are relative and if the dollar is squeezing higher, then everything else will subsequently fall — at least momentarily. As always, position sizing and time preference is key for all. </p><p>As for the catalyst for a surge higher in the dollar denominator of the bitcoin exchange rate (BTC/USD), there are 80 trillion possible catalysts…</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/financialjuice/status/1599735857816240129"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><figure>

Bitcoin emerged as a response to this global crisis of legitimacy.</p><p>Now, more than a decade later, the economic damage created by the pandemic has triggered a further breakdown of the system. As the Federal Reserve’s infinite money printing creates high inflation, Bitcoin steadily increases its popularity as a safe haven. </p><p>At the same time, as the old economy is being destroyed, the leading global institutions have stepped forward to reboot the entire system. The key organization, the World Economic Forum (WEF), with the theme of “<a href="https://www.weforum.org/great-reset">The Great Reset</a>,” <a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_CBDC_Technology_Considerations_2021.pdf">prepares for</a> the rollout of the central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p><h2>CBDC Versus Bitcoin</h2><p>Agustin Carstens, head of the Bank for International Settlements,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpNnTuK5JJU"> explains</a> CBDCs as programmable money that gives issuers the power to control every transaction. Using these powers, issuers can restrict what ordinary people are allowed to spend money on.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/resist_05/status/1585028310748499969"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>In response to central banks creating their own digital currencies, the original cypherpunk and cryptographer, Adam Back tweeted:</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1517843949091799042"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p><a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1517843949091799042"><em>Link to embedded Tweet here</em></a>. </p><p>Now, Bitcoin and CBDCs, two different types of digital currency with contrasting features, race toward a global adoption. The crux of this competition involves different visions of the world. The outcome of this race will determine the future of humanity.</p><h2>Shift Of Authority</h2><p>The crisis of legitimacy triggered by the financial panic of 2008 signaled the demise of the Western liberal democracy. This has begun to create a shift in the locus of authority in our society. </p><p>The idea of democracy that inspired the birth of the United States was based on a humanistic worldview. In the past, authority was placed in the gods, and the sacred text. People sought answers from the external. They turned to religion, the Bible and Popes for their decisions. </p><figure>

    </figure><p>A move towards democracy brought a shift in values. It placed authority in human hands, putting emphasis on the individual. People who were seeking behavioral norms outside of themselves began to rely on their personal experience.</p><h2>Threat To Democracy</h2><p>Yuval Noah Harari, Israeli public intellectual and historian,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=4ChHc5jhZxs"> talks about</a> how, in this crisis of democracy, a threat to the humanistic worldview is now emerging from laboratories and research departments in places like Silicon Valley.</p><p>Harrai, who is<a href="https://www.weforum.org/people/yuval-noah-harari"> a lead advisor</a> to Klaus Schwab, head of the World Economic Forum (WEF),<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ChHc5jhZxs"> points out</a> ways in which science is challenging the story of humanism. </p><figure>

    </figure><p>He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ChHc5jhZxs">explains</a> that scientists are saying there is no such thing as free will and that freedom is just another myth, an empty term that humans have invented. He defines feelings as biochemical processes of calculation and contends that there is no reason to consider them the highest authority in the world.</p><h2>Techno-Religion</h2><p>Harari, who has been<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-loves-sapiens-2019-2?op=1"> praised by</a> the likes of Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, and celebrated by tech workers in Silicon Valley, explains how in this twilight of democracy, authority is now once again moving away from humans. This time, he states it is not some gods above the clouds that control human destiny, but algorithms, and data in the clouds of the Amazon and big tech giants.</p><p>He<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGt5xklfmsU"> describes</a> a new revolution happening around this shift of authority. It is led by a “techno-religion”, the ideology that technology provides salvation. He<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=3158&amp;v=g6BK5Q_Dblo&amp;feature=youtu.be"> explains</a> that this techno-religion is a data religion within which “data and information becomes a supreme source of authority and of meaning in the world.” It makes us believe that technology knows more about us than we do ourselves. It tells us, “Don’t listen to feeling or gut intuition. Just turn to data.” </p><p>Acting as a spokesperson for this new sect of techno religion, Harari<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ChHc5jhZxs"> predicts</a> a coming of a future without humanity. He states that humans like you and I will disappear and that the earth will be dominated by very different kinds of beings or entities. Under the new authority of algorithms, Harari<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuL3wlodJC8"> describes</a> how human beings are viewed as no longer spiritual souls, but become “hackable animals.”</p><h2>Warning For Humanity</h2><p>Some saw what was coming and warned about the potential machine takeover of the world and the elimination of human beings.</p><figure>

The mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto recognized that this system was not adequate by itself to secure the value of freedom and the place of individuals as supreme authority in the system.</p><p>Those who gained control over the production of money have created an economic system that works to their advantage. Concentration of economic power in a few hands turned democracy into a system of control. With sophisticated methods of persuasion, through use of propaganda and PR under the guise of democracy, the population was subjected to manipulation of their feelings.</p><p>By challenging the monopoly of money, Bitcoin — cypherpunks’ holy grail — has enabled economic liberty. With the principle of “don’t trust, verify,” this technology places the source of legitimacy with individuals, for the first time in history. </p><p>Rather than residing in the clouds of tech giants, authority is now descending into the human heart.</p><h2>Revival Of Humanism</h2><figure>

    </figure><p>The birth of Bitcoin has helped creativity and freedom of expression to flourish, creating the resurgence of the arts. It now inspires a new renaissance of humanism.</p><p>Before the Renaissance, history was seen as being shaped by divine forces. With the advent of the Renaissance, beginning in the 14th century in Italy, this view shifted.</p><p>The Renaissance placed human beings at the center of life. A man was regarded as a partner in the creation of Gods, to actively engage in shaping the course of their own lives.</p><p>Just as the Renaissance placed emphasis on the individual, now, the Bitcoin Renaissance 2.0 creates sovereign individuals, enabling human beings to truly come alive.</p><h2>A Path Of Salvation Via Proof-Of-Work</h2><p>People from all nations, with different backgrounds, started to align themselves with humanistic ideals that exist at the core of Bitcoin. Through meetups and <a href="http://b.tc/conference">conferences</a>, they are now finding one another. They begin to speak the same language and share values. </p><p>Transcending their cultural differences, they have become Bitcoiners. They are bearers of humanity, beginning to claim the source of authority in human imagination.</p><p>This is now creating a humanistic movement, generating a force strong enough to counter the techno revolution.</p><p>Between Bitcoin and CBDCs, we are now presented with a choice.</p><figure>

Through each individual voluntarily participating in a network of consensus, each of us can engage in validating our own truth.</p><p>While a path of technological salvation moves a society toward the post-human era, Bitcoin, pro-human technology inspires each individual to create a new world of humanism.</p><h2>El Salvador (“The Savior”)</h2><p>El Salvador, the country that first <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-to-declare-bitcoin-as-legal-tender">declared bitcoin legal tender</a>, has become a center of this Renaissance 2.0.

Direction: San Salvador. The Bitcoin community is about to gather here for Adopting Bitcoin, the final major Bitcoin conference of the year, but certainly not the least. Friends and Bitcoiners from around the world are flying into the country to work together and promote Bitcoin adoption. Who knows how many of them knew much about this country before the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-approves-bitcoin-legal-tender">“Ley Bitcoin” was implemented</a>?</p><p>Before returning to San Salvador, we made a pit stop in the village of Ataco — we were invited to participate in the handing out of a Bitcoin diploma, an actual qualification in Bitcoin and financial education that students in (currently) seven public schools in El Salvador receive after participating in a course offered by <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/38-high-school-students-in-el-salvador-earned-a-bitcoin-diploma">My First Bitcoin</a>.</p><p>Less than a year ago, during our first trip to El Salvador living in Bitcoin only, we attended a meeting between the first principal to join the Bitcoin diploma project, government representatives and the project's founders.

Because of this, we decided to do something we had not yet done here in El Salvador and we went to Starbucks. Last year, we saw dozens of videos on Twitter of bitcoin transactions at this chain in the country and felt confident this coffee shop would our sats. </p><p>“Two cappuccinos and two chocolate muffins please,” we said. “We will pay in bitcoin!” </p><p>Silence. The waitress' lost look meant only one thing: she had never used Bitcoin before and had no idea how to do accept our proposed payment. Her colleague came to her aid but she could not remember the password to their Chivo wallet. No dice. So, we went to the McDonald's next door, with the same intent. </p><p><br>That is where the real surprise took place: Not even the McDonald's manager remembered the password for the Chivo app. Less than a year ago, the same establishment was studded with illuminated “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/pkq91j/mcdonalds_el_salvador_now_mcdonalds_everywhere/">pay for your burger in bitcoin!</a>' signs. Unbelievable. <br><br></p><p>We remembered that the restaurant’s automated checkouts could create a bitcoin QR code without requiring any password and we asked the staff to try it. It worked! But what a struggle.</p><p>Education is everything. </p><p>The day before, we witnessed the final test of 16- and 17-year-olds who proved perfectly capable of creating and managing new, non-custodial bitcoin wallets, importing them into new devices, making on-chain transactions and monitoring them in a Bitcoin explorer. Less than 24 hours later, we found ourselves drinking watered-down coffee at a venue whose staff could not remember an application PIN.</p><section><figure>

It is good to see so many friendly faces again, from all over the world. The content was of a high standard and audience participation was good.</p><p>The panel I participated in was titled "<a href="https://pretalx.com/adopting-bitcoin-2022/schedule/">Orange Pilling The World’s Masses</a>" — as if that were easy. I spent the night taking notes:</p><ul><li>I don't like the term “orange pilling,” though I wish that teaching Bitcoin was as easy as swallowing a pill: You swallow it and boom, you're a Bitcoiner. I consider it a misleading term. Studying and understanding Bitcoin is a long, time-consuming process.</li><li>Bitcoin is the greatest human rights tool ever invented. It was so long before “have fun staying poor,” and its price does not even matter to me. Price is just a consequence of its technology and the social revolution it is bringing. In El Salvador, where a person understands that bitcoin is also fundamental to their own survival, they understand everything. That, for me, is the “orange pilling” moment.</li><li>What wallet do I recommend downloading for orange pilling? It depends on who I'm talking to. If it's someone completely new to the field, I go with Wallet Of Satoshi. The Lightning transactions there are amazing. True, it is completely custodial (not your keys, not your coin!), but the user experience is amazing. There are just two buttons and it's instant. It works like a charm. But if I talk to someone who already knows something about the technology, I go with Blue Wallet. In this application, you have two different wallets: the non-custodial bitcoin wallet (of which you then own the private key) and one for using the Lightning Network. I think it's very useful to make the difference between Layer 1 and Layer 2 clear. If you want to pay for a coffee with the Lightning Network, you literally have to move your bitcoin from Layer 1 to Layer 2. </li><li>In our work, we always have to keep in mind that it is really very early. As Bitcoiners, we would like to see this technology applied to the world as soon as possible. The truth is that history itself teaches us that this will not be possible. Think of credit cards: Frank McNamara invented the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diners_Club_International">Diners Club</a>, the world's first credit card, in 1950. It took a notable amount of time after this for credit cards to become truly relevant. Bitcoin, in addition to being a disruptive technology, is a philosophical achievement. That's why so many pre-coiners don't think they need it and that it doesn't solve any problems for them. We have to be patient and allow this creature more time to develop. </li><li>When will we reach hyperbitcoinization? I always wonder what is meant by this word. The diffusion of a technology to transmit value instantaneously and without boundaries? To me that is not hyperbitcoinization. Bitcoin will allow us to vote in a distributed network, to certify in a distributed network. It will enable us sooner or later to disintermediate any trust process. Trust is obsolete.</li></ul><p>The notes worked and the panel went very well. There were roars of applause and lots of compliments.</p><section><figure>

All around us were tropical vegetation, incredible sunsets and exotic animals. People from dozens of different countries have gathered here. To sharpen your hearing was to perceive a Babel of different languages and accents. All of this happened solely because of the intuition of a pseudonymous scientist — someone who dared to dream so big as to come up with something capable of changing the world. </p><p>If this thing, in itself, is not incredible, I really don't know what is. </p><p>The truth is that Bitcoin has already changed our lives, irreversibly. And it has also already done so for so many people who are able to take this idea and embed it into their jobs or even to invent a new job from scratch. There are many such examples here. Sure, lots of technical people, like developers, journalists and entrepreneurs. But also many more creative people. The young man from India who decides to travel the world in Bitcoin, 40 countries in 400 days. The American couple who manages to teach while having fun. The journalist who, once he falls down the rabbit hole, devotes himself exclusively to Bitcoin. The driver who, thanks to Bitcoiners, sees his business scale like he never could have imagined. The small coffee producer who manages to export by getting paid in an instant and without onerous fees. </p><p>We could go on listing similar cases for hours. These are small things, let's be clear. And perhaps they are isolated examples. And it may take resourcefulness and a touch of madness to make your dreams into realities with Bitcoin. But it is already possible. Bitcoin works. It changes the lives of those who can seize opportunities and all that it takes is having that spark.</p><p>The nights in El Zonte were hot and humid at this time. The sun set quickly behind the horizon. We all met at a hotel called Palo Verde for a conference party organized by IBEX. All of our friends were there, those we love. We had something to eat, chatted for a while, and then the music started. There is nothing more liberating than dancing on the beach, feet in the sand. It was super hot, but the dance floor was still crowded. </p><p>At the entrance we were given tickets for a raffle and prizes were to be drawn. Someone in our group won a very good bottle of whiskey. That's the end. As the amber liquid trickled down our throats, we already anticipated the hangover headache. When the music ended, it was time for goodbyes.</p><p>The road home for us translates into a long walk on the shoreline, under an impressive starry sky, barefoot, with the waves placidly bathing our ankles.</p><p>Pura vida.</p><section><figure>
