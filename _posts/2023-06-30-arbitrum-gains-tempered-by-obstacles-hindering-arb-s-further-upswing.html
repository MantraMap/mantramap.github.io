Arbitrum (ARB)&#8217;s gains have been tempered by various challenges, hindering its further upswing. The declining inflows of stablecoins on the Arbitrum network have raised concerns among investors and enthusiasts alike, as it signals potential obstacles for the growth and development of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.Â  As a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, Arbitrum initially garnered significant attention and saw impressive gains, but recent hurdles have dampened the optimism surrounding its future prospects.Â  While the decline in stablecoin inflows is a cause for worry, there are potential avenues for growth that could help revive Arbitrum&#8217;s momentum.Â  Source: Coingecko Resilient Growth Amidst Volatility: ARB Performance Despite facing market volatility, both the Arbitrum protocol and its native token, ARB, have demonstrated remarkable growth.
