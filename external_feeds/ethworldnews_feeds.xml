<ul><li>Ex-congressional candidate Michelle Bond received at least $54,000 from Ryan Salame and other former FTX employees during her campaign in 2022.</li><li>Federal prosecutors are now looking into the money Bond received from boyfriend Salame and up to $880,000 she lent to her own election endeavors, WSJ reported on Tuesday.</li><li>Bond also earned $200,000 a year working for the bankrupt crypto exchange as a consultant.</li><li>This particular probe is separate from the case against FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried for allegedly breaking U.S. campaign finance laws by donating millions of customer funds to political candidates.</li></ul>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-ftx-executive-linked-to-campaign-finance-probe-of-new-york-gop-race-c2b50252" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-ftx-executive-linked-to-campaign-finance-probe-of-new-york-gop-race-c2b50252" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>, federal prosecutors are investigating former FTX exec Ryan Salame and the money he donated to ex-congressional candidate Michelle Bond who also happens to be Salame&#8217;s partner. </p>



<p>Government lawyers are looking into whether Salame and Bond violated U.S. campaign finance laws as investigators probe all the activities of the FTX crypto exchange following its massive crash last year. </p>



<p>Bond received up to $54,000 from boyfriend Salame along with funds from other FTX accounts for her campaign last year. Bong who was aiming for the Long Island congressional seatÂ was also on the company&#8217;s payroll, earning $200,000 per year as a consultant. Investigators are also digging into up to $880,000 that Bond lent to her own campaign.</p>



<p>The probe began in April after authorities seized cellphones belonging to Bond and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/fbi-raids-former-ftx-ryan-salames-house/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/fbi-raids-former-ftx-ryan-salames-house/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Salame in a raid on their $4 million Maryland mansion</a>. </p>



<h2>Prosecutors Set Sights On FTX Execs</h2>



<p>While Salame was not charged in the case against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried for stealing billion in exchange customer funds and defrauding investors, the former company executive is reportedly an unnamed co-conspirator in SBF&#8217;s indictment. </p>



<p>Federal investigators are also probing other former leadership members like Nishad Singh, Caroline Ellison, and Gary Wang. </p>



<p>In other news, the crippled crypto exchange launched a <a href="https://claims.ftx.com/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://claims.ftx.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">claims portal</a> for customers allowing users to access their accounts and submit a filing to be included in the company&#8217;s court bankruptcy proceedings.</p>

<p>Arkham Intel Exchange will not support trading off-chain info, the blockchain intelligence provider said on Tuesday amid speculation that its new platform supports doxxing wallet owners. The company also has a public token sale on Binance and an airdrop for users.</p>



<h2>&#8220;Intel-To-Earn&#8221; Vision Draws Criticism To Arkham&#8217;s Exchange</h2>



<p>Arkham <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/arkham-allow-users-buy-sell-intel-wallets/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/arkham-allow-users-buy-sell-intel-wallets/" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its Intel Exchange for monetizing blockchain information and allowing &#8220;talented on-chain sleuths&#8221; to earn for their work. The platform functions in a quid-pro-quo manner where information seeks post requests for data as bounties and sleuths can claim these bounties for a fee. </p>



<p>Conversely, sleuths or users with in-demand blockchain data can offer their intel for a buy-now price or in auctions. </p>



<p>The announcement was met with controversy and concerns from the crypto community, with many voices agreeing that the tool could be used to dox wallet owners and sell private information. Skeptics also noticed that referral links generated by users revealed their email addresses. </p>

<p>The Aave DAO community will soon vote on a proposal aimed at <a href="https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=268" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=268" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">launching</a> the GHO stablecoin on Ethereum&#8217;s mainnet after months of testing on Goerli, a popular testnet on Ethereum.</p>



<p>If approved, users would be able to mint GHO tokens against their collateral directly on Ethereum&#8217;s main chain. GHO&#8217;s interest rate will be changeable through Aave DAO governance votes. </p>



<p>Proposed by Aave Companies, an active contributor to the DeFi lender, the plan hopes to generate additional revenue for the project&#8217;s DAO. The proposal also would bootstrap competition among stablecoin borrowers on the lender&#8217;s platform, per the AIP. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If approved, the introduction of GHO would make stablecoin borrowing on the Aave Protocol more competitive and generate additional revenue for the Aave DAO by providing to the DAO treasury 100% of the interest payments made on GHO borrows.</p></blockquote>

<h2>GHO Minting Via Aave Facilitators, Aave DAO Plans</h2>



<p>The proposal plans to introduce GHO minting on Ethereum through facilitators &#8211; protocols or entities that are able to burn and mint GHO coins. &#8220;This proposal combined two previously approved Facilitators (the Aave V3 Ethereum Pool and the FlashMinter)&#8221;, the proposal reads. </p>



<p>This means that users have two options for minting GHO tokens. They can either deposit collateral in the V3 Ethereum Mainnet Pool and borrow GHO through Aave V3 Ethereum Pool or lash mint GHO tokens without any collateral using the FlashMinter Facilitator. The latter option requires that users repay the loan in a single transaction. </p>



<p>This AIP also proposes slashing the cost of borrowing GHO by using a mechanism built on Staked Aave (stkAAVE).</p>

<ul><li>Paradigm has filed an amicus brief in the SECâs lawsuit against crypto exchange Bittrex.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto investment firm challenged the securities regulatorâs jurisdiction over crypto secondary markets.&nbsp;</li><li>Paradigm highlighted previous statements by SEC Chair Gensler about the agencyâs lack of authority over secondary markets.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>San Francisco-based Paradigm has filed an amicus brief in the Securities and Exchange Commissionâs lawsuit against Seattle-based crypto exchange Bittrex. The crypto investment firmâs amicus filing comes almost three months after the securities regulator sued the crypto exchange for allegedly operating an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>SEC v Bittrex : An Attempt To Expand Regulator&#8217;s Jurisdiction?</strong></h2>



<p>Rodrigo Sierra Silva, Special Counsel for Paradigm, took to <a href="https://twitter.com/RSSH273/status/1678453989258715136" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> recently to share the news of the crypto investment firmâs amicus brief in SEC v Bittrex. Silva, who previously served as outside counsel to crypto investors and entrepreneurs at Cooley LLP, stated that his companyâs filing was to show the rejection of the SECâs âunsupported attemptâ to expand its jurisdiction over crypto secondary markets.Â </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The SECâs lawsuit against Bittrex is the first of three cases that the SEC has brought in rapid succession against crypto exchanges. Through these actions, the SEC is wrongfully attempting to lay claim over crypto secondary markets.â </p><cite>Rodrigo Silva, Special Counsel for Paradigm</cite></blockquote>



<p>The Paradigm lawyer also cited a Congressional testimony by <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-coinbase-violated-securities-laws/">SEC</a> Chair Gary Gensler, wherein he acknowledged the lack of his agencyâs authority to regulate the secondary markets in question. âThe exchanges trading in these crypto-assets do not have a regulatory framework,â Gensler stated during his testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on May 6, 2021.Â </p>



<p>Silva added that the law hadnât changed since the SEC Chairâs 2021 testimony and called out the securities regulator for somehow discovering the same authority that it previously acknowledged it did not have. Paradigm believes that the regulator doesnât have jurisdiction over secondary markets for crypto assets because they do not involve investment contracts and are, therefore, not securities transactions under the agencyâs remit.</p>

<ul><li>The share price of software firm Microstrategy increased by 7% following a recent projection by Berenberg.&nbsp;</li><li>The investment bank believes that next yearâs Bitcoin halving could trigger a rally in Microstategyâs stock (MSTR).&nbsp;</li><li>Berenburgâs current MSTR price target is $430, which would be an 18-month high.</li></ul>



<p>Hamburg-based Berenberg Capital Markets recently circulated a research note which presented the upcoming <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-pro-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> halving as a potential trigger event for the share price of the United States-based software firm Microstrategy. Berenberg believes that the fourth Bitcoin halving could lead to a considerable rally in the share price of Bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylorâs company.Â </p>



<h2><strong>Berenberg Shares Bullish Price Target For Microstrategy</strong></h2>



<p>According to a research note shared with <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/238784/bitcoin-halving-underpins-bull-case-for-microstrategy-berenberg-says" rel="nofollow noopener">The Block</a>, Berenberg Capital Markets placed most of Microstrategyâs value on the massive Bitcoin holding on its balance sheet, which exceeded a whopping 150,000. The investment bank is counting on the previously seen rally in BTCâs price following the halving event, to trigger a bullish scenario for the share price of Saylorâs company as well.Â </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;If the fourth bitcoin halving features he kind of strong rally in the price of bitcoin that occurred prior to and following the first three halvings, then we believe it is likely that MSTRâs stock would rally along with it; the correlation between the companyâs share price and the price of bitcoin is ~0.90.&#8221;</p><cite>Berenberg Capital Markets</cite></blockquote>



<p>Berenberg currently has a rather bullish price target for Microstrategyâs stock, $430 to be precise. The investment bank believes that the software firmâs share price will reach an 18-month high and deliver numbers that were previously witnessed in January 2022. At the time of writing, the stock was trading at $407.7, up more than 7% over the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previously witnessed trends suggest that Microstrategyâs stock reacts to the price action of Bitcoin. A drop in BTC is usually mirrored by the software companyâs share price. A research report released by Standard Chartered on Monday reinforced MSTRâs bull case. The British banking giant increased its BTC price target and stated that the flagship cryptocurrency could reach $130,000 by the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Dubaiâs Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority has initiated enforcement action against UAE-based crypto exchange BitOasis.&nbsp;</li><li>The local regulator reprimanded the exchange for failure to comply with mandated regulatory conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>VARA has also revoked the MVP license which was granted to the crypto exchange in April 2023.&nbsp;</li><li>VARAâs MVP license was previously described as restrictive by fellow crypto exchange Bybit.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>United Arab Emirates-based crypto exchange BitOasis found itself in regulatory trouble earlier today after Dubaiâs Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) initiated enforcement actions against it. VARAâs crackdown on the Middle East-focused crypto exchange was prompted by the latterâs failure to comply with mandated conditions within the timelines prescribed by the local regulator.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Dubai VARA Suspends BitOasisâ MVP LicenseÂ </strong></h2>



<p>The Virtual Assets Regulatory Committee issued a<a href="https://www.vara.ae/en/" rel="nofollow noopener"> market alert</a> earlier today, informing investors and customers of BitOasis about ongoing supervisory controls and enforcement actions against the crypto exchange. VARAâs reprimand comes just two months after the exchange was issued one of the Emiratesâ first minimum viable product (MVP) operational licenses. The license paved the way for the exchange to secure a permit for market operations in the region pending the fulfillment of key conditions.Â </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>âBitOasis is under review for not meeting mandated conditions, required to be satisfied within 30-60 day time frames prior to being permitted to undertake any VARA regulated market activity.â</p><cite>Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority</cite></blockquote>



<p>The local regulator has suspended BitOasisâ conditional MVP license and announced that the exchangeâs license for Institutional and Qualified Retail Investors had become non-operational. This meant that the crypto exchange would have to work with the regulator to sort out the issues before applying for the Full Market Product (FMP) license. VARA noted in its market warning that it would monitor the situation for regulatory compliance and fulfillment of remedial actions imposed on the exchange.</p>



<p>BitOasis has not issued a statement to address the latest development in its Middle Eastern operations. Fellow crypto exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bybit-cyprus-ahead-mica-implementation/">Bybit</a> was issued an MVP license by VARA last month. At the time, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou described the license as restrictive, adding that it only allowed the crypto exchange to cater to a very restricted set of accredited investors.</p>

The Digital Currency Group (DCG) subsidiary penned a letter to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit earlier today to express its frustration with the SECâs recent conduct.Â </p>



<h2><strong>Grayscale: Leveraged Bitcoin ETF Exposes Investors To Greater Risk</strong></h2>



<p>According to the <a href="https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Grayscale-28j-letter-re-2x-BTC-futures-ETF-7.7.23.pdf?sfclid=00Q5G00000Z914hUAB&amp;utm_source=marketo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=1339&amp;utm_content=cta-button&amp;mkt_tok=MDAwLUVVRS0xMjUAAAGM33BbCUnPwID7Awua0leTsWOSRQ5nff_0ImhaJUCh-0Ptadnx4NM_XNU4FDzksEmlIHnByT61SEvTXQib2FkCEuq9GiAUgJmazWII3pw" rel="nofollow noopener">letter</a> sent to the Columbia District Court, the SECâs decision to allow the trading of Volatility Sharesâ 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX) exposed investors to an investment product that was riskier than Bitcoin futures ETF. The letter was sent by Don Verrilli of Munger, Tolles &amp; Olsen, the law firm which represents Grayscale Investments. The securities regulator approved trading of the BITX ETF starting June 27, 2023. BITX has already accumulated $15 million in assets.Â </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>âThe fact that the Commission has allowed a leveraged bitcoin futures ETP to begin trading demonstrates that the Commission continues to arbitrarily treat spot bitcoin ETPs differently than bitcoin futures ETPs.â </p><cite>Don Verrilli, partner at Munger, Tolles &amp; Olsen</cite></blockquote>



<p>Verrilli stated in his letter that the 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF sought to double the performance of the S&amp;P CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index each day. He added that the Volatility ETF in question exposed investors to even more risks of the BTC markets than Grayscaleâs proposed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP). The letter from Grayscale comes more than a year after it sued the SEC for denying its spot Bitcoin ETF application.</p>

<p></p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/07/10/fmr-sec-chair-jay-clayton-on-u-s-china-relations-were-overly-dependent-on-a-vicious-competitor.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/07/10/fmr-sec-chair-jay-clayton-on-u-s-china-relations-were-overly-dependent-on-a-vicious-competitor.html" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>, the highly regarded former Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  Jay Clayton, expressed strong belief in the approval of a Bitcoin ETF. </p>



<p>According to Clayton, the Bitcoin market may have reached a level of maturation that could potentially warrant regulatory approval for an ETF. The increased institutional adoption and market developments should have addressed many concerns previously held by regulators.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen development to the point where companies whose reputation in the market matters are saying that they think that trading and custody around this market are sufficient,&#8221; said Clayton in the interview. </p>



<p>When asked by the interviewer, &#8220;Can they say NO to a Spot ETF?, Clayton responded &#8220;It would be hard to resist approving a Bitcoin Spot ETF if the spot market has similar efficacy to the futures market. </p>



<p>With an ETF in place, investors would be able to track Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements without direct ownership of the cryptocurrency itself; this approach mitigates some perceived risks associated with holding digital assets.</p>



<p>While acknowledging that the SEC bears primary responsibility for investor protection and market integrity Clayton argued that risks related to a Bitcoin ETF have diminished over time due to regulatory advancements and increased oversight in the marketplace. </p>



<p>Several other countries have already embraced Bitcoin ETFs which highlights that it may be time for the U.S. not to lag behind in embracing such financial innovation.</p>



<p>Despite this positive outlook. Clayton recognized that any proposal for a Bitcoin ETF should undergo a comprehensive review by the SEC to address potential concerns including market manipulation, custody solutions, and investor protection measures. The former chair stressed on conducting thorough due diligence by the SEC in order to mitigate risks associated with this emerging sector within crypto industry. As discussions surrounding a potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF continue, words from an authoritative figure such as Clayton bolster industry experts&#8217; belief that regulatory approval is well overdue for such an investment vehicle. If approved the introduction of a Bitcoin ETF into the American market may unlock significant possibilities for retail as well as institutional investors interested in participating within the regulated cryptocurrency realm securely.</p>

<p>Police in Hong Kong are investigating a crime syndicate after a local accountant was fleeced of HK$1 millionÂ in Tether during an over-the-counter (OTC) exchange in Tsim Sha Tsui.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3216901/hong-kong-retiree-loses-nearly-hk7-million-2-months-online-cryptocurrency-investment-scam?module=hard_link&amp;pgtype=article" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3216901/hong-kong-retiree-loses-nearly-hk7-million-2-months-online-cryptocurrency-investment-scam?module=hard_link&amp;pgtype=article" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">local media</a>, the accountant was lured to the shop after interacting with an Instagram ad offering high exchange rates. The post included contact information which the victim used to arrive at a basement shop in Chevalier House on Chatham Road South, Tsim Sha Tsui.</p>



<p>Sources say the accountant hoped to exchange their $127,750 in Tether&#8217;s stablecoin USDT to HK$1 million in an OTC trade. The scammer who impersonated a shop employee offered &#8220;a bundle of HK$1,000 banknotes on the counter for payment of the transaction,&#8221; said a person familiar with the matter. </p>



<p>The Hong Kong accountant, unaware of the scammer&#8217;s plans, transferred $128,040 in Tether to an e-wallet at their behest. With their booty in hand, the fraudster asked to be excused and disappeared from the shop moments later. </p>



<p>The accountant realized they had been swindled and contacted local police on Sunday evening around 10 pm. Authorities are reportedly investigating whether the shop was specifically set up to steal the accountant&#8217;s digital currency and how deep the syndicate&#8217;s operations run. </p>



<h2>Hong Kong&#8217;s Crypto Streets</h2>



<p>Sunday&#8217;s incident is part of a string of crypto scams besieging Hong Kong&#8217;s burgeoning digital currency ecosystem. Last month, another accountant lost $3.4 million (HK$27 million) to a crypto investment scheme. A retiree lost nearly $1 million of her personal savings to an investment scam in April. It&#8217;s unclear whether cases are unrelated or perpetrated by the same organization.</p>



<p>Hong Kong recently <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/hong-kong-considers-huobi-crypto-license/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/hong-kong-considers-huobi-crypto-license/" rel="noreferrer noopener">approved</a> licensing laws and rules for crypto operators in bid to standardize the local industry and attract firms amid the uncertain regulatory atmosphere orbiting the U.S. digital asset market.</p>

<p>Blockchain intelligence provider Arkham announced a new offering to allow users anonymously buy and sell data about wallet addresses.</p>



<p>On Monday, the startup unveiled &#8220;The Worldâs First On-Chain Intelligence Exchange&#8221; for blockchain sleuths and intel seekers alike. Users of the exchange will be able to post intelligence requests in the form of bounties. Sleuths can then claim these bounties and provide the requested intel for an agreed price. </p>



<p>On-chain sleuths can also offer intel on wallet addresses for a fixed price or via auction to the highest bidder. This &#8220;intel-to-earn&#8221; model will create a liquid market for blockchain information and foster easier monetization for talented on-chain investigators, the intelligence provider said on Monday. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Our vision for the Arkham Intel Exchange is a decentralized intel-to-earn economy powered by smart contracts, in which any sleuth can earn based on their skills &amp; experience. This ushers in a new era for crypto with a much higher standard of transparency and knowledge.</p></blockquote>



<p>Intel traded on the Arkham Intel Exchange will be solely accessible to the buyer for a period of 90 days before it is made public to all users. Arkham said this system will allow the buyer to extract alpha in the short run and ensure decentralization of on-chain knowledge in the long run.
