These include fraud, scams, regulatory uncertainties with digital asset custody, platform vulnerabilities, ambiguous statements from companies, crypto contagions, and others. As banking system regulators, the watchdogs pledged their undivided regulatory diligence. This means increased caution and stricter rules on banking organizations when it comes to digital exposure.
