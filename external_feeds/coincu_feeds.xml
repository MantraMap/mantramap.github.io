<p>All funds and NFTs are safe. No action is needed at this time. The project is suspended and cannot initiate new loans. The suspended state is to protect all assets in the protocol. They confirm that no funds are lost. The project also said that it has successfully executed a white hat recovery script, saving all ERC20 and ERC721 assets of all LPs and borrowers. All information will be updated for users as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Astaria has been in public beta since May 25. The recovery script uses an updated contract implementation and the Recovery Token, which has withdrawn all funds and NFTs to Astaria&#8217;s multi-signature address.</p>



<p>Non-fungible token lending platform Astaria has gone public after a lengthy closed beta period. The platform was co-founded by former decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol SushiSwap CTO Joseph Delong. NFT holders can lease their assets to traders who cannot afford blue-chip NFTs in one purchase. With support for over 300,000 NFTs, Astaria seeks to inject liquidity into the larger Ethereum-based NFT ecosystem.</p>

<p>Unlike other NFT lending platforms that work peer-to-peer with borrowers and lenders, Astaria uses a third party to facilitate its lending market, tapping into its NFT due diligence service. The upshot to acting as a &#8220;strategist&#8221; will help liquidity providers enter the market while assisting borrowers in leasing their properties.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Polygon has proposed upgrading Polygon PoS to a zkEVM validium, which would be a decentralized ZK Layer 2. Polygon PoS in its current state is secured by its validators, rather than by ZK proofs. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Polygon&#8217;s proposal to upgrade Polygon PoS to a zkEVM validium has the potential to revolutionize blockchain technology, with existing validators running a decentralized sequencer and data availability network.</em></li>



<li><em>The upgrade is expected to go live on mainnet by the end of Q1 2024, and its implementation could dramatically improve the speed, efficiency, and security of Polygon&#8217;s blockchain infrastructure.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Polygon has proposed upgrading Polygon PoS to a zkEVM validium, which would be a decentralized ZK Layer 2. Polygon PoS in its current state is secured by its validators, rather than by ZK proofs. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1536.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="511" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1536-1024x511.png" alt="Polygon Proposes Decentralized zkEVM Validium Layer 2 Upgrade For PoS: Report" class="wp-image-196690" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1536-1024x511.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1536-300x150.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1536-768x383.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1536-360x180.png 360w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1536-750x374.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1536.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Polygon Proposes Decentralized zkEVM Validium Layer 2 Upgrade For PoS: Report 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The proposal enables Polygon PoS to become more secure, more performant, and a core part of the Polygon 2.0 ecosystem. With over $2 billion of on-chain assets, tens of thousands of dapps, and an average of 2.5 million transactions per day, the upgrade would be a major achievement. If accepted by the community, it would be the first time that an existing chain of this size and importance adds ZK proofs to become an L2.</p>



<p>Additionally, it allows the entirety of Polygon PoS users, assets, and state to migrate to the Polygon 2.0 ecosystem, which aims to establish Polygon as the Value Layer of the Internet. Polygon 2.0 is powered by ZK technology, with the core belief that every Polygon chain should be a ZK L2. The goal of the upgrade is to enable Polygon PoS to leverage bleeding-edge ZK technology and fit into the Polygon 2.0 vision, ideally without changing anything for users or developers. All applications should continue working, and fees should remain just as low, with the only difference being higher security for users and seamless interoperability with every other chain in the Polygon 2.0 ecosystem.</p>

<p>The upgrade would create a validium, which is the lower-cost, higher-throughput sibling of a rollup. Validiums offer similar security guarantees to rollups, but transaction data is made available off-chain, resulting in significantly lower fees and significantly higher scalability. The only additional cost to run Polygon PoS as a zkEVM validium in the long term would be the cost of generating proofs, which Polygon Labsâs ZK teams have already made incredible progress in reducing. The cost to prove a 10 million gas batch on Polygon zkEVM is just $0.0259, or $0.00005 per transfer.</p>



<p>As a result, Polygon PoS coexists with Polygon zkEVM rollup, with both networks using bleeding-edge zkEVM technology. Polygon zkEVM rollup is a great fit for high-value DeFi applications, while upgraded Polygon PoS (zkEVM validium) would be a great fit for applications that have high transaction volume and require low transaction fees, such as Web3 gaming and social and micro DeFi.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Bankrupt crypto project Voyager Digital will reopen its app and allow customers to withdraw funds almost a year after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</p>



<p>Voyager bankruptcy plan manager Paul Hage said in a June 14 court filing that around June 15, its app would be updated to show the amount that can be withdrawn, and the estimated withdrawal period will be from June 20 to July 5.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1534.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="315" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1534.png" alt="Voyager Transfers Tokens From Hot Wallet May Be Related To Reopen Withdrawal" class="wp-image-196679" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1534.png 600w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1534-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="Voyager Transfers Tokens From Hot Wallet May Be Related To Reopen Withdrawal 5"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This plan was first approved by the court on May 17, and it is expected that customers will receive 35.72% of their funds within 30 days of requesting withdrawal.</p>



<p>In the filing, Hage also noted that Three Arrows Capital had gone bankrupt and still owed Voyager $650 million. As such, this initial withdrawal only allows for the withdrawal of more than 35% of client funds, and &#8220;the main focus will shift to recovering additional assets that can be distributed to creditors&#8221; upon completion of the initial distribution.</p>



<p>Additionally, $445 million of customer funds could be returned to creditors pending the final resolution of Alameda Research&#8217;s priority claim for Voyager. It is not expected to happen at least until mid-September 2023.</p>



<p>Voyager is a lending project that went bankrupt after the 3AC fund collapsed. The main reason behind this was that the project needed more money because the 3AC fund refused to pay the debt of $650 million.</p>

<p>Voyager initially agreed to sell it back to FTX for $1.4 billion in October 2022 but failed because FTX went bankrupt.</p>



<p>Subsequently, Binance offered to acquire Voyager for $1 billion. However, this deal was withdrawn due to obstructions by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bitcoin (BTC) price is approaching the $29,000 mark with a gain of more than 6% after receiving support from a series of significant funds.</em></li>



<li><em>Wisdomtree is the seventh company to apply for a spot in Bitcoin ETF in less than a week.</em></li>



<li><em>This shows that these big players want a legal environment that is clearer and fairer than today.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In the gloomy regulatory environment of the United States, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195689-bitcoin-is-exciting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> has received a strong cheer, with a nearly 7% increase in the past 24 hours from the uprising of a series of traditional asset management companies.</strong></h5>

<p>In less than a week, seven major asset managers have filed applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF with the SEC, including Blackrock, Fidelity, Citadel, Charles Schwab, Deutsche Bank, MasterCard, and WisdomTree. Bitcoin has recorded a 6.5% gain in the past 24 hours towards $28,900.</p>



<p>This momentum is largely due to the fact that <a href="https://news.coincu.com/196656-wisdomtree-enters-spot-bitcoin-etf-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WisdomTree</a> today participated in the registration drive. Earlier, banking giant Deutsche Bank said on Tuesday that it had applied for a digital asset custody license in Germany. Cryptocurrency exchange EDX Markets, which has received funding from financial heavyweights including Charles Schwab (SCHW), Citadel Securities, and Fidelity Digital Assets, has begun offering trading with BTC and ether (ETH) on the same day. Last week, investment management giant BlackRock (BLK) surprised the market by applying to a spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF).</p>

<p>The bitcoin rally is certainly correlated with the news that all these larger traditional financial institutions are looking to get serious exposure to the digital asset ecosystem following the regulatory pressures of the day. US, including lawsuits against cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Coinbase.</p>



<p>The ETF applications reflect the industry&#8217;s effort to provide investors with regulated options for participating in the Bitcoin market and highlight the growing recognition of Bitcoin&#8217;s potential in the financial tradition.</p>



<p>This news has softened the relatively bleak regulatory environment in the United States. And it also suggests that these big players are looking for a regulatory environment that is both clearer and fairer than today.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[New York-based major asset management firm WisdomTree has applied for approval to launch the WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust (WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust).]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Another big player in the wealth management space, Wisdomtree, has joined the registration of a spot Bitcoin ETF.</em></li>



<li><em>In the application, the company outlined its investment objective as exposure to the bitcoin price while considering the costs and liabilities associated with the operation of the ETF.</em></li>



<li><em>In less than a week, seven companies filed for a bitcoin ETF showing a new wave of institutional investors entering the bitcoin market.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New York-based major asset management firm WisdomTree<a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1850391/000121465923008647/p620230s1a2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> has applied</a> for approval to launch the WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust (WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust), which will be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1528.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="766" height="476" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1528.png" alt="Big Asset Management Wisdomtree Enters Spot Bitcoin ETF Race" class="wp-image-196660" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1528.png 766w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1528-300x186.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1528-750x466.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px" title="Big Asset Management Wisdomtree Enters Spot Bitcoin ETF Race 9"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In the filing, WisdomTree outlined its investment goal of Bitcoin price exposure while considering the fees and liabilities associated with ETF operations. The company intends to price these funds daily based on the US Bitcoin CF settlement price, which aggregates trading flows from major Bitcoin spot exchanges.</p>



<p>WisdomTree&#8217;s approach involves &#8220;in-kind&#8221; transactions with authorized participants, allowing them to distribute bitcoins or facilitate the distribution of bitcoins to the trust&#8217;s custodians, National Bankers Association.</p>



<p>This filing comes after <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195477-blackrock-to-expand-more-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlackRock&#8217;s</a> recent application for a spot Bitcoin ETF, signaling the growing interest and recognition of bitcoin in the traditional financial space.</p>



<p>The documents show that the fund will be named &#8220;iShares Bitcoin Trust (iShares Bitcoin Trust)&#8221; and that its assets &#8220;will consist primarily of bitcoin held by custodians representing the fund.&#8221; The document states that the custodian is a crypto exchange Coinbase.</p>



<p>Although the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved a number of bitcoin futures ETFs, it has rejected applications for spot bitcoin ETFs from all asset managers, including Grayscale, VanEck and WisdomTree.</p>

<p>In less than a week, a series of large asset management organizations such as Blackrock, Fidelity, Citadel, Charles Schwab, Deutsche Bank, MasterCard, and WisdomTree have all simultaneously targeted the spot ETF. This reflects the industry&#8217;s attempt to provide investors with regulated options to participate in the bitcoin market, albeit at the expense of assets dedicated to the sovereign use of bitcoin.</p>



<p>In addition, the registration actions also highlight the growing recognition of Bitcoin&#8217;s potential in traditional finance. By signing up for a spot ETF, these asset management giants are acknowledging the need for managed investment vehicles in the space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Polygon Labs suggested an update to zkEVM validium, a Layer 2 network protected by Ethereum, for its flagship Polygon PoS sidechain.</em></li>



<li><em>The update attempts to bring the present Polygon PoS chain in line with the Polygon 2.0 goal.</em></li>



<li><em>If accepted by the Polygon community, the huge update would boost security and make the blockchain foundation more &#8220;future-proof.&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On Tuesday, Polygon, an Ethereum scaling solution, published a pre-proposal discussion post to make its primary chain, the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/184349-polygon-pos-bridge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polygon PoS</a> chain, compatible with zero knowledge (ZK) technology.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1524.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1524.png" alt="Caution: Layer 2 Polygon Wants To Upgrade Polygon PoS Chain Compatible With zkEVM" class="wp-image-196649" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1524.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1524-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1524-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1524-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Caution: Layer 2 Polygon Wants To Upgrade Polygon PoS Chain Compatible With zkEVM 11"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to the proposal, the update intends to connect the present Polygon PoS chain with the concept for Polygon 2.0, a future version of Polygon that employs zkEVM validium, a sort of zero-knowledge scaling technology.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1526.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1526-1024x576.png" alt="Caution: Layer 2 Polygon Wants To Upgrade Polygon PoS Chain Compatible With zkEVM" class="wp-image-196651" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1526-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1526-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1526-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1526-1536x864.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1526-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1526-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1526.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Caution: Layer 2 Polygon Wants To Upgrade Polygon PoS Chain Compatible With zkEVM 12"></a></figure></div>


<p>The proposal, named &#8220;Polygon 2.0,&#8221; <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-2-0-polygon-pos-zk-layer-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">indicates</a> that it intends to employ Polygon&#8217;s in-house zkEVM to improve the security and efficiency of the sidechain while maintaining its low fees. This would be distinct from the team&#8217;s current zkEVM, which was released in March 2023.</p>



<p>The update would still be Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible. A validium varies from a ZK rollup in that it employs an off-chain data availability architecture. Polygon also provides a ZK rollup, which became live in March.</p>



<p>According to Polygon co-founder Mihailo Bjelic&#8217;s blog post, if accepted by the Polygon community, the massive update would boost security and make the blockchain foundation more &#8220;future-proof.&#8221;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1527.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1527-1024x576.png" alt="Caution: Layer 2 Polygon Wants To Upgrade Polygon PoS Chain Compatible With zkEVM" class="wp-image-196652" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1527-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1527-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1527-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1527-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1527-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1527.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Caution: Layer 2 Polygon Wants To Upgrade Polygon PoS Chain Compatible With zkEVM 13"></a></figure></div>


<p>Polygon Labs said that the updated Polygon PoS and the old zkEVM would coexist inside the Polygon ecosystem. If the update is authorized, it might be deployed on the mainnet by the end of 2024.</p>



<p>Moreover, Bjelic claims that this improvement would reduce reorgs, allow for speedier transaction confirmations, and enable the blockchain to grow.</p>



<p>The upgrade will be the first time an existing chain has included ZK proofs and advanced to Layer 2. In terms of daily transactions, Polygon is now one of the most actively utilized blockchains in the crypto market, with over $2 billion in on-chain assets.</p>

<p>Commissioner Mairead McGuinness said that she would go forward with a measure to support the central bank&#8217;s digital currency, which would address issues like privacy, distribution, and offline transactions. Earlier, there were sources that the bill <a href="https://news.coincu.com/196295-european-pauses-digital-euro-support-law/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would not be introduced on time</a>.</p>



<p>McGuinness also stated the digital euro ambitions and a related bill on the legal status of currency at a Brussels event.</p>

<p><em>Bloomberg</em> stated on June 14 that it had obtained a copy of a draft proposal from the European Commission. In terms of financial stability, the advice may compel the ECB to limit the use of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).</p>



<p>According to the leaked law, the new CBDC would have to be accessible for cash-style offline payments from the start, and users would not be able to design it to restrict future usage.</p>



<p>In the case of offline transactions, neither the European Central Bank nor payment service providers will have access to personal transaction data, though banks that distribute the currency can send financial crime authorities information about how accounts are funded if they suspect money laundering.</p>

<p>The CBDC&#8217;s plans have aroused concerns that they may lead to governmental spying or usurp the status of banknotes and coins.</p>



<p>After studying technical specifics for many years, the European Central Bank is expected to make a decision later this year on whether to proceed with the initiative.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Reserve, the stablecoin protocol, has launched a $20 million power move in the Curve Wars.</em></li>



<li><em>Since its inception in 2020, the protocol&#8217;s eUSD RToken has generated $5.7 billion in transaction volume in South America using the protocol&#8217;s RPay app.</em></li>



<li><em>It is now one of the top ten largest CVX holders.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a June 20 announcement, stablecoin protocol Reserve is investing $20 million in the governance tokens of yield farming applications Curve, Convex, and Stake DAO.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1519.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="465" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1519-1024x465.png" alt="Stablecoin Protocol Reserve To Join Curve Wars With $20 Million Investment" class="wp-image-196638" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1519-1024x465.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1519-300x136.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1519-768x349.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1519-750x341.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1519.png 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Stablecoin Protocol Reserve To Join Curve Wars With $20 Million Investment 17"></a></figure></div>


<p>The investment aims to boost the liquidity of the Reserve&#8217;s stablecoins, known as RTokens. The protocol will purchase governance tokens from Curve, Convex Finance, and StakeDAO in its biggest investment to yet.</p>



<p>Reserve, based in California, is the company behind the Reserve Protocol, which enables users to create asset-backed stablecoins known as RTokens that are tied to the US dollar.</p>



<p>Reserve is a stablecoin system that enables users to build their own currencies that may be backed by any asset. It has established stablecoins such as Electronic USD (eUSD), High-Yield USD (hyUSD), Reserve (RSV), Reserve Dollar (RSD), and ETH+.</p>



<p>Since its inception in 2020, the protocol&#8217;s eUSD RToken has generated $5.7 billion in transaction volume in Latin America using the protocol&#8217;s RPay app. Other RTokens include the dollar-pegged stablecoin High Yield USD and the Ether staking index ETHPlus.</p>

<p>Reserve was already the seventh-largest holder of Convex tokens before to the news, behind only Mochi, Redacted, JPGd, Badger, Clever, and FRAX. These tokens were obtained as a result of the protocol&#8217;s significant usage of Convex to generate yield for its users.</p>



<p>PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman are among those who have invested in the firm. Coinbase Ventures and the crypto giant Digital Currency Group have also invested in the company.</p>



<p>According to the team, this additional $20 million investment may enable new RToken features like collateralized loans, wallet solutions, tokenizing real-world assets, and more transparent financial platforms.</p>



<p>The $20 million investment may come as pleasant news to CRV token holders since CRV hit a one-year low on June 15. The new low was partly related to the scandal over suspected Aave loans taken out by Curve&#8217;s founder.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1518.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="614" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1518.png" alt="Stablecoin Protocol Reserve To Join Curve Wars With $20 Million Investment" class="wp-image-196637" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1518.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1518-300x180.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1518-768x461.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1518-750x450.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Stablecoin Protocol Reserve To Join Curve Wars With $20 Million Investment 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>Reserve is already one of the top ten largest holders of CVX, Convex Finance&#8217;s governance token. But, according to DAO CVX Tracker, its 970,000 CVX governance tokens are dwarfed by the likes of Frax, which possesses over 3.6 million token.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The former Chairman of the CFTC called the SEC&#8217;s attack on exchanges &#8220;boring.&#8221;</em></li>



<li><em>He emphasized that the ancient Bitcoin players did not need to exchange for a long time.</em></li>



<li><em>Investors are still focused on the outcome of the lawsuit between the SEC and the exchanges.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Christopher Giancarlo, the former Chairman of the United States Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has <a href="https://twitter.com/giancarloMKTS/status/1671164989149966336" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> on the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) much-discussed crackdown on the Coinbase exchange.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/104974179-GettyImages-865972522.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/104974179-GettyImages-865972522-1024x683.jpg" alt="Former CFTC Chairman Criticizes SEC&#039;s Lawsuit Against Exchanges As Boring" class="wp-image-196628" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/104974179-GettyImages-865972522-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/104974179-GettyImages-865972522-300x200.jpg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/104974179-GettyImages-865972522-768x512.jpg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/104974179-GettyImages-865972522-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/104974179-GettyImages-865972522-750x500.jpg 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/104974179-GettyImages-865972522-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/104974179-GettyImages-865972522.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Former CFTC Chairman Criticizes SEC&#039;s Lawsuit Against Exchanges As Boring 20"></a></figure></div>


<p>Giancarlo has long been pro-crypto innovation as a former CFTC Chairman, and his support post-office has earned him the title &#8220;Crypto Dad.&#8221;</p>



<p>Although not explicitly commenting on whether the SEC will prevail in the litigation it has filed against these exchanges, the opinion is that the crackdown, if successful, would just shift the timescale for which blockchain and cryptocurrencies will dominate the administration of value.</p>



<p>Giancarlo mirrored the views of crypto advocate James Harper, who said that although the market regulator&#8217;s enforcement action is necessary, the strategy is &#8220;boring.&#8221;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1514.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1514-1024x576.png" alt="Former CFTC Chairman Criticizes SEC&#039;s Lawsuit Against Exchanges As Boring" class="wp-image-196629" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1514-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1514-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1514-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1514-1536x864.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1514-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1514-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1514.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Former CFTC Chairman Criticizes SEC&#039;s Lawsuit Against Exchanges As Boring 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>In support of this position, Harper emphasized how ancient Bitcoiners do not need an exchange in the long run, particularly when transactional possibilities are built into the utility for which they keep the asset.</p>



<p>The chances of the SEC winning in its case against Coinbase and Binance are now being debated in the community, with many experts feeling the regulator&#8217;s crackdown is an overreach of its regulatory authority. The platforms are eager to defend their claims in court, following in the footsteps of Ripple Labs, which has been fighting the SEC for more than two and a half years.</p>



<p>Thinking about events and the expected price fluctuations surrounding them is one of the more difficult components of investing. What happened in the cryptocurrency market when the SEC initiated action against Binance and Coinbase was a prime example.</p>

<p>Since <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195558-coinbase-boosts-shareholder-value/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> had previously gotten a Wells Notice, more regulatory action against the company was arguably more likely than against Binance. Consider the enforcement case against Binance, a company with no recognized physical headquarters, which makes it unclear how the SEC would examine it.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/167030-iris-energy-increases-self-mining-capacity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Iris Energy</a> announced that construction of the remaining 80MW of data centers for Phase 1 (the first 100MW) of its 600MW Childress facility had begun. The next four 20MW data centers are estimated to enhance the Company&#8217;s potential operational capacity by 63% (from 5.6 EH/s to 9.1 EH/s1) and are scheduled to be completed in early 2042.</p>



<p>With $64 million in cash, no debt, operational cashflows from its current 5.6 EH/s, and extra flexibility from its committed equity facility, the firm is well funded.</p>



<p>Applied Digital Company, Crusoe Energy, and Hut 8 Mining are among the miners that have lately expanded into other sorts of computing. AI data center space demand is expected to reach $76 billion by 2028, with huge language models like OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT becoming more popular.</p>

<p>Miners&#8217; access to inexpensive electricity and data center infrastructure may make it seem simple for them to transition to AI and cloud computing. Yet, in terms of operational quality, uptime, and customer service, the needs of high-performance computing businesses vary dramatically from those of mining.</p>



<p>Iris Energy also said that their HPC data center plan is now a parallel emphasis while preserving flexibility on the miner acquisition schedule, which is dependent on financing and market circumstances. In 2020, the firm and Dell Technologies inked a strategic agreement of understanding to test and develop possible data center solutions for energy-intensive computing workloads.</p>
