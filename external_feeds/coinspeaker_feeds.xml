										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/yen-level-us-dollar-2022/">Japanese Yen Slumps to Lowest Level Against US Dollar Since November 2022</a></p>
<p>The Japanese yen experienced a massive decline on Monday, August 14, slipping to its lowest level against the US dollar for the first time since November 2022. This downward trajectory resulted in the yen breaking through the crucial 145 mark. According to a CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/14/yen-breaches-145-level-against-usd-raises-expectations-boj-may-intervene.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report,</a> the currency briefly touched the same level last Friday before eventually recovering some ground.</p>
<p>The decline has brought about speculation that the country&#8217;s central bank, the Bank of Japan (BOJ), may intervene to restore the value of the Japanese currency. A recent Forex report released by HSBC on Monday provided insights into the potential outcomes of the bank&#8217;s support.</p>
<p>The report suggested that the Japanese Ministry of Finance might consider intervention within the range of 145-148 to stabilize the yen&#8217;s decline. It&#8217;s worth noting that both the BOJ and the Japanese government had previously intervened by purchasing yen when it <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/japanese-yen-24-year-low-yield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breached</a> the 145-to-dollar exchange rate in September 2022. One month after the government got involved, the currency <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/japanese-yen-falls-dollar-32-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declined</a> further to 150% against the US dollar.</p>
<h2>Japanese Bonds Hit 10-Year High As BOJ Modifies Policy</h2>
<p>However, HSBC also noted the possibility of short positions on the yen increasing further if the BOJ and Japanese authorities choose not to intervene this time.</p>
<p>The report highlighted that these positions had been reduced by over 30% in July, coinciding with the buildup to the BOJ&#8217;s monetary policy meeting on July 28. The BOJ said during the conference that it would offer to purchase 10-year Japanese government bonds at a fixed rate of 1% in a move that aims to expand the trading band on long-term yields.</p>
<p>The central bank further stated that it would still maintain the previous 0.5% cap on these yields, making it look more like a reference point rather than a rigid limit. Reacting to the news, the country&#8217;s bonds surged to a 10-year high of 0.572% two weeks ago.</p>
<h2>US Dollar Hits One Month High Despite Plummeting Yen</h2>
<p>While the Japanese currency is headed towards a downward trajectory, the US dollar has displayed a strong uptrend since the close of July, with the dollar index surging from its July 13 low of 99.77 to its current level of 102.99.</p>
<p>HSBC drew attention to a &#8220;new factor&#8221; contributing to the strength of the dollar – particularly, the elevated longer-term US yields due to concerns about the country&#8217;s budget deficit and treasury supply. The bank acknowledged that this might be a temporary phenomenon, occurring alongside the existing USD framework that is not signaling a robust downtrend for the US dollar.</p>
<h2>Japan to Unveil Its Gross Domestic Product Tomorrow</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Japan is gearing up to reveal its gross domestic product (GDP) data for the quarter ending in June on Tuesday, August 15.</p>
<p>Additionally, inflation figures for July are set to be released later this Friday. <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/hsbc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HSBC</a> highlighted that any deviations in the data could strengthen negative sentiments.</p>
<p>Market experts are projecting a 0.8% growth in GDP on a quarter-on-quarter basis, and the core consumer price index, excluding fresh food prices, is expected to reach 3.1%, as a Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/yen-breaks-above-145dlr-level-choppy-trading-dollar-firm-2023-08-14/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">poll</a> indicates.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coca-cola-masterpiece-nft-collection-on-base/">Coca-Cola Launches Masterpiece NFT Collection on Base</a></p>

<p>The household brand name <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coca-cola/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coca-Cola</a> has launched its Masterpiece NFT collection on the Coinbase layer-2 network, Base. Recall that last week, the Base mainnet officially <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-base-network-live-web3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened to the general public</a> with over 100 Dapps and service providers.</p>
<p>Coinbase <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1690763490674503680" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> Coca-Cola&#8217;s NFT launch as part of its “Onchain Summer” initiative which began on August 9. The OnChain Summer initiative is to celebrate Base’s mainnet launch with on-chain art, gaming, and music projects. The aim is to demonstrate the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the Layer 2 chain.</p>
<h2>About the Masterpiece NFT Collection</h2>
<p>The Coca-Cola NFT collection features either a classic or a modern artwork, intertwined with the iconic Coca-Cola bottle. Classics such as &#8220;The Scream&#8221; by Edvard Munch and &#8220;Girl with a Pearl Earring&#8221; by Johannes Vermeer are used in the collection. The collection includes eight NFT versions, available from 0.0011 ETH to 0.014 ETH.</p>
<p>“Coca-Cola is bringing their Global Masterpiece campaign on-chain with iconic works from leading artists,” the announcement said.</p>
<p>Since announcing the mint on Sunday, nearly 50,000 NFTs have been minted via the mint.fun platform. One can expect that many more will be minted with the minting period not due to end until Wednesday.</p>
<h2>Not the First Rodeo</h2>
<p>This is not Coca-Cola’s first foray into the world of NFTs. In July 2021, Coca-Cola auctioned its first-ever NFTs as a single asset. <a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/media-center/coca-cola-nft-auction-fetches-more-than-575000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The auction</a> was a big hit with fans and the crypto community and sold for over $575k. The proceeds were then donated to Special Olympics International. Later in July 2022, the company launched another 136 digital collectibles to celebrate Pride Month.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola is not the first major brand to join the NFT craze. Other companies such as Nike, Asics, Louis Vuitton, Mattel Creations and Taco Bell have all launched NFT collections in recent months. However, Coca-Cola&#8217;s Masterpiece NFT collection is unique in its use of Base. The brand could very well be the largest consumer brand to be involved with Base so far.</p>
<p>Later this month, other digital collectible projects like Zora, Pixelmon, Showtime, and Indelible are also expected to launch on Base. As more brands follow suit, it will be interesting to see how Base paves the way for more mainstream adoption of NFTs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mastercard-minority-stake-mtn/">Mastercard to Acquire Minority Stake in MTN’s Fintech Business</a></p>
<p>MTN Group Ltd (JSE: MTN), Africa’s largest wireless carrier, has announced that <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/mastercard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mastercard Inc</a> (NYSE: MA) is planning to purchase a minority stake in its financial technology business. This investment deal values the fintech arm at approximately $5.2 billion, representing almost 40% of MTN&#8217;s total market value.</p>
<p>MTN’s Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Mupita stated in a recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-14/mastercard-to-buy-stake-in-mtn-s-5-2-billion-fintech-unit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> that the signing of the definitive investment agreements between MTN and Mastercard is anticipated to take place in the near term.</p>
<h2>Promise of the MTN-Mastercard Partnership</h2>
<p>This strategic partnership with Mastercard holds immense promise for both companies. MTN’s extensive reach across the African continent, combined with Mastercard’s expertise in secure payment technology, is poised to accelerate the growth and accessibility of fintech services in the region.</p>
<p>This influx of funds can serve as a temporary substitute for dividends from subsidiaries, providing financial flexibility and allowing MTN to address short-term financial needs or allocate resources to strategic initiatives.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the cash injection from Mastercard’s investment can partly offset the impact of increased 2023 capital spending guidance for MTN, which has been affected by forex (foreign exchange) fluctuations.</p>
<p>This balance-sheet reinforcement, combined with Mastercard&#8217;s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mastercard-acquires-ciphertrace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expertise</a> in payment technology and financial services will position MTN to pursue its digital transformation efforts and expand its fintech offerings more aggressively.</p>
<p>Mastercard&#8217;s investment in MTN’s mobile money unit reflects a broader industry trend, with companies such as Airtel Africa and Safaricom likewise focusing on transitioning from basic voice and text mobile services to comprehensive digital solutions. This precedent, set by other industry giants like India&#8217;s Jio Platforms Ltd, underscores the importance of collaboration and strategic investment in driving innovation and growth in the digital economy.</p>
<p>As MTN seeks to raise funds through asset sales, including the sale and lease-back of mobile-phone towers and potentially divesting its stake in IHS Holding Ltd., the market will closely watch the execution of these plans, as they could further enhance MTN’s financial position and support its growth objectives.</p>
<h2>MTN Reports Impressive Half-Year Earnings</h2>
<p>In the midst of this strategic partnership, MTN has delivered impressive financial results for the first half of the year. The company revealed a 7.1% increase in its half-year earnings.</p>
<p>MTN reported that its headline earnings per share (EPS), a key measure of profitability, rose from 506 cents in the same period the previous year to 542 cents in the first six months of the current year. This robust financial performance signals the company’s resilience and adaptability in a dynamic market environment.</p>
<p>The company has faced operational challenges due to frequent power outages, which compelled it to allocate substantial capital to backup power systems. Despite these hurdles, MTN has remained proactive in its pursuit of strategic partnerships that could enhance its fintech offerings.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/anthropic-100m-investment-sk-telecom/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/anthropic-100m-investment-sk-telecom/">Google-backed AI Firm Anthropic Secures $100M Investment from SK Telecom</a></p>
<p>US-based artificial intelligence startup Anthropic PBC announced that it has secured a staggering $100 million in investments from South Korea&#8217;s largest telecommunications company SK Telecom. With this investment, SK Telecom also seeks to bolster its telecommunications-driven AI business.</p>
<p>The two players have entered into a partnership wherein Anthropic will build large language models (LLMs) customized or telcos. Anthropic is already competing with players like OpenAI in building different AI foundation models. It also stands to be one of the most well-funded AI firms in the market. earlier this year in May 2023, Anthropic raised $450 million from investors such as Spark Capital and Alphabet Inc&#8217;s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a>.</p>
<p>Established in 2021 by CEO Dario Amodei and his sister Daniela, both of whom were former senior team members at OpenAI, Anthropic&#8217;s mission revolves around creating trustworthy AI systems and conducting research on the potentials and challenges of AI.</p>
<p>Unlike OpenAI, Anthropic takes a different approach. While OpenAI employs reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to enhance safety and minimize risks, Anthropic utilizes reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF). This feedback mechanism involves one AI model correcting another based on a set of &#8220;rules or principles,&#8221; known as &#8220;Constitutional AI&#8221; by Anthropic.</p>
<p>As part of their collaboration, SK Telecom and Anthropic are set to co-create a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM), catering to various languages like Korean, English, German, Japanese, Arabic, and Spanish.</p>
<p>The two entities, SK Telecom, and Anthropic, are collaborating to integrate this multilingual LLM into the Telco AI Platform, which is currently under development by the Global Telco AI Alliance.</p>
<h2>Anthropic&#8217;s Claude 2 Model</h2>
<p>Anthropic&#8217;s Claude series of large language models (LLMs) have been in direct competition with OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT. Recently, Anthropic unveiled its Claude 2 model in order to compete with ChatGPT-4.</p>
<p>Anthropic asserts that Claude 2 boasts enhanced performance, longer response capabilities. Users can now access them through an API, along with its new public beta website called Claude.ai. Marketed as a relatively &#8220;harmless&#8221; AI system, Claude can handle a diverse range of conversational and text-related tasks.</p>
<p>The company further <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude-2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">added</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We have heard from our users that Claude is easy to converse with, clearly explains its thinking, is less likely to produce harmful outputs and has a longer memory. We have made improvements from our previous models on coding, math and reasoning&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Merely a week ago, Anthropic introduced an upgraded edition of Claude Instant, a swifter and more cost-effective text-generation model accessible via an API. The company asserts that this new version exhibits &#8220;substantial&#8221; enhancements in domains like mathematics, coding, reasoning, and safety.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-cyber-sei-tokens/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-cyber-sei-tokens/">Binance Lists CyberConnect (CYBER) and Sei (SEI) Tokens, Set to Begin Trading within 24 Hours</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a>, the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, has <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-open-trading-for-cyberconnect-cyber-and-sei-sei-fe281e1fa6e7493788969242995ba04a" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> the listing of its new projects – CyberConnect (CYBER) and Sei (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-sei-36th-project/">SEI</a>). According to the announcement, the tokens are set to go live on August 15, 2023, at 12:00 (UTC). And for a start, both tokens will only be able to trade on five pairs. That is, the platform will allow CYBER to trade on CYBER/BNB, CYBER/BTC, CYBER/FDUSD, CYBER/TRY, and CYBER/USDT. Similarly, it will open trading for SEI on the SEI/BNB, SEI/BTC, SEI/FDUSD, SEI/TRY, and SEI/USDT trading pairs.</p>
<p>Although only three trading pairs will be immediately available, Binance, says it will enable its Spot Grid for the CYBER/BTC, CYBER/USDT, SEI/BTC, and SEI/USDT trading pairs within 48 hours after trading launches.</p>
<p>Binance also notes that it will apply Seed Tag to CYBER and SEI. However, it was also quick to clarify that the &#8216;TRY&#8217; in its trading pairs is not another digital currency, but rather a fiat currency. And for the CYBER/FDUSD and SEI/FDUSD trading pairs, Binance says users will enjoy zero maker fees, at least for now.</p>
<h2>CYBER and SEI Tokens</h2>
<p>CYBER is the native token of the web3 social network CyberConnect, which enables developers to create social apps that focus on helping users gain full ownership of their digital identity and content. Per Binance, the total token supply of CYBER is 100,000,000. However, once listed on Binance, CYBER&#8217;s initial circulating supply is expected to be 11,038,000 ( about 11.04% of the total supply).</p>
<p>SEI, on the other hand, is layer 1 blockchain Sei Network&#8217;s native token. SEI&#8217;s circulating supply upon listing will be 1.8 billion or 18% of the total supply of 10 billion, <a href="https://research.binance.com/en/projects/sei#:~:text=The%20project%20has%20raised%2035MM,of%20the%20total%20token%20supply)." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-vars-slk="per Binance" data-vars-tar="research.binance.com" data-vars-tar-uri="/en/projects/sei">per Binance</a>. However, it has been tipped to reach nearly a half-billion market cap on debut.

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/paypal-cryptocurrencies-hub-pyusd/">PayPal Unveils Cryptocurrencies Hub Following PYUSD Stablecoin Launch</a></p>
<p>Leading American payment company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayPal</a> has taken another step into the digital asset industry with the launch of its Cryptocurrencies Hub. This feature allows users to interact with different crypto assets such as Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) and Ethereum (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH</a>). The move comes just one week after introducing its native <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/stablecoins-how-manage-operate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stablecoin</a> dubbed PYUSD, which is backed 1:1 by the US dollar.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/paypal-cryptocurrencies-hub-launch" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> by Cointelegraph, the payment giant updated its terms and conditions to offer insights into how users can leverage the newly introduced Cryptocurrencies Hub to explore the world of digital assets. This strategic maneuver demonstrates the company&#8217;s ambition to establish itself as a prominent crypto-friendly platform.</p>
<p>PayPal&#8217;s foray into the emerging economy began in October 2020 when the company expanded its services to allow users to buy, sell, and hold assets in their accounts. Shortly after that, in March 2021, the company extended its crypto services, enabling customers to checkout at other online businesses using cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2>PayPal Unveils Its Cryptocurrencies Hub</h2>
<p>The US-based payments company has now deepened its foothold in the industry with the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/paypal-paypal-usd-stablecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> of the controversial stablecoin and the subsequent introduction of the Cryptocurrencies Hub. This new feature aims to facilitate the seamless buying and selling of cryptocurrencies. Notably, it empowers users to use the proceeds from their crypto transactions to purchase through the PayPal platform.</p>
<p>Upon its official launch, the Cryptocurrencies Hub will be seamlessly integrated with users&#8217; existing PayPal accounts, accessible using their existing login credentials.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the new crypto offering is designed to enable swift conversions between PYUSD and a diverse range of other digital assets. According to the company, any balance shown in the Cryptocurrencies Hub represents the total amount of each asset displayed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any balance in your Cryptocurrencies Hub represents your ownership of the amount of each Crypto Asset shown. You will not hold the digital Crypto Assets themselves in your Crypto Asset balance,&#8221; the company explained in the newly updated terms of service.</p>
<h2>Hawaii Users Are Exempted from Using PayPal&#8217;s New Service</h2>
<p>While PayPal&#8217;s new crypto service allows users to explore the crypto industry, access to this innovative feature has been restricted in certain jurisdictions and for specific individuals. The company has chosen a personalized approach to grant access to the newly introduced service.</p>
<p>According to the payment firm, to be eligible for the Cryptocurrencies Hub, new users must open a personal PayPal account and maintain a Balance Account in good standing. Additionally, users must provide key identification information, including their full name, physical address, date of birth, and taxpayer identification number.</p>
<p>However, these rules do not apply to Hawaii residents as the company has excluded them from using the new crypto service.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your access to the Cryptocurrencies Hub will be through your personal PayPal account&#8217;s Balance Account. If you are a Hawaii resident, you will not be permitted to set up a Cryptocurrencies Hub at this time,&#8221; the company said.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/crypto-mom-hester-peirce-gensler-sec/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/crypto-mom-hester-peirce-gensler-sec/">Former SEC Official Predicts Crypto Mom Hester Peirce to Replace Gensler as SEC Chair</a></p>
<p>Former <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a> official John Reed Stark has recently weighed on the state of the current spot Bitcoin ETF applications and why he doesn&#8217;t expect any approval this year. Earlier in June, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) received several applications from giant financial players like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock</a>, Bitwise, and others.</p>
<p>However, Reed Stark predicts that the regulatory situation on crypto enforcement would take a u-turn if a Republican candidate takes over the US Presidency after the 2024 elections. In a tweet on August 13, the ex-SEC Office of Internet Enforcement head suggested that if a Republican becomes President, the crypto-regulatory landscape could undergo significant change. This might involve appointing crypto-friendly Commissioner Hester Peirce to take over as the agency&#8217;s chairman instead of Gary Gensler.</p>
<p>Several Republican candidates are currently in contention. Former President <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> leads among Republican voters, followed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, albeit with a considerable gap.</p>
<p>However, he also reminds us that the SEC&#8217;s crackdown on cryptocurrencies began when Jay Clayton was in office. Just a few days before his resignation, Clayton had filed a lawsuit against Ripple for selling XRP as unregistered securities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chair Clayton served as a fierce and relentless crypto critic and boasts a hefty multi-year track record of anti-crypto speeches and Congressional testimony, while also spearheading a broad range of groundbreaking crypto-related enforcement actions and aggressive/comprehensive SEC crypto-related regulatory pronouncements,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1690707913789112320" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a> Reed Stark.</p>
<h2>Hester Pierce as the New SEC Chair?</h2>
<p>For years, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has been a vocal critic of her administration and their tough stand on crypto. She is quite popular as the &#8216;crypto mom&#8217; within the crypto community for her crypto-friendly stand.</p>
<p>Stark highlighted Peirce&#8217;s track record of disagreement and resistance against numerous of the regulator&#8217;s crypto-related enforcement actions. He pointed out that if Peirce were to lead the SEC, it&#8217;s likely that most of the agency&#8217;s crypto-related enforcement efforts and disruptive actions in the crypto space would come to a sudden stop.</p>
<p>Stark also highlighted the growing divide in crypto regulation within the SEC and broader US politics. When Stark initially started discussing crypto in 2017, he noted that various politicians, including then-President Donald Trump, Secretary Hilary Clinton, and Congresswoman Maxine Waters, shared a common view that crypto was a &#8220;dangerous and horrific plague&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, the stance on crypto has become more contentious. Republican candidate Ron de Santis has expressed intentions to safeguard Bitcoin and pledged to prohibit central bank digital currencies (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDCs</a>) if elected President.</p>
<p>On the opposing side, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren has been actively working to tighten regulations on all forms of crypto in the country. She has even formed an &#8220;anti-crypto army&#8221; as part of her Senate re-election campaign.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/zunami-protocol-manipulation-attack/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/zunami-protocol-manipulation-attack/">Zunami Protocol Loses $2.1M in Fresh Price Manipulation Attack</a></p>
<p>Decentralized finance protocol Zunami Protocol has <a href="https://twitter.com/ZunamiProtocol/status/1690863406079696896?t=6BD7CxEQCNxt6Q2B4IXb9Q&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">confirmed</a> to its clients that there has been an attack on its &#8220;zStables&#8221; pools on Curve Finance. Sharing the news on Twitter, Zunami assured clients that its collateral remains intact. However, the protocol also warned clients to avoid buying any of its Zunami Ether (zETH) or Zunami USD (UZD) stablecoins while it investigates the matter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, blockchain security firm PeckShield has tied the exploit to price manipulation by attackers. And by its estimates, the attackers carted away no less than $2.1 million from Zunami’s Curve Pool. For what it&#8217;s worth, another blockchain security outfit Ironblocks has also estimated Zunami&#8217;s loss, pegging it at similar figures to that of PeckShield.</p>
<p>It might be worth mentioning that Zunami protocol did not catch wind of the attack until about 20 minutes after PeckShield discovered the exploit on Curve. Zunami later confirmed the attack on August 13, at around 11:07 UTC.</p>
<h2>Zunami Protocol Falls Victim to Flash Loan Attack</h2>
<p>By all means, Zunami may be the latest victim of a flash loan attack, a scheme that has gradually become the bane of existence for many DeFi protocols. According to Ironblocks, &#8220;the attacker took [a] flash loan from [the] balancer, then he added liquidity so he [would] be able to change the price significantly and started to trade in Zunami&#8217;s exchange.&#8221;</p>
<p>The attacker then removed the liquidity and changed the price, before trading back and returning the flash loan. In the end, the attacker made 1,152 ETH to himself in what was a classic case of price manipulation, <a href="https://twitter.com/Ironblocks_/status/1690869728204533760?t=csyQVY5zTrZvfi1IzAftJw&amp;s=19">claims</a> Ironblocks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the attack immediately impacted the prices of both the Zunami USD stablecoin (UZD) and Zunami Ether (zEth). This follows after both plummeted shortly after the hack. UZD is the most impacted and has already lost over 99% of its value. zEth is also currently down 88% to $206.</p>
<p>Curve Finance, on the other hand, has also been having a very turbulent run recently. It has been hit by multiple attacks, losing as much as $19 million to a single hacker.  As Coinspeaker earlier <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/curve-finance-bounty-exploiter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>, however, there is still a $1.8 million bounty for information about the yet-to-be-identified hacker.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/metaverse-affyn-grand-prix-season/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/metaverse-affyn-grand-prix-season/">Metaverse-gamified Platform Affyn Partners with Grand Prix Season Singapore 2023 to Promote Web3 Adoption</a></p>
<p>A well-funded multiverse and play-to-earn Web3 platform Affyn has announced that it has partnered with Grand Prix Season Singapore 2023 (GPSS) to further introduce the Web3 ecosystem during the racing event. Notably, the GPSS event is supported by the Singapore Tourism Board, thus making the collaboration with Affyn strategic to its future growth prospects. Moreover, the Singapore government is keen to help attract digital assets investors and  Web3 project developers in the country to improve its economy.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the one-week Formula One Singapore Grand Prix event is titled Web 3.0 | Art Meets Metaverse. The event is expected to kick off on September 16, 2023, at Suntec City’s Sunthesis with an <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT</a> art exhibition and talk show lined up for the attendees. As a result, Affyn protocol anticipates showcasing its digital artworks and other products for potential customers.</p>
<p>“We are proud to partner with GPSS as it underlines Affyn’s intent to bolster Government initiatives and bring Web 3.0 development to the next level. As the only official Web 3.0 company partnering with GPSS, an event supported by STB, it is an incredible opportunity to drive awareness of developments in the industry. We’re looking forward to working with both Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 brands to showcase to a wider audience how the metaverse is changing the world for the better,” Affyn CEO Lucaz Lee noted.</p>
<h2>Affyn Market Outlook</h2>
<p>The Affyn network uses its native token dubbed FYN. Following increased on-chain activity, FYN price has gained approximately 5 percent in the past five days to trade around $0.022 on reporting time. However, the FYN price is still under the water in regard to the listing price of 14 cents earlier last year. The play-to/earn metaverse platform has gained significant momentum with its NFTs on OpenSea dubbed Nexus World &#8211; Gen Zero buddies having a total volume of about 403 Ether.</p>
<p>The Polygon-based Affyn NFTs had a total supply of about 400 items with a floor price of approximately 1.6 ETH. The Affyn NFTs dubbed Buddied include units with unique attributes and properties that can be improved over time. Notably, Affyn’s Buddies can be trained to participate in quests, raids, and user-created activities. The Affyn metaverse land is also viewed as an NFT that is tradeable among other users on the company’s marketplace.</p>
<p>The future developments of Affyn are well secured by notable investors, partners, and experienced leadership including former Unity, Expedia, and KPMG employees. Moreover, the mainstream adoption of digital assets and blockchain technology assures Web3 projects, which are building reputable products, a secure growth outlook.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/china-global-rice-market/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<p>The global rice market is experiencing a significant upheaval as prices soar to their highest levels in nearly 12 years.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/china-global-rice-market/">China’s Heavy Rains Pose Threat to Global Rice Market</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The global rice market is currently on the brink of further strain as China, the world&#8217;s largest rice producer, grapples with heavy rain and flood risks in its grain-producing north-eastern region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resulting reduction in yields is expected to exert upward pressure on global rice prices, according to a recent </span><a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/heavy-rain-in-north-east-china-may-raise-pressure-on-global-rice-prices-10-08-2023" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Fitch Ratings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China’s role in the global rice market cannot be understated. As the leading rice producer, the country not only feeds its own vast population but also contributes significantly to the international rice trade. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fitch report highlighted that China’s three key provinces, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia, have been grappling with heavy rainfall, prompting flood alerts and raising concerns about the impact on grain production. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These provinces collectively accounted for a significant portion of China’s grain output in 2021, with Heilongjiang being the largest rice-producing province, contributing 13.7% to the country&#8217;s rice production in the same year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The heavy rainfall, triggered by the remnants of Typhoon Doksuri and worsened by the approach of Typhoon Khanun, has left many key grain production areas waterlogged. As a result, crop yields for the current year are expected to decrease, although the extent of the damage remains uncertain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These adverse conditions are predicted to drive up China&#8217;s domestic grain prices, potentially prompting higher imports during the latter half of 2023 to offset the potential yield loss. While the situation in China raises concerns about potential disruptions to the global rice market, the effects on corn prices are expected to remain contained due to ample global supply.</span></p>
<h2><b>Global Rice Prices Reach 12-Year High</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the global rice market is experiencing a significant upheaval as prices soar to their highest levels in nearly 12 years, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) All Rice Price Index. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent ban on non-basmati white rice exports by India and the United Arab Emirates has sent shockwaves through the market. With India accounting for over 40% of the world&#8217;s rice trade, this move has had a substantial impact on the availability of rice in international markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Thailand, another significant rice producer, has taken measures to address water scarcity. Low rainfall has prompted the Thai government to urge farmers to plant less rice in order to conserve water resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consequences of these developments have led to a surge in rice prices, with the FAO’s All Rice Price Index reaching levels of 129.7 as of July 2023. Market observers are now anticipating a continuation of higher rice prices as the impacts of these supply disruptions reverberate across the industry.</span></p>
