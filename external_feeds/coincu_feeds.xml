<p>According to the announcement posted by the two parties on the evening of January 11, <strong>the Amazon Web Services cloud computing platform officially joined hands with Ava Labs</strong> &#8211; the organization behind Avalanche, to popularize and scale the application of blockchain technology in businesses, organizations, and governments.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The partnership aims to make it easier for individuals to launch and manage nodes on Avalanche and gives the network more power and flexibility for developers.</p>



<p><strong>AWS will support Avalanche&#8217;s infrastructure and decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem and one-click node deployment through its marketplace</strong>. Links will also include Ava Labs&#8217; participation in AWS Activate, a program that helps early-stage startups and entrepreneurs get started on its platform.</p>



<p>Additionally, AWS will support Avalanche&#8217;s dApp ecosystem and deploy subnets to Amazon Marketplace to enable individuals and organizations to operate custom subnets themselves. At the same time, <strong>Ava Labs will participate in AWS Activate</strong>, a program for startups and fledgling entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>The subnets are part of Avalanche&#8217;s scaling solution that redirects traffic away from the main blockchain and allows projects to stake its native token, AVAX, while also creating blockchains layer-1 or layer-2.</p>



<p><strong>Avalanche&#8217;s AVAX token has gone &#8220;crazy&#8221; in the past 24 hours</strong>. It once hit $16.50 and is currently trading around $16, <strong>recording a gain of 27.73% within 24 hours</strong>. The total trading volume reached 954 million USD, increasing four times during the day.</p>

<p>Recently, Avalanche has continuously made significant strides. For example, it integrates NFT with the e-commerce giant Shopify, cooperation with the World Chess Federation, or essential upgrades like &#8220;Banff 5&#8221;. But in general, 2022 is an inefficient year, and it is difficult to retain users for Avalanche.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Recently, <a href="http://El Salvador Was Surpassed By Australia On The Top Largest Crypto ATM Hub Rankings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">El Salvador </a>approved a digital asset issuance law, paving the way for Bitcoin bonds advocated by President Nayib Bukele.</em></li>



<li><em>The new law provides legal certainty for transferring any digital asset offered for sale in the country.</em></li>



<li><em>El Salvador has been preparing for Bitcoin bonds since at least the beginning of 2022.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>In an official <a href="https://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/nacional/asamblea-legislativa/1031174/2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement</a>, El Salvador approved a digital asset issuance law that brings the country closer to Bitcoin bonds.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-702-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-702-1024x576.png" alt="El Salvador Approved Digital Asset Issuance Law, New Step For Bitcoin Bonds" class="wp-image-159827" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-702-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-702-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-702-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-702-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-702-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-702.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="El Salvador Approved Digital Asset Issuance Law, New Step For Bitcoin Bonds 9"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>It also established a new government agency to regulate digital assets in El Salvador.</p>



<p>The Executive promoted this motion, which was introduced into parliament last November. According to article 3 of the proposal, digital asset is a digital representation that <strong>can be stored and transferred electronically</strong>, using a Distributed Recording Technology system or similar or similar technology, where the records are linked and encrypted to protect the security and privacy of the transactions.</p>



<p>According to the ruling party,<strong> the new law provides certainty in transferring digital asset offerings to the public in El Salvador.</strong></p>



<p>For opposition delegates, however, <strong>the regulations facilitated money laundering and tax evasion and left the Nayib Bukele government more indebted.</strong></p>



<p>It is reported that El Salvador<strong> has been preparing for Bitcoin bonds since at least the beginning of 2022.</strong> The law will open favorable conditions for Bitcoin bonds, such as the <strong>&#8220;Volcán&#8221; bond</strong> that President Bukele introduced since the law&#8217;s inception. Bitcoin is a legal tender in El Savior.</p>

<p>Digital asset service providers in El Salvador must complete the registration process and comply with the proposed law&#8217;s provisions.</p>



<p>These entities <strong>must provide a list of the digital assets they intend to issue, including the &#8220;benefits and limitations&#8221; of those assets</strong>. They must also demonstrate cybersecurity precautions and customer service capabilities and provide the names and titles of company employees. In addition, digital asset issuers must also disclose information about the jurisdiction or country in which they operate.</p>

<p>The consumer price index (CPI) is a gauge of an economy&#8217;s inflation. The US CPI releases have consistently influenced the volatility of cryptocurrencies in 2022 since it is thought to have a direct bearing on the US Federal Reserve&#8217;s choices about interest rate adjustments (Fed). The US stock market and the cryptocurrency sector were badly impacted by the Fed&#8217;s decision to <strong>raise interest rates from 0.25% to 4.5% in 2022 due to the ongoing rise in inflation.</strong></p>

<p>The consumer price inflation rate in the US eased for a fifth straight month to 7.1% in November 2022,<strong> the lowest since December 2022 and below market expectations of 7.3%</strong>. Still, the latest reading remained well above the US Federal Reserve&#8217;s 2% target. On a monthly basis, the non-seasonally adjusted <strong>CPI edged down 0.1% to 297.711 points</strong>, while the seasonally adjusted index was up 0.1%, the least in three months and also below consensus of 0.3%. <strong>According to the most recent CPI report for December 2022, experts predict inflation will continue to decline to 6,5%.</strong></p>

<p>If this happens, <strong>the Fed will certainly be pressured to slow down the pace of interest rate hikes</strong>, although the agency, in its latest report, still set expectations for further rate hikes in 2023 with a full-year target of 5.1%.</p>



<p><strong>In the face of market optimism, Bitcoin (BTC) surged to $18,297</strong>, the highest value threshold reached by the world&#8217;s leading cryptocurrency since December 15, 2022, when the market reacted positively before the news that the Fed cooled down the interest rate hike. Compared to the opening price of 2023 at $16,541, <strong>BTC has now gained over 10.6%</strong>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s impressive to see how far businesses have come since bitcoin&#8217;s introduction approximately ten years ago. Before bitcoin, the fintech industry was characterized by its reliance on banks as reliable third parties who protected the security and fungibility of our money, albeit at a slow and expensive pace. Decentralized technology has shown that rather than through intermediaries like banks, such as governments, different entities&#8217; interests can be cooperatively aligned in a single system.</p>



<p>Smart contracts are used to regulate Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). A DAO can be transparent and immutable because all transactions are recorded and cannot be changed. DAOs have the potential to completely change how businesses are managed. They could increase the effectiveness and transparency of organizations.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-698.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="983" height="519" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-698.png" alt="How DAOs and Blockchain Can Help Your Business in 2023" class="wp-image-159814" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-698.png 983w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-698-300x158.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-698-768x405.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-698-750x396.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 983px) 100vw, 983px" title="How DAOs and Blockchain Can Help Your Business in 2023 19"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Collaborating with a <a href="https://appinventiv.com/blockchain-application-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blockchain application development company</a> that not only possesses expertise in creating DAOs on blockchains from scratch but has also resolved issues relating to centralization brought on by master nodes (those who own the majority of tokens), code vulnerability, shadow voting, and the extension of time caused by obtaining a unanimous vote.</p>



<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How are DAOs Built on Blockchain?</h1>



<p>DAO is composed of four critical elements- governance, objectives, rewards, and voting. For building DAO, it is important to understand these concepts from the code. To begin with, one needs to have a deeper understanding of how smart contracts work as they construct the basic set of rules for the community members and determines how the protocols would operate. This is where governance plays an important role.</p>



<p>Here are the basic steps to <a href="https://appinventiv.com/blog/how-to-build-dao-on-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">build DAO on blockchain</a>:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Establish the goal and lay the groundwork</strong></li>



<li><strong>Establish ownership and voting procedures</strong></li>



<li><strong>Create a system of government</strong></li>



<li><strong>Implement incentives and rewards</strong></li>



<li><strong>Start the DAO building process</strong></li>
</ol>



<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How can DAOs Help your Business Accelerate in 2023?</h1>



<p>The goal of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization is not just two simplify manual tasks but to completely eliminate human errors. Other than that, it also holds several benefits which help a business streamline its operations. Let&#8217;s look at how DAO and blockchain can help to improvise the ways you operate your business.</p>



<h2><strong><strong>Decentralized Administration</strong></strong></h2>



<p>Businesses may run decentralized and without the need for a centralized authority, thanks to DAOs. As a result, businesses can operate more democratically and effectively because decisions are reached by consensus among all parties.</p>



<p>DAOs can also save organizations money by eliminating the need for pricey intermediaries. Due to the fact that every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, they also offer more accountability and transparency. Additionally, due to their decentralized character, DAOs can assist firms in reaching out to new markets and clients.</p>

<h2><strong>Better Interaction</strong></h2>



<p>Blockchain technology, which enables an open and secure method of managing data and transactions, is frequently used to establish DAOs. Everyone participating in the organization can easily understand what is happening and measure progress thanks to this. &#x200d;</p>



<h2><strong>Enhanced Effectiveness</strong></h2>



<p>Smart contracts are used to combine and automate numerous business processes in a DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization. Businesses can enhance their bottom line by streamlining their processes with the aid of DAOs. A DAO, for instance, can automate bills and payroll. Because there is no longer a requirement for manual processing, businesses can save time and money.</p>



<h2><strong>Increased Revenue</strong></h2>



<p>DAOs&#8217; distinctive organizational structure holds out the possibility of enabling a focus on community rather than just profit and may even present a more socially conscious structure, one intended to promote the prosperity of all people rather than concentrating solely on the needs of a handful of powerful shareholders. This might have an impact on how firms operate as well as how society as whole addresses current social issues. &#x200d;</p>



<h2><strong>More Customer Engagement</strong></h2>



<p>A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for businesses enables businesses to interact with customers more. It can help businesses enhance customer engagement and loyalty by giving them a clear and effective channel for communicating with their clients.</p>



<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Get Started with DAOs Blockchain Development</h1>



<p>As blockchain technology continues to spur countless advances, DAOs have also emerged with a bright future. Today&#8217;s majority of DAOs run with a flat organizational structure that promotes shared value. As the complexity of DAO platform development increases, the ability to create a structure that organizes humans becomes an increasingly important goal.</p>



<p>A structure that promotes a sense of community among all members while methodically advancing the project as a whole is necessary for DAOs with complex aims. Human experience spanning hundreds of years has demonstrated that few people are better than others at specific tasks. Complex DAOs are moving toward a hub-and-spoke architecture, in which specialists join teams to concentrate on certain aspects of the bigger project.</p>

<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Yes, DAO Promises an Autonomous Future</h1>



<p>Companies can quickly scale and become leaner without compromising service quality by employing DAO platforms to automate and compartmentalize specific elements of their operations. A real DAO is currently challenging to construct due to a few roadblocks. An organization that deals with tangible things will always need human labor until robots become more affordable and accessible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Access to technology like IoT beacons is currently limited. Additionally, the concept of a self-governing system necessitates rising levels of complexity over time. Businesses aren&#8217;t getting any easier, therefore, a truly self-governing DAO has a lot more factors to take into account for efficient, equitable functioning.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies can be traded through an exchange or as a CFD with a broker of your choice. One of the costs associated with crypto trading is the possibility of negative slippage. The crypto market can be very volatile and there can be massive fluctuations in the price of a crypto asset within a short period of time. In cryptocurrency, slippage is the difference between the price of a crypto asset when you place the trade and when the transaction was actually executed. </p>



<p>The term slippage is not exclusive to cryptocurrencies as it applies to other financial markets. The crypto trader needs to be very conscious of slippage because many times the volatility of the crypto market surpasses other financial markets (like forex) and slippage can have a tangible impact on profitability.</p>



<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Why Slippage Occurs When Trading Cryptocurrencies</h1>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/130880-debridge-announces-deswap-liquidity-network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slippage</a> is mostly determined by the volatility and liquidity of any financial instrument. The crypto market is still young when compared to more established financial markets like forex and stocks. As a result, small news announcements can massively increase the volatility of a crypto asset causing prices to witness great highs or incredible lows. Also, slippage is determined by the number of buyers and sellers of a specific crypto asset. Low liquidity is when there are not enough buyers and sellers to fill an order at the requested price and this can lead to high slippage. Slippage can be negative or positive. To stay safe from negative slippage, many crypto traders always set their slippage tolerance when trading crypto assets. This is literally an instruction to your exchange or broker to only execute a trade when it is within your slippage tolerance. To totally avoid the stress of constantly monitoring slippage, you can choose to trade with reputable <a href="https://tradingbeasts.com/no-slippage-brokers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no slippage brokers</a>.</p>

<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">3 Easy Ways To Avoid Slippage In Cryptocurrency</h1>



<p>Positive slippage is good news for crypto traders as orders are fulfilled at a better price than the price at which the order was initiated. The bad news is negative slippage which can lead to massive losses if not controlled. It is very difficult to predict if a specific crypto trade will have a negative or positive slippage until it is actually executed by your chosen exchange or broker.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to the volatility of the crypto market, it may not be possible to completely avoid slippage but there are definitely ways to minimize losses from negative slippages</p>



<h2><strong>Monitor Crypto News And Events</strong></h2>



<p>There is most times increased volatility in the crypto market during important events and news announcements. <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-volatility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Volatility</a> is known to be one of the main factors influencing slippage in the crypto market. During major news announcements or events, the prices of crypto assets fluctuate a lot which causes slippage. Some crypto traders could be lucky to experience massive positive slippage during these periods of increased volatility. It is important to note that negative slippage is also a very likely occurrence.  As a crypto trader seeking to minimize losses from negative slippage, it is advisable to always monitor crypto news and events before placing trades. You can easily monitor crypto news via Twitter and popular crypto blogs. You can even choose to completely avoid trading during major events like the fed meeting.</p>

<h2><strong>Avoid Cryptocurrencies With Low Liquidity</strong></h2>



<p>Another route to minimize slippage losses is to only trade cryptocurrencies with <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/u/yahoo-finance/watchlists/crypto-top-volume-24hr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">high liquidity</a>. It can be very tempting to focus on investing in unpopular cryptocurrencies that are usually lower priced. The challenge is that many of these unpopular cryptos have low trading volume and slippage is more likely to occur when trading them. It is advisable to focus your crypto trading on high-liquidity cryptocurrencies like BTC/USD, ETC/USD, USDT/USD, and BNB/USD.</p>

<h2><strong>Place Limit Orders Instead of Market Orders</strong></h2>



<p>So far, we have only looked at ways to minimize slippage losses. It is possible to completely eliminate negative slippage in the crypto market by placing limit orders instead of market orders. Limit order simply means you set a trade to be executed at a future price while a market order is executed immediately after it is opened. The idea of using a limit order looks very fancy but the challenge is that there is no guarantee that a specific crypto asset will get to the limit order price for your trade to be executed.&nbsp;</p>



<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion On Dealing With Slippage In Cryptocurrency</h1>



<p>Volatility and liquidity are the major factors that influence the slippage value in the crypto market. Slippage is a normal part of crypto trading and can be negative or positive. It is very unlikely that any crypto investor will dislike positive slippage as this gives them a better price than the initial price they planned to trade at. The challenge is with minimizing or eliminating unplanned slippage losses which can be very frustrating. After implementing ways to avoid slippage, it is still advisable to always set your slippage tolerance before initiating any crypto trade with an exchange or broker.</p>

<p>Blockchain is just new for storing legitimate information, while Artificial Intelligence is developing intelligence that thinks and solves problems like humans. The results were fascinating when both aspects were combined, and their impact was mind-bursting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Certain areas have successfully made full use of Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence. Let’s dig into these areas;</p>



<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Security&nbsp;</h1>



<p>The degree of originality is referred to as Authenticity. In techno systems like Blockchain, authenticity plays a role that is quite critical and crucial. Anyone who enters the system, transfers, and does anything else can do this just because of his authentic identity. If the identity never matches, that person is prohibited from entering the system and doing the rest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But certain vulnerabilities just break authenticity protocols and finding the best measures extends us to use AI in our means. AI embedded within Blockchain can implicitly favor more secure means to transact and to do other operations. The most affectionate use of Artificial intelligence is to read data and to extract lightning insights from the data. AI embedded with Blockchain can help identify and track the data history with thundering speed. With this, Authencity levels up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While processing data is not the end, AI motivates BLockchain to generate a greater amount of transparency as compared to single. Because the real test for any technology is simply the degree of security, it provides. And Blockchain deals in an immense amount of decentralized transactions, so AI just lifts things upward.&nbsp;</p>



<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Automation&nbsp;</h1>



<p>Business operations are transforming into new glories just because of these two technologies. The most profound gain that blockchain delivers is Smart Contracts that are automatically executed by finalizing the parties. But embedding Into the smart contracts empowers more deliverance of these contracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While a system embedded with AI can recommend expired products or products that are not liable to perfection for a while.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever parties do transactions regularly, they have to do them manually, but a system embedded with AI can also ensure automation in this cause. A system automatically allocates the schedule for such things based on your preference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It gives a better trading experience and helps you trace out the stocks that will burst in price in the coming time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While AI always comes up with automation and brings intelligence which is artificially made.&nbsp;</p>



<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Healthcare&nbsp;</h1>



<p>Blockchain technology has been very promising to healthcare. It allows for storing patients&#8217; records of diagnosis and medicine records, and altogether keeping the medical record stored on the Blockchain powered with Artificial Intelligence can set up large advantages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let’s dig into these advantages;</p>



<p>First and foremost, a patient having a medical record can be allowed to match with several symptoms to predict where the patient will stand in the coming time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Secondly, tracking past diagnosis records will eliminate the long diagnosis period, and it ultimately ends up reducing costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thirdly, the life of medicine can also be evaluated by tracking past medical records.</p>



<p>Last but not least, Blockchain And AI are simply revolutionizing healthcare.&nbsp;</p>



<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Financial Services</h1>



<p>The Financial Industry is emerging and gaining a higher amount of transparency by enabling these two technologies. Both these together exclude the fiction and provide lethal peace to do transactions. Blockchain, on the one hand, improvises decentralized transactions on one hand which is quite safe, and on the other hand, AI puts intelligence to process data at rapid speed.&nbsp;</p>



<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Supply Chain&nbsp;</h1>



<p>Paper records have been put into the fire by enabling department shareable databases. In this way the supply chain has gained a lot by having Blockchain embedded with Artificial Intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This eliminated paperwork and tributes to the masses by having more realistic options to communicate and control the supply chain operations.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-694.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="671" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-694-1024x671.png" alt="Blockchain And Artificial Intelligence: Sheer Improvisation " class="wp-image-159792" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-694-1024x671.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-694-300x197.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-694-768x503.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-694-750x491.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-694-1140x747.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-694.png 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Blockchain And Artificial Intelligence: Sheer Improvisation  31"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Secondly, AI ensures more efficiency. For instance, at product leveling, carbon emission is a mindful thing to analyze and control. Artificial Intelligence ensures tracking data regarding carbon emissions, which will help alert the accuracy of controlling the emissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchain and AI never end here and are simply growing away from the boundaries. Just keep yourself updated regarding the new forms of both these technologies, and the way of making things happen is quite phenomenal.&nbsp;</p>



<h1 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Final Words</h1>



<p>Digital Landscape delivers the best products just to make our life easy. And in this regard, two such aspects are Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence, and formerly both are best in their leagues.</p>



<p>But when they merged, the impact was blistering and incomparable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from these, Bitcoin trading has been gathering a lot of privileges in this regard. Know better at <a href="http://the-bitcoin360-ai.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin 360 AI</a>, the best trading platform, and a handy advisor to make your trading journey full of mileage that never falls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the bankruptcy trial of the FTX exchange held on January 11, 2023 (US time), the lawyer representing the exchange raised the number of <strong>recovered assets to $5 billion, a surprising number compared to previous predictions</strong>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We have located over $5 billion of cash, liquid cryptocurrency and liquid investment securities measured at petition date value. [It] just does not ascribe any value to holdings of dozens of illiquid cryptocurrency tokens, where our holdings are so large relative to the total supply that our positions cannot be sold without significantly affecting the market for the token,&#8221; </p>
<cite>Landis Rath &amp; Cobb attorney Adam Landis on FTX&#8217;s behalf, said.</cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>FTX also added that the latest asset estimate does not include the amount of $425 million in cryptocurrencies being managed by the Bahamas government.</strong></p>



<p>The latest statement from FTX surprised many people when on December 20, 2022, the exchange announced that <strong>it had only recovered $ 1 billion in assets</strong>. Still, now it has reached $ 5 billion, only less than one month later.</p>



<p>However, <strong>the detailed list of assets that FTX has recovered still needs to be determined.</strong></p>



<p>Meanwhile, according to documents compiled by former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried at the time of FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy, the exchange had more than $9 billion in assets but only about $1 billion in cash and marketable securities immediately. The rest are incredibly illiquid cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>The increase in the number of restored FTX assets will further ignite the hope of <strong>more compensation for the exchange&#8217;s investors and creditors</strong>, who previously had to prepare themselves for only taking about 1/10 of the amount of money locked on the floor.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The amount of the shortfall is not yet clear, and it will depend on the size of the claims pool and our recovery efforts. But every week, we come closer to completing the work necessary to estimate recoveries for a plan of reorganization,&#8221; Landis said.</p>
<cite>Landis said.</cite></blockquote>



<p>It is estimated that<strong> the amount of money FTX leaves a deficit in using users&#8217; deposit funds to invest with Alameda is about $8-$10 billion.</strong></p>



<p>At the trial, FTX&#8217;s lawyer also accused former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried of directing <strong>former CTO Gary Wang to build a &#8220;backdoor&#8221; on FTX to withdraw users&#8217; funds without being detected</strong>. The Alameda Foundation has borrowed up to $65 billion from FTX. That money was then spent by the FTX and Alameda team to buy real estate, build offices, and sign contracts to sponsor sports, parties, and political donations for the FTX managers themselves -Alameda borrowed.</p>

<p>In addition, the judge allowed FTX to keep confidential information of <strong>more than 9 million individual and institutional creditors of the exchange for another three months to ensure privacy</strong>. Before that, many major Western news agencies had filed a petition asking the court to declassify information about creditors.</p>

<p>The DEX aggregator is the world&#8217;s first full aggregation protocol for crypto trading that liquidity sources from <strong>DeFi</strong> and <strong>CeFi</strong>, and enables cross-chain swaps.</p>



<p>To find and optimize the best trading alternatives for various crypto assets on various public blockchains, <strong>OpenOcean</strong> searches across <strong>DEXs</strong> and <strong>CEXs</strong>. Once the infrastructure is established, it will permit direct cross-chain transactions in addition to cross-chain swaps between the combined public chains. Users simply need to pay the standard exchange fees and blockchain gas fees for trades, which are assessed by the exchanges and not by the DEX aggregator.</p>



<p>Increasing integration with multiple blockchains allows OpenOcean to expand its choices to make it easier for users to deal with cross-chain transactions.</p>

<p>The first zero-liquidation loan pool that <strong>MYSO</strong> <strong>v1</strong> is launching is an <strong>rETH/wETH pool</strong>; lenders will be able to earn a yield on <strong>wETH</strong> without directly staking, while borrowers will be able to hyperstake their rETH without liquidation.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1) Hi everyone! We’re extremely proud to announce that the MYSO v1 protocol is officially live on Ethereum Mainnet! Let’s dive into some details regarding our initial <a href="https://twitter.com/Rocket_Pool?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Rocket_Pool</a> rETH/wETH pool, gated LP launch, referral program, and more!  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  <a href="https://t.co/WQOQnI8lcA" target="_blank">https://t.co/WQOQnI8lcA</a></p>&mdash; MYSO (@MysoFinance) <a href="https://twitter.com/MysoFinance/status/1612885617737711617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 10, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The following are the official parameters for this first pool:</p>



<ul>
<li>collateral currency: rETH</li>



<li>loan currency: wETH</li>



<li>tenor: 90 days</li>



<li>maxLoanPerColl: 1.01 wETH</li>



<li>r1: 4% annualized</li>



<li>r2: 2% annualized</li>



<li>liquidityBnd1: 1 wETH</li>



<li>liquidityBnd2: 50 wETH</li>



<li>minLoan: 0.1 wETH</li>



<li>baseAggrBucketSize: 100</li>



<li>creatorFee: 0.25%</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>The wETH of LP will never be lent out for less than</strong> <strong>2% APR since the rETH/wETH pool</strong> <strong>will always be deployed with a minimum APR of 2%</strong>. Note that users&#8217; <strong>actual payout rates (APYs)</strong>, which depend on pool utilization and are unpredictable, are <strong>not the</strong> <strong>minimum APR of 2%</strong>. The initial tenor is set at <strong>90 days</strong>, so borrowers may take out loans for as long as that amount of time. This indicates that users may have to wait up to the whole <strong>90 days</strong> before a loan is settled.</p>



<p>For borrowers, the <strong>rETH/wETH pool </strong>enables users to hyperstake their <strong>rETH</strong> without any liquidation risk, allowing users to get leveraged exposure to <strong>rETH</strong> without worrying about liquidation, for instance, if rETH briefly depegs. We are aware that consumers will want to take advantage of this additional gain on their holdings of <strong>rETH</strong> because this hyperstaking offering sans liquidations has never been witnessed in DeFi previously.</p>

<li><em>The agency has given Zipmex until January 12 to respond and explain whether it has been operating in Thailand as a digital-asset fund manager without permission. If accurate, the company would have had to get a permit before starting operations there.</em></li>



<li><em>The Thai regulatory body has made preparations to strengthen regulations for cryptocurrencies, putting investor protection as its top priority. Along with a nationwide prohibition on cryptocurrency loans, it also plans to establish rigorous regulations for crypto advertisements.</em></li>

<p>According to a <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-11/thailand-probes-embattled-crypto-exchange-zipmex-on-rule-breach" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg report</a></em>, local authorities are looking into behaviors that they think may breach the terms of service for suppliers of digital asset services. This includes the products it offers as digital assets.</p>



<p>The <strong>Thai</strong> <strong>SEC</strong> has given the exchange until <strong>January 12</strong> to respond and explain whether it has been operating in Thailand as a digital-asset fund manager without permission. If accurate, the company would have had to get a permit before starting operations there.</p>

<p>In <strong>July 2022</strong>, Zipmex openly experienced financial distress, which included stopping withdrawals and seizing accounts. The pressure was brought on by a protracted bear market that led to the closure of several enterprises in the sector and widespread layoffs.</p>



<p>In August, the exchange and the <strong>Thai SEC</strong> discussed <strong>a potential recovery strategy</strong>.</p>



<p>The agency filed a police report against <a href="https://news.coincu.com/144076-zipmex-requests-creditor-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zipmex</a> on <strong>September 7</strong>, alleging that<strong> the exchange provided &#8220;incomplete&#8221; information in its procedural compliance papers.</strong></p>

<p>Since then, the Thai regulator has made measures to strengthen regulations for cryptocurrencies, putting investor protection first. Along with a nationwide prohibition on cryptocurrency loans, it plans to establish rigorous regulations for crypto advertisements.</p>



<p><strong>V Ventures</strong>, a division of Thoresen Thai Agencies Pcl, is <a href="https://news.coincu.com/148548-v-ventures-seeks-to-acquire-90-of-zipmex/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the process</a> of purchasing <strong>Zipmex</strong> for about <strong>$100 million</strong>.</p>
