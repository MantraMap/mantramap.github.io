										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="1200" height="700" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Crypto-Investment-Giant-Captures-Insane-Market-Demand-With-Another-Week-Of-Massive-Bitcoin-Accumulation.jpg" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Crypto Investment Giant Captures Insane Market Demand With Another Week Of Massive Bitcoin Accumulation" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Crypto-Investment-Giant-Captures-Insane-Market-Demand-With-Another-Week-Of-Massive-Bitcoin-Accumulation.jpg 1200w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Crypto-Investment-Giant-Captures-Insane-Market-Demand-With-Another-Week-Of-Massive-Bitcoin-Accumulation-300x175.jpg 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Crypto-Investment-Giant-Captures-Insane-Market-Demand-With-Another-Week-Of-Massive-Bitcoin-Accumulation-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Crypto-Investment-Giant-Captures-Insane-Market-Demand-With-Another-Week-Of-Massive-Bitcoin-Accumulation-768x448.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div>
<p>After a long pause, the Bitcoin ETF mania seems to have bounced back with the world&#8217;s largest asset manager BlackRock, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">applying</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for approval to launch its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).</p>



<p>This development came just days after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-vs-sec-stakes-just-got-higher-following-binance-coinbase-lawsuits-as-xrp-win-proves-pivotal/">legal action against major exchanges</a> Coinbase and Binance.US for allegedly offering unregistered securities.</p>



<p>A Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is a financial product that aims to expose investors to Bitcoin through traditional financial markets. It functions similarly to other ETFs but will focus on Bitcoin as the underlying asset. Investors can buy and sell shares of the Bitcoin ETF on stock exchanges, allowing them to gain indirect exposure to Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements without owning or managing the cryptocurrency directly. According to the filing, BlackRock&#8217;s so-called “iShares Bitcoin Trust” intends to collaborate with Coinbase Custody as its custodial partner in securely holding the Bitcoin that forms the foundation of the ETF.</p>



<p>Introducing a Bitcoin ETF is expected to attract a broader range of investors, particularly institutions, to the cryptocurrency market, with various metrics already showing all Bitcoin cohorts are off-distribution and entering light accumulation.</p>



<p>Recent market trends have echoed this sentiment. On Monday, June 9, crypto analytics firm Glassnode reported an increase in the holdings of Bitcoin entities with balances under 100 BTC, which include the so-called <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-shrimps-and-crabs-increase-holdings-by-almost-1-million-btc-amid-price-drop/">“shrimps”</a> and “fish”. According to the firm, these entities absorbed the equivalent of 254% of the mined supply over the past month, approximately 2,286 BTC per day.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/IOtaLfKbc1HGSxe0ujDhYEfgmvASgTV74B68Ybg5yzutaHG_gy3kKtEuVCQpSF1wpS8S4yGb-rXjhAnCbjtVbNxOHouh5DgyjFpUMKIN9vWb6MXxjOr8ZJJvI4yP6QkQnsFPRMabAkFO4IJzcX0ASA" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Moreover, in a separate tweet, Glassnode highlighted a decline in Bitcoin&#8217;s Highly Liquid Supply, reaching a cycle low of 2.94 million BTC, which reflects a decrease of 620,000 BTC since January 2022. Notably, a decrease in liquid supply implies that there is less Bitcoin available for trading overall. This reduction in the actively tradeable supply can influence the price of Bitcoin, as a decrease in supply relative to demand can potentially drive prices higher.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/8X9FxFsIhQbVwzOY5CIqUq2JZxufSJSzk3lK6G_XemhHIxmPVAzWr0st3ntDetwikaz6Wt0h9n8-0Euqf_KiS7qBdbWrX5HFa6T2q6TWIbvfk1QUzadJudLPo8G4TeCVs8DZaCJXPKE3UwNPldKaWQ" alt=""/></figure>



<p>That said, whereas it’s too early to deduce what happens for Bitcoin’s price in the short term, experts have argued that the prospect of a Bitcoin ETF from BlackRock has the potential to fuel interest and investment in the cryptocurrencies further. Moreover, retail will likely follow institutions in buying Bitcoin to avoid missing out (FOMO), pouring a wall of money into Bitcoin, Ether, ADA and other crypto assets.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="646" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-14-1024x646.png" alt="" class="wp-image-82178" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-14-1024x646.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-14-300x189.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-14-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-14-1536x970.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-14-2048x1293.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $26,644 after a strong close of last week&#8217;s candle. According to popular crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe, BTC must hold atop the $26,000. “<em>If that practically sustains, the odds of upwards continuation is significant,” </em>he <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1670713059801718785">tweeted</a> today.</p>

<p>Uniswap, the world’s second-largest decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol, has announced the upcoming release of Uniswap v4, a highly anticipated upgrade that aims to revolutionize liquidity provision and token trading on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>



<p>In a Tuesday <a href="https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-v4">blog</a>, Uniswap highlighted the importance of adapting to evolving technology and market demands. It further introduced an open-source code for its upcoming V4 version so that the public can contribute to the protocol’s development, saying that this inclusive approach aims to foster a robust ecosystem and ensure that Uniswap v4 caters to the diverse needs of its users.</p>



<p>According to the blog, unlike the current version v3, Uniswap v4 introduces a groundbreaking concept called &#8220;hooks,&#8221; which enables users to customize liquidity pools and make better decisions based on their preferences.</p>



<p><em>“Our vision with Uniswap v4 is to allow anyone to make these tradeoff decisions through the introduction of hooks,”</em> Read the blog.</p>



<p>Hooks are contracts that run at various stages of a pool&#8217;s lifecycle, allowing new functionalities and strategies to be added. This flexibility empowers developers to implement dynamic fee structures, onchain limit orders, time-weighted average market makers (TWAMMs), and even integrations with lending protocols and customized oracles.</p>



<p>The introduction of hooks is expected to unlock a wide range of possibilities for liquidity pool customization, promoting innovation and expanding the capabilities of the Uniswap Protocol. Thus, pools will no longer be restricted to a predetermined sequence of actions, allowing developers to experiment and create pools tailored to specific use cases.</p>



<p>Notably, Uniswap v4&#8217;s core logic will be non-upgradeable, ensuring the security and integrity of the protocol while allowing for individual pools to utilize their own hook smart contracts.</p>



<p>Uniswap v4 also brings significant improvements to architecture and gas efficiency. As the protocol operates on the Ethereum blockchain, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/vitalik-buterin-proposes-advanced-ways-to-make-ethereum-gas-fees-fairer/">gas fees</a> have historically been a concern. Currently, Uniswap v3 requires a new contract for each pool. As per the blog, Uniswap v4 will change that by consolidating all pools within a single &#8220;singleton&#8221; contract.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This architectural enhancement will streamline pool creation and reduce gas costs by a staggering 99%. Additionally, Uniswap v4 incorporates a &#8220;flash accounting&#8221; system that optimizes asset transfers, resulting in further gas savings and overall efficiency.</p>



<p>That said, the unveiling of Uniswap v4 represents a significant milestone in the evolution of decentralized finance (DeFi). Building upon the success of Uniswap v3, which has already established itself as a leading decentralized exchange protocol processing over $1.5 trillion in trading volume, the forthcoming launch of Uniswap v4 is expected further to propel the decentralized finance ecosystem towards accelerated decentralization efforts.</p>

<p>In a June 15, 2023 press release, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) alleged that the crypto exchange OKCoin USA Inc violated the Federal Deposit Insurance Act by making false and misleading statements regarding its insured status with the FDIC on its website and in a social media post.</p>



<p>Through a cease and desist letter, the FDIC requested OKCoin to address what it referred to as false and misleading statements. The FDIC said that OkCoin claimed to offer FDIC insurance of USD deposits for its US customers.</p>



<p>The FDIC said OkCoin’s statements were likely misleading and potentially harmful to consumers. The FDIC requested OKCoin to immediately remove all information, representations, or references suggesting that OKCoin is FDIC-insured.</p>



<p>The FDIC gave OKCoin 15 business days on receipt of its cease and desist letter to provide written confirmation that it had fully compiled. Other companies that received cease and desist orders from the FDIC on June 15, 2023, were Bodega (Bodega Importadora de Pallets) and Money Avenue, LLC.</p>



<p>The FDIC has issued several cease and desist letters in the past to firms contravening the Federal Deposit Insurance Act that prohibits any person or entity from representing or implying that an uninsured deposit is insured under the FDI Act.</p>



<p>In August 2022, the FDIC issued letters demanding five companies(Cryptonews.com, Cryptosec.info, SmartAsset.com, FTX.US, and FDICCrypto.com) and their officers, directors, and employees to stop making false and misleading statements about FDIC deposit insurance.</p>



<p>In July 2022, the FDIC issued a cease and desist letter to Voyager Digital, LLC, and its related entities for making false and misleading statements concerning Voyager’s deposit insurance status.</p>



<p>In the letter to Voyager, the FDIC said that Voyager had made various representations on its website, mobile app, and social media accounts, suggesting that it was FDIC-insured and that the FDIC had insured customers against the failure of Voyager.</p>



<p>According to the new rules shared by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) in a press release dated June 8, 2023, the FCA requested crypto firms to ensure investors have the appropriate knowledge and experience to invest in crypto.</p>



<p>The FCA advised crypto firms marketing crypto assets to UK consumers to offer a cooling-off period for first-time investors to offer more protection to consumers. Consumer protection is at the heart of the formation of crypto regulations.</p>



<p>The FCA further requested firms promoting crypto to use transparent and fair adverts and to put in place clear risk warnings that are not misleading. The FCA asked for more guidance for firms advertising crypto to UK consumers.</p>



<p>The conduct of crypto firms remains under scrutiny by financial regulators and watchdogs.</p>

<p>According to a June 17, 2023 press release, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has secured emergency relief against Binance Holdings Limited. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao also agreed to repatriate to the United States (US) all assets for Binance.US customers.</p>



<p>The court order issued from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia will allow Binance.US customers to withdraw their assets from the Binance.US platform, and any customer&#8217;s funds on the platform will remain in the US till the resolution of the SEC’s pending litigation against Binance Holdings Ltd.</p>



<p>Other requirements by the order include the prohibition of the defendants from destroying records, transferring any assets or funds to Binance Holdings Limited, Changpeng Zhao, or their affiliates, and a restriction on spending assets or funds except for ordinary course business expenses.</p>



<p>As per a June 5, 2023 press release, the SEC filed 13 charges against Binance, its entities, and its CEO Changpeng Zhao that included operating unregistered exchanges, misrepresenting trading controls and oversight on the Binance.US platform, and the offering and selling of unregistered securities.</p>



<p>According to a June 6, 2023 press release, the SEC had filed an emergency action seeking a temporary restraining order to freeze, repatriate and ensure that the assets held for the benefit of customers of the Binance.US crypto trading platform remain in the US.</p>



<p>On June 14, 2023, the federal judge overseeing the SEC’s case against Binance.US declined to order a temporary restraining order freezing the U.S. trading platform&#8217;s assets and requested the parties to agree on limits to a compromise solution by June 15, 2023.</p>



<p>Binance has been in the news lately, facing various regulatory actions worldwide. Regulatory action against Binance is generally considered significant as Binance is the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volumes.</p>



<p>On June 16, 2023, Binance announced they were exiting the Dutch market, citing failure to obtain a virtual asset service provider (VASP) registration with the Dutch regulator. Binance advised its users in the Netherlands to withdraw their funds and that no other trading or deposits would be possible.</p>



<p>Binance France is reportedly under investigation by French prosecutors for breaching anti-money laundering procedures and advertising its services before registering with the financial markets regulator. Binance was registered with France’s financial markets regulator in May 2022.</p>



<p>And according to the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission, Binance Cyprus Limited has applied for deregistration.</p>

<p>The outcome remains uncertain in the riveting legal battle between <a href="https://zycrypto.com/former-sec-director-says-judgment-on-ripple-vs-sec-lawsuit-to-come-within-days-xrp-to-10/">Ripple</a> and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, a recent analysis from Google Bard AI sheds light on Ripple&#8217;s potential for a significant victory. As the case continues to unfold, numerous factors come into play, influencing the ultimate verdict. In this article, we delve into the key arguments provided by Google Bard AI supporting both Ripple&#8217;s triumph and potential downfall.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-xrp-security-debate"><strong>The XRP Security Debate</strong></h2>



<p>At the core of the SEC&#8217;s case against Ripple lies the assertion that XRP should be classified as a security. Yet, the crypto community remains deeply <a href="https://zycrypto.com/why-pro-ripple-lawyer-says-xrp-cant-be-classed-as-a-security-even-if-it-was-sold-as-one/">divided</a> on this matter. While some experts vehemently oppose such categorization, others see plausible arguments for XRP as a security. The SEC&#8217;s evidence backing their claim lacks clarity, leaving room for doubt and further debate.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ripple&#8217;s Legal Team</strong></h2>



<p>Fortifying its position, Ripple has assembled a legal team comprised of the country&#8217;s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-and-coinbases-top-legal-minds-hold-offsite-meeting-is-an-xrp-relisting-closer-than-ever/">top legal minds</a>. These seasoned lawyers bring an impressive track record of victories in complex cases, bolstering Ripple&#8217;s prospects for success. With their wealth of experience and expertise, they are prepared to tackle the SEC head-on and defend Ripple&#8217;s interests vigorously.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Support From Crypto Community</strong></h2>



<p>A resounding wave of support emanates from the crypto community, standing firmly behind Ripple in this legal tussle. Many enthusiasts argue that the SEC&#8217;s pursuit of Ripple represents an overreach of its regulatory authority, potentially stifling innovation in the crypto space. This unwavering backing from the community reflects a broader sentiment that Ripple&#8217;s victory would pave the way for positive <a href="https://zycrypto.com/how-the-outcome-of-sec-v-ripple-case-could-shape-crypto-markets-as-xrp-army-eagerly-awaits-verdict/">industry developments</a>.</p>



<p>Undeniably, the SEC possesses vast resources and a solid determination to secure a favourable outcome in this lawsuit. With their extensive arsenal, they wield considerable power to influence the proceedings. Additionally, the possibility of compelling key witnesses to testify against Ripple looms over the case, potentially posing a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ex-ripple-exec-on-why-sec-might-still-defeat-ripple-in-xrp-lawsuit-amid-unmasking-of-hinman-docs/">threat</a> to Ripple&#8217;s defense.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Verdict Hangs in the Balance</strong></h2>



<p>Ultimately, the fate of Ripple hinges upon the evidence presented by both parties and the rulings of the presiding judge. With the ongoing case, it is premature to predict the victor definitively. However, given the arguments in <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-contemplates-ipo-as-sec-lawsuit-finally-nears-end-will-it-propel-xrp-to-10/">Ripple&#8217;s favor</a>, they appear to have a substantial chance of prevailing. The verdict of this lawsuit will reverberate across the crypto industry, setting a precedent for future regulatory actions.</p>



<p>Ripple&#8217;s case against the SEC rests on several crucial factors, including the contested classification of XRP, their legal team, and the unwavering support of the crypto community. However, the SEC&#8217;s formidable resources and potential key witnesses against Ripple pose significant challenges. Ripple remains <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-army-shower-confidence-on-a-ripple-win-in-sec-case-as-whales-load-up-heavily/">poised for success</a> in this high-stakes legal battle, but only time will reveal the true victor in this momentous clash.</p>

<p>BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">filed paperwork</a> last week with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the formation of a spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF).</p>



<p>Although the SEC, which oversees ETFs in the United States, has continuously denied all applications for spot bitcoin ETFs, experts say BlackRock’s proposed investment vehicle has a better chance of getting a green light owing to the fund management giant’s strong political connections and its huge success rate with ETF applications.</p>



<p>Hopes surrounding a potential spot Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock sparked a bullish sentiment among Bitcoin investors after the news became public last Thursday. And if there is any truth in the rumours swirling around, then Bitcoin could be on the brink of another bullish boost fuelled by another financial giant. Rumours suggest that U.S.-based financial services firm Fidelity Investments could soon follow in BlackRock’s footsteps and register a spot Bitcoin ETF with the SEC. Fidelity could also bid for Digital Currency Group subsidiary, Grayscale.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fidelity Next To Attempt To Register Spot Bitcoin ETF In The U.S.?</strong></h2>



<p>For approximately 10 years, crypto company after crypto company has tried its luck with the SEC. Now Wall Street’s heaviest hitters are lending their weight.</p>



<p>In a June 18 <a href="https://twitter.com/AP_Abacus/status/1670455968608538624">tweet</a>, Arch Public co-founder Andrew Parish suggested that Fidelity Investments is readying to take a giant step toward a spot bitcoin ETF, days after BlackRock announced its application. Parish indicated that Fidelity was about to make a “seismic move” in the crypto space.</p>



<p>An ETF is an investment vehicle that tracks the price performance of an underlying asset, such as gold, foreign currencies, or bitcoin. Perhaps most importantly, ETFs mirror the value of an underlying asset without an investor having to buy the asset itself.</p>



<p>Parish also claimed Fidelity could soon acquire Grayscale, the fund manager that is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/grayscale-flips-the-script-and-sues-the-sec-after-spot-bitcoin-etf-plan-rejection/">currently in a legal standoff with the SEC</a> after the securities regulator denied an application to convert its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an exchange-traded fund.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He said he wouldn’t be surprised to see Fidelity offer staking services real soon.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Addendum: wouldn’t be surprised to see Fidelity offer staking soon. <a href="https://t.co/GRyYx6u5cH">pic.twitter.com/GRyYx6u5cH</a></p>&mdash; Andrew (@AP_Abacus) <a href="https://twitter.com/AP_Abacus/status/1670456502828531713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 18, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The question remains, when will the U.S. see its first spot Bitcoin ETF?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Super Bullish For Bitcoin Amid SEC Crackdown</strong></h2>



<p>Notably, BlackRock’s ETF application and the alleged incoming Fidelity filing come at a strange time: The SEC this year has pursued legal recourse against crypto firms such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Binance for what it considers unregistered securities relating to a slew of digital assets listed on the exchanges.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, BlackRock’s and Fidelity’s foray into the bitcoin market can be deemed bullish events that will drive investors’ confidence in the crypto industry. Being the biggest asset manager in the world, a BlackRock-sponsored spot bitcoin ETF would bring an air of legitimacy and that air should generate a heavy inflow of capital. Maybe that would supercharge the price of Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Whether this means the BTC price goes up or down, approval of the BlackRock and Fidelity applications will be a big moment for crypto.</p>

<p>Following the recent revelation of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">BlackRock&#8217;s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF</a>, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has found himself at odds with Bitcoin maximalists. Divergent opinions on the potential effects of BlackRock&#8217;s involvement in the crypto space have prompted a contentious debate among the crypto community in response to the announcement.</p>



<p>When BlackRock submitted paperwork to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) outlining its plans to provide institutional investors with a regulated vehicle to gain exposure to Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements without directly holding the digital asset, news of the asset management giant&#8217;s interest in developing a Bitcoin Spot ETF broke.</p>



<p>Charles Hoskinson responded to the news by voicing his scepticism and worries. He denounced the enthusiastic support of Bitcoin maximalists for BlackRock&#8217;s participation in the cryptocurrency market on Twitter. He said, <em>“Bitcoiners defending Blackrock is all you need to know about their ethics, mental state, and greed.”</em></p>



<p>Hoskinson claimed that such backing was naive, cautioning that the proposed Bitcoin ETF might bring in a large amount of new capital and ultimately lower the value of Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Hoskinson&#8217;s comments offended Bitcoin maximalists, who vehemently favour the idea. They contend that BlackRock&#8217;s entry into the cryptocurrency market will significantly validate Bitcoin and increase its acceptance by the general public, opening the door for even more adoption and recognition. Maximalists view this as a favourable development that might help not just Bitcoin but also other strong projects like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-at-5-analysts-set-huge-ada-price-expectations-for-2023-as-key-metrics-surge/">Cardano</a>, which Hoskinson himself founded.</p>



<p>Hoskinson reinforced his viewpoint in reaction to the debate with Bitcoin maximalists, underlining his worries regarding the possible repercussions of BlackRock&#8217;s engagement. He said, “I&#8217;m old enough to remember Mike Hern and Gavin being driven out. I&#8217;m also old enough to remember Jimmy Song pushing for the US government to ban all crypto except Bitcoin. Sorry maximalists are fanatics that want to harm us all.<em>”</em></p>



<p>The argument over the ramifications of BlackRock&#8217;s proposed Bitcoin Spot Trust continues, and the cryptocurrency community is still split on the issue. While Hoskinson maintains his skepticism and warns against the eventual devaluation of the asset, Bitcoin maximalists see it as a positive step toward further acceptance. Only time will tell how this conflict of viewpoints will affect the cryptocurrency market&#8217;s future and how traditional financial institutions and the decentralized world will interact.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in the news related to the Cardano founder, Hoskinson is funding the Galileo Project&#8217;s search for a crashed unidentified flying object or space entity near the coast of Papua New Guinea, led by Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb and his student Amir Siraj.</p>

<p>Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon has been sentenced to four months of incarceration after being found guilty of forging his travel documents.</p>



<p>A Montenegrin Basic Court shared the verdict on June 19, noting that the time spent in custody will be included in the sentence. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-montenegro-court-sentences-kwon-to-four-months-in-jail"><strong>Montenegro Court Sentences Kwon To Four Months In Jail</strong></h2>



<p>Terra creator Do Kwon was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/terras-luna-sees-selloff-following-founder-do-kwons-arrest-in-montenegro/">apprehended </a>at Podgorica Airport in Montenegro while attempting to fly to Dubai. Kwon and his business partner Chang-joon Han were found carrying fake travel documents, including Costa Rican passports that Kwon says he didn’t know were invalid. “If I had suspected it was a fake passport, I would not have travelled to many countries,” Kwon reportedly said in a June 17 report from the South Korean publication <em>Segye Ilbo</em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I filled out all the documents and received a Costa Rican passport through an agency in Singapore recommended by a friend,” Kwon posited, adding that he had traveled to multiple countries all over the world for years with the Costa Rican passport. He indicated that he was given the passport by an agency with a Chinese name he couldn’t remember.</p>



<p>Kwon also possessed a Belgian passport, which he claimed to have received through a different third-party agency.</p>



<p>Kwon and Han have remained in custody since March, when they were apprehended in the Balkan country. The pair are the subject of a jurisdictional tussle between prosecutors in the U.S. and their native country South Korea.</p>



<p>Kwon stressed the innocence of his colleague and former Terraform Labs Chief Financial Officer Han, telling the court, &#8220;If you are punished for a fake passport, let me be the only one.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, the prosecution urged the court to punish Kwon and Han, indicating that if a genuine establishment did not give the passport, it was made with wrong intentions.</p>



<p>The court said that two Costa Rican passports, two Belgian passports, and two identity cards belonging to Kwon and Han were also seized.</p>



<p>Kwon will be held in extradition custody for up to six months while the local court weighs South Korea’s extradition request.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Kwon And The Fall Of Terra</strong></h2>



<p>In May 2020, the Terra network’s algorithmic stablecoin UST lost its dollar peg, creating a rush for investors to sell their tokens. UST then entered a death spiral that saw over $40 billion wiped from the market. Hundreds of thousands of investors saw their life savings vanish into thin air, and the Terra blockchain eventually stopped.</p>



<p>Refusing to cooperate with criminal inquiries, Kwon<a href="https://zycrypto.com/fallen-crypto-star-do-kwon-may-be-in-serbia-after-fleeing-singapore-report/"> fled from South Korea to Singapore</a> shortly after Terra’s implosion. A South Korean court issued an arrest warrant for Kwon last September, alleging that the fallen crypto star broke capital markets laws.</p>



<p>Interpol also <a href="https://zycrypto.com/lunas-do-kwon-bags-a-red-notice-from-interpol-in-bid-to-hasten-his-arrest/">issued </a>a red notice for him in September, making him a wanted man in 195 countries across the globe. Kwon, however, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/terras-do-kwon-apologizes-to-luna-victims-insists-he-is-not-on-the-run/">insisted </a>that he was not “on the run” and maintained an active presence on Twitter.</p>



<p>Apart from rejecting the document forgery allegations, Kwon also denied claims that he made any financial contributions to Montenegro’s former finance minister Milojko Spajić, the current leader of the Europe Now party.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/jpmorgan-believes-bitcoin-is-currently-undervalued-sees-huge-crypto-upside-potential/">JPMorgan</a> strategists, Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, might potentially be classed to strike a balance between promoting innovation and protecting investors. The proposal comes amid ongoing discussions over the legal status of cryptocurrencies and the requirement for specific rules in the sector.</p>



<p>In a report released by JPMorgan, strategists under the direction of Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou discussed the potential for creating a new regulatory classification that would be suited exclusively for cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and others that demonstrate enough decentralization to avoid being classified as securities. Though less regulated than securities, the proposed &#8220;other category&#8221; would impose more limitations and investor safeguards than commodities.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;This &#8216;other category&#8217; would involve more restrictions and investor protections than currently envisaged for commodities but less onerous than those required for securities,&#8221; wrote the JPMorgan strategists.</em></p>



<p>Ethereum&#8217;s future reclassification results from the growing demand for regulatory clarity in cryptocurrency. Both sector participants and authorities have faced difficulties due to the lack of defined regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States has been at the forefront of efforts to allay these worries.</p>



<p>SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has emphasized the need to protect investors and abiding by current securities regulations on numerous occasions. Gensler emphasized the possible dangers connected with specific crypto assets during a congressional hearing on cryptocurrencies and asked for more robust oversight and regulation.</p>



<p>However, specific cryptocurrencies&#8217; status as securities is still up for debate. The SEC has come under scrutiny for determining whether a digital asset counts as a security, especially in light of continuing legal battles and regulatory proceedings against major market participants.</p>



<p>Attention has also been drawn to Gensler&#8217;s position on regulating the cryptocurrency market. Gensler recently reaffirmed his commitment to stopping fraud and safeguarding investor protection in an interview. To stop market manipulation and illegal actions, he emphasized the necessity for a thorough regulatory framework and more vigorous oversight.</p>



<p>The suggestion by JPMorgan strategists to designate Ethereum and other comparable decentralized cryptocurrencies into an &#8220;other category&#8221; may offer a compromise between the available regulatory choices. This strategy tries to find a balance that encourages innovation and protects investors by providing extra protections and limits above and above those for commodities while avoiding the stricter rules for securities.</p>



<p>The categorization of Ethereum might have wide-ranging effects on the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. It might serve as a model for other decentralized cryptocurrencies now unsure of their regulatory status. A clearer regulatory framework would be advantageous for projects like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/digital-asset-platform-bakkt-follows-robinhood-in-delisting-cardano-polygon-solana-after-sec-lawsuits/">Solana, Matic, Cardano</a>, and others facing concerns regarding their potential classification as securities.</p>



<p>The sector eagerly anticipates further developments as the discussion over cryptocurrency regulation continues. The proposal for a new regulatory classification for Ethereum exemplifies the continuous attempts to strike a balance between safeguarding investors and encouraging innovation in the quickly changing ecosystem of digital assets. Undoubtedly, how these talks turn out will influence how cryptocurrencies develop in the future and where they fit into the larger financial system.</p>

<p>Pepe Coin, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency, has recently demonstrated an impressive surge of 10% in its price within 48 hours. Due to regulatory worries from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the cryptocurrency market has been experiencing a general selloff. It&#8217;s unclear whether this is the beginning of a recovery rally or just a brief fakeout, despite the price increase appearing to demonstrate resilience.</p>



<p>Pepe Coin&#8217;s price wave follows a significant downturn in its value. In recent weeks, there was a sudden 80% decrease in the value of the cryptocurrency, which worried both analysts and investors. However, the most recent 10% increase has raised the possibility of a rebound.</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/pepe-coin-gains-broader-acceptance-after-gemini-exchange-listing/">Pepe Coin</a> has drawn the attention of market watchers, especially in light of claims of a big 1 trillion PEPE sell-off. Investors were alarmed when the suspected sell-off was linked to an insider dump. The abrupt drop in value prompted questions about Pepe Coin&#8217;s long-term viability and worried people about its prospects.</p>



<p>However, the current price increase has reignited interest in the cryptocurrency spawned by memes. Market participants and investors are eager to ascertain whether this upward movement denotes a true rebound or a brief price fluctuation.</p>



<p>Analysts have offered their opinions on the predicament and the future course of Pepe Coin. According to some experts, the recent increase is a precursor to a rebound rally, signalling increased market confidence and a likely downtrend reversal. They contend that the rising price and higher trading volume indicate growing support for cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Sceptics continue to be wary, asking if the most recent price increase is long-term sustainable. These critics contend that the rally might have been a brief &#8220;fakeout,&#8221; characterized by a spike in excitement before the general downturn resumed. Before making investment decisions, they advise investors to exercise restraint and carefully analyze the underlying fundamentals and market dynamics.</p>



<p>Pepe Coin&#8217;s performance in the upcoming weeks will be crucial in assessing its durability and long-term viability because its future is still undetermined. The crypto market still struggles with regulatory worries and greater scrutiny from regulatory organizations like the SEC.</p>



<p>Market participants eagerly await new developments and regulatory bodies&#8217; guidance as the cryptocurrency industry seeks regulatory clarification. The regulatory environment will significantly shape the future of cryptocurrencies like Pepe Coin and their capacity to develop in a compliant and transparent manner.</p>



<p>Investors and enthusiasts will be careful of Pepe Coin&#8217;s price fluctuations and market mood in the interim to determine whether the current spike represents a genuine indication of recovery or is merely a passing blip in a volatile market. The final result will depend on variables, including market sentiment, legislative changes, and Pepe Coin&#8217;s capacity to recoup and maintain investor trust in the face of continued difficulties.</p>

<p>Often warned by industry executives, the United States is losing its grip on digital assets more significantly in Bitcoin (BTC) although a much safer investor atmosphere could cause a turnaround.</p>



<p>New <a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1666784344868806657?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">data</a> from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode show that the 2022 bear market affected the United States market more than other jurisdictions in terms of growth and adoption. Since mid-2022 the amount of Bitcoin traded by US firms has dropped by 11%, with most tricking into Asia.</p>



<p>“<em>A clear divergence is visible in the year-over-year BTC supply change based on geographical regions. The extreme dominance of US entities in 2020-21 has clearly reversed, with US supply dominance falling by 11% since mid-2022,” </em>Glassnode researchers noted.</p>



<p>The Asian market recorded a 9.9% increase throughout 2022 but still lags behind US high levels of Jan 2021. European markets have maintained their position recording a slight increase of 1.1% in BTC supply dominance.</p>



<p>“<em>European markets have been fairly neutral over the last year, whilst a significant increase in supply dominance is visible across Asian trading hours.”</em></p>



<p>Europe has become an attractive spot in driving crypto investments after it began drafting the Markets In Crypto Asset (MiCA) regulation. The regulation seeks to unify cryptocurrency regulation across the jurisdiction and clear uncertainty amongst other things in the region. Many commentators have tipped MiCA to be the “<em>turning point” </em>in crypto regulation and positioned Europe at the center of digital asset adoption.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-asia-steals-the-show"><strong>Asia steals the show</strong></h2>



<p>Several US crypto executives have berated the state of things in the sector following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) enforcement-by-regulation approach. This year, Republican lawmakers also blasted the Commission’s Chairman Gary Gensler for his hostile stance against digital assets.</p>



<p>At a hearing in the House Financial Service Committee in April, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/gary-gensler-is-driving-crypto-to-china-republican-congressman-hit-sec-chair-with-fresh-allegations/">lawmakers</a> grilled Gensler for the lack of clarity in the sector with Rep Tom Emmer accusing him of driving investments to China. “<em>You’re pushing start-ups into the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” </em>she said.</p>



<p>China is reportedly making plans to reconsider its harsh stance on digital assets as Hong Kong has allowed exchanges to offer trading services and is playing down plans for a state-owned exchange. The renewed push among exchanges for the Asian market also points to a larger interest in web3 and Bitcoin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Uniswap’s new upgrade has sparked a new controversy regarding its “open source” description, with developers saying “<em>it is not as advertised.”</em></li>



<li>The company released its fourth version on a Business Source License, giving room for critics due to its four-year open-source period.</li>



<li>Uniswap has responded to critics explaining that four years is not a long time to balance incentivizing innovation and giving out exclusive rights.</li>
</ul>



<p>This week, Uniswap’s developers noted that the new version of the decentralized exchange (DEX) will offer users limitless possibilities; while that may be true, some promises were not.</p>



<p>Prior to the launch of Uniswap’s V4, the management team made several promises from the increased utility of the exchange to its open-source nature which attracted the attention of developers. The promise of it being open-source has been called a “<em>misrepresentation” </em>by a cross-section of Ethereum’s community.</p>



<p>The V4 was released as a Business Source License (BSL), which means that its code is open to the public and can be copied, reproduced, and redistributed, but there’s a caveat. All these can only be done after four years when it converts to a General Purpose License (GPL).</p>



<p>Lefteris Karapetsas, an Ethereum developer and founder of Rotki, expressed his displeasure stating that “Uniswap decided to go with a Business Source License (BSL), continuing what they did with v3. The reason is they don’t understand open source,<em> and they believe their moat is their code which is wrong.” </em>He was the first to call out Uniswap on Twitter and urged them to use the proper terminology as this “<em>is insulting to actual open-source software.”</em></p>



<p>Another dev, Scott Lewis, <a href="https://twitter.com/scott_lew_is/status/1668740924489232384?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">pointed</a> out that Unisawap’s V4 is a four-year proprietary license adding that “<em>If anyone else misrepresented the truth like this, they would be torn to shreds. That’s the power of being powerful.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-uniswap-defend-their-false-claims"><strong>Uniswap defend their “<em>false” </em>claims</strong></h2>



<p>Hayden Adams the founder of Uniswap alongside his development team addressed the controversy on YouTube. The group noted that the four-year period is not as long time as it appears, and it strikes a healthy balance between “<em>incentivizing innovation and giving exclusive rights to the protocol, which has precedents in &#8216;normal&#8217; settings as well.”</em></p>



<p>Gabriel Shapiro describes it as a tax on innovation, explaining further that it would be difficult for young devs to navigate while building from scratch. </p>



<p>“<em>Anyone who&#8217;s looked at BSL code even once, and then later codes something similar, is at a risk of catching a copyright claim,” </em>he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the criticisms meted out against Uniswap, many have hailed the V4 for rolling out a new smart contract termed “<em>hooks” </em>which lets developers expand liquidity pools increasing customizability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Former SEC Director Says Judgment On Ripple vs SEC Lawsuit To Come Within Days — XRP Price To $10?</p>



<p>$1 XRP Price Looks Nigh</p>



<p>A long-time enforcement attorney-cum-regional director at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has predicted that Ripple’s long-standing tussle with the agency will conclude in days’ time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-the-end-near"><strong>Is The End Near?</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC-Ripple case, which has dragged on for over two years now, may be coming to an end very soon.</p>



<p>Marc Fagel, the former Regional Director of the SEC’s San Francisco Regional Office, <a href="https://twitter.com/Marc_Fagel/status/1669390377168805890">expects </a>a judge to issue her ruling in the XRP lawsuit in the coming days. Fagel was responding to an XRP enthusiast who suggested in a tweet that the SEC withdrawing its lawsuits before summary judgment potentially undermines the presiding judge. A follow-up tweet noted that a delay in the verdict would bolster the argument that public relations influenced the judge’s decision and that it would lead to more confusion.</p>



<p>While trying to avoid speculation, Fagel posited that a court decision could be expected within days. In his opinion, any further delay in the lawsuit would be due to the complexities of the case and not any hidden agendas.</p>



<p>The SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">initiated </a>its precedent-setting suit against Ripple, CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and chairman Chris Larsen in the last quarter of 2020. The allegation: raising north of $1.2 billion from 2013 via the unlicensed sale of alleged security, XRP.</p>



<p>The XRP community was recently in uproar after the infamous William Hinman materials were <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-primed-for-massive-upsurge-as-sec-case-tilts-in-ripples-favor-amid-huge-reveal-of-hinman-docs/">released to the public</a>. Ripple’s counsel argued that Hinman’s speech in 2018 — where he reportedly said that Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, was not a security — fostered confusion, leading market participants, including Ripple, to believe that XRP was not a security.</p>



<p>According to former SEC director Fagel, Ripple’s case is quite different from other enforcement actions recently launched by the securities watchdog. He opined that the judge would likely not address the Hinman documents or the secondary market trading matter. The emails, however, may be referenced in connection with a verdict on the individual defendants&#8217; liability.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Implications Of The Impending Ruling</strong></h2>



<p>Weighing in on the Twitter conversation, XRP holders’ attorney John Deaton recalled his earlier argument that the greatest mistake in the suit was charging individual execs with aiding and abetting, sparking a recklessness standard. Nevertheless, Deaton is confident that no reasonable jury can find the two Ripple executives reckless.</p>



<p>The high-stakes drama between the SEC and Ripple is likely to be the defining moment for the broader crypto industry, not just for XRP.  SEC chair Gary Gensler has frequently reiterated his belief that all cryptocurrencies — except for Bitcoin — are securities, signalling the Commission’s intent to scrutinize more crypto assets.</p>



<p>A Ripple defeat would hamper mainstream adoption, embolden the SEC to pursue similar cases, cause market turbulence, and an exodus of many ambitious crypto startups looking for friendlier jurisdictions away from the United States. Notably, Deaton, earlier this month <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-lawsuit-sec-has-a-3-chance-of-winning-says-lawyer-predicts-xrp-victory-surge-to-10-price/">predicted </a>a 3% chance of District Judge Analisa Torres ruling in favor of the SEC.</p>



<p>A Ripple victory, on the other hand, would boost confidence in crypto assets and usher in a new era of investments. If this happens, the price of Ripple’s XRP could rocket to as high as $10 in no time, per Deaton.</p>

<p>Intercontinental Exchange-owned Bakkt has delisted Solana, Polygon, and Cardano, adding to a growing list of crypto firms ending support for the tokens amid a wave of regulatory uncertainty in the United States.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bakkt-shakes-up-crypto-offerings-delists-ada-matic-sol"><strong>Bakkt Shakes Up Crypto Offerings, Delists ADA, MATIC, SOL</strong></h2>



<p>Regulatory pressures have led New York-based digital assets platform Bakkt to delist native tokens for prominent blockchains Solana, Polygon, and Cardano.</p>



<p>Bakkt’s general counsel and secretary Marc D&#8217;Annunzio <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/06/16/bakkt-delists-solana-polygon-cardano-regulatory-clarity/">told </a><em>Fortune </em>the firm was implementing changes “until there is further clarity on how to compliantly offer a more extensive list of coins.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The exchange Bakkt delisted ADA, MATIC, and SOL on the grounds of unclear supervision.  Bakkt delisted Algorand and Decentraland tokens amid the SEC lawsuit against Bittrex, and then voluntarily delisted 25 tokens in May.  Bakkt currently offers eight tokens including BTC, ETH,…</p>&mdash; Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1669684096526860289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The delisting move comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed two lawsuits last week against cryptocurrency exchanges <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">Coinbase </a>and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">Binance</a>. The regulator alleged that SOL, MATIC, ADA, and other digital assets were unregistered securities in both filings.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Robinhood Started The Trend</strong></h2>



<p>Bakkt is at least the third company in recent days to axe tokens labelled as unregistered securities by the SEC. Popular trading app Robinhood <a href="https://zycrypto.com/robinhood-ceases-support-for-cardano-solana-and-polygon-after-sec-calls-them-securities/">cut support </a>for ADA, MATIC, and SOL on June 9. eToro followed suit on June 12, <a href="https://twitter.com/eToroUS/status/1668323758199955456">suspending </a>trading of Decentraland, Dash, Algorand, and Polygon for U.S. customers in light of the SEC’s recent legal action. This is not the first time eToro is delisting tokens in response to SEC-related pressure. In late 2020, the platform halted access to XRP shortly after the SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">sued </a>Ripple. </p>



<p>That being said, Bakkt does not seem to be popular enough to impact investor sentiments or the market. The prices of ADA, SOL, and MATIC are up by 1.8%, 3.7%, and 1.1%, respectively, despite the company’s decision. </p>



<p>Still, Bakkt&#8217;s decision to halt support for major altcoins may influence other companies to follow suit.</p>
