<ul><li>The share price of software firm Microstrategy increased by 7% following a recent projection by Berenberg.&nbsp;</li><li>The investment bank believes that next year’s Bitcoin halving could trigger a rally in Microstategy’s stock (MSTR).&nbsp;</li><li>Berenburg’s current MSTR price target is $430, which would be an 18-month high.</li></ul>



<p>Hamburg-based Berenberg Capital Markets recently circulated a research note which presented the upcoming <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-pro-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> halving as a potential trigger event for the share price of the United States-based software firm Microstrategy. Berenberg believes that the fourth Bitcoin halving could lead to a considerable rally in the share price of Bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylor’s company. </p>



<h2><strong>Berenberg Shares Bullish Price Target For Microstrategy</strong></h2>



<p>According to a research note shared with <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/238784/bitcoin-halving-underpins-bull-case-for-microstrategy-berenberg-says" rel="nofollow noopener">The Block</a>, Berenberg Capital Markets placed most of Microstrategy’s value on the massive Bitcoin holding on its balance sheet, which exceeded a whopping 150,000. The investment bank is counting on the previously seen rally in BTC’s price following the halving event, to trigger a bullish scenario for the share price of Saylor’s company as well. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;If the fourth bitcoin halving features he kind of strong rally in the price of bitcoin that occurred prior to and following the first three halvings, then we believe it is likely that MSTR’s stock would rally along with it; the correlation between the company’s share price and the price of bitcoin is ~0.90.&#8221;</p><cite>Berenberg Capital Markets</cite></blockquote>



<p>Berenberg currently has a rather bullish price target for Microstrategy’s stock, $430 to be precise. The investment bank believes that the software firm’s share price will reach an 18-month high and deliver numbers that were previously witnessed in January 2022. At the time of writing, the stock was trading at $407.7, up more than 7% over the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previously witnessed trends suggest that Microstrategy’s stock reacts to the price action of Bitcoin. A drop in BTC is usually mirrored by the software company’s share price. A research report released by Standard Chartered on Monday reinforced MSTR’s bull case. The British banking giant increased its BTC price target and stated that the flagship cryptocurrency could reach $130,000 by the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority has initiated enforcement action against UAE-based crypto exchange BitOasis.&nbsp;</li><li>The local regulator reprimanded the exchange for failure to comply with mandated regulatory conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>VARA has also revoked the MVP license which was granted to the crypto exchange in April 2023.&nbsp;</li><li>VARA’s MVP license was previously described as restrictive by fellow crypto exchange Bybit.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>United Arab Emirates-based crypto exchange BitOasis found itself in regulatory trouble earlier today after Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) initiated enforcement actions against it. VARA’s crackdown on the Middle East-focused crypto exchange was prompted by the latter’s failure to comply with mandated conditions within the timelines prescribed by the local regulator.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Dubai VARA Suspends BitOasis’ MVP License </strong></h2>



<p>The Virtual Assets Regulatory Committee issued a<a href="https://www.vara.ae/en/" rel="nofollow noopener"> market alert</a> earlier today, informing investors and customers of BitOasis about ongoing supervisory controls and enforcement actions against the crypto exchange. VARA’s reprimand comes just two months after the exchange was issued one of the Emirates’ first minimum viable product (MVP) operational licenses. The license paved the way for the exchange to secure a permit for market operations in the region pending the fulfillment of key conditions. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“BitOasis is under review for not meeting mandated conditions, required to be satisfied within 30-60 day time frames prior to being permitted to undertake any VARA regulated market activity.”</p><cite>Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority</cite></blockquote>



<p>The local regulator has suspended BitOasis’ conditional MVP license and announced that the exchange’s license for Institutional and Qualified Retail Investors had become non-operational. This meant that the crypto exchange would have to work with the regulator to sort out the issues before applying for the Full Market Product (FMP) license. VARA noted in its market warning that it would monitor the situation for regulatory compliance and fulfillment of remedial actions imposed on the exchange.</p>



<p>BitOasis has not issued a statement to address the latest development in its Middle Eastern operations. Fellow crypto exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bybit-cyprus-ahead-mica-implementation/">Bybit</a> was issued an MVP license by VARA last month. At the time, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou described the license as restrictive, adding that it only allowed the crypto exchange to cater to a very restricted set of accredited investors.</p>

<p>Grayscale Investments, the asset management giant behind the world’s largest Bitcoin, has called out the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for approving riskier Bitcoin futures ETFs and rejecting applications for the relatively safer spot <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/former-sec-chair-jay-clayton-bullish-on-bitcoin-etf-approval/">Bitcoin ETFs</a>. The Digital Currency Group (DCG) subsidiary penned a letter to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit earlier today to express its frustration with the SEC’s recent conduct. </p>



<h2><strong>Grayscale: Leveraged Bitcoin ETF Exposes Investors To Greater Risk</strong></h2>



<p>According to the <a href="https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Grayscale-28j-letter-re-2x-BTC-futures-ETF-7.7.23.pdf?sfclid=00Q5G00000Z914hUAB&amp;utm_source=marketo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=1339&amp;utm_content=cta-button&amp;mkt_tok=MDAwLUVVRS0xMjUAAAGM33BbCUnPwID7Awua0leTsWOSRQ5nff_0ImhaJUCh-0Ptadnx4NM_XNU4FDzksEmlIHnByT61SEvTXQib2FkCEuq9GiAUgJmazWII3pw" rel="nofollow noopener">letter</a> sent to the Columbia District Court, the SEC’s decision to allow the trading of Volatility Shares’ 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX) exposed investors to an investment product that was riskier than Bitcoin futures ETF. The letter was sent by Don Verrilli of Munger, Tolles &amp; Olsen, the law firm which represents Grayscale Investments. The securities regulator approved trading of the BITX ETF starting June 27, 2023. BITX has already accumulated $15 million in assets. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“The fact that the Commission has allowed a leveraged bitcoin futures ETP to begin trading demonstrates that the Commission continues to arbitrarily treat spot bitcoin ETPs differently than bitcoin futures ETPs.” </p><cite>Don Verrilli, partner at Munger, Tolles &amp; Olsen</cite></blockquote>



<p>Verrilli stated in his letter that the 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF sought to double the performance of the S&amp;P CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index each day. He added that the Volatility ETF in question exposed investors to even more risks of the BTC markets than Grayscale’s proposed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP). The letter from Grayscale comes more than a year after it sued the SEC for denying its spot Bitcoin ETF application.</p>

<p></p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/07/10/fmr-sec-chair-jay-clayton-on-u-s-china-relations-were-overly-dependent-on-a-vicious-competitor.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/07/10/fmr-sec-chair-jay-clayton-on-u-s-china-relations-were-overly-dependent-on-a-vicious-competitor.html" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>, the highly regarded former Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  Jay Clayton, expressed strong belief in the approval of a Bitcoin ETF. </p>



<p>According to Clayton, the Bitcoin market may have reached a level of maturation that could potentially warrant regulatory approval for an ETF. The increased institutional adoption and market developments should have addressed many concerns previously held by regulators.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen development to the point where companies whose reputation in the market matters are saying that they think that trading and custody around this market are sufficient,&#8221; said Clayton in the interview. </p>



<p>When asked by the interviewer, &#8220;Can they say NO to a Spot ETF?, Clayton responded &#8220;It would be hard to resist approving a Bitcoin Spot ETF if the spot market has similar efficacy to the futures market. </p>



<p>With an ETF in place, investors would be able to track Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements without direct ownership of the cryptocurrency itself; this approach mitigates some perceived risks associated with holding digital assets.</p>



<p>While acknowledging that the SEC bears primary responsibility for investor protection and market integrity Clayton argued that risks related to a Bitcoin ETF have diminished over time due to regulatory advancements and increased oversight in the marketplace. </p>



<p>Several other countries have already embraced Bitcoin ETFs which highlights that it may be time for the U.S. not to lag behind in embracing such financial innovation.</p>



<p>Despite this positive outlook. Clayton recognized that any proposal for a Bitcoin ETF should undergo a comprehensive review by the SEC to address potential concerns including market manipulation, custody solutions, and investor protection measures. The former chair stressed on conducting thorough due diligence by the SEC in order to mitigate risks associated with this emerging sector within crypto industry. As discussions surrounding a potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF continue, words from an authoritative figure such as Clayton bolster industry experts&#8217; belief that regulatory approval is well overdue for such an investment vehicle. If approved the introduction of a Bitcoin ETF into the American market may unlock significant possibilities for retail as well as institutional investors interested in participating within the regulated cryptocurrency realm securely.</p>

<p>Police in Hong Kong are investigating a crime syndicate after a local accountant was fleeced of HK$1 million in Tether during an over-the-counter (OTC) exchange in Tsim Sha Tsui.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3216901/hong-kong-retiree-loses-nearly-hk7-million-2-months-online-cryptocurrency-investment-scam?module=hard_link&amp;pgtype=article" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3216901/hong-kong-retiree-loses-nearly-hk7-million-2-months-online-cryptocurrency-investment-scam?module=hard_link&amp;pgtype=article" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">local media</a>, the accountant was lured to the shop after interacting with an Instagram ad offering high exchange rates. The post included contact information which the victim used to arrive at a basement shop in Chevalier House on Chatham Road South, Tsim Sha Tsui.</p>



<p>Sources say the accountant hoped to exchange their $127,750 in Tether&#8217;s stablecoin USDT to HK$1 million in an OTC trade. The scammer who impersonated a shop employee offered &#8220;a bundle of HK$1,000 banknotes on the counter for payment of the transaction,&#8221; said a person familiar with the matter. </p>



<p>The Hong Kong accountant, unaware of the scammer&#8217;s plans, transferred $128,040 in Tether to an e-wallet at their behest. With their booty in hand, the fraudster asked to be excused and disappeared from the shop moments later. </p>



<p>The accountant realized they had been swindled and contacted local police on Sunday evening around 10 pm. Authorities are reportedly investigating whether the shop was specifically set up to steal the accountant&#8217;s digital currency and how deep the syndicate&#8217;s operations run. </p>



<h2>Hong Kong&#8217;s Crypto Streets</h2>



<p>Sunday&#8217;s incident is part of a string of crypto scams besieging Hong Kong&#8217;s burgeoning digital currency ecosystem. Last month, another accountant lost $3.4 million (HK$27 million) to a crypto investment scheme. A retiree lost nearly $1 million of her personal savings to an investment scam in April. It&#8217;s unclear whether cases are unrelated or perpetrated by the same organization.</p>

<p>Blockchain intelligence provider Arkham announced a new offering to allow users anonymously buy and sell data about wallet addresses.</p>



<p>On Monday, the startup unveiled &#8220;The World’s First On-Chain Intelligence Exchange&#8221; for blockchain sleuths and intel seekers alike. Users of the exchange will be able to post intelligence requests in the form of bounties. Sleuths can then claim these bounties and provide the requested intel for an agreed price. </p>



<p>On-chain sleuths can also offer intel on wallet addresses for a fixed price or via auction to the highest bidder. This &#8220;intel-to-earn&#8221; model will create a liquid market for blockchain information and foster easier monetization for talented on-chain investigators, the intelligence provider said on Monday. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Our vision for the Arkham Intel Exchange is a decentralized intel-to-earn economy powered by smart contracts, in which any sleuth can earn based on their skills &amp; experience. This ushers in a new era for crypto with a much higher standard of transparency and knowledge.</p></blockquote>



<p>Intel traded on the Arkham Intel Exchange will be solely accessible to the buyer for a period of 90 days before it is made public to all users. Arkham said this system will allow the buyer to extract alpha in the short run and ensure decentralization of on-chain knowledge in the long run. The exchange will go live on Tuesday, July 18. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Co-Founder of Terraform Labs Daniel Shin needs more time to mount his defense, lawyers told a Seoul Court on Monday.</li><li>Shin’s April indictment alleges that the former Terra exec and seven other former company employees broke South Korea’s Capital Markets Act.</li><li>South Korean investigators are also looking to prosecute founder Do Kwon who is in a Montenegrin jail cell for forging travel papers.</li></ul>



<p>The first hearing for a case against Terraform co-founder Daniel Shin held on Monday following the company&#8217;s astronomical crash last year that deleted over $40 million from investor&#8217;s pockets. </p>



<p>According to South Korean media outlet <a href="https://m.news1.kr/articles/?5101793" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://m.news1.kr/articles/?5101793" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">News 1</a>, the Seoul Southern District Court preliminary hearing addressed charges brought against Shin and seven other former Terra employees. Although Shin did not personally appear in court, his lawyers requested more time to mount a defense as the case is highly technical. The court set a date of August 28 for a second hearing.</p>



<p>Shin and other former executives became subjects of investigations in South Korea following the crash of Terra last year. In April, prosecutors formally <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/terra-daniel-shin-nine-others-indicted/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/terra-daniel-shin-nine-others-indicted/" rel="noreferrer noopener">indicted Shin</a> and claimed that he violated the country&#8217;s Capital Markets Act. </p>



<p>While two requests for Shin&#8217;s arrest were denied, authorities have reportedly seized around 247 billion won in assets belonging to former Terra execs. Co-founder Shin and his lawyers denied any wrongdoing and insisted that he left the company prior to any malicious activity. </p>



<h2>Terra Co-Founders In Legal Bind</h2>



<p>Indeed, Do Kwon and Daniel Shin who are the co-founders of Terraform Labs face legal consequences after their company&#8217;s massive crash in 2022. Shin is currently on trial in South Korea despite claiming he cut ties with the company before the crash. </p>



<p>Do Kwon who is wanted by Interpol, South Korean law enforcement, and U.S. authorities, was found guilty of forging travel documents in Montenegro. A judge <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-4-month-montenegro-forgery/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-4-month-montenegro-forgery/" rel="noreferrer noopener">sentenced Kwon to four months</a> in jail after a court decided that he would remain in detention for the rest of 2023 while authorities consider extradition requests. </p>

<p>Shiba Inu enthusiasts are eagerly anticipating the upcoming launch of Shibarium. The Layer 2 solution designed for the Shiba Inu ecosystem.</p>



<p>Shibarium is anticipated to have a significant impact on reducing gas fees on the Shiba Inu network ultimately making it more accessible and affordable for users. This development has attracted investors who are already showing interest in SHIB prior to the Shibarium launch over recent weeks.</p>



<p>The price of SHIB has been steadily rising and was trading as high as $0.0000085 according to <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DGIEmxZN/?symbol=BINANCE%3ASHIBUSDT" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DGIEmxZN/?symbol=BINANCE%3ASHIBUSDT" rel="noopener">TradingView</a>. Experts predict that following the Shibarium launch there is a possibility that the price could even reach $0.0000100, if not higher.</p>



<p>The Shibarium launch is <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/07/shiba-inu-based-shibarium-blockchain-expected-to-go-live-in-august/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/07/shiba-inu-based-shibarium-blockchain-expected-to-go-live-in-august/" rel="nofollow noopener">scheduled </a>to take place in August 2023; although an exact date hasn&#8217;t been disclosed yet. Developers assure that they remain on track with their schedule.</p>



<p>Once Launched Shibarium will mark a significant milestone for the Shiba Inu ecosystem by introducing improved scalability and efficiency for better user interaction with the network. Consequently this highly anticipated event is also expected to positively influence SHIBs price and potentially lead to wider token adoption. The following are key benefits associated with Shibarium:</p>



<p><strong>1) Reduced gas fees:</strong> By implementing a proof of stake consensus mechanism instead of Ethereums current proof of work mechanism. Shibarium will substantially lower gas fees on the Shiba Inu network. </p>



<p><strong>2) Increased scalability: </strong>Compared to Ethereum. Shibarium will be capable of processing a higher number of transactions per second. This enhancement will greatly improve scalability and overall efficiency for the Shiba Inu network.<br><strong>3) Enhanced user experience: </strong>With reduced gas fees and increased scalability provided by Shibarium users will find it more convenient and cost effective to interact within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The much anticipated launch of Shibarium is undoubtedly poised to be a major catalyst within the Shiba Inu community.</p>



<p>Further driving growth and development in the ecosystem. The launch of Shibarium is an important development for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. By making the network more scalable, efficient and user friendly it has the potential to increase adoption of the token and raise the price of SHIB. However. It is important to be aware of the risks associated with this project.</p>



<p>There is a possibility that the project could be delayed or canceled despite the good track record of the Shibarium developers. Additionally, there is always a risk that the project may not meet expectations or could be vulnerable to hacking. If hacking were to occur, it could negatively impact the reputation of the Shiba Inu ecosystem and potentially cause a decline in SHIBs price.</p>

<p>There are a number of liquid staking services available, including Lido, Rocket Pool, and Stakefish. These services typically work by issuing a token that represents the staked cryptocurrency. For example, when users stake ETH with Lido, they receive stETH tokens. stETH tokens can be traded, lent, or used just like ETH tokens.</p>



<p><strong>Why is liquid staking growing in popularity?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What does the addition of LDO to the Grayscale DeFi Fund mean?</strong></p>



<p>The addition of LDO to the Grayscale DeFi Fund is a significant development for the liquid staking space. It is a sign of growing institutional interest in liquid staking services, and it is likely to help to drive further adoption of these services in the future.</p>

<p><strong>What does the future hold for liquid staking?</strong></p>

This is likely to lead to further development of the liquid staking space, as new services and products are introduced.</p>



<p>It is also possible that liquid staking will eventually become the standard way to stake cryptocurrencies. This is because it offers a number of advantages over traditional staking, such as increased liquidity and flexibility.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908.26.0.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">response</a> sent to U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla, the SEC asked the court to disregard arguments previously made by Coinbase regarding the legality of its crypto listings, citing that the exchange was a multi-billion dollar entity with access to sophisticated legal counsel. The securities regulator further took issue with the crypto exchange’s argument that the approval of its IPO confirmed its underlying business and protected it from future enforcement actions. </p>



<p>The SEC cited Coinbase’s previous court filings which noted that the uncertainty regarding the security status of the tokens listed on the crypto exchange may pose a risk to its investors.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>These actions clearly show that Coinbase understood that the securities laws could apply to its conduct and knew which rules to consider in evaluating the legality of its conduct, but nevertheless made the calculated decision to take on this risk in the name of growing its business.&#8221; </p><cite>Securities and Exchange Commission</cite></blockquote>



<p>The SEC believes that the arguments made by Coinbase are flawed and highlighted that it had adopted the very legal framework as a basis for making listing decisions that it claimed had no applicability to its activities. The response filed with Judge Polk requested the denial of the exchange&#8217;s motion to have the lawsuit dismissed. The regulator also stated that it would oppose any motion for judgement from the crypto exchange.</p>
