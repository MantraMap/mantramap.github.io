<p>As reported by E-Daily this afternoon, the Korean police will have an emergency meeting with the 5 largest Korean exchanges (Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit and Gopax) and Binance to develop a plan to build built a system that allows users to check virtual currency wallet addresses and request freezing of funds not only on 5 major domestic exchanges but also on the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the market through this meeting.</p>



<p>Previously, in October last year, the police signed business agreements with five domestic virtual asset exchanges, including Upbit, and opened a &#8220;virtual asset exchange confirmation system&#8221;. When the police look up the address of the virtual asset wallet under investigation, it works in a way that notifies the exchange that is actually regulated among the five major exchanges.</p>



<p>This country is promoting this system so that it can be applied to Binance, an overseas virtual asset exchange. In addition, the advancement of the virtual asset exchange confirmation system and the reorganization of the hotline (a police-only communication network) will be discussed. The police plan to expand the exchange confirmation system to all 36 exchanges in the country, including five major exchanges.</p>

<p>This action is organized after an investigation related to the virtual assets of lawmaker<a href="https://news.coincu.com/188958-klayswap-raid-suspected-kim-nam-guk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Kim Nam-guk</a> in the country is being investigated. The finding shows that the former Democrat held at least $4.5 million in crypto assets on the Wemix exchange. This disclosure raises concerns about possible money laundering, conflicts of interest, and abuse of inside information.</p>



<p>The government has taken significant steps to address the issue of cryptocurrency holdings among state officials by introducing the &#8220;Kim Nam-guk Prevention Law.&#8221; The law comes in the wake of a scandal involving members of Congress who were found to have transferred large amounts of cryptocurrency. The new law, which Congress has unanimously passed, requires lawmakers and senior officials to report their crypto assets.</p>

<p>He shared the text of the proposed new debt ceiling deal on Sunday, which includes a complete suspension until January 1, 2025, while implementing a series of spending cuts, including limiting non-defense spending and reducing RSI funding.</p>



<p>In response to Davidson, Pierre Rochard – VP of Research at Bitcoin mining firm Riot Platforms – he was noted that the bill does not have any mention of a proposed Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) tax previous government. Davidson confirmed that the proposal is no longer available and that blocking the Democrats&#8217; proposed taxes is among the Republican negotiating victories.</p>



<p>The proposed withdrawal was part of a series of tax-related concessions the administration made in negotiations around the nation&#8217;s looming debt ceiling. The act still needs congressional approval before it goes into effect to avoid a seeming economic disaster for the US government.</p>

<p>Previously, a proposal to levy a 30% tax on electricity used by cryptocurrency miners was proposed as part of President Biden&#8217;s 2024 fiscal year budget. If the latter is passed, miners could face a 10% annual tax increase for three years on electricity generated starting in 2024.</p>



<p>The proposed tax would make proof-of-work crypto miners a 30% tax on all energy used during mining – significantly increasing the cost of running a mining business in the United States.</p>

<p>His expanded responsibilities come when Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, are under fire from US authorities over compliance issues. Outside of the US, there has been a flurry of developments, including launching a new platform for Japanese residents after buying a local crypto firm and a joint venture in Thailand securing licenses for digital exchange. In Australia, the permit for its derivatives business has been canceled pending a review of its local operations.</p>

<p>Teng’s international experience, regulatory background, and global relationships will be an asset to Binance as it seeks to navigate the complexities of the global regulatory landscape. The Blockchain Association Singapore&#8217;s board chairman, Chia Hock Lai, approved Teng&#8217;s appointment.</p>



<p>Before joining Binance, Teng held other senior positions in the traditional financial sector. His experience and expertise in regulatory compliance and corporate finance make him a valuable asset to Binance in the current regulatory environment. Teng&#8217;s swift and steady ascension at Binance is a testament to his capabilities and the company&#8217;s trust in him.</p>

<p>In early May, the currency was only processing less than 20,000 transactions per day, which indicated that it had not yet gained much traction in the crypto industry. However, this all changed when the number of transactions skyrocketed to 1.152 million on May 25, then slightly increased to 1.162 million the following day, and finally broke the 2 million mark on May 27. This astonishing increase drove DOGE&#8217;s transaction volume to a new all-time high, which proved to be a remarkable milestone for the meme-coin, as it outperformed Bitcoin&#8217;s peak transaction volume in 14 years.</p>



<p>The sudden and remarkable acceleration of DOGE&#8217;s transaction volume can be attributed to an intriguing trend: the rampant minting of DRC20 tokens on the Dogecoin chain. This sudden increase in network activity was fueled by the attractive low transaction fees that DOGE offers, which led to a flurry of activity on the network. As a result, Dogecoin has seen a surge in network activity, which has increased its transaction volume significantly.</p>

<p>Despite the increased transaction volume, the price performance of Dogecoin has remained relatively stable. As of the most recent data, the price of Dogecoin stands at $0.073444, reflecting a modest 0.8% increase over the day and a 2.5% gain over the past week. It is noteworthy that the increased network activity could potentially lead to a rise in the price of Dogecoin in the future, as more people start to recognize its potential.</p>

<p>NFT ticketing, or Non-Fungible Token ticketing, is a novel approach to ticketing that utilizes blockchain technology and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to revolutionize the way event access is managed. Unlike traditional tickets that are physical or digital representations of a generic item, NFT tickets are unique digital assets that are verifiable, scarce, and indivisible.</p>



<p>NFTs are built on blockchain platforms, with Ethereum being the most commonly used network. Each NFT ticket represents a distinct token on the blockchain, carrying specific metadata such as event details, seat numbers, venue information, and more. The uniqueness and traceability of NFT tickets make them highly secure and resistant to counterfeiting.</p>



<p>The process of NFT ticketing involves several steps. First, event organizers create NFT tickets by minting unique tokens on a blockchain platform. They attach relevant information to each ticket, making it a complete representation of the event access. These NFT tickets are then made available for sale through online platforms or marketplaces.</p>



<p>When someone purchases an NFT ticket, ownership of the token is transferred to their digital wallet. The ownership transfer is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability. The buyer can choose to keep the ticket or transfer it to another party, just like a physical ticket exchange.</p>



<p>Smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with predefined rules, play a crucial role in NFT ticketing. Event organizers can embed smart contracts into the NFT tickets, specifying conditions such as transfer restrictions, resale rights, or access to exclusive event perks. These smart contracts automatically enforce the defined rules, providing a seamless and automated experience for both organizers and ticket holders.</p>



<p>On the day of the event, attendees present their NFT tickets stored in their digital wallets. The event venue or ticketing system scans the unique identifier of the ticket, verifies its authenticity and ownership by interacting with the blockchain, and grants access to the event based on the validated ticket.</p>



<p>NFT ticketing offers several advantages over traditional ticketing systems. Firstly, it enhances security and eliminates the risk of counterfeit tickets, as each NFT ticket is unique and cannot be replicated. The transparency and traceability of blockchain records ensure the authenticity and integrity of each ticket.</p>



<p>Additionally, NFT ticketing provides opportunities for secondary market transactions. Ticket holders can sell or trade their NFT tickets on various marketplaces, creating additional revenue streams and enabling ticket transfers in a secure and transparent manner. This opens up possibilities for fan engagement and ticket ownership beyond the primary sale.</p>



<p>NFT ticketing also offers scalability and flexibility for event organizers. They can easily create and manage a large number of NFT tickets without the need for physical production or distribution. The customizable nature of NFT tickets allows for different tiers, VIP access, or unique perks, providing a tailored and personalized experience for attendees.</p>



<p>NFT ticketing provides valuable data and analytics to event organizers. Through blockchain records, organizers can gain insights into ticket sales, attendee demographics, and behavior patterns, enabling them to optimize marketing strategies, improve event planning, and enhance the overall attendee experience.</p>



<p>NFT ticketing introduces a transformative approach to event access management, leveraging blockchain technology and NFTs to ensure authenticity, enhance security, and provide new opportunities for both event organizers and ticket holders. As this innovative ticketing method gains traction, it has the potential to reshape the future of event ticketing, creating a more secure, transparent, and engaging experience for all stakeholders involved.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How NFT Ticketing Works</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/NFT-Ticketing-3.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/NFT-Ticketing-3-1024x576.jpeg" alt="NFT Ticketing 3" class="wp-image-190721" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/NFT-Ticketing-3-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/NFT-Ticketing-3-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/NFT-Ticketing-3-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/NFT-Ticketing-3-750x422.jpeg 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/NFT-Ticketing-3-1140x642.jpeg 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/NFT-Ticketing-3.jpeg 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Exploring NFT Ticketing: A Revolutionary Approach to Event Access 24"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The process of NFT ticketing involves several key steps that ensure the integrity and security of event access:</p>



<ol>
<li>Ticket Creation: Event organizers mint NFT tickets by creating unique tokens on a blockchain platform. They attach relevant metadata to each ticket, such as event details, seating information, date, and venue. This metadata ensures that the NFT ticket carries all the necessary information for event entry.</li>



<li>Ticket Sale: NFT tickets are typically sold through online platforms or marketplaces. Buyers can use cryptocurrency to purchase NFT tickets, and each transaction is recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent and immutable transaction history.</li>



<li>Ownership and Transfer: Once a ticket is purchased, ownership of the NFT ticket is transferred to the buyer&#8217;s digital wallet. The buyer can hold onto the ticket or transfer it to another party, just like a physical ticket. The blockchain records the ownership history, enabling easy tracking of the ticket&#8217;s journey and ensuring authenticity.</li>



<li>Smart Contract Integration: Smart contracts, self-executing contracts with predefined rules, play a crucial role in NFT ticketing. Event organizers can embed smart contracts into the NFT ticket, which automatically enforces event-related rules and conditions. These rules could include ticket transfer restrictions, resale conditions, or access to exclusive event perks.</li>



<li>Event Access: On the day of the event, attendees present their NFT ticket stored in their digital wallet. The event venue or ticketing system scans the unique ticket identifier and verifies its authenticity and ownership by interacting with the blockchain. Once the ticket is confirmed, the attendee gains entry to the event.</li>

<li>Enhanced Fan Engagement: NFT ticketing opens up new avenues for fan engagement and interaction. Ticket holders can participate in exclusive events, access digital content, or receive special benefits tied to their NFT tickets. This creates a sense of exclusivity and strengthens the connection between event organizers and attendees, fostering a loyal fan base.</li>



<li>Data and Analytics: NFT ticketing provides valuable data and analytics for event organizers. Blockchain records enable organizers to gather insights into ticket sales, attendee demographics, and purchasing patterns. This data can be used to improve marketing strategies, optimize event planning, and enhance the overall attendee experience.</li>



<li>Environmental Sustainability: NFT ticketing reduces the environmental impact associated with traditional ticketing methods. By eliminating the need for physical tickets, printing, and shipping, NFT ticketing helps reduce paper waste and carbon emissions. This aligns with sustainability efforts and promotes eco-friendly practices in the event industry.</li>



<li>Global Accessibility: NFT ticketing enables global accessibility to events.

This expands the reach of events, allows for international fan participation, and creates a more inclusive and diverse audience.</li>



<li>Integration with Digital Wallets: NFT tickets can be stored and managed in digital wallets, providing convenience and ease of access for attendees. Digital wallets allow ticket holders to keep all their event tickets in one place, eliminating the need for physical ticket handling and reducing the risk of loss or damage.</li>
</ol>



<p>NFT ticketing offers a range of benefits, including enhanced security, reduced ticket fraud, secondary market opportunities, scalability, fan engagement, data insights, environmental sustainability, global accessibility, and integration with digital wallets. As NFT ticketing continues to evolve, it has the potential to transform the ticketing industry and provide a more secure, efficient, and engaging experience for both event organizers and attendees.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>NFT ticketing represents a groundbreaking innovation in the ticketing industry, leveraging blockchain technology to ensure authenticity, enhance security, and provide new opportunities for ticket holders and event organizers.

<li><em>An Ethereum whale deposited 23,080 ETH worth $44M on Binance, indicating that major holders are starting to take profits amid Ethereum&#8217;s recent surge.</em></li>

<p>This is a significant amount, and suggests that major holders are now starting to take profits amid Ethereum&#8217;s recent surge.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Interestingly, the whale has been reducing its holdings in Ethereum systematically, making significant transfers of approximately 8,000 ETH each time the cryptocurrency experiences upward price movement. This pattern indicates a strategic move by the whale to gradually liquidate a portion of its holdings while minimizing potential market impact and volatility.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the whale&#8217;s average withdrawal price for Ethereum whales stands at around $1,820, which is well below the latest peak price. This suggests a conservative approach to risk management and a preference for locking in profits during periods of price strength. However, it&#8217;s important to consider that the whale&#8217;s actions do not necessarily indicate a larger trend among Ethereum whales.</p>



<p>Despite this sizable withdrawal, Ethereum&#8217;s market performance has remained resilient, with the price of Ethereum holding above the crucial $1,900 threshold. This suggests that the broader market sentiment remains bullish and is not significantly swayed by the actions of individual whales.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ethereum-Whales-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="315" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ethereum-Whales-1.jpeg" alt="Ethereum Whales 1" class="wp-image-190716" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ethereum-Whales-1.jpeg 600w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ethereum-Whales-1-300x158.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="Ethereum Whales Dumping As ETH Reaches $1,904 29"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>It&#8217;s also worth considering the potential implications of the whale&#8217;s activity. Major holders, known as whales, typically have significant influence over cryptocurrency prices due to the substantial size of their trades. The decision to sell or reduce their holdings can often lead to significant market movements. In this instance, the whale&#8217;s gradual sell-off may indicate a belief that Ethereum has peaked, or at least that a significant downturn is more likely than a continued upward trajectory.</p>



<p>As of press time, no major spike in exchange deposits has been recorded, suggesting that the behavior of this whale is not creating a market-wide trend. However, it will be interesting to see if other Ethereum whales follow suit and begin reducing their own holdings, potentially leading to a more significant market movement. Overall, it seems that while individual whales may have some impact on the market, the broader sentiment remains bullish, and Ethereum&#8217;s recent surge is still cause for optimism.</p>

<p>Having submitted an application notice to the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission on May 29, the exchange is now able to offer regulated services to its clients. This move is in line with Hong Kong&#8217;s recent introduction of a crypto licensing regime for crypto exchanges, which aims to protect retail investors and encourage innovation.</p>

<p>Huobi HK has stated that it will work closely with auditors to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering regulations set forth by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission. The platform&#8217;s primary goal is to meet the regulatory requirements of the commission and provide its clients with a secure and reliable trading experience.</p>



<p>Other firms, including BTSE, JPEX, and OKX, have also expressed their interest in applying for a virtual asset exchange license in Hong Kong. This shows that the crypto industry is taking note of Hong Kong&#8217;s efforts to regulate the sector and create a more stable environment for investors.</p>

<p>Huobi HK&#8217;s offering will operate via the main Huobi website. The exchange has already announced that it will list bitcoin and ether, among other major coins. The company believes that the regulation of web3 in Hong Kong will boost the adoption of cryptocurrencies on a global scale. As such, it plans to continue collaborating with regulatory authorities in Hong Kong to support the development of a vibrant web3 hub.</p>



<p>Huobi HK has established itself as a leading crypto exchange, with a trading volume of $12.7 billion so far this month. Although it lags behind larger exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and OKX, Huobi&#8217;s decision to offer crypto spot trading to retail and institutional clients in Hong Kong is a significant move that will undoubtedly help it gain a larger market share in the region.</p>
