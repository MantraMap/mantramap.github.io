Tether&#8217;s partner, Capital Union, a leading international boutique financial institution based in the Bahamas, manages this reserve. Capital Union is also in charge of the reserve&#8217;s custody and auditing.<br /><br />According to the company, one of the key benefits of Tether Introducing CNHT, a Stablecoin Pegged to the Chinese Yuan is that it enables cost-effective and secure Chinese Yuan transactions and eliminates the need to pay large transaction fees when sending CNHT across borders, as CNHT can be sent almost instantly and without the need for middlemen.<br /><br />CNHT is also fully compliant with Chinese regulations and is available on a number of exchanges, including OKEx and Huobi.<br /><br />It is the first stablecoin to be launched on the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/tron-unveils-plans-to-invest-100-million-in-blockchain-gaming-fund/">Tron blockchain,</a> and it aims to provide a more efficient and cost-effective way for people to exchange currencies.<br /><br />The introduction of this new stablecoin is expected to improve liquidity and lower transaction costs for those who use it. It will also make access to the Chinese yuan and other international currencies easier for users.</p>

<p>Following the team&#8217;s 3-0 extra-time loss to Morocco in the FIFA World Cup, the Spain National Football Team Fan Token (SNFT), according to data from <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/spain-national-fan-token">CoinGecko</a>, fell 42% from $0.09 per coin to $0.03 today.<br /><br />Crypto sports bettors have invested their money in tokens bearing the names of their preferred teams ever since the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/chz-price-analysis-chiliz-price-jumps-15-in-week-amid-fresh-wave-of-hype-ahead-of-fifa-world-cup-2022/">World Cup</a> began. Some tokens, such as the Argentine Football Association Fan Token (ARG), function similarly to DAO governance tokens by allowing owners to vote on upcoming fan events but not on the team&#8217;s strategy or roster.<br /><br />Sports fan tokens are all about the game, even though the majority of tokens can fluctuate with the turbulence of the cryptocurrency market.<br /><br />The price of the ARG token fell after Saudi Arabia defeated Argentina on November 23, 2022, as supporters sold their tokens. According to Coingecko, the Argentina team fan token initially traded at $8.10 per coin on November 20, 2022, but after the team&#8217;s defeat three days later, it dropped to $5.35 and has been falling ever since.<br /><br />Even a victory, however, does not ensure that a token&#8217;s value will rise. Argentina defeated Australia 2–1 on December 3, 2022. The price of the ARG token was trading at $3.57 at the time, failing to surpass the highs of the previous week.<br /><br />Team tokens are used for more than just the World Cup. In April, digital asset platform Socio announced a partnership with thirteen NFL teams, including the Atlanta Falcons, Baltimore Ravens, Chicago Bears, Cleveland Browns, Los Angeles Rams, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, to create fan tokens.<br /><br />The following month, Socio announced a partnership with Major League Soccer to produce fan tokens for all 26 teams.<br /><br />Image Credit: Shutterstock</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftm-price-analysis-fantom-spikes-on-speculation-of-andre-conjes-comeback-here-are-levels-to-watch/">Fantom (FTM)</a> is posting gains compared to the backdrop of most crypto assets which were recording losses. At the time of publication, FTM was up 4% in the last 24 hours at $0.2528 and 23% in the past week. WigoSwap, an integrated DeFi platform on the Fantom network, has integrated multiple Chainlink services to support the on-chain prediction mini-game. Fantom has announced its new governance proposal As part of its continued push toward implementing sustainable monetization incentives for builders. The proposal seeks to reduce Fantom’s current burn rate to redirect more network fees directly to dApps building on Fantom. If passed, this implementation will reduce Fantom’s burn rate from 20% to 5% and redirect this 15% reduction toward gas monetization. This gas monetization will reward high-quality dApps, retain talented creators, and support Fantom’s network infrastructure.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $0.5500, $0.4300, $0.2900<br />Support Levels: $0.2155, $0.1868, $0.1517</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftm-token-price-climbs-30-in-24-hours/">FTM</a> is trading sideways above the near-term bottom at $0.2155 of the daily moving average (MA 50), defending the $0.200 level. Given that it is just above key structural support, the consolidation could last a while before the bulls resume. <br /><br />On the upside, a strong break above the daily MA 200 at $0.2775 could result in a stronger rebound to $0.4300. Above this point, the next resistance level could be $0.5500. If the price falls below $0.2300, negative forces may resurface, sending the FTM price to test the $0.2000 bottom and below.</p>

<p>After reaching the level of $0.2615 on December 1, the FTM/USD pair is currently consolidating above the 4-hour MA 50. Key supports in the $0.2155 &#8211; $0.2500 range are expected to hold and keep larger bulls intact for a new push higher and renewed probe through key resistance at $0.2900<br /><br />A break below the $0.2500 pivot may result in a deeper pullback toward the next key support at the $0.2155 level. In summary, while the overall picture remains slightly bearish due to the downtrend drawn from the $3.379 January 2022 high, the current consolidation around the $0.2500 support level increases the likelihood of an upturn.</p>

<p>On December 1, nearly 227.2 million 1-inch tokens were unlocked, accounting for nearly 15% of the total supply of 1.5 billion tokens. This figure represents one-quarter of the over 800 million 1-inch tokens that were locked before the most recent unlock event. <br /><br />In December 2020, the DEX aggregator will launch its native token. Only 6% of the total supply was released at the time, with the remaining tokens subject to a four-year vesting schedule that ends in December 2024. As with other <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/what-is-decentralised-finance-defi-and-how-does-it-work/">DeFi projects</a>, tokens were initially distributed among entities such as the core team, investors, advisors, and the community.<br /><br />The most recent 1-inch token unlock occurred in June. At the time, the coin&#8217;s spot price had dropped by 25%, from $0.81 to $0.60. As crypto prices have fallen, the token price has fallen by more than 80% this year.<br /><br />Following the June unlock, a whale wallet deposited 15 million tokens on Binance. According to Etherscan data, this wallet deposited another batch of 15 million 1-inch tokens to Binance on December 2.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/circle-to-go-public-with-a-4-5-billion-valuation/">Circle</a> Internet Financial has decided not to go public. Through the announcement, they have mutually agreed to terminate their agreement with Concord Acquisition Corp.<br /><br />The decision was announced today in a press release, which detailed the mutually agreed-upon termination. Furthermore, the agreement reached by Circle and Concord changes the outlook for the former&#8217;s initial public plans.<br /><br />It was a massive agreement that would have allowed Circle Internet Financial to go public. As a result, the press release confirmed that this will no longer be the case. It cites a mutually agreed-upon termination of the agreement with Concord to go public at a valuation of $4.5 billion.<br /><br />Concord is a &#8220;publicly traded special purpose acquisition company,&#8221; and the agreement with Circle <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/usdc-stablecoin-provider-in-its-strongest-financial-position-ever-says-circle-ceo/">(USDC)</a> was announced in July 2021. Nonetheless, the agreement was amended in February of this year, according to the announcement.<br /><br />The release states that the amendment issued Concord a deadline of December 10, 2022, to <em>“consummate a business combination.”</em> Thereafter, the release notes that <em>“termination of the proposed business combination has been approved,”</em> as of today.<br /><br />Bob Diamond, the chairman of Concord Acquisition Corps, still maintained high praise for Circle. <em>“I remain confident in Circle’s regulatory-first approach to building trust,”</em> Diamond noted. Additionally, stating, <em>“I will continue being an advocate for the company as it continues to grow.”</em><br /><br />In the statement, Circle CEO and co-founder Jeremy Allaire stated that Concord has <em>&#8220;added value throughout the process.&#8221;</em> Finally, he expresses his disappointment that <em>&#8220;the proposed transaction timed out,&#8221;</em> emphasizing the importance of client transparency.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout Q3 2022, Gate.io Group, the parent company of crypto exchange Gate.io, revealed its global expansion progress in several key crypto regions such as Dubai, Lithuania, and Turkey. Now, a new milestone has been achieved. Recently announced in a keynote at Istanbul <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/algorand-now-blockchain-partner-for-2022-qatar-fifa-world-cup/">Blockchain</a> Week 2022, Gate.io and its Turkey-based counterpart Gate Turkey unveiled GateTR, a new crypto exchange tailored to serve Turkey’s growing crypto market.</p>
<h2>Reveal and launch of GateTR at IBW 2022</h2>
<p>During the keynote, the Head of Gate Turkey, Kafkas Sonmez, presented several key features of the new GateTR exchange, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>User-friendly and ultra-fast trading experience tailored to Turkey’s crypto market.</li>
<li>Trade cryptocurrency, buy or sell with Turkish Lira (TRY) and withdraw to local bank accounts.</li>
<li>GateTR will share Gate.io’s listing policy to the fullest extent available in Turkey.</li>
<li>Later expansion of trading products and services beyond spot trading.</li>
<li>Q1 2022 to see announcements of collaborations to merge crypto trading with areas such as transportation, travel, and shopping.</li>
<li>Dedicated 24/7 customer support</li>
</ul>
<p>Also discussed was the strict adherence to regulatory compliance and AML/CTF controls employed by Gate.io Group and that compliant operations are central to the exchange’s commitment to regulators and users in Turkey. Additionally, Gate.io Founder and CEO Dr. Lin Han further reinforced Gate.io’s adhesion to Proof of Reserves audits following the release of Gate.io’s open-source Merkle Tree method, welcoming other exchanges to follow suit.</p>
<p>Lastly, Gate.io invited visitors to attend a special afterparty co-sponsored by Gate.io to facilitate meaningful discussions around blockchain and Web3 and to participate in exclusive online and onsite activities to win NFTs. Investors can <a href="https://www.gate.io/price">check the latest price of crypto</a> on www.gate.io.</p>
<h2>Expanding globally, in Turkey, and beyond</h2>
<p>After establishing offices in one of Istanbul’s business districts in May, Gate.io began expanding its operations in Turkey in preparation for GateTR’s development and launch and formed strategic partnerships with other industry companies and local banks.</p>
<p>The launch of the GateTR crypto exchange is a significant step forward in Gate.io Group expanding its products and services to more users globally. Gate.io Group has put regulatory compliance at the center of its globalization strategy, dedicating resources to ensuring it meets or exceeds the expectations of regulators and legislation.</p>
<p>Aside from establishing offices in Turkey this year, Gate.io Group groups’ various regional entities acquired licenses and registrations respective to their regions, including a VASP registration in Lithuania, VFA Class 4 license in Malta, a TCSP license in Hong Kong, and a DMCC license in Dubai.</p>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ethereum-eth-rise-and-fall-at-415-this-is-the-picture-of-what-transpired/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> currently trades at $1,274, up 3% in the last 24 hours. Casa, a popular Bitcoin self-custody firm, is adding Ethereum support to its platform, which some may find surprising because it is perceived as a purely Bitcoin-inclined firm. According to the company, a revamped version of the Casa app will debut in January. In other news, Phantom, a noncustodial wallet and originally a Solana-native product, is now launching on Ethereum to allow a large user base across Web3 to interact with NFTs and decentralized applications. Ethereum Core developer Tim Beiko has reiterated that the Ethereum testnet Ropsten is shutting down. According to an announcement published on the official Ethereum website, the Ropsten network will be shut down in the coming weeks. The great bulk of the remaining validator nodes will be shut down between December 15 and December 31, 2022. After that, Ropsten will no longer be supported by the client team, the testing team, or the infrastructure team.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $1,700, $1,500, $1,300<br />Support Levels: $1,200, $1,000, $800</p>
<h4>ETH/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/eth-price-analysis-ethereum-briefly-loses-1200-whales-quietly-add-to-holdings-amid-price-drop/">ETH/USD</a> pair fluctuates near recent-monthly lows, trading below the two primary daily moving averages of 50 and 200. In the long-term trend, the ETH/USD pair is still in a consolidation phase after its descent from its November high of $1,677. This is part of a rebound trend that began in 2022 at $879 (a relatively low level).<br /><br />Bearish sentiment is confirmed by the rejection of the upper horizontal resistance line at the level of $1,700 and the daily MA 200. The next goal for ETH is the $1,350 level. Even in the event of a strong reversal, the tendency may continue for ETH to continue in a range, and the support level of $1,200 will remain unchanged.</p>
<h4>ETH/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63381 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-4-hour-Dec-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-4-hour-Dec-4.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-4-hour-Dec-4-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-4-hour-Dec-4-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-4-hour-Dec-4-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-4-hour-Dec-4-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ETHUSD-4-hour-Dec-4-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><span style="color: #999999">ETH/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></h6>
<p>ETH/USD&#8217;s rebound from $1,073 has so far quickened and reached a value of $1,308. The $1,200 level of the medium-term projection may provide some support. However, breaking through the $1,300 minor resistance level is necessary to confirm the short-term bottoming. <br /><br />The intraday bias on the ETH/USD pair remains neutral at the moment. The following levels of $1,500 may be the next level to complete the current rebound from $1,073 to $1,300. On the other hand, a breach of the near-term support at $1,200 may alter the neutrality of the intraday bias and lead to another consolidation before a new decline begins.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Prosecutors&#8217; plea for an arrest warrant against Daniel Shin, co-founder of Terraform Labs, was denied by a South Korean court.</p>
<p>The Seoul Southern District Court ruled on Saturday local time, stating via text message that it is difficult to assume Shin poses a flight risk or would obliterate evidence due to his actions during the inquiry.</p>
<p>The court added that it has similarly dismissed the arrest warrants for seven additional parties to the case. According to a Yonhap article, they include three early investors and four Terra developers.</p>
<p>According to Yonhap, who also cited the court, the suspect&#8217;s right to present a defense against his main charge of breaking capital market laws must be guaranteed. Following the verdict, the prosecution&#8217;s office texted, &#8220;It is difficult to understand the court&#8217;s decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>The court opted to reject the arrest warrants of people who allegedly generated unauthorized profits while purporting to be defending their rights to self-defense while acknowledging the gravity of the accusations, they claimed.</p>
<p>To determine whether to issue yet another arrest warrant, prosecutors will examine the dismissal.<br />In May, the sister token Luna and the TerraUSD stablecoin, which had been designed to preserve a 1:1 relationship with the dollar, both failed.</p>
<h2>Do Kwon’s Whereabouts Unknown</h2>
<p>The other founder of the Terra ecosystem is the cryptocurrency entrepreneur Do Kwon. His whereabouts are unknown since Seoul prosecutors have called for his arrest. He has asserted his innocence.</p>
<p>Should Do Kwon be charged with violating the country&#8217;s capital markets law, Kwon Ohoon of Cha &amp; Kwon Law Offices in Seoul said on Saturday that it&#8217;s &#8220;questionable&#8221; if the court will find him guilty. He noted that the court appeared to have ruled that the prosecution&#8217;s claims that the Terra/Luna was a result of capital markets law crimes were unfounded.</p>
<p>According to a Terraform Labs spokesperson, the court decision &#8220;illustrates the baseless character of the prosecutors&#8217; charges.&#8221; &#8220;With these claims behind us, our emphasis is on providing the greatest web3 ecosystem to start and scale a blockchain and shaping the future of Terra.&#8221; In a text message, Shin&#8217;s attorneys described the court&#8217;s ruling as a &#8220;sound judgment.&#8221;</p>

The majority of crypto investors felt particularly vulnerable after the panic reaction. BTC/USD challenged the $18,000 ceiling and caused a sharp selloff of the risk-sensitive asset. Bitcoin reclaimed the $17,000 level on Wednesday; however, bulls have been unable to maintain their bullish momentum. BTC has remained below $20,000 since Nov. 8 and is still fully in its bearish price channel. Meanwhile, at the time of writing, BTC/USD is trading in the $16,942 range, well below the psychological $20,000 mark. Bitcoin&#8217;s correlation with stock market indices (the S&amp;P 500, the Dow Jones, and the Nasdaq) has increased. The total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market has also increased slightly, standing at $0.859 trillion ($0.833 trillion a week ago).<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $22,000, $20,000, $17,500<br />Support Levels: $15,000, $12,000, $10,000</p>

<p>Since the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/btc-price-analysis-btc-usd-stays-under-bearish-pressure-after-decline/">BTC/USD</a> market exhibits a downward trend, it was thought to be in a bearish range. As it rallies downward, the price appears to be trending lower. Before finally forming a new zone at the $15,512 level of significance, the market seems to have broken through several price levels. <br /><br />The sellers were successful in making a strong low, and the price has since settled at this level. The buyers&#8217; journey through the market to increase their wealth is one of the other market prospects. However, the bullish movement was unsuccessful, and the bears might eventually overtake them by driving the price below the important $15,000 level.</p>

<p>The market is currently exhibiting indications of a change in a trend toward the downside on the four-hour chart. The BTC/USD is anticipated to fall just below the $15,000 support if the immediate bullish move is invalidated. The intraday bias in BTC/USD remains slightly down at this time. The fall from $17,317 to $16,792 could be restarted by the $17,500 level break.<br /><br />Positively, a lower resistance level above $17,500 may instead change the intraday bias back to the upside for the resistance level at $20,000. After all, trading in the short to medium term will likely continue between the levels of $15,000/$20,000.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has topped the $17,000 mark once again. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap fell below that level for much of the day Friday amid higher-than-expected job reports but recovered later on. <br /><br />The Labor Department said on Friday that nonfarm payrolls grew 263,000 for the month, while the unemployment rate was 3.7%. The payroll total was far higher than the 200,000 predictions, while the unemployment rate was as expected.<br /><br />According to market observers, the numbers will probably support the Federal Reserve&#8217;s push to raise interest rates, even as it prepares to slow the pace of those hikes at its meeting in December.<br /><br />Bitcoin rose as high as $17,108 on December 2 after dropping from highs of $17, 317 the previous day.<br /><br />Investor confidence in cryptocurrencies has been hammered after Sam Bankman-Fried’s exchange FTX collapsed and filed for bankruptcy in November, sending shockwaves through the entire crypto industry. <br /><br />The fact that the market remains stagnant and probably needed time to heal up is prompting analysts to warn that the bounce might be a bear market rally and would not be sustained.<br /><br />Based on historical data, Bitcoin always had a dismal December after decreases in the previous month. The trend was clear in 2018, 2019, and 2021, leaving a December decline that was on average close to 11%.<br /><br />Other digital coins also rose, including ether, which was the last higher by about 2% at $1,293. The market somewhat reversed the impact brought on by the higher-than-expected data release.<br /><br />At the time of publication cryptocurrencies such as WEMIX were up 30.25%, Fruits (FRTS) was up 77.68%, Veritaseum (VERI) was up 15%, MAGIC was up 21%, Moonbeam (GLMR) was up 11%, Braintrust (BTRST) up 18%, Acala token was also up 32% while Revain was up as much as 61%.</p>
<h2>Ankr’s aBNBC Token Is Down 99%</h2>
<p>Ankr’s aBNBC token is down by 99.5% since the exploit which drained BNB out of Ankr’s liquidity pool. The quantity of tokens produced is unknown, but some sources assert that they may have created up to 60 trillion aBNBc tokens. They began the process of moving these tokens from the Binance Smart Chain to Ethereum after many of them were traded for the stablecoin USDC.<br /><br />The Ankr team earlier on Friday acknowledged that it had been the target of a crypto attack that cost it about $5 million in BNB.<br /><br />In an update, it proposes steps to address the current situation: first, taking a snapshot and reissuing ankrBNB to all valid aBNBc holders before the exploit. The ankrBNB token will continue to be redeemable, while aBNBc and aBNBb will no longer be redeemable. <br /><br />Additionally, Ankr says it will buy $5 million worth of BNB and use this to compensate in totality the liquidity providers that have been affected by the exploit due to the drainage of the liquidity pool.</p>
