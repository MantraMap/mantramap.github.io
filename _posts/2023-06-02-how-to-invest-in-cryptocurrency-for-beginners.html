What is cryptocurrency investment? Cryptocurrency investment in its most basic form is the process of buying digital currencies and holding them in the hope that the market falls in your favour while your portfolio increases in value. The value of a cryptocurrency is determined by the principle of supply and demand. As demand for a cryptocurrency, coin or token rises, there becomes fewer of them in circulation — resulting in a boom in price action. If the supply of coins outpaces demand for them, their value typically falls. There are several indicators that might draw an investor towards a particular cryptocurrency. Some investors and traders choose which cryptocurrencies to invest in by conducting a technical analysis of a range of coins. An investor might have certain criteria that need to be met to invest. For example, cryptocurrencies that are in an overall uptrend, are showing positive signs of adoption and have a durable, scalable blockchain interface are more desirable than those that don’t. Common types of crypto investing There are many ways to invest in cryptocurrency, besides directly purchasing coins or tokens through an exchange. Some of the common types of crypto investing include: Investing in crypto-oriented or pro-crypto companies ­— As the prices of cryptocurrencies soar, so does the stock price in companies that form their business around them. Companies that are able to integrate cryptocurrency blockchain networks into their service offering can prove profitable as cryptocurrency use becomes more widespread. Investing in crypto-heavy funds — Crypto funds typically carry less risks than committing capital to one specific cryptocurrency.

For example, Fidelity is unveiling plans to allow users to dedicate 20% of their 401k holding to cryptocurrencies — allowing investors to diversify their 401k.
