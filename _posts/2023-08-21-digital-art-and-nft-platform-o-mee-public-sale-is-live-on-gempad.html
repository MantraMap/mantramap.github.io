<p dir="ltr">The o-mee token fuels the entire platform and its ecosystem, with utilities ranging from buying and selling, advertising, staking, gifting, lottery tickets, NFT booster packs, and future developments such as direct staking to creators&rsquo; profiles. o-mee empowers users and enhances their experiences within the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">After a successful private sale, the announcement on GemPad seemed to excite a lot of investors as it being one of the premier launchpads and incubators within the Web3 and blockchain ecosystem.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;We firmly believe in giving creators the control over their own creations. This is an exciting step in our journey, the token launch. It will open a network of possibilities for our community, ones that we have been working so much for,&rdquo; said Jared Walker, CEO and Co-founder of o-eee in a statement. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re thrilled to continue offering artists and communities with opportunities that bridge the gaps between Web2 and Web3 ecosystems&rdquo; continued Jared.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company aims to establish a space that not only democratises access to the Web3 landscape but also enhances the intrinsic social and economic value that creators bring to the table. In the spirit of innovation and exclusivity, o-mee is challenging conventional norms in the secondary market by redefining the archaic percentage-based commission structure. Jared and the o-mee team commented on the company&rsquo;s future launch with progressive development such as the o-mee blockchain network, NFT trading views, gamifications and more!</p>
