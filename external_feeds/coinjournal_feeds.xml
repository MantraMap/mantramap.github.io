<li dir="ltr">Bitcoin price rose to $27,500 on Coinbase early Tuesday, with the upside coinciding with positive crypto news from Hong Kong.</li>
<li dir="ltr">This is after the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced that registered exchanges will begin allowing retail investors to trade BTC and ETH from 1 June.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Analysts say Bitcoin&rsquo;s immediate price outlook needs a break above $27,600 for bullish continuation.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> traded to highs of $27,500 on Coinbase as crypto prices bounced earlier on Tuesday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The upside for the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency by market cap came amid an extended struggle around the 27k area, and happened as bulls capitalised on positive market reaction to news out of fast-growing crypto hub Hong Kong.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, as of writing, the price of Bitcoin was hovering near $27,200 as bulls retreated from the resistance level marked by the 20-day moving average on the daily chart.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">BTC price rose amid positive news from Hong Kong</h2>
<p dir="ltr">On Tuesday, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/">crypto news</a> out of Hong Kong was that retail investors will as from 1 June be able to buy and trade digital assets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The announcement was made by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which noted that <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/">crypto exchanges</a> will soon be allowed to extend crypto trading services to retail investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the SFC, this will be effective 1 June, 2023, and tokens that receive the nod would require a 12-month track record. The tokens will also need to have a substantial market capitalization, a category that Bitcoin dominates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>The news of Hong Kong allowing retail investors to trade in BTC and ETH on registered digital asset platforms delivered a notable BTC price bump in a bleak market &ndash; gives you an idea of how significant this news is</em>,&rdquo; Noelle Acheson, the author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, said in a<a href="https://twitter.com/NoelleInMadrid/status/1660932932167512065">&nbsp;<u>tweet</u></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Acheson believes the next key step of this announcement is that indeed retail investors can trade Bitcoin and Ethereum on registered exchanges.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">FINALLY the crypto market gets some good news, in the form of Hong Kong&rsquo;s regulatory crypto framework which enters into force on June 1. The big deal is confirmation that retail investors will be able to trade BTC and ETH on licensed platforms.&#129377;<a href="https://t.co/NQboEsx5b5">https://t.co/NQboEsx5b5</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Noelle Acheson (@NoelleInMadrid) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoelleInMadrid/status/1660987660771442689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">$27,600 is a key level for BTC &ndash; analyst</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the positive news, Bitcoin&rsquo;s latest attempt to break to key levels above $28k look to hinge on overall market outlook. In particular, the headwinds currently in place regarding the US debt limit situation is one investors are likely to watch keenly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On what could be next for Bitcoin price, crypto analyst Rekt Capital says the critical resistance area that bulls must conquer for upside continuation is $27,600.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>BTC may be forming an &ldquo;exaggerated&rdquo; Bullish Divergence on the Daily RSI. A potentially positive sign for some upside movement. However, [it is] important to realise that the key resistance to beat is ~$27600</em>,&rdquo; he noted.</p>

<li>Bitget has registered as a virtual asset service provider in Poland.</li>
<li>The crypto exchange had registered in Lithuania as well in April.</li>
<li>Bitget ended the first quarter with a 146% increase in BGB holders.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.bitget.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitget</a> has successfully registered as a VASP &ndash; Virtual Asset Service Provider in Poland, the crypto exchange confirmed in a press release on Tuesday.</p>
<h2>Bitget continues to expand in the EU region</h2>
<p>The crypto market news reiterates that Bitget remains committed to expanding globally despite the ongoing market volatility.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s development enables the crypto derivates platform to legally offer its services in/from Poland in compliance with the country&rsquo;s regulations. According to its Managing Director Gracy Chen:</p>

<li dir="ltr">The FTX Token price rose more tha 12% on Tuesday to trade at highs of $1.16.</li>
<li dir="ltr">FTT&rsquo;s upside bounce came as latest court filings showed there are efforts to reopen the collapsed crypto exchange FTX.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, but the team led by new CEO John J. Ray III has hinred at plans to restart operations.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ftx-token/">FTX Token</a> saw fresh upside action on Tuesday, rising double digits to hit intraday highs of $1.16 across major trading platforms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to data from Coingecko, the price of the FTX Token was up 12% in the early afternoon during the US trading session. The intraday trading volume for the FTT/USD pair was $28,322,396 over the past 24 hours as of writing, signaling a surge in trading activity of about 395%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">FTT, which traded to highs of $84.18 during the last bull market, was priced around $1.12 to currently change hands at a 98.67% discount from that peak.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Why is FTX Token price surging?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The top 10 cryptocurrencies were all trading green on Tuesday afternoon as the crypto market looked to bounce from recent losses catalysed by the overall uncertainty across risk asset markets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As stocks struggled with indecisiveness following an impasse on US debt ceiling talks, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> was attempting to solidify gains above $27k. Ethereum price, which like Bitcoin has suffered from drying volume, was up to $1,860.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But gains for the top digital assets paled in comparison to those of FTT. The token&rsquo;s price, which fell to practically zero in late 2022, was soaring on positive sentiment around the potential reopening of the collapsed crypto exchange <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/ftx/">FTX</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reports about an imminent move in this direction has translated into more demand for the platform&rsquo;s native token.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">When will FTX 2.0 land?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">While no definite timeline is in place, FTX&rsquo;s likely revival has looked more and more concrete since the FTX 2.0 talk surfaced a while ago. Now the latest <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-DocketInfo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">court filings</a> show new CEO John J. Ray III has recently worked on the reboot proposal.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ray has previously hinted at the reentry of FTX into the cryptocurrency exchange market, with his remarks gaining footing as the team was revealed to have recovered more than $7 billion worth of bankrupt platform&rsquo;s assets.</p>

<li>Ledger has decided to delay its recovery feature as it open-sources the code, CEO Pascal Gauthier said in a letter.</li>
<li>The Ledger Recover feature won&rsquo;t be rolled out until the open sourcing is complete, he noted.</li>
<li>Gauthier also apologised for the way the company handled the communication around the feature&rsquo;s release.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/ledger/">Ledger</a> is delaying the rollout of its recovery feature, CEO Pascal Gauthier has announced.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to details in a <a href="https://www.ledger.com/blog/ledger-recover-a-message-from-pascal-gauthier-chairman-ceo-at-ledger" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">letter</a> the CEO of the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrency-guides/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-hardware-wallet/">hardware wallet</a> provider addressed to customers and the broader cryptocurrency community, the planned implementation of Ledger Recover will remain on hold until the company releases its code.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>We have made the decision to accelerate the open sourcing roadmap! We will include as much of the Ledger operating system as possible, starting with core components of the OS, and Ledger Recover, which won&rsquo;t be released until this work is complete</em>,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other than that, Ledger plans to open source the recovery protocol, a move the company believes will enable the crypto community to benefit from increased room for making choices regarding the self-custody of their assets. The service will also remain fully optional.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve listened to our customers; we are accelerating a roadmap that&rsquo;s been in progress, and regardless, the security of your Ledger remains unchanged</em>,&rdquo; the Ledger exec added.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Ledger CEO apologises to crypto community</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Ledger announced the recovery service last week, revealing that users would be able to secure the encrypted backups of seed phrases via custodians.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The feature was to allow crypto holders access and restore private keys after they lose or forget seed phrases. The Ledger Recover is an opt-in feature that will require customers to complete a Know-Your-Customer (KYC) check.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Criticism of Ledger&rsquo;s move was massive, with the industry shocked by how the company proceeded to handle the uproar.</p>
<p>In his letter, Gauthier apologised &ldquo;for the way this was communicated.&rdquo; The wallet provider&rsquo;s leadership is also set to <a href="https://twitter.com/_pgauthier/status/1661012646685196295" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hold</a> an AMA on Tuesday, 23 May 2023 at 12:30 pm ET where the Ledger Recover service will be expounded on.</p>

<li>The price of RNDR has increased by 42.49% over the last seven days.</li>
<li>Render recently released a new Render Network Foundation website.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/render-token/">Render Token</a> has been in the limelight in the past month and mainly in the last two weeks because of the rising RNDR price.</p>
<p>There has been a lot going on around the distributed GPU rendering network built on top of the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/what-is-ethereum/">Ethereum </a>blockchain as it aims to connect more artists and studios in need of GPU computing power with mining partners willing to rent their GPU capabilities out.</p>
<h2>Why is the Render Token price surging?</h2>
<p>There are several Render Token news responsible for the current RNDR bullish trend.</p>
<p>The most recent <a href="https://twitter.com/RenderToken/status/1660735844242563072?s=20">announcement was made on May 22</a>&nbsp; and it was announcing revisions to the C4D plugin for Octane that includes a brand new feature, an ORBX export command tailored exclusively for RNDR Jobs, available through the live viewer. The announcement resulted in a 6% RNDR price surge.</p>
<p>The other crypto news about Render Network was on May 19, when Render launched its new Render Network Foundation website featuring an all-new community hub for The Render Network, including art showcases from some of the amazing creators in the Render Network community.</p>
<p>The new website provides a simple, easy way to find information about the Render Network. Users can access the Artist portal, Knowledge Base, information about participating in Render Network Governance, and links to Render Network&rsquo;s social sub-communities.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">BRC-20 tokens were launched on Bitcoin in March 2023</li>
<li dir="ltr">Transaction fees spiked to all-time highs in May 2023 as network activity spiked</li>
<li dir="ltr">Bringing memes and NFTs to Bitcoin has caused controversy</li>
<li dir="ltr">Some argue the rising fees are vital to the security of the network, while others scoff at the activity for getting away from Bitcoin&rsquo;s &ldquo;vision&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">We live in an inflationary world. Food prices, rent, energy &ndash; everything feels more expensive. That is not limited to the fiat world, however. Bitcoin users have noticed a hike in fees recently. So why is this happening, and what does it mean for Bitcoin? And what does this weird concept of NFTs on Bitcoin have to do with anything?</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin fees rocket upwards in May</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Firstly, let us look at a chart presenting Bitcoin fees over the last three years to show the spike in fees. Clearly, the vertical jump in the first week of May is glaring.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/13860731">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">While Bitcoin fees may rise in future regardless (and we will get to that in a moment), the outlier that is this wild spike in May 2023 is down to something I never thought I would say with regards to Bitcoin: <em>memes.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Specifically, the BRC-20 protocol, which is a token standard inspired by ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum. To explain this, we first need to look at Bitcoin Ordinals, because that is what has made this all possible. And yes, it is all on the Bitcoin blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What are Bitcoin Ordinals?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin was always viewed as the &ldquo;pure&rdquo; blockchain. There was no room for non-fungibility, meaning each Bitcoin is the same as another Bitcoin. No NFT nonsense here, thank you very much.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This changed in January 2023 when the Ordinal protocol was invented. In simple terms, the Ordinals protocol is a system for marking each satoshi, the smallest denomination of a Bitcoin (every Bitcoin is divided into 10 million satoshis). These marked satoshis can then be tracked and differentiated from other satoshis, meaning they are technically &ldquo;non-fungible&rdquo;. And so, against all odds, we (sort of) have Bitcoin NFTs.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The marks on satoshis have become known as &ldquo;inscriptions&rdquo;. These inscriptions were made possible by the Taproot upgrade to the Bitcoin network in November 2021. The protocol is known as Ordinals, named due to the fact the transfer scheme for satoshis relies on the order of transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">While this all sounds a little complex, in comparison to NFTs on other blockchains, it is very primitive and basic. There are no smart contracts here. Sidechains are not necessary. Everything is inscribed directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What are BRC-20 tokens?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Two months after Ordinals arrived in the world, an experimental token standard, named BRC-20 in a nod to ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum, were launched in March 2023. This token standard creates <em>fungible tokens within the Ordinal protocol.&nbsp;</em>You may suspect where this is going. The ability to trade fungible tokens within this protocol of Bitcoin? Yes, memes.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the below chart, I have presented the top 10 BRC-20 tokens by market cap. As one will be able to deduce pretty swiftly when looking at the names, a lot of these are memes.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/13861126">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr"><em>(sidenote &ndash; eagle-eyed readers may also be able to deduce from the supply of some of these tokens that they are memes. Personally, I enjoy the nod to Satoshi Nakamoto with the 21 million supply of so many on the board).&nbsp;</em></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What has all this got to do with fees?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">So, back to fees. The rise of Bitcoin Ordinals has thrown up an interesting dilemma. These inscribed satoshis are now competing for block space with conventional Bitcoin transactions. On the Bitcoin network, more activity leads to more fees, and this is why we have been seeing a spike in fees. As the BRC-20 tokens have taken off, we have seen Bitcoin&rsquo;s network clog up and fees jump.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This has caused a debate. Some argue against these higher fees, lamenting the waste of time that NFTs and memes are, getting in the way of what Bitcoin is &ldquo;meant&rdquo; to be. On the other side, fees are vital for the security of the Bitcoin network. Additionally, once the final supply of 21 million Bitcoins is hit in 2140, miners will need to survive solely on fees. Indeed, as block rewards step down with each halving, mining fees become an ever larger portion of miners&rsquo; income, and hence these fees are a crucial incentive for miners and a driver of the hash power for Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/13861352">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">Personally, my take on this is somewhat between the two extremes. I have every confidence that these memes and NFTs and whatever else trading on the Bitcoin network are inherently valueless. Then again, I don&rsquo;t care much for NFTs in general. However, I don&rsquo;t see the rising fees as an issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The key here is that the hash rate is still rising. This contrasts to April 2021, which was another time period when Bitcoin fees spiked violently, the average transaction on the network costing a staggering $70. This was due to a crash in the hash rate, which is very much a concern for Bitcoin&rsquo;s security and stability as a network.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is different. Rising fees due to increased activity is fine. That is true regardless of the transaction: regular, meme, NFT or other. It really doesn&rsquo;t matter. Besides, the scalability issue with Bitcoin is well known, and fee spikes encourage people to look at solutions such as sidechains, like the popular Lightning network which bundles transactions together off-chain. But there are other Layer-2s besides Lightning, such as Liquid and Rootstock, to name a couple.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The prediction that the Bitcoin blockchain will become a base settlement layer has been around for some time. The existence of what is likely a fad, i.e. these tokens and Ordinals, is relatively harmless and shouldn&rsquo;t change much in the overall scheme of things. The fee and scalability issue will always be here, regardless of what is driving it. And this is exactly why we have the Lightning network, and why people are continuing to innovate to come up with Layer-2 or other solutions.&nbsp;</p>

<li dir="ltr">KAVA price jumped more than 40% despite the overall market lull, reaching highs of $1.56 on Binance.</li>
<li dir="ltr">While there was no clear trigger for the surge, Kava has had a few major developments in recent weeks.</li>
<li dir="ltr">KAVA currently trades around $1.17 and is in danger of giving up all the gains if profit taking deals intensify.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://coinjournal.net/kava/">price of KAVA</a> is up about 9% in the past 24 hours as at 9:30 am ET on Tuesday, 23 May. The KAVA/USD pair is trading around $1.16 amid increasing pressure from profit takers.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">But before the current sell-off pressure, the price of the Cosmos zone token had rallied more than 40% to hit its highest level since November 2022.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Kava price sliding after rally to multi-month high</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The price of KAVA rose to $1.56 on leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance, with the token spiking 44% from lows of $1.08. &nbsp;The token&rsquo;s value was up nearly 63% in the past 30 days.</p>

<p></p></span></span>
<p class="fr-img-space-wrap2">Kava is a highly scalable Layer-1 blockchain that combines the speed and interoperability of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/cosmos/">Cosmos</a> and the developer power of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). There was no apparent trigger for the huge move today. However, here&rsquo;s why the token&rsquo;s value might have rallied so hard for a brief moment before investors likely started taking profits.</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">Although likely a normal pump episode, the price gains follow the recent launch of the KAVA 13 mainnet and the announcement of a new integration with a leading data indexing platform SubQuery. SubQuery&rsquo;s indexer tool is available across Osmosis, Cronos and Fetch.ai in the Cosmos ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The blockchain developer toolkit is also available for Web3 developers across Ethereum, Polygon, BNB, Flare, NEAR, Polkadot, Avalanche, and Algorand. It is offered as a data-as-a-service solution that allows users to focus on core project use cases and the front-end, all without having to first build a custom backend for data processing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kava also announced a $5000 giveaway as it celebrated the launch of NFTs and GameFi on its chain.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What next for the KAVA price?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Today&rsquo;s price surge for KAVA appears to have been an outlier of sorts given the overall outlook of the crypto market. It&rsquo;s possible such gains will not hold and any correction that follows could wipe all the upside movement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">KAVA/USD might thus retreat to support at $1.10 or lower if current levels near $1.20 fail to hold. On the flipside, an uptick across the market or fresh pump based on new KAVA news could see buyers target a retest of today&rsquo;s highs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Ether has been trading around the $1,800 region over the past few weeks.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The crypto market is slowly recovering from its recent slump and ETH could target the $2k psychological level soon.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Ether is yet to test the 11-month high of $2,141 since it reached that level after the Shanghai update.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">Ether could test the $2k level soon</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has been underperforming in recent weeks. The cryptocurrency has been trading between the $1,750 and $1,850 level over the past few weeks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The performance coincides with a stagnant performance from the broader cryptocurrency market. The total cryptocurrency market cap has stood around the $1.1 trillion region during that period.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At press time, the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/"><u>price of Ethereum</u></a> stands at $1,852, up by more than 2% over the last 24 hours. The positive performance comes as the sentiment in the broader crypto market improves.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Investors continue to observe the ongoing debt ceiling talks in the United States, with some of them leaning towards cryptocurrencies as hedge against a possible US debt default.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ether, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, could be one of the biggest winners if the market attracts more investors.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Key levels to watch</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The ETH/USD 4-hour chart is looking bullish as Ethereum has been performing well over the past 24 hours. The technical indicators show that ETH could rally higher in the near term.</p>
<div class="fr-img-space-wrap"><span class="fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib fr-draggable fr-fil" style="width: 600px"><span class="fr-img-wrap">
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/04/23/1684848813278-b8d3ca44-503f-4327-bf9d-5dbd4c9b5639.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil" width="600" height="285"><span class="fr-inner"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/?exchange=COINBASE"><u>ETH/USD Chart By TradingView</u></a></span></p>
<p></p></span></span>
<p class="fr-img-space-wrap2">&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">The MACD line is now within the positive zone, indicating that the bulls are currently in charge of the Ether market. The 14-day RSI of 64 also shows that Ether could soon enter the overbought region if the rally continues.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the current market conditions persist, ETH could test the first major resistance level at $1,921 before the end of the day. However, ETH could need the support of the broader crypto market to reach the second major resistance level at $2,008 in the near term.&nbsp;</p>
