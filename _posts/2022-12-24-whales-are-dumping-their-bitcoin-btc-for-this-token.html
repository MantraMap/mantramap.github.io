<p>Whales dump some of their Bitcoin (BTC) as fear dominates the market. Since the crypto major started trading in the market, big holders have dumped the most BTC in the 30-day timeline.</p>
<p>Due to the recent update, Bitcoin (BTC)&rsquo;s price continues to show weakness. Investors are switching over to The Hideaways (HDWY) to recover their losses.</p>
<p class="s7">Bitcoin (BTC) Whales are Migrating Elsewhere</p>
<p>It is another migration season for Bitcoin (BTC) whales. Just before the end of the year, big rollers dumped 280,000 BTC in just 30 days. This is the highest number ever recorded since the crypto major started in 2009.</p>
<p>The recent move has an estimated value of $4.7 billion, immediately affecting BTC&rsquo;s price negatively. Bitcoin (BTC) declined 5.28% to $16,782.49 in the 7-day charts - another setback for crypto gold. </p>
<p>Analysts were expecting a better performance and continued strong buying momentum after bulls pushed the price to $18,000.00 on December 13. </p>
<p>But buyers stopped approaching $18,400.00, outnumbered by sellers wanting to take profit at the $18,390.60 zone.</p>
<p>After their small games on BTC, investors switched over to The Hideaways (HDWY) to get more value for their money.</p>
<p class="s7">Dormant Bitcoin (BTC) Wallets Suddenly Moves Out Funds</p>
<p>While Bitcoin (BTC)'s price is a little over the place, a sudden move from defunct crypto wallets startled spectators.</p>
<p>QuadrigaCX, once the largest crypto exchange in Canada, filed for bankruptcy three years ago after the sudden death of its founder.</p>
<p>The firm&rsquo;s bankruptcy trustee, Ernst and Young, announced they have lost control of an estimated 100 BTC worth $355,000 during that time. </p>
<p>This week, dormant cold wallets tied to QuadrigaCX moved out the missing 100 BTC, which have now grown in value to $1.7 million. </p>
<p>However, the bankruptcy trustee firm said they are not behind the recent movement and attributed it to a suspected theft.</p>
<p class="s7">The Hideaways (HDWY) Celebrates Presale Success</p>
<p>Analysts warned Bitcoin (BTC) will continue trading in volatility until the end of the year.</p>
<p>While the crypto major is having a difficult time, analysts say this is the perfect time to explore different cryptocurrencies that could give better returns than BTC.</p>
<p>The Hideaways (HDWY) is among their top recommendations. The new cryptocurrency is closing its initial presale with a $100,000 prize draw after receiving better-than-expected demand for its native coin.</p>
<p>Investors are willing to put money into stable projects and The Hideaways (HDWY) is steady - thanks to its real estate backing that ensures strong underpinning whatever happens in the broader crypto industry.</p>
<p>HDWY sells at $0.10, an amount that will not only get you a passive income source but also a chance at winning a fortune you could only imagine in your life. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t miss your chance!</p>
