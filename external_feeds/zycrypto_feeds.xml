<p>Bitcoin and Ether traded without much fanfare Friday as the top crypto’s volatility continued its rapid decline. At press time, Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market volume, was trading at $16,983 after a 0.23% uptick in the past 24 hours.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Ether was exchanging hands at $1,272 after a 0.71% increase in the same period, according to CoinMarketCap data. Notably, the two cryptos continued to hold within a narrow range they have occupied since mid-December.</p>



<p>Other cryptos on the top-ten list of non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies continued to lose ground, with XRP, Dogecoin and MATIC plunging 2.90%, 3.78% and 2.77%, respectively, in the past day. The global cryptocurrency market capitalization increased by 0.74% to $830B, while the total crypto market volume dropped by 14.05%&nbsp;to $27.35B.</p>



<h2 id="h-cardano-leads-in-gains"><strong>Cardano Leads in Gains</strong></h2>



<p>Cardano managed to shake off the weakness, surging by 5.66% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.29 at press time. In the past seven days, ADA, the native token for the Cardano proof-of-stake blockchain, has grown by over 18%, making it the largest gainer among the top ten cryptos.</p>



<p>ADA’s growth has been attributed to a range of key factors, including the user trust that goes with the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-to-test-cardanos-new-wallet-with-1000000-worth-of-ada-experiment/">consistent growth</a> of its ecosystem. Earlier this week, Cardano dApps completed 16 million transactions hitting a new milestone. On January 4, crypto payments giant processor CoinGate noted in a report that ADA entered the top ten most used cryptos list for the first time in 2022.</p>



<p>Large investors also seem to be helping buoy ADA prices as the token’s current prices offer attractive discounts. Crypto market intelligence platform Santiment Feed attributed ADA’s end-of-week mini-surge to aggressive buying by addresses holding between 1M to 100M ADA.</p>



<p>According to the firm, this group of investors have added back 217.2M ADA since Jan 1 2023, despite dumping 568.4M coins in the final two months of 2022. As per the firm, this cohort “may be a main validator to watch for a price breakout”, potentially sending the price back to $0.30.</p>

<h2><strong>FTX Contagion Continues To Shake Markets.</strong></h2>



<p>Although the crypto market seems to have priced in the events of the last two or so months, the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-feds-launch-ftx-task-force-to-trace-and-recover-stolen-investor-funds/">FTX contagion</a> continues to unravel, suppressing crypto prices further. Crypto bank&nbsp;Silvergate Capital became the latest casualty announcing on Thursday it was cutting 40%&nbsp;of its staff after facing US$8.1 billion in withdrawals sparked by the FTX failure in November.</p>



<p>Genesis Global Trading, one of the leading lenders in the industry, also reportedly cut its headcount by 305 and is considering filing for bankruptcy, according to a report by Wall Street Journal, which cited people familiar with the matter. On Friday, Digital Currency Group, the parent company of Genesis Global Trading, announced it is shutting down a wealth-management division called HQ due to, among other reasons, a “prolonged crypto winter.”</p>

<ul>
<li>Fidelity files three trademark applications, delving into the metaverse with huge plans. </li>



<li>The firm leverages key areas like virtual real estate investments, NFT trading, and marketplace services. </li>



<li>Fidelity’s belief in digital assets has not wavered even after the implosion of FTX, with the firm poised to create more impact in the sector. </li>
</ul>



<p>Investment giant Fidelity is set to make inroads in the metaverse as its latest efforts in the development of web3 to the delight of metaverse users.</p>



<p>The firm filed three trademark applications in the United States covering a host of web3 products and services including, virtual real estate investments, cryptocurrency trading, and NFT marketplaces, among others. The investment giant&#8217;s latest move has kept users gleeful as they await the offerings in the metaverse. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks">filings</a>, the company is also looking at investment services for mutual and retirement funds in the metaverse. Another area is the provision of educational services and multiple conferences in digital reality platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>conducting classes, workshops, seminars, and conferences in the field of investments and in the field of marketing financial services in the metaverse and other virtual worlds,” </em>read the filing.</p>



<p>A metaverse electronic payment will also be rolled out as the filing states, “<em>financial administration of credit card accounts in the metaverse and other virtual worlds.” </em></p>



<p>Digital asset trading services in the metaverse will incorporate NFTs, cryptocurrencies, and electronic wallet services alongside a financial management advisory service in virtual real estate and referral services.</p>



<p><em>“Electronic wallet services in the nature of electronic storage and processing of virtual currency for electronic payments and transactions via a global computer network; digital currency, virtual currency, cryptocurrency digital token.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2 id="h-fidelity-s-digital-asset-drive">Fidelity’s digital asset drive&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Fidelity Investment’s push in cryptocurrencies this year has been nothing short of excellent despite the heavy criticisms by some lawmakers on its recent crypto offerings and the market downturn. In April, the firm announced plans to offer companies and their employees access to Bitcoin (BTC) in their 401(k) retirement accounts. </p>



<p>The investment company also launched Fidelity Crypto, a service that allows retail investors to trade Ethereum (ETH)  and BTC at zero fees from their phones. In October, the company increased its digital asset division by hiring 100 employees instead of other top firms laying off staff.</p>

<p>Bitcoin continued to trend range bound on Saturday, riling investors who had to contend with lacklustre price volatility in the past 14 months. At press time, the top cryptocurrency was trading at $16,966 after a 1.11% increase in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Its biggest rival, Ethereum, also traded sluggishly at $1263- a level it has been toying at for the past two days.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-77010" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Unlike the past year, where a clique of high net-worth investors like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-bull-tim-draper-sticks-to-250000-price-prediction-for-btc-in-2023/">Tim Draper</a> and Ark Invest CEO Cathie woods made extremely optimistic calls for Bitcoin, it has increasingly become harder for investors to predict where crypto prices may be going as 2023 unravels. However, some sceptics are convinced that Bitcoin will plunge lower before the curve can flatten out in the coming days.</p>



<p>For instance, Gareth Soloway, the chief market strategist of InTheMoneyStocks, believes there is more room for Bitcoin to the downside. Speaking to Kitco News earlier yesterday, the pundit who correctly predicted Bitcoin’s 2021 top, noted that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pundit-who-predicted-bitcoins-plunge-to-20k-lowers-bet-to-12000/">Bitcoin could plunge</a> to $9,000. </p>



<p><em>“I’m still looking at eventually $12,000 to $13,000 in a short-term target. I do believe it will go lower than that and pierce $10,000 and could go as low as $9,000 before all this is over.”</em> Soloway told Kitco’s, David Lin.</p>



<p>According to him, the Bitcoin chart was in the process of forming a “bear flag pattern” which, if validated, could see its price drop to the said level. He, however, stated that BTC was likely to see a minor rally in the near term.</p>



<p><em>“All we have to do is take out $17,000, and I actually think we are going to get a short-term rally to about $18,400. So actually, I’m very short-term bullish, but you can’t ignore the bigger pattern here, which is still bearish.”</em></p>



<p>Soloway’s predictions come even as the FTX debacle hammers the markets. In the past two months, firms linked to Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire have been folding, crushing investors’ risk appetite. To Soloway, however, whereas “there is still some flushing to do”, there was no doubt that all this was getting closer to ending.</p>



<p><em>“We are also getting close to potential regulation, which I think will be a huge asset for bitcoin and crypto as that will be an avenue for big money to start dabbling in crypto again,”</em> he went on. </p>



<p>Previously, Soloway has called for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/analyst-gareth-soloway-reveals-probable-trigger-for-bitcoins-ascent-to-500000/">Bitcoin at $500,000</a> in the long term as clear regulations for the crypto sector are passed, and adoption picks up. Since tapping an all-time high of $68,789 in November 2021, Bitcoin’s price has fallen over 75%, making it the fourth largest wipe-out of all time in the asset’s history.</p>

<p>MicroStrategy, the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin reserves, has continued to splash cash towards BTC purchases ignoring cynics and the industry’s chaos created by the stunning collapse of FTX.</p>



<h2 id="h-microstrategy-buys-more-btc"><strong>MicroStrategy Buys More BTC</strong></h2>



<p>In a Dec 28 filing with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), the business intelligence company disclosed it had purchased 2,395 bitcoins for approximately $43 million between Nov 1, 2022, and Dec 21, 2022.</p>



<p>More interestingly, it revealed that it sold 704 BTC on Dec 22 to help it take advantage of the various US tax benefits given bitcoin’s vanished value since it first started acquiring the cryptocurrency in 2020. Notably, it later bought back 810 bitcoins at $16,845 per coin on Dec 24.</p>



<p>The latest purchase now brings MicroStrategy’s holdings to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-community-fears-centralization-as-microstrategys-bitcoin-holdings-hit-132500-btc/">approximately 132,500 BTC</a> acquired at a total cost of around $4.03 billion and an average purchase price of approximately $30,397 a coin.</p>



<h2><strong>Crypto Community Puzzled At BTC Purchases</strong></h2>



<p>Whereas calls to purchase BTC at current discounted prices have been rising among crypto users, not everyone is stoked by MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy.</p>



<p>In the wee hours on Saturday, Michael Saylor, the company’s founder and former CEO, shared a Bitcoin performance chart from 2020, tweeting;</p>



<p><em>“The Bitcoin Strategy is winning for MicroStrategy.”</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tuOaasGcaPbzNpJ5f5j-QtThyQUNHB5b046QcKY2YFmfzFzNzTifDt6KiBMW6OMnwvZdcHcyIAYC-gjnm3-zZNW52sg-jCp5XMy5fF40ZQ_MPYlqIPLyTLQxytH2NmaQodAzl83dQxqh0fQnEE1XvWLak_j23CJfd1vOqNkavQUB70bCxEN0mP3tH3DHw5yG4HEA4ygMJg" alt="C:\Users\Newton\Downloads\Fl0vsS3WYAM85fc.png"/></figure>



<p>The tweet, which has since garnered close to a million views, has received mixed reactions, with most comments suggesting most crypto adherents have lost hope in his bitcoin acquisition strategy.</p>



<p><em>“Microstrategy Bitcoin holdings are down 45%, which is almost the worst performer here. This chart assumes he went all in on Bitcoin at the date provided. In reality, he&#8217;s just been averaging in as everything crashes which defeats the point of this graphic,”</em> Fellow trader Nebraskan Gooner commented on the chart. </p>



<p><em>“$MSTR is down 90% from the high, has over 1 billion unrealized loss on the bitcoin, and has over $700 million debt to get those BTC. If that&#8217;s winning to you then I don&#8217;t want to know what losing means to you,”</em> another wrote.</p>



<p>With Bitcoin trading at around $16,966 at press time, MicroStrategy’s stash would now be worth just over $2.24 Billion, translating to an unrealized loss of about $1.79 billion.</p>



<p>Moreover, apart from debts owed to creditors for the purchase of Bitcoin, shares of MicroStrategy have continued to tumble, dropping nearly 50% following the FTX debacle.</p>



<p>Despite the downturn, MicroStrategy, which turned to bitcoin in 2020 as a hedge against inflation, remains unwavering, with Michael Saylor stressing that they <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategy-reiterates-it-has-a-long-term-focus-on-bitcoin-despite-a-harrowing-year/">will never sell</a> their Bitcoin. Saylor, who has previously revealed he owns 17,732 bitcoins, believes that the world most traded cryptocurrency is “unstoppable” and that, ultimately “, Bitcoin is the separation of money and state”.</p>

<ul>
<li>The partnership is a win for the Ethereum-scaling network, having welcomed a major NFT project from Solana, y00ts.</li>



<li>Polygon’s native MATIC token added 3% in the last 24 hours.</li>
</ul>



<p>Financial services giant Mastercard is collaborating with Polygon to bring together music artists, their fans, and industry mentors through a Web 3 accelerator program. Mastercard Artist Accelerator will launch in spring 2023 with a live-streamed artists showcase &#8211; per the announcement.</p>



<p>The program targets musicians, DJs, and producers with the tools to share their content on Web 3, including minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It includes exclusive access to special events and music releases. For the fans, the MasterCard Artist Accelerator features a limited NFT edition dubbed The MasterCard Music Pass, providing users with exclusive Web3 learning resources.</p>



<p>Commenting about the launch during the Consumer Electronics Show, MasterCard Chief Marketing and Communication Officer Raja Rajammanar termed the partnership as an opportunity to nurture budding artists. &#8220;<em>Music is a universal passion, inspiring, moving, and bringing us together; however, it can feel impossible for budding artists to break in. With the MasterCard Accelerator, we are expanding access and driving connections further with cutting-edge Web3 technology,</em>&#8221; he said.</p>



<h2 id="h-mastercard-artist-accelerator-program-targets-new-crop-of-artists"><strong>Mastercard Artist Accelerator Program Targets New Crop of Artists</strong></h2>



<p>Polygon Studios, the firm behind Polygon blockchain, is optimistic that the program will empower a new generation of artists using blockchain technology &#8211; also educate the public about the technology. &#8221;<em>Web3 has the potential to empower a new type of artists that can grow a fan base, make a living and introduce novel mediums for self-expression and connection on their terms,</em>&#8221; CEO Ryan Wyatt said.</p>



<p>The announcement has boosted the price of Polygon’s native MATIC token, up to an intraday high of $0.8104, according to data shared by CoinMarketCap. The price changed by +3% in the past day and +5.79% in the last week. MATIC ranks tenth among other cryptos, with a market capitalization of more than $7 billion.</p>



<p>Mastercard Artist Accelerator is a win for Polygon, one of the fastest blockchains, onboarding major brands like Starbucks, Nike, and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polygon-nfts-finally-coming-to-over-1-4-billion-instagram-users-matic-primed-for-huge-boost/">Instagram</a>. The blockchain is said to have paid $3m in grants to have Solana NFT projects, y00ts, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-is-losing-its-touch-with-nfts-as-major-projects-announce-departure/">moved</a> to its platform. Together with DeGods, another NFT platform on Solana, y00Ts generated some of the highest NFT sales on Solana, up to 70%.</p>

<ul>
<li>Analysts mirror the development of the market in 2023 in line with the current status and future landmark activities.</li>



<li>The SEC v Ripple case, stablecoin, DeFi regulations, and demystification of the FTX saga, among others, are pivotal in swinging the pendulum.</li>



<li>Network upgrades on Ethereum, Solana and other blockchains rolled out this year will also set the tone for web3 development.</li>
</ul>



<p>The new year has come with new speculations and insights over the market as experts mirror key factors that can shape the growth of web3 over the next 12 months.</p>



<p>The major area analysts have dwelt on is the market&#8217;s bearish trend. Is an end in sight? Last year was chaotic, with several top assets losing as much as 60% in value with no positive roads in sight. Market leader, Bitcoin, slumped over 55% last year and still hangs below $17,000.</p>



<p>On the bright side, inflation is on the decline, and many experts have predicted stocks and other assets to bounce back, so the bear season may soon be over.</p>



<p>The SEC v Ripple (XRP) case is now two years old, and the final decision would be a landmark case for both the SEC and Ripple. On the side of the SEC, a judgment declaring XRP as a security could reshape digital asset regulation in the country.</p>



<p>Some commentators believe that the case would have a wider reach with authorities going after centralized exchanges like Binance US, Coinbase, and Kraken. Lewis Cohen, an attorney specializing in web3 and digital assets, stated that the SEC wants to go all out of its wins against XRP.</p>



<p>“<em>If they got their way, most US token marketplaces could not allow users to buy and sell ‘crypto securities’ without registering as an exchange or getting an exemption,” </em>he added.</p>



<p>A win for Ripple will prevent a draconian push by regulators to describe digital assets as securities. Specifically, it will be a landmark <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-will-triumph-in-sec-battle-and-gary-gensler-will-resign-this-year-pundit-predicts/">moment</a> for the XRP Army, which believes its beloved asset is being held back by the SEC.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-upgrades-for-ethereum"><strong>More upgrades for Ethereum</strong></h2>



<p>After Ethereum’s Merge last year, which <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-merge-goes-live-and-a-new-era-for-ethereum-begins-heres-the-whole-bushel/">transitioned</a> the network to a proof-of-stake model reducing its energy usage by 99%, Vitalik Buterin restated his commitment to continue leading the advancement of web3. The blockchain will implement a Shanghai upgrade in Q1 2023 to enable stakers to withdraw their Ethereum (ETH).</p>



<p>Since staking kicked off on the blockchain, users have staked about $20 billion worth of ETH, including newly generated ETH, and will be available for withdrawal in March. Ethereum is also poised to extend its leadership as the leader in NFTs and other projects as its closest rival, Solana, battles migrating projects and technical issues.</p>

<p>Indonesia is considering setting up a national crypto exchange to keep pace with the fast-changing financial landscape.</p>



<p>Citing a Wednesday report by Bloomberg, the exchange is expected to launch later this year before the country assigns the Financial Services Authority (FSA) control over such assets. Presently, crypto assets in Indonesia are policed by “Bappebti” -the country’s commodities futures trading regulatory agency responsible for regulating commodity contracts.</p>



<p>Confirming the plan on Wednesday, January 4, Bappebti acting head Didid Noordiatmoko noted that the move was part of the country’s broader <a href="https://zycrypto.com/indonesia-set-to-tax-crypto-transactions-and-investments-from-may/">financial sector plan</a>.</p>



<p><em>“The FSA will assume regulatory power over the assets over the next two years, by which time the exchange should be set up,”</em> said Noordiatmoko.</p>



<p>The statement comes even as lawmakers push for a regulation seeking to task the FSA with regulation strengthening supervision and oversight of crypto-assets which have been booming in the South East Asia nation. Lawmakers presented the draft law in September 2022 following the Terra-induced turbulence by cryptocurrencies and the need to tighten the regulation of crypto exchanges.</p>



<p>Despite adopting a strict anti-crypto stance in the past, partially due to local regulations and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/indonesias-islam-council-bans-muslims-from-trading-bitcoin-deems-crypto-as-haram/">Islamic laws,</a> Indonesia has been loosening its noose, opting for progressive regulations as demand for crypto assets continues to soar. According to the country’s trade ministry, as of November 30th 2022, there were 16 million crypto investors compared to 11.2 million at the end of 2021. </p>



<p>Despite the ongoing crypto winter slashing trading volumes globally, statistics provided by the trade ministry showed that Indonesians traded 212 trillion rupiahs ($14.3 billion) worth of crypto in the first half of 2022. Presently 383 crypto assets and 10 local coins can be traded by Indonesians, with another 151 assets and 10 coins under evaluation by the Bappebti.</p>



<p>It is important to note that while trading in digital assets is legal in the country, the use of crypto payments as a form of payment is prohibited in Indonesia after the country imposed a blanket ban on the practice in 2017. That could change if the proposed law on moving crypto assets from the  Bappebti to the FSA is passed. </p>

<ul>
<li>The Manhattan US Attorney’s Office has created a task force to recover losses linked to the collapse of FTX.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The move comes as embattled FTX co-founder and CEO pleaded not guilty to several counts of fraud.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Analysts laud the creation of the task force and call for a renewed push against activities of bad actors in the cryptosphere.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The US Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) has formed an ‘FTX task force’ to investigate and recover investor funds as well as to handle others related to the implosion of FTX last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Damian Williams, a federal prosecutor on the FTX case, disclosed the task force&#8217;s establishment in a statement adding that all resources and expertise will be put in to ensure that justice is served. </p>



<p><em>“The Southern District of New York is working around the clock to respond to the implosion of FTX, all hands are on deck. We are launching the SDNY FTX task force to ensure that this urgent work continues, powered by all the SDNY’s resources and expertise until justice is done.”</em></p>



<p>Led by Andrea Griswold, the task force will use asset forfeiture to recover billions owed to FTX users. The task force is made up of experienced and seasoned prosecutors from various SDNY divisions, including the Public Corruption Unit, Commodities Fraud and Transactional Crime Enterprise Unit. </p>



<p>Griswold is also popular among digital asset circles for investigating the collapse of Terra&#8217;s stablecoin UST and LUNA token last year which wiped billions from the market. The FTX implosion has also resulted in huge losses, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) estimating over $8 billion loss for users. </p>



<p>FTX filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection in November, claiming to have 100,000 creditors and liabilities going over $10 billion. </p>



<h2 id="h-sbf-pleads-not-guilty">SBF pleads not guilty&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The creation of the task force comes after Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) pleaded not guilty to all charges of fraud linked to the collapse of FTX. SBF is now scheduled to face trial on Oct 2, with the court granting further bail conditions which prohibit SBF from accessing or transferring FTX assets. </p>



<p>SBF could potentially face <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftxs-sbf-bags-250-million-bail-could-face-up-to-100-years-in-jail-as-close-associates-plead-guilty/">jail time</a> of up to 115 years if he is found guilty of all eight counts of fraud. Last month, former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang pleaded guilty to fraud charges concerning their roles in the collapse of the digital asset exchange.</p>

<p>Ethereum whales are busy amassing Shiba Inu ahead of the anticipated <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-finally-wants-to-drop-the-memecoin-tag-with-the-debut-of-its-own-blockchain-as-adoption-rate-wobbles/">Shibarium launch</a>. Whalestats shows that the meme crypto was among the top ten most purchased tokens among the top 2,000 largest Ethereum investors as of this week.</p>



<p>What is fueling the high whales’ appetite is the much-awaited Shibarium. It is a layer-2 platform expected to improve the performance of Shiba Inu. Speculations were heightened that Shibarium could be launched soon after the ecosystem’s lead developer Shytoshi Kusama remarked on the same. &#8220;<em>Love meeting with the team from UnificationUND about Shibarium. Aligning. Onboarding. Finalizing. Soon. Very Soon,</em>&#8221; Kusama said.</p>



<p>Described as the foundation for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, Shibarium features a decentralized exchange (DEX), blockchain games, and the metaverse &#8211; all of which have been under development. Shiba Inu currently relies on Ethereum, with shortcomings being slow transactions and high gas fees. However, that is bound to change within the layer-2 solution. Shibarium will take most of the transactions off Ethereum while still using the blockchain as a security layer.</p>



<h2 id="h-shibaswap-governance-token-bone-jumps-double-digit"><strong>ShibaSwap Governance Token BONE Jumps Double-Digit</strong></h2>



<p>BONE, a governance and utility token, has gained the most from the sentiment among the five major tokens in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The digital asset, capped at 230,000,000 tokens, has gained 10% in the past week, according to data from CoinGecko. On the other hand, SHIB declined by 0.36% in the same period.</p>



<p>LEASH and TREAT are the other tokens expected to play a key role in the upcoming Shibarium. Both tokens can be staked for rewards in Shiba Inu liquidity pools. Also in the plan is SHI, a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-primed-for-strong-recovery-as-ecosystem-mulls-introducing-stablecoin-before-year-end/">utility stablecoin</a>. The Shibarium developers have also added a token burn mechanism to cut the supply of SHIB.</p>



<p>The latest data from the Shiba Inu burn tracker, Shibburn shows that the number of burned SHIB to date was 410,384,382,996,444 as of the time of writing these lines. The canine-themed token launched with an initial supply of a quadrillion tokens, out of which that in circulation stands at 562,850,341,247,185.</p>

<p>Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau has called for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/france-calls-for-eu-wide-cryptocurrency-regulation/">tougher regulatory requirements</a> for crypto firms even as European Union Nations chart a path forward for an all-around regulation.</p>



<p>According to a Jan 5 Bloomberg report, the governor stressed the need for France to move with urgency in enacting sound rules for the crypto sector when delivering a speech to the financial sector in Paris. Villeroy noted the recent volatility in the sector means France should not wait for European rules to come into effect before it can make licensing for Digital Asset Service Providers (DASPs) compulsory.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“All the disorder in 2022 feeds a simple belief: it is desirable for France to move to an obligatory licensing of DASP as soon as possible, rather than just registration,”</em> said Villeroy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, licensing laws for DASPs are optional. However, persons who provide “crypto trading” and “custody services” on behalf of third parties must register with the AMF. About 60 crypto firms, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-eyes-france-as-spot-for-a-global-headquarters-amid-regulatory-thunderstorms/">including Binance</a>, operate in the country, having received lighter registration from the country’s Financial Markets Authority (FCA). At least 50 others operate in the country without licenses.</p>



<p>France has an eased regime for regulating digital asset providers, a factor that has often challenged its efforts to present itself as the most pro-crypto nation among EU nations.</p>



<p>Mid last month, Herve Maurey, a Senate finance committee member, proposed an amendment, which, if passed, will see the clause allowing crypto firms to operate without a license until 2026 removed. Proposing the amendment, Maurey noted that the FTX collapse had been a game changer, warranting tightening of rules urgently regardless of when the MiCA rules would be passed.</p>



<p><em>“This (FTX) led a number of players within the French system to consider that things needed to be supervised more tightly,”</em> he said.</p>



<p>That said, the amendment could end the option to operate without stringent checks as early as October 2023, with deliberations in the French parliament kicking off this month.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the soon-to-be ratified <a href="https://zycrypto.com/finalized-eu-mica-crypto-regulation-seeks-to-police-nfts-and-algorithmic-stablecoins/">Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA)</a> regulation, which has been pending in the EU parliament, is expected to enter into force in early 2023. First tabled in 2020, the regulation seeks to establish harmonized rules for crypto assets and related services and activities for the EU level and put into place a framework that is intended to avoid Terra or FTX-style collapses.</p>

<p>Solana, one of the largest proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies, has been going bonkers, jumping over 40% in the past seven days on the back of BONK, a dog-themed token that recently debuted on the Solana ecosystem.</p>



<p>Launched on Dec. 25, BONK is a meme coin modelled after Shiba Inu and features a dog avatar. BONK is described as “the first Solana dog coin for the people, by the people.” Accordingly, 50% of the token’s supply is said to have been airdropped to the Solana community as a way of compensating them following FTX and Alameda’s collapse, according to a statement on the token’s website.</p>



<p>“<em>The Bonk community were tired of toxic “Alameda” tokenomics and wanted to make a fun meme coin where everyone gets a fair shot,”</em> read the statement.</p>



<p>In the past 24 hours, BONK has surged 42.90%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. This growth has also convinced some Solana traders that the token’s trading volume is potentially driving Solana’s price up, therefore piling into BONK.</p>



<p>Solana’s rebound comes after the cryptocurrency dropped as low as $8.30 on Dec. 29 after being caught up in the loss wave following the implosion of FTX and Alameda Research.</p>



<p>As ZyCrypto reported, Sam Bankman-Fried’s public support for Solana and revelations of Alameda holding a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/despite-solanas-tumble-amid-the-ftx-collapse-the-community-is-keeping-its-hopes-high/">significant chunk</a> of SOL on its balance sheet painted the cryptocurrency in bad light leading to a massive retail dump. Between Nov 7 and Dec 29 2022, SOL lost over 77% of its value, bringing the asset&#8217;s total losses to just over 96%.</p>



<p>Solana also witnessed a massive exodus of projects building on the ecosystem, with Non-fungible token (NFT) firm Dust Labs announcing plans to bridge off two of its top-performing Solana NFT projects, DeGods and y00ts, onto Ethereum and Polygon.</p>



<p>With the dust settling on the FTX saga following the arrest of Sam Bankman-Fried, the Solana community seems to be pulling themselves together with the hope of reviving Solana’s lost glory. In the past three weeks, calls on the community to focus on the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/heres-why-solanas-future-is-still-bright-despite-sol-price-nuking-97-below-ath-vitalik-buterin/">ecosystem’s developments</a> and growth as opposed to sideshows have been rising.</p>



<p>Last week, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressed support for Solana, noting that “the chain has a bright future” after the recent sell-off washed out “the awful opportunistic money people.” He went on to note that he hoped that Solana’s community would get its fair chance to thrive.</p>

<p>A myriad of events in 2022 overshadowed the crypto industry. This left many investors, regulators and governments wondering whether they had seen the worst of the industry pitfalls and what is expected come 2023.</p>



<p>According to PrivacyAffairs, cryptocurrency scams were reported at US$4.3 billion by November 2022. A December 9, 2022, CoinDesk crypto staff layoff compilation estimated that over 26,000 jobs were lost in the crypto industry.</p>



<p>Several crypto companies struggled to stay afloat, some were closed, and others filed for bankruptcy. Notable among these were Argo Blockchain, BlockFI, Celsius Network, Compute North, Core Scientific, FTX, Terraform Labs, Three Arrows Capital and Voyager Digital. </p>



<p>2022 also saw most of the major cryptocurrency prices heading southward. The major cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, started trading at around US$47,000 and closed the year at just under US$17,000. Similarly, Ethereum, the major altcoin, started the year trading at around US$3,800 and closed the year at around US$1,200.</p>



<p>Most of the world economies were hit by high inflation in 2022. The annual inflation rate hit a record high of 9.1% for the United States in June 2022. Similarly, consumer price inflation in the Euro Area reached a record high of 10.6% in October 2022. The US Fed, the European Central Bank (ECB) and many other central banks hiked their key interest rates in 2022 to curb rising inflation. Cryptocurrency prices were hit as markets adjusted to higher interest rates.</p>



<p>2022 witnessed several global efforts aimed at regulating the crypto industry. The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation geared towards harmonising crypto asset rules in the EU is expected in early 2023. In the United States (US), several bills on crypto-related regulation were introduced and are awaiting Congress to pass them.</p>



<p>One of the major events of 2022 was the Merge of the Ethereum network, transitioning from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in September. Among the key benefits of this upgrade is the expected reduction in energy consumption of the Ethereum blockchain by over 99%. Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, highlighted the roadmap for further upgrades to the Ethereum network: the Surge, the Scourge, the Verge, the Purge and the Splurge.</p>



<p>The year 2022 is now behind us. 2023 comes with optimism that the challenges of 2022 can only form a stronger foundation for the crypto industry going forwards. Crypto regulation is expected to come hard and fast. Major cryptocurrencies are mostly trading range bound as 2023 kicks off. Lessons learned will have a profound say in how crypto investors and other stakeholders approach 2023 and beyond.</p>

<ul>
<li>Despite the heavy downfall of cryptos, NFTs showed resilience last year.</li>



<li>The positive report has accelerated the price of APE, SAND, and MANA.</li>
</ul>



<p>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)-related cryptocurrencies surged Thursday on the report that the asset class did not perform poorly in 2022, despite the bear run. According to data from DappRadar, NFT sales volumes in 2022 ducked to $25.1 billion from $24.7 billion in the prior year.</p>



<p>The analytics firm reported that the number of trades made last year was 101 million, an improvement from 2021’s 58.6 million, meaning the digital assets fetched a lower value per unit. The decline in dollar terms is tied to the crypto winter, partly caused by macroeconomic factors, the collapse of Terra Luna and its stablecoin, and the contagion around the demise of FTX.</p>



<p>OpenSea ranked top in NFT trades with more than $297 million in December. The marketplace’s sales increased in April with the NFT land plots for Otherside by Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). OpenSea’s trading volumes recorded a sharp decline between May and June from $3.3 billion to $1 billion, showed the report.</p>



<h2 id="h-bayc-was-the-top-performing-nft-in-2022"><strong>BAYC Was the Top-Performing NFT in 2022</strong></h2>



<p>Bored Ape Yacht Club was the top-selling NFT in 2022, according to CryptoSlam, posting estimated sales of $1.6 billion. Most of its sales were made between January and May before the price dropped from a high of $429,000 to a low of $60,000.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, NFT-related tokens are responding positively to the reports. Apecoin&#8217;s APE surged 14% in the past week to peak at $4.18. The jump has increased the market cap of the BAYC&#8217;s token to $1.4 billion. Similarly, Sandbox token SAND rose 10% during the period, while Decentraland (MANA), another blockchain big on NFTs, added an equivalent margin.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Solana continues to suffer from the collapse of FTX. Towards the year&#8217;s close, its major NFT projects, yOOts and DeGods <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-is-losing-its-touch-with-nfts-as-major-projects-announce-departure/">announced</a> their exit from the blockchain. yOOts is planning to move to Polygon, while DeGods will launch on Ethereum this quarter. The outflow deepens Solana&#8217;s woes, considering the two projects accounted for over two-thirds of its NFT sales.</p>

<p>US largest crypto trading platform, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/not-a-single-mention-of-cardano-pretty-low-says-hoskinson-on-coinbases-2023-market-outlook-report/">Coinbase</a>, has agreed to part a total sum of $100 million towards settling its compliance worries with US financial regulators. The sum is reportedly split into two halves, per a New York Times report, with one part as a fine and the other designated as part of commitments to improve internal compliance efforts.</p>



<p>Coinbase was accused of multiple compliances and anti-money laundering violations, including a backlog of necessary scrutiny measures affecting over 100,000 transactions. For a crypto exchange valued at $7.6 billion, the company’s know-your-customer (KYC) practices have been described as rudimentary and porous, with a high risk of allowing lawbreakers and criminals to swindle unsuspecting victims through its platform.</p>



<p>The company had earlier pledged to revamp its compliance team–which the financial regulators describe as too overwhelmed to keep up with over 100 million unique customers–by incorporating external evaluators. But such efforts proved rather ineffective, prompting the opening of a formal investigation last year.</p>



<p>Since obtaining its license in 2017, Coinbase has prided itself as one of the biggest crypto players to establish a foothold in the US. But, the New York-licensed company appeared to have fallen short of the strict regulatory standards peculiar to US markets.</p>



<p>In the US, crypto companies are held to the same compliance standards as commercial banks. Many believe the now-defunct FTX may not have engaged in such fraudulent practices if it was registered in the US instead of the Bahamas. But over the last few years, a trove of donations, nearing billions of dollars, were largely enjoyed by key political officers and decision-makers at the White House–much with little to no suspicion or scrutiny–in the run-up to the 2022 midterm elections.</p>



<p>Worse still, there are still no approved laws for policing operations, despite two congressional recommendations and SEC digital assets report, as crypto innovations spring faster, spreading across one-twelfth of the US total population.</p>



<p>With the current violation, Coinbase will join top exchanges like Kraken and Robinhood, already enlisted in the US regulatory violations list, with a combined fine of $30.3 million. Rumours are ripe about a four-year IRS investigation into Binance compliance misgivings now nearing close. The result, if indicative of Changpeng Zhao’s company, could see Binance give away a considerable grip on its momentous dominance, especially since the fall of embattled Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX.</p>
