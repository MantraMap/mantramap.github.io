					<description><![CDATA[Polkadot (DOT) is riding a solid bullish momentum that enabled it to stay in the green for the past 24 hours and maintain significant gains in the last seven days. According to tracking from Coingecko, at the time of writing, DOT is changing hands at $4.69, tallying a weekly hike of 10%. Moreover, the 13th largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap has managed to trim its 30-day losses down to just 11.4% although it is still several miles away from its all-time high value of $54.98%. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains 4.5% in Weekly Timescale As Shanghai Upgrade Nears Holders, though, need to be cautious as some of its technical indicators show that Polkadot’s surge might be short-lived. DOT might soon experience strong selling pressure as indicated by its Relative Strength Index (RSI) which is currently hovering at the 50% region. DOT No Longer A Security Although there’s a lot of uncertainty in DOT’s future as far as trading price is concerned, it would seem that the crypto asset has put itself in a very good position to avoid being choked by strict regulations that threatens the broader crypto space. Following the collapse of the FTX exchange platform that made investors lost a lot of money and the continued proliferation of crypto scams, analysts expect that international governments will soon bring the hammer down to better regulate ownership, selling, buying, trading and use of cryptocurrencies. Polkadot, however, could be safe from this looming threat as according to Web3 Foundation, the altcoin is no longer considered as a security but more like a software. In addition, the team behind the project have been proactively working with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more sensible regulation.  In doing so, DOT might have just saved itself from this market landscape-changing development. DOT total market cap at $5.3 billion on the daily chart &#124; Chart: TradingView.com Polkadot Price Forecast As there is no clear timetable yet for the enforcement of additional regulations for the crypto space, DOT investors need to turn their focus first on what awaits the digital asset in the days to come.

					<description><![CDATA[Ripple has been locked in a bitter court battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding whether XRP should be classified as a security or not. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, recently tweeted about him being optimistic but cautious of what 2023 brings in terms of regulations. Because of this, XRP has been trading sideways, a movement not altered since FTX’s collapse. Adding to the downward pressure is the significant whale activity on the market. According to Whale Alert, whales have been moving hundreds of millions worth of XRP to the open market with the biggest transfer worth $92 million.  Related Reading: Ethereum Gains 4.5% in Weekly Timescale As Shanghai Upgrade Nears However, the market seems bullish despite recent bearish developments as XRP, as of writing, went up by 2% in the past 24 hours. XRP is currently trading at $0.3435, down 0.5% in the last seven days, data by Coingecko shows. Today is the first day of the 118th Congress. While prior efforts at regulatory clarity for crypto in the US have stalled, I am cautiously optimistic that 2023 is the year we will (finally!) see a breakthrough. A thread on why… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 3, 2023 What XRP’s Case Mean For Crypto And Its Price The day the SEC filed the complaint, December 21, 2020, XRP fell by 67.13% on the charts. However, December 5 proved to be a day XRP holders should rejoice. According to a report, the SEC failed to satisfy the three elements of the Howey Test which determines whether the asset is a security or not.  This is a big win not just for Ripple but for the entire crypto industry as this would legitimize crypto’s place in the financial space. With the company and community hopeful for a win, Ripple released to escrow over 55% of XRP’s total supply out of which is a billion XRP.  Although the market is very hopeful for a win, Garlinghouse’s statement shows a very mixed sentiment about what 2023 will bring for the company and for the world of crypto. But he is very clear on what could – or better yet, should – happen this year; break the status quo in the current U.S. legislation about what crypto should and shouldn’t be or America will lose its innovation leader status.  Related Reading: MATIC Advances 6.5% In Last 7 Days – Can It Sustain Gains For Another Week? XRP total market cap at $17.3 billion on the daily chart &#124; Chart: TradingView.com Investors Should Watch Out For This&#8230; Currently, the sideways market movement could be broken in the next few weeks. As of writing, investors and traders of the token are pushing the price up to test the $0.3680 price resistance range.  With low correlation with Bitcoin and Ethereum, it might only be slightly dampened by bad macroeconomics as recession fears grow.  Crypto market FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt), however, might become a problem. As of now, two events are sending negative signals to investors of crypto. First is Huobi’s decision to lay-off 20% of its workers, and the second is the Genesis-DCG fiasco.  Any negative developments here might affect XRP’s ability to test its current resistance range. As the situation develops, investors and traders should capitalize on the token’s current bullish momentum.   -Featured Image: The Daily Hodl]]></description>

<p>Although the market is very hopeful for a win, Garlinghouse’s <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1610352765129338880?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> shows a very mixed sentiment about what 2023 will bring for the company and for the world of crypto. </p>
<p>But he is very clear on what could – or better yet, should – happen this year; break the status quo in the current U.S. legislation about what crypto should and shouldn’t be or America will lose its innovation leader status. </p>


<h2><strong>Investors Should Watch Out For This&#8230;</strong></h2>
<p>Currently, the sideways market movement could be broken in the next few weeks. As of writing, investors and traders of the token are pushing the price up to test the $0.3680 price resistance range. </p>
<p>With low correlation with Bitcoin and Ethereum, it might only be slightly dampened by bad macroeconomics as <a href="https://www.ctpublic.org/2023-01-06/the-u-s-job-market-is-still-healthy-but-its-slowing-down-as-recession-fears-mount" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recession fears</a> grow. </p>
<p>Crypto market FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt), however, might become a problem. As of now, two events are sending negative signals to investors of crypto. First is Huobi’s <a href="https://ph.news.yahoo.com/crypto-exchange-huobi-lay-off-070546959.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">decision</a> to lay-off 20% of its workers, and the second is the <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2023/01/200748-genesis-pondering-bankruptcy-filing-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Genesis-DCG fiasco</a>. </p>
<p>Any negative developments here might affect XRP’s ability to test its current resistance range. As the situation develops, investors and traders should capitalize on the token’s current bullish momentum.  </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cardano (ADA) has seen some pretty tragic price action in the last couple of months, which has dragged its price down toward two-year lows. It still continues to maintain this downtrend and is barely moving, just like the rest of the crypto market, but some developments among large ADA investors could see some bullish momentum for the digital asset. Cardano Whales Begin Accumulating In New Year Toward the end of 2022 when momentum in the crypt market was dropping, there had been some selling from large ADA investors.

The result was more selling pressure on the digital asset that dragged its price down below $0.25, making its lowest price point since early 2021.

The report shows that in the first five days of 2023, these large investors have already added more than 217 million ADA to their stash. This brought the percentage of supply that they now hold back up to the 57.22% level, not the highest it’s ever been, but certainly an encouraging figure.

					<description><![CDATA[In its latest quarterly update, Grayscale announced the rebalancing of funds for the fourth quarter of 2022. As part of the rebalancing, Grayscale sold off a certain amount of its Digital Large Cap Fund and dumped its held tokens, including Avalanche Network token AVAX.   AVAX has slipped by 2% following the sell-off in the past 24 hours. According to Grayscale, the sold-off AVAX tokens were replaced with the purchase of the existing fund components in proportion to their respective weightings. Grayscale Purchased And Existing Tokens The AVAX sell-off was only part of the CoinDesk Large Cap Select Index and Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund. In its CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Select Ex ETH Index and Grayscale Smart Contract Platform Ex-Ethereum Fund portfolio rebalancing, the company sold off Algorand native token ALGO. In its CoinDesk DeFi Select Index methodology, Grayscale adjusted its DeFi Fund’s portfolio and purchased Synthetix (SNX) after selling some existing assets.  Related Reading: Grayscale Says It May Return 20% Of Investor Capital, Bitcoin Refuses To Budge As of now, the Grayscale portfolio fund now includes 65% Bitcoin (BTC), 30% Ethereum (ETH), 1.86% Cardano (ADA), 1.39% Polygon (MATIC), and 1% Solana (SOL). Meanwhile, its DeFi Fund’s Fund Components include  65.05% Uniswap (UNI), 12.39% Aave (AAVE), 8.15% MakerDAO (MKR), 6.02% Synthetix (SNX), 4.58% Curve DAO Token (CRV), and 3.81% Compound (COMP).  Since July, Grayscale has been carefully monitoring the CoinDesk Large Cap Select Index. The index launched in April tracks the market capitalization-loaded performance of “the largest and most liquid digital assets.” During Grayscale usage of the Index, the quarterly scheduled rebalancing resulted in the dumping of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Chainlink (LINK), Polkadot (DOT), and more Uniswap (UNI) purchases. AVAX Slips After Grayscale Dumped Before the sell-off, AVAX was still sitting at a $12 zone; however, after Grayscale dumped its holdings, the AVAX token dropped by 2% and traded at $11.39 Friday morning.  AVAX has appreciated over the past months. It has surged from around $9 to $13. Notably, Grayscale fund’s portfolio, which currently has $163 million in assets under management (AUM), only held a small portion of AVAX tokens. As of September 30, AVAX made up less than 1% of the company’s fund’s assets, according to its previous quarterly report. Related Reading: Avalanche: Will 2023 Bring A Fruitful Recovery For The AVAX Ecosystem? There was no significant move from ALGO, which was also removed from the Grayscale portfolio fund. It fell from a range of $0.17 to $0.15. As of the time of writing, ALGO currently trades at $11.73 with a 24-hour trading volume of $45 million.  On the other hand, AVAX seems to be gaining momentum to the upside at the time of writing as it has already formed a retracement; a reversal is likely to happen. AVAX currently trades at $11.73, down by 0.8% in the last 24 hours, with a trading volume of $125 million over the same period.]]></description>

The circulating supply is 34.52 billion ADA, with its maximum token supply pegged at 45 billion ADA tokens. ADA has performed well recently since the turn of the year, prompting optimism among holders. With the prolonged crypto winter in 2022, investors are hoping for more favorable market conditions moving forward. Cardano’s recovery has rekindled interest in the project and questions on how long it can sustain the rally. What Is Behind ADA’s Price Upsurge? ADA is enjoying increased adoption since its trading volume has increased. Investors and holders of the coin are more likely to buy into the project due to its utility. Cardano is one of the largest blockchains to use the energy-efficient proof-of-stake network. This proof-of-stake helps in energy saving and environmental protection.

According to data from CoinMarketCap, the crypto market has pushed the cumulative market cap to around $812.00 billion. This indicated a drop of 0.88% over the past 24 hours. With the declining market trend, XRP stands among the assets that have lost value. The price dip has attracted crypto whales. They have moved millions of XRP tokens to different crypto exchanges.

It recorded that crypto whales have transferred about 385 million XRP to crypto exchanges within 24 hours. The cumulative tokens are worth almost $131 million in the current market prices. The data provider noted that besides the most significant single transaction, many whales had moved about 70 million XRP tokens to several crypto exchanges. The value is worth about $25.6 million. The report indicated that most transfer transactions were on Bitstamp, costing $10.1 million. In addition, one of the whales moved XRP tokens worth about $11.8 million to the Bitso crypto exchange. Also, an unknown crypto whale is reported to have purchased up to 35.1 million XRP tokens. The transaction occurred during this present XRP price dip through the Bitso exchange. As a result, the whale accumulated Ripple tokens worth about $11.8 million. Notably, the largest single transaction from a whale, as recorded by the data provider, involved a transfer of over 280 million XRP tokens. The tokens are worth almost $95.4 million.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows the Bitcoin exchange depositing transactions are now at a 4-year low, indicating that the bottom may be here. Bitcoin 30-Day MA Exchange Depositing Transactions Have Declined As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the metric&#8217;s current levels are the same as in Q1 2019. The &#8220;exchange depositing transactions&#8221; is an indicator that measures the total number of Bitcoin transfers that are headed toward centralized exchanges. The difference between this metric and the more popular exchange inflow is that the latter indicator tells us the total amount of BTC being deposited to exchanges, that is, the combined sum of the value of each transaction going to exchanges (rather than their total number), which is a value that can be inflated by a few whales and are thus not representative of the trend being followed by the entire market (especially the retail investors). But since the exchange depositing transactions only focus on the pure number of individual transfers taking place rather than their amounts, the metric could give a more accurate picture regarding whether the average investor is sending coins to exchanges or not at the moment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Large Dormant Supply On The Move Since one of the main reasons holders deposit to exchanges is for selling purposes, a high value of this indicator can have bearish implications for the price of the crypto. On the other hand, low values imply not many investors are applying selling pressure right now.

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin price has struggled below $17,000 for multiple weeks now, and it recently dipped below the $16,900 mark. This downward move on the Bitcoin chart could be attributed to the recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes. The minutes of the meetings revealed that the Federal Reserve System would stick with higher interest rates for the foreseeable future. This has evidently sent ripples through the market, causing participants to react negatively. The technical outlook of the asset has reflected a fall in accumulation, but indicators are still positive about the Bitcoin price over the upcoming trading sessions. From the daily chart, it can be inferred that BTC will make a recovery in the next trading sessions. Bitcoin continues to hold itself steady above the $16,600 price mark. Currently, the price of the asset is consolidated, with major altcoins following the same price trajectory. Over the last 24 hours, BTC slipped 0.6%. The Bitcoin price at the moment is trading at a 76% discount from its all-time high of 2021. The market capitalization of Bitcoin decreased slightly, indicating that sellers outnumbered buyers at press time.

The coin recently lost the $16,800 support level; however, this is extremely short-term as BTC will soon initiate recovery on the chart. A slight push from the buyers will help BTC propel itself above the $16,800 mark, which indicates that the overhead resistance for the coin stood at $16,900. Clearing the $16,900 price mark will pave the way up to $17,000. On the other hand, if demand doesn&#8217;t show up immediately, BTC could retrace further to sit at $16,600 before it starts to move northward again. The amount of BTC traded in the last session declined to indicate slight bearishness. Technical Analysis Despite a fall in the number of buyers, the technical outlook has managed to remain positive for Bitcoin price. The Relative Strength Index noted a downtick, which indicated that buyers were slowly exiting the market. On the other hand, however, Bitcoin has displayed a positive sign on the daily chart. The price of the asset was above the 20-Simple Moving Average line (SMA), which meant that buyers still had the upper hand in driving the price momentum in the market. Additionally, the 50-SMA (yellow) was below the 20-SMA (red) line; this is a golden cross, a pattern that is formed before the coin starts a rally. In accordance with incoming bullish strength, Bitcoin price depicted a buy signal on the daily chart. The price momentum is indicated by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence, which showed green signal bars. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains 4.5% in Weekly Timescale As Shanghai Upgrade Nears These bars were buy signals, which also aligned with the idea that the price of the asset was about to go up.

					<description><![CDATA[Solana-based BONK has been all the craze since the start of the new year. The meme coin had risen from obscurity to the largest meme coin on the Solana ecosystem in less than two weeks, recording massive gains for investors during this time. However, the hype seems to have reached its peak and BONK has begun the dreaded downward correction. BONK Falls 50% In 24 Hours In the last day, the price of BONK  has rapidly declined, losing more than 50% of its value during this time.
