<p>Introducing DongCoin</p>
<p>LBank Exchange is thrilled to announce the upcoming listing of DongCoin (DONG), Korea&rsquo;s first shitcoin (excluding Luna).</p>
<p>The global digital currency sphere is no stranger to meme coins. Yet, the waves created by these fun, internet-inspired tokens have not fully hit the shores of South Korea until now. Enter 똥코인 (DongCoin), Korea's premier meme coin. Though Luna may claim some notoriety, DongCoin is setting out to prove its mettle in the meme coin arena.</p>
<p>While meme coins have been majorly a Western phenomenon, with tokens inspired by internet humor, DongCoin serves as Korea's answer to this trend. The name itself &ndash; "똥" which translates to "s**t" in English &ndash; carries a cheeky nod to the term "s**tcoin". This is not just a coin; it's a statement, embracing the humor and playfulness that internet culture is known for.</p>
<p>The fact that Americans aren't the only ones enjoying meme coins is now evident. Koreans have a rich internet culture, appreciating memes and emoticons, notably the poop emoji. Now, they have a coin tailored for their humor.</p>
<p>About DONG Token</p>
<p>A whopping 420,000,000,006,969 tokens are up for grabs. Such an elaborate figure, filled with meme-worthy numbers like 420 and 69, further reinforces the playful nature of this cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Based on ERC20, DONG has a total supply of 420 trillion (i.e. 420,000,000,006,969). It will be listed on LBank Exchange at 8:00 UTC on August 25, 2023, investors who are interested in DONG can easily buy and sell it on LBank Exchange by then.</p>
