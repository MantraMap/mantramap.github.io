<p>According to<a href="https://coincu.com/200804-binance-abandons-dutch-market/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/200804-binance-abandons-dutch-market/" rel="noreferrer noopener"> CZ</a>, fostering a strong sense of camaraderie within the team involves various elements, including group-building activities, coaching sessions, motivational talks, and more. While these methods are helpful in creating cohesion, CZ acknowledges that their effectiveness can diminish over time in the face of external pressures and FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). However, by rallying the community together and fighting through challenges, Binance strengthens its mission of promoting financial freedom worldwide.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>CZ believes that activities such as group-building dinners and outings play a crucial role in fostering a sense of unity among team members. Additionally, coaching sessions, mentors, and even psychotherapists help in personal and professional development, leading to stronger bonds within the team. Motivational talks also serve as a powerful tool to inspire and energize the workforce.</p>



<p>While internal pressures have brought the <a href="https://www.binance.com/en" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.binance.com/en" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> team closer, CZ recognizes the importance of collaboration and building trust with external stakeholders. By fostering transparency, open communication, and collaborative partnerships, Binance aims to gain the support and trust of the wider community.</p>

<p>Binance&#8217;s relentless pursuit of enhancing financial freedom for people around the world remains at the core of its mission. The team&#8217;s unity and commitment to overcome challenges together further solidify the platform&#8217;s resolve to provide innovative and inclusive solutions in the crypto space.</p>



<p>CZ&#8217;s focus on team building and collaboration demonstrates the significance of creating a supportive and cohesive environment within the organization. By fostering a strong team spirit and continuously adapting to external pressures, Binance aims to remain at the forefront of the crypto industry.</p>



<p>As Binance continues to evolve and navigate the ever-changing landscape of the cryptocurrency market, CZ&#8217;s vision for team building and collaboration serves as a guiding principle. By uniting the internal team and building trust externally, Binance strives to empower individuals and promote financial freedom on a global scale.</p>

<p>In response, the country&#8217;s top financial regulator has implemented measures that require its employees to disclose their cryptocurrency holdings.</p>



<p>The scandal involved allegations of insider trading among lawmakers, one of whom was accused of selling tokens before new cryptocurrency regulations were introduced. The lawmaker was later found to be serving on a crypto-related parliamentary subcommittee at the time.</p>



<p>The aftermath of the scandal has led to a renewed push for transparency among MPs, regulators, and public officials. As a result, the Financial Services Commission (FSC), which is responsible for regulating South Korea&#8217;s crypto industry and conducting checks on domestic crypto exchanges, has updated its Code of Conduct for employees.</p>



<p>The revised code now prohibits staff involved with ‚Äúvirtual assets‚Äù from trading cryptocurrencies using undisclosed information obtained while performing their duties. In addition, employees who own tokens are now obligated to report this information to the FSC.</p>

<p>To comply with the new regulations, employees will be required to submit a form called the ‚ÄúReport on the Possession of Virtual Assets.‚Äù The form mandates that staff disclose the type of virtual assets held, the date of acquisition, and the quantity of tokens owned.</p>



<p>The restriction on crypto trading applies to public officials currently engaged in virtual asset-related duties, as well as those who performed such duties within the previous six months.</p>



<p>While the FSC still requires legislative changes to enforce the new code, it is working to expedite the process and aims to complete it in the second half of this year. South Korea and Japan are often seen as frontrunners in crypto regulation, and their actions may prompt other countries to follow suit.</p>

<p>Ukraine has already implemented laws requiring sitting MPs to disclose all assets, including cryptocurrency holdings. The disclosure of such holdings has led to public outcry in the past due to the large amounts of tokens possessed by Ukrainian lawmakers, raising questions about the origin of these significant crypto reserves.</p>



<p>The ‚ÄúCoin Gate‚Äù scandal has prompted the South Korean financial regulator to extend the requirement of declaring crypto holdings to its employees. The updated code of conduct prohibits staff from trading cryptocurrencies using undisclosed information obtained during their duties, and employees with crypto holdings must report them to the FSC. The FSC is seeking legislative changes to enforce the new code and hopes to complete the process later this year.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Scammers are already impersonating Crypto Twitter users on Threads, Meta&#8217;s new microblogging app, following its launch on July 5.</em></li>



<li><em>Threads has already surpassed 98 million sign-ups, but high-profile Crypto Twitter figures have warned of fake accounts impersonating others or themselves.</em></li>



<li><em>According to a report by Web3 security firm Beosin, $108 million worth of crypto was stolen in phishing scams in the first half of this year alone.</em></li>

<p>Although the app has already seen an impressive 98 million sign-ups since its release on July 5, it is still nowhere near as popular as Twitter, which has an estimated 450 million users. However, several high-profile Crypto Twitter users have already warned of imposter accounts on Threads, and it seems that the scammers are wasting no time in their attempts to deceive unsuspecting users.</p>

<p>Over the past few days, multiple <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threads-an-instagram-app/id6446901002" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threads-an-instagram-app/id6446901002" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crypto Twitter</a> figures have pointed out fake accounts on Threads that are impersonating others or themselves. Wombex Finance, a decentralized finance platform, tweeted an image of a Threads account impersonating it on July 8, warning that it could be a scammer as the project isn&#8217;t on the platform. Similarly, NFT influencer Leonidas tweeted a warning a day earlier to their over 93,000 followers that large NFT accounts, including their own, are being impersonated by &#8220;scammers&#8221; on Threads.

<p>On July 6, Jeffrey Huang, known on Twitter as Machi Big Brother, tweeted his Threads profile, and one user pointed out that there was already a Threads account impersonating his Twitter persona. While the Thread accounts mentioned have not yet shared any scam or phishing links, most are posting crypto-related content.</p>

<p>In the past, Twitter has been a popular channel for crypto phishing scammers, who often hack into the Twitter accounts of well-known individuals and businesses to post malicious links. These links are designed to trick unwitting targets into sharing their crypto exchange login, a crypto wallet seed phrase, or connect a wallet to a crypto-draining smart contract. According to a report by Web3 security firm Beosin, phishing scams stole $108 million worth of crypto in the first half of 2022 alone.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bitcoin price dropped below $30,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average after breaking the $30,500 support zone. </em></li>



<li><em>The price is now trading above the $29,850 support zone but might face resistance near the $30,500 zone. </em></li>



<li><em>Bulls could push the price toward $31,000 and open doors for a move toward the $32,000 resistance zone.</em></li>

<p>This happened after it broke the $30,500 support zone, which sent <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://bitcoin.org/en/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a>&#8216;s value plummeting. However, the downturns were limited, as the price seemed to be trading in a range above the $29,850 support zone.</p>



<p>Despite the fall, there was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $31,630 swing high to the $29,868 low. Even though there was an attempt to increase above the $30,500 resistance, it was unsuccessful. This means that Bitcoin is currently trading below $30,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average.</p>

<p>On the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair, there was also a break below a contracting triangle with support near $30,200. If the price of Bitcoin increases again, it might face resistance near the $30,300 level and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. The next resistance is near the $30,500 zone, above which the price might retest $30,750. This is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $31,630 swing high to the $29,868 low.</p>



<p>However, if the bulls push the price above the $30,750 level, there could be a drift toward $31,000. The next major resistance is near the $31,400 level. Any more gains could open the doors for a move toward the $32,000 resistance zone. Overall, Bitcoin&#8217;s price is currently hovering around support zones, but there are opportunities for gains if the bulls push the price higher.</p>

<p>As of now, the platform holds approximately $176 million worth of crypto assets, with a Clean Asset ratio (excluding VGX) of 96.15%. Notable assets on the platform include 2,287.4 BTC, 27,363.7 ETH, 18,558,340 USDC, 2,060 trillion SHIB, and more.</p>



<p>The reopening of withdrawals on Voyager was met with a surge in users seeking to move their crypto assets off the platform. The net outflow of $250 million reflects a significant movement of funds, indicating users&#8217; preference for storing their assets elsewhere or potentially taking advantage of other trading platforms.</p>

While the net outflow is substantial, the platform continues to hold a considerable sum of cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>The Clean Asset ratio, which stands at 96.15%, represents the proportion of assets excluding VGX, Voyager&#8217;s native token, and implies that the majority of the remaining assets on the platform are free from encumbrances or liabilities.</p>

<p>Among the notable cryptocurrencies held by Voyager are 2,287.4 BTC, 27,363.7 ETH, 18,558,340 USDC, and a significant quantity of the meme-based token SHIB.</p>



<p>The significant outflow of crypto assets from Voyager suggests that users may have sought alternative platforms or custodial services for their trading and investment needs. This trend highlights the competitive nature of the cryptocurrency market and the importance for platforms to consistently meet user expectations in terms of security, usability, and customer support.</p>



<p>As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, market participants are advised to conduct thorough research and due diligence when selecting trading platforms and custodial services. The security and trustworthiness of these platforms play a crucial role in safeguarding users&#8217; assets and ensuring a seamless trading experience.</p>



<p>Voyager will likely focus on improving its offerings and implementing measures to retain and attract users amidst the dynamic and evolving crypto market. The platform&#8217;s ability to adapt to users&#8217; demands and address any potential concerns will be essential in maintaining its competitiveness in the industry.</p>

<p>The Poly Network hack, which took place recently, resulted in the theft of a substantial amount of digital assets across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum. The hacker exploited a vulnerability in the network&#8217;s smart contract, allowing them to gain unauthorized access and transfer funds to their control.</p>



<p>The consolidation of approximately 566.4 ETH into the address 0x712 indicates the perpetrator&#8217;s efforts to centralize their ill-gotten gains into a single location. This move raises questions about their intentions and potential plans for the stolen funds. Law enforcement agencies, blockchain analysts, and the crypto community at large are closely monitoring these transactions for any potential leads that could help recover the stolen assets.</p>

<p>The transfer of 1,007.4 ETH to the address 0xcC2bb introduces another aspect to the ongoing investigation. It remains unclear whether this address belongs to the hacker or if it represents an attempt to obfuscate the flow of funds. The tracing of these transactions poses a significant challenge due to the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions, but efforts are underway to identify and track the movement of the stolen assets.</p>



<p>The Poly Network team, along with various blockchain security firms and organizations, are actively collaborating to address the security vulnerabilities that led to the exploit and to mitigate any further potential risks. They are working towards implementing enhanced security measures and protocols to prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>

<p>This surge in hashrate indicates a significant increase in mining activity and highlights the growing interest in <a href="https://hashrateindex.com/blog/hashrate-index-roundup-july-9-2023/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://hashrateindex.com/blog/hashrate-index-roundup-july-9-2023/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a>. Concurrently, the price of Bitcoin has witnessed a remarkable 14% rise over the past month, cementing its position as the leading cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>The surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s hashrate indicates an intensified competition among miners, as they strive to secure a larger share of the network&#8217;s mining rewards. The increase in hashrate is a positive sign for the Bitcoin network, as it reinforces the security and robustness of the blockchain.</p>

<p>In tandem with the hashrate surge, premium ASIC miners like the S19 XP have experienced a notable increase in price. These specialized mining rigs are highly sought after for their superior mining capabilities. However, the price increase has not been uniform across all ASIC models, with some experiencing a decline in prices. The fluctuation in ASIC prices suggests an evolving market demand, with miners opting for more efficient and cost-effective options.</p>



<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price surge in the last thirty days reflects growing investor confidence and renewed interest in the cryptocurrency. Several factors have contributed to this upward trend, including increased institutional adoption, positive regulatory developments, and a wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance. Bitcoin&#8217;s decentralized nature and limited supply have further bolstered its appeal as a digital store of value and hedge against inflation.</p>



<p>As Bitcoin&#8217;s price continues to climb, market analysts are closely monitoring its trajectory. Some experts believe that the current bullish trend may pave the way for new all-time highs in the coming months. However, others caution that price volatility remains a characteristic of the cryptocurrency market, advising investors to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before entering the market.</p>
