He noted that the debt ceiling debate, risk of national default, and possible credit rating downgrades are &#8220;destabilizing&#8221; factors for the USD. He also predicted that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates at least two more times.</strong></p>
<h2>Larry Fink on Rate Hikes and Inflation</h2>
<p>Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, the world’s largest asset manager, shared his view on the U.S. economy, future interest rate hikes, and the U.S. dollar&#8217;s reserve currency status at a Deutsche Bank financial services conference Wednesday.</p>
<p>The executive expects the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at least two more times, emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fed is not finished … Inflation is still too strong, too sticky.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The Fed is going to have to be more vigilant,” Fink said, noting that while “The economy is more resilient than the market realizes,&#8221; there are &#8220;pockets of problems,&#8221; such as the commercial real estate sector. Last month, Federal Reserve Chair <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-chair-powell-hints-at-possible-pause-in-interest-rate-hikes/">Jerome Powell</a> hinted that the Fed may pause raising interest rates this month.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just don&#8217;t see evidence of a reduction in inflation, or I don&#8217;t see evidence that we&#8217;re going to have a hard landing,&#8221; the Blackrock executive opined.</p>
<p>However, he downplayed the risk of a U.S. recession, noting that if it were to occur, it would likely be modest.</p>

<h2>Risks to U.S. Dollar’s Reserve Currency Status</h2>
<p>The Blackrock boss warned that the &#8220;drama&#8221; surrounding the debt ceiling has eroded trust in the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency. He cautioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>I believe we&#8217;ll have a resolution, but let&#8217;s be clear, the United States is jeopardizing its reserve currency status.</p></blockquote>
<p>He explained that the debate around the debt ceiling, the risk of the U.S. defaulting on its debt obligations, and possible credit rating downgrades were all &#8220;destabilizing&#8221; factors for the U.S. dollar. &#8220;We are eroding some of that trust, which in the long run we need to rectify and rebuild,&#8221; he further said.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fitch-maintains-negative-watch-on-us-rating-despite-debt-limit-resolution/">Fitch Ratings</a> said the U.S. &#8220;AAA&#8221; credit rating remains on negative watch despite the recent debt limit agreement. Prior to Congress reaching the debt ceiling deal, <a href="https://news-bitcoin-com.webpkgcache.com/doc/-/s/news.bitcoin.com/moodys-on-de-dollarization-rating-agency-labels-us-debt-default-a-near-term-danger-to-the-dollars-position/">Moody&#8217;s</a> said: &#8220;The greatest near-term danger to the dollar&#8217;s position stems from the risk of confidence-sapping policy mistakes by the U.S. authorities themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Saturday, President Joe Biden signed a bill that suspends the U.S. government&#8217;s $31.4 trillion debt ceiling, averting a possible U.S. default. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen previously warned that the Treasury would be unable to pay all of the government&#8217;s bills on <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-revises-debt-default-date-us-government-could-exhaust-funds-by-june-5/">June 5</a> if Congress had not acted by then.</p>

<h2>&#8216;Using the Country’s Debt as a Political Weapon Undermines Confidence in U.S. Government&#8217;</h2>
<p>Nigel Green, the CEO of Devere Group, a financial services company headquartered in the United Arab Emirates, highlighted the challenges that the U.S. economy continues to face, despite Congress reaching a debt ceiling deal, in an opinion piece published by Newsmax Friday. The deal, which President Joe Biden signed into law on Saturday, prevented a potential <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-revises-debt-default-date-us-government-could-exhaust-funds-by-june-5/">national debt default</a>, which could have occurred on June 5 if a resolution had not been reached, according to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.</p>
<p>“So, let’s be clear: this down-to-the-wire deal struck this week to raise the debt limit — and only until January 2025 — does not solve the underlying political challenges facing the U.S. and its economy,” Green stressed. “The main issue is that lawmakers in recent times have had, and continue to have, little incentive to reach agreement,” he continued, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s an increasingly polarized political landscape, which is being amplified by algorithms and economic interests. I believe it’s a trend that will only intensify in the foreseeable future.</p></blockquote>
<p>Green also noted that a presidential election is coming up in 2024, cautioning that the debt ceiling “political agreement” is “unlikely to be maintained for very long” if former president Donald Trump wins.</p>
<p>“Standoffs becoming a frequent occurrence will risk more government shutdowns, more restrictions on central bank independence and more damage to the U.S., and therefore global, economy,” the executive opined, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Using the country’s debt as a political weapon, undermines confidence of investors in the U.S. government amid concerns about the government’s ability to properly manage its finances.</p></blockquote>
<p>“This loss of confidence will mean that it becomes more difficult for the U.S. government to borrow money in the future, which could lead to higher interest rates and weaker economic growth,” he warned.</p>

<p>The Devere CEO also highlighted the risks to the U.S. dollar, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Debt ceiling dramas also erode some of the current global reserve currency’s credibility and reputation as a ‘safety asset,’ which could have far-reaching repercussions for the U.S.</p></blockquote>
<p>He recently argued that “debt ceiling crises are the ‘ultimate gift’ for America’s major geopolitical rival, China, which is seeking to promote the internationalization of its own currency and to position itself as a more stable and attractive investment option, in order to attract more international investment and capital inflows.”</p>
<p>Green emphasized that he is in favor of “debt ceiling reforms that take away the threat of a U.S. government default and all the implications of that, and reforms that make lawmakers in Washington truly accountable by automatically triggering spending cuts should the ceiling be reached.” However, he doubts “such reforms will come to fruition as a debt ceiling gridlock is a useful political theatre for lawmakers – on both sides – keen to push agendas.”</p>

Furthermore, from May 1 onwards, the network has successfully verified anywhere from 355,000 to over 682,000 transactions per day. Presently, approximately 188 blocks or 0.343 gigabytes must be mined by bitcoin miners to resolve the backlog of unconfirmed transactions.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#x2019;s Consistent Backlog: 188 Blocks to Clear Pending Transactions</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, there remains a significant backlog of pending bitcoin transfers awaiting confirmation. With the average block interval set at ten minutes per block, it would require approximately 1.30 days to clear this backlog. However, a substantial portion of the backlog has been resolved since <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/average-bitcoin-transaction-fees-skyrocket-to-19-20-per-transfer-as-over-440000-transactions-remain-unconfirmed/">May 7 and 8, 2023</a>, when the number of unconfirmed bitcoin transactions exceeded 500,000.</p>

<p>On May 8, according to <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3y">data</a> from bitinfocharts.com, the average transaction fee skyrocketed to $31 per transaction. As of June 4, 2023, the average transaction fee stands at 0.00012 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> or $3.15. The same website displays a <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-median_transaction_fee.html#3y">median-sized transaction fee</a> of 0.000053 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> or $1.44 per transaction. As of 3:51 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) on June 4, 2023, according to mempool.space statistics, there are approximately <a href="https://archive.ph/AeMEm#selection-1879.1-1879.9">257,141 pending transactions</a> awaiting confirmation.</p>
<p>To address a significant portion of this backlog, approximately 188 blocks must be successfully mined. Mempool.space provides fee data categorized into four tiers, including a &#x201C;no priority&#x201D; transfer costing $0.31 per transaction, a &#x201C;low priority&#x201D; transfer at $0.69 per transaction, a &#x201C;medium priority&#x201D; transaction priced at $0.84, and a high priority transfer for $0.99. At the same time, a significant portion of the blame for the high throughput and the backlog can be attributed to the nearing 11 million milestone reached by <a href="https://ordinals.com/">Ordinal inscriptions</a>.</p>

<p>When comparing average transfer fees, Bitcoin outperforms Ethereum&#x2019;s network fees, with data revealing that the <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-transactionfees.html#3y">average ETH transfer fee</a> amounts to 0.0029 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> or $5.46 per transaction. The <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-median_transaction_fee.html#3y">median-sized network fee</a> on Ethereum is 0.0012 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> or $2.30 per transaction. Interestingly, Etherscan&#x2019;s <a href="https://etherscan.io/gastracker">gas tracker</a>, similar to mempool.space, displays lower fees for ether transfers compared to the figures shown on bitinfocharts.com.</p>

<p>For instance, at 3:51 p.m. (ET) on Sunday, a high-priority <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> transaction only incurs a fee of $0.84 per transfer. While Bitcoin established a record of <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/charts/transaction-count">682,000+ transactions</a> per day on May 1, Ethereum surpasses this by <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_transactions_per_day">clearing</a> anywhere between 930,000 to 1 million transactions daily.</p>

However, PEPE has lost over 70% in value during the past 30 days.</strong></p>
<h2>Pepe Value Slides 26% Lower Over the Past 2 Weeks</h2>
<p>The meme coin <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pepe">pepe (PEPE)</a> has experienced a significant decline in value recently after an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-pepe-the-frog-crypto-token-becomes-sixth-largest-meme-coin-by-market-cap/">initial surge</a> when the token was launched. The token gained real-world value on April 18, 2023, and since then, Pepe has risen 2,192% against the U.S. dollar. However, over the past seven days, Pepe has dropped more than 13%, and according to 14-day statistics, it is down over 26%. Additionally, precisely 30 days ago on May 5, 2023, the meme coin reached its all-time high (ATH) at $0.00000431 per unit.</p>

<p>Since reaching its ATH, PEPE has lost over 70% of its USD value. In the past day, PEPE has slid 4.1% lower. Despite the decline, PEPE still holds the third-largest market cap among meme coins, currently at $530 million. At the time of writing, PEPE is ranked 84 out of the 10,085 crypto assets listed on coingecko.com. Over the past 24 hours, the meme coin, which features the likeness of Pepe the Frog, has experienced a worldwide trade volume of $57.25 million.</p>
<p>The top two leading meme coin crypto assets, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DOGE/">dogecoin (DOGE)</a> and <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/SHIB/">shiba inu (SHIB)</a>, have performed significantly better than PEPE in the past week. While PEPE experienced a 13% loss during this period, DOGE has gained 0.3% against the U.S. dollar, and SHIB is down 1.3%. Currently, there are <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/pepe/richlist/">116,394 PEPE holders</a>, and the top ten wallets hold 41.67% of the coin&#x2019;s supply. The top 100 richest PEPE holders control 64.60% of the total supply of this meme coin asset.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/meme-token">Meme coins</a> that have performed notably well this week include iotex shiba (IOSHIB), which has surged over 200%, bullbear ai (AIBB) with an 83% increase, and dyor token (DYOR) up 67% against the U.S. dollar. On the other hand, the top three meme coin losers are 3d3d (3D3D) down 59%, turbo (TURBO) down 49%, ignore fud (4TOKEN) down 36%, and wojak (WOJAK) dropping 35% in value this week. As of Sunday, June 4, 2023, the meme coin economy is valued at $16.96 billion, experiencing a slight 0.1% decline in the last 24 hours.</p>

The AI-based language model will allow its experts to speed up and expand the analysis of new risks related to crypto assets.</strong></p>
<h2>Blockchain Forensics Firm Elliptic to Employ Chatgpt</h2>
<p>London-headquartered Elliptic, a leader in blockchain analysis and crypto-asset risk management, announced the integration of the Chatgpt chatbot into its team’s off-chain intelligence and research gathering efforts.</p>
<p>The company pointed out in a press release that the solutions it has developed leverage a proprietary dataset consisting of more than a decade’s worth of data, “encompassing over 97% of crypto transactions by trading volume, and the largest collection of crypto exchange risk profiles.”</p>

<p>Adding the technology based on artificial intelligence (AI) to Elliptic’s tool set will allow its specialists to concentrate on accuracy and scalability while the large language model (LLM) will be used to organize the data, the firm noted, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>With Chatgpt, Elliptic’s researchers and investigators will be able to synthesize and organize intelligence on new risk factors in higher volumes and at a quicker speed than ever before.</p></blockquote>
<p>“We pride ourselves in being on the forefront of blockchain innovation, and incorporating cutting-edge technologies to enhance how we work,” said Elliptic CEO Simone Maini. “Integrating Chatgpt allows us to scale up our intelligence,” Chief Technology Officer Jackson Hull added.</p>
<p>Elliptic specializes in blockchain analysis and risk assessment on crypto transactions, providing intelligence services to financial firms, crypto businesses, governments and law enforcement agencies. It is backed by investors such as J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo Strategic Capital.</p>
<p>Developed by the Microsoft-funded AI research laboratory Openai, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chatgpt</a> has been making its way into the crypto space. In March, leading U.S. digital asset exchange Coinbase <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-tries-ai-assistant-chatgpt-for-pre-listing-risk-assessment-of-tokens/">announced</a> it’s testing the product as a token verification tool.</p>

However, this creation sets itself apart by being trained on a myriad of resources specifically focused on Bitcoin and its enigmatic founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. </strong></p>
<h2>Meet the AI Chatbot ‘Talk2Satoshi’</h2>
<p>On May 31, bitcoin enthusiast and author <a href="https://twitter.com/CierrePorbin">Pierre Corbin</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/CierrePorbin/status/1663953138506772480?s=20">unveiled</a> a chatbot platform infused with the essence of Bitcoin. This unique platform, akin to Openai&#8217;s Chatgpt, functions as a conversational program capable of responding to queries and engaging in dialogue with users.</p>
<p>What sets <a href="https://www.talk2satoshi.com/">talk2satoshi.com</a> apart is that Corbin, with the assistance of <a href="https://twitter.com/HugoFerrer_">Hugo Ferrer</a>, the co-creator, fed the chat program with a diverse array of sources, including Satoshi Nakamoto&#8217;s emails and forum posts, Saifedean Ammous&#8217; 2018 book &#8220;The Bitcoin Standard,&#8221; and Corbin&#8217;s own work, &#8220;The Great Reset and the Rise of Bitcoin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our news team posed a series of inquiries to talk2satoshi.com, such as &#8220;Why is bitcoin valuable?&#8221; As an illustration, we specifically inquired, &#8220;Why will there never be more than 21 million bitcoin?&#8221;</p>
<p>The chatbot said: “By 2140, there will be no more bitcoins issued and a maximum of 21 million bitcoins will have been produced. This is hardcoded into the protocol and cannot be changed without risking the loss of coins due to a bug fix or functionality implementation. Therefore, every change to the protocol must be backwards compatible.”</p>
<p>The talk2satoshi.com chatbot added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Additionally, Bitcoin&#8217;s supply is strictly limited, and there can only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence.</p></blockquote>

<p>We also decided to pose the same inquiry to Openai&#8217;s Chatgpt 3.5 for an alternate perspective. “The reason why there will never be more than 21 million Bitcoin is due to a design feature known as ‘Bitcoin&#8217;s maximum supply,’” Chatgpt 3.5 said. “This feature is an integral part of Bitcoin&#8217;s underlying technology, known as the blockchain. To ensure scarcity and prevent inflation, Bitcoin&#8217;s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, implemented a rule in the software protocol that reduces the rate at which new Bitcoin is created over time.”</p>

<p>Following the launch announcement from talk2satoshi.com&#8217;s Twitter account, <a href="https://twitter.com/flesler">Ariel Flesler</a> revealed that he had created a similar, yet unpublished, chatbot called &#8220;<a href="https://flesler.github.io/satoshi-ama/">Satoshi Nakamoto AMA</a>.&#8221; Flesler&#8217;s chatbot includes preloaded questions and cites sources such as statements made by Satoshi on the bitcointalk.org forum.</p>

<p>The Satoshi Nakamoto AMA chatbot also shares a similar user experience with Openai&#8217;s Chatgpt. In addition, Corbin and Flesler&#8217;s creations come on the heels of Crypto.com&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-com-unveils-amy-an-ai-powered-companion-for-crypto-enthusiasts/">introduction</a> of Amy, an AI-powered companion for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Amy offers knowledge on a wide range of crypto-related topics, rather than focusing solely on Nakamoto&#8217;s Bitcoin.</p>

<h2>Decentralized Finance Nightmare: Atomic Wallet Compromised, Millions in Crypto Stolen</h2>
<p>Based on several reports, the decentralized finance (defi) wallet platform Atomic Wallet appears to have been breached. On Saturday, the Atomic Wallet team acknowledged the event on their Twitter account after hearing from affected users. &#x201C;We have received reports of wallets being compromised. We are doing all we can to investigate and analyse the situation. As we have more information, we will share it accordingly,&#x201D; <a href="https://twitter.com/AtomicWallet/status/1664946301815910400?s=20">stated</a> the Twitter account for Atomic Wallet.</p>

<p>Boasting an estimated user base of five million, Atomic Wallet saw several of its users voicing their frustrations after the update. One victim <a href="https://twitter.com/Christomos03/status/1665010540094078978?s=20">lamented</a>, &#x201C;All of my hard working money has vanished from Atomic Wallet only. This is your responsibility to secure the funds. What will happened to our funds?&#x201D;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-591777 size-full" title="Atomic Wallet Hack: Decentralized Finance Wallet Breached, Millions Lost in Attack" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/drain.jpg" alt="Atomic Wallet Hack: Decentralized Finance Wallet Breached, Millions Lost in Attack" width="1280" height="275" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/drain-300x64.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/drain-1024x220.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/drain-768x165.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/drain.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>Some Atomic Wallet users <a href="https://twitter.com/dumbmoneytrader/status/1664999793511264256?s=20">said</a> their funds were unaffected, but still received warnings to remove their money from the platform immediately. One individual <a href="https://twitter.com/librehash/status/1665035667926048770?s=20">advised</a>, &#x201C;Your wallet will be emptied if you don&#x2019;t move your funds.&#x201D; While Atomic Wallet says it is investigating, the onchain sleuth Zachxbt is also looking for clues.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Some things to note about this hack,&#x201D; Zachxbt <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1665080799253733377?s=20">stated</a>. &#x201C;Largest single victim I have observed is for 2.8M <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>. Multiple other losses for 6 figures across different chains. Thanks to all of the victims who have messaged me their transaction hash. The root cause is still tbd,&#x201D; he added. The reason behind the Atomic Wallet breach is still unknown; however, Zachxbt later tweeted that he aided in recovering $1 million for one of the victims.</p>

<p>&#x201C;A huge shoutout goes to [Buffalu] and [Brian Smith] for helping us successfully rescue $1m from the Atomic Wallet hacker for one of the victims,&#x201D; <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1665226056570118146?s=20">tweeted</a> Zachxbt. When questioned about how the funds were retrieved, the onchain investigator <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1665228832184442883?s=20">said</a> the details would be disclosed at a later date.</p>

Speaking in the aftermath of the collapse of crypto-friendly banks in the U.S. and amid Binance’s issues with payment providers in Australia, Changpeng Zhao (CZ) said investments in several banks might be a better option although not a guarantee that crypto won’t be cut off.</p>

<p>Peter Schiff, the chief economist of Europac and best-selling author, has blasted the recent bipartisan deal regarding the United States debt ceiling.

The founder of the world’s largest digital asset exchange is convinced stablecoins can increase use cases for the U.S. dollar and praises the pro-crypto stance of Republican presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis.</strong></p>
<h2>CZ: Lack of Clarity and Regulation by Enforcement Mark Current Regulatory Landscape in U.S.</h2>
<p> founder and chief executive, Changpeng Zhao, gave his thoughts on the crypto regulatory situation in the United States in an Ask Me Anything <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1nAKErZgnVkGL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">session</a> on Twitter this past Wednesday. He was asked to comment in light of the 2024 U.S. presidential election and the statements of some of the candidates on cryptocurrency and regulations.</p>
<p>CZ said that his outlook on the current regulatory environment in the U.S. is not positive from crypto’s perspective. “I think there’s a lack of clarity and there are clear cases of regulation by enforcement of which we are a recipient of, in at least one case. So, it’s just not good,” he stated.</p>
<p>“U.S. has pros and cons. U.S. is a democracy, it’s got the foundations, freedom of speech … So it’s strong in many points. But the U.S. also has some disadvantages when it comes to crypto adoption,” the entrepreneur elaborated.</p>

<p>Zhao noted that the U.S. dollar is the global dominant currency which is a very powerful tool for the United States. He added that some people in the country believe that no one can do anything that would even hint at undermining that power.</p>
<p>“But then there’s a different group of guys, who are innovators, who say the best way to enhance the dominance of that [the dollar] is to embrace crypto,” the founder of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange pointed out and suggested:</p>
<blockquote><p>If we increase the U.S. dollar-based stablecoins, that further strengthens the U.S. dollar being used in more places. If we limit that, it reduces the use cases for the U.S. dollars globally, at least in the crypto communities.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Zhao Praises ‘Great’ Florida Governor, ‘Fantastic’ Miami Mayor</h2>
<p>CZ admitted he is too busy to regularly follow U.S. politics but praised Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for his stance on crypto assets. “He is very pro-crypto, so I think he is great,” Zhao said. He listed other U.S. officials in that category such as “fantastic” Miami Mayor Francis Suarez and Commissioner on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), “crypto mom,” Hester Peirce.</p>
<p>While currently the “U.S. doesn’t look positive to crypto,” with its “chaotic environment,” the collapse of three crypto-friendly banks, and lawsuits involving a number of leading crypto companies, the CEO of Binance is convinced that the United States has the potential to become a leader again, when the regulatory landscape becomes more favorable.</p>
<p>Changpeng Zhao’s comments on the regulatory challenges for the crypto industry in the world’s leading economy come after he recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-buying-bank-not-solution-for-banking-problems-says-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">addressed</a> the problems with banking that his and other companies in the sector are currently facing around the world.</p>

<h2>Coinbase to Launch New Bitcoin and Ether Futures Products</h2>
<p>Following the launch of the company&#x2019;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-derivatives-exchange-reveals-nano-bitcoin-futures-product/">nano-sized</a> bitcoin and ether contracts, Coinbase <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-derivatives-exchange-will-launch-institutional-sized-bitcoin-and">announced</a> this week that it has witnessed substantial &#x201C;institutional interest and demand for advanced derivatives products.&#x201D; As a result, the San Francisco-based exchange has opted to introduce &#x201C;institutional-sized&#x201D; bitcoin and ether futures contracts through its regulated Coinbase Derivatives Exchange.</p>
<p>These new futures products will become available on June 5, with the Coinbase Bitcoin (BTI) futures contract specified at 1 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and the Coinbase Ether (ETI) futures contract at 10 ether per contract. Coinbase asserts that these institution-focused contracts also provide significantly lower fees compared to traditional options, enabling institutions to improve their capital utilization. Additionally, the company highlights that these new contracts will be accessible through third parties.</p>
<p>Coinbase stated, &#x201C;We have partnered with institutional-leading FCMs, brokers, and front-end providers to support institutional clients further, enabling seamless access to these futures contracts through their robust trading platforms.&#x201D;</p>

<p>In the past 24 hours, the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/derivatives">total derivatives volume</a> is at $102 billion, currently 24.69% lower than the previous day. This weekend&#x2019;s top three derivatives exchanges include , Deepcoin, and Bybit. &#x201C;With the launch of these institutional-sized USD-settled contracts, we aim to empower institutional participants with greater precision,&#x201D; added Coinbase.</p>
