It can be viewed as a catalyst for personal growth and spiritual transformation, offering individuals a unique path toward self discovery and enlightenment.</p><p>In this essay, I will explore how Bitcoin can serve as a tool for this type of self transformation and become a catalyst for a profound journey of spiritual growth.</p><h2>Embracing Financial Sovereignty</h2><p>Bitcoin's core principle lies in decentralization and the elimination of intermediaries, offering individuals full control over their financial assets.</p><p>By embracing Bitcoin, we embark on a journey of financial sovereignty, freeing ourselves from the restrictions imposed by traditional financial systems. This newfound autonomy allows us to transcend limiting beliefs and societal expectations regarding money, enabling us to reevaluate our relationship with wealth and abundance.</p><p>As we develop a sense of self reliance and take responsibility for our financial well-being, we open the doors to self empowerment and spiritual growth.</p><p>Furthermore, financial sovereignty through Bitcoin encourages us to question the existing economic paradigm, in which financial institutions and governments exert significant control over our monetary transactions. As we challenge this centralized authority, we develop a deeper understanding of the importance of individual freedom and the potential for positive change through decentralized systems.</p><p>This realization extends beyond financial matters, encouraging us to question other aspects of our lives that may be governed by external authorities, fostering a sense of empowerment and self determination.</p><h2>Fostering Trust And Collaboration</h2><p>Bitcoin's underlying technology, its blockchain, relies on a network of participants who collectively validate and verify transactions. This decentralized approach fosters trust and collaboration, as each participant contributes to the overall security and integrity of the network.</p><p>Through engagement with the Bitcoin community, we develop a sense of interconnectedness, recognizing the importance of collaboration, transparency and consensus.</p><p>This realization extends beyond the realm of finance, teaching us valuable lessons about trust, cooperation and the power of collective action in our personal lives and relationships.</p><p>The Bitcoin community, consisting of developers, miners, investors and enthusiasts, demonstrates the power of collaboration and shared goals. It encourages individuals to work together towards common objectives, fostering a sense of unity and cooperation that transcends geographical and cultural boundaries. By actively participating in this community, we learn to embrace diversity, respect differing opinions and harness the power of collective intelligence.</p><p>These values extend beyond Bitcoin and can shape our interactions with others, helping us build stronger relationships and fostering a sense of harmony within our social circles.</p><h2>Cultivating Patience And Emotional Resilience</h2><p>Bitcoin's volatile nature tests our emotional resilience and challenges our capacity for patience.</p><p>The market's ups and downs teach us invaluable lessons in perseverance, discipline and emotional control. Investing in bitcoin necessitates a long-term perspective and the ability to weather temporary setbacks without succumbing to fear or panic.</p><p>By cultivating these qualities, we foster a deeper sense of equanimity, learning to detach ourselves from outcomes and embracing the journey rather than fixating solely on the destination. This shift in mindset lays a strong foundation for spiritual growth, as we develop the ability to navigate life's uncertainties with grace and composure.</p><p>And the lessons learned from bitcoin's volatility extend beyond financial markets.</p><p>They teach us to approach life's challenges with a calm and composed demeanor, recognizing that setbacks are temporary and part of a larger journey. Cultivating patience allows us to embrace the process of personal growth and transformation, understanding that true change takes time.</p><p>By embracing this patient mindset, we become more attuned to the present moment, finding joy and contentment in the journey itself rather than fixating solely on the end goal. This mindfulness fosters a deeper sense of self awareness and spiritual connection, enhancing our overall well-being</p><h2>Exploring New Paradigms Of Value</h2><p>Bitcoin challenges our conventional notions of value and offers an opportunity to explore alternative systems of wealth.</p><p>Its limited supply and decentralized nature detach it from the control of central authorities, prompting us to question the established notions of money and the pursuit of material possessions.</p><p>As we delve into the world of Bitcoin, we encounter a diverse community of individuals who value knowledge, innovation and personal growth over superficial indicators of success.</p><p>This exposure broadens our horizons, encouraging us to redefine our own measures of value and prioritize the pursuit of experiences, relationships and personal development.</p><p>Bitcoin's emergence as a store of value introduces us to the concept of "digital scarcity," which highlights the importance of intellectual and technological advancements. This shift in perspective prompts us to reevaluate our own talents, skills and knowledge, recognizing that they hold intrinsic value beyond material possessions.</p><p>By prioritizing personal growth and the pursuit of meaningful experiences, we align ourselves with a more holistic and fulfilling understanding of wealth.</p><p>This new paradigm allows us to embrace a purpose-driven life, in which our actions and contributions to society hold greater significance than mere accumulation of wealth.</p><h2>Practicing Mindfulness And Gratitude</h2><p>Engaging with Bitcoin provides an invitation to cultivate mindfulness and gratitude in our lives.</p><p>As we witness the transformative power of this technology, we become more aware of the present moment and the opportunities it holds. By practicing gratitude for the innovations and possibilities Bitcoin presents, we shift our focus from scarcity to abundance, attracting more positive experiences into our lives.</p><p>This newfound mindfulness expands our consciousness and deepens our spiritual connection, as we learn to appreciate the interconnectedness of all things and the limitless potential of the universe. Bitcoin's disruptive nature encourages us to challenge the status quo and approach life with a sense of curiosity and wonder. It prompts us to question the existing financial systems, societal structures and our own belief systems.</p><p>By cultivating a mindful and grateful attitude, we remain open to new possibilities, embrace change and foster a sense of awe for the transformative potential that lies within us and the world around us.</p><p>This mindset allows us to tap into our inner wisdom, explore our true purpose and cultivate a deeper sense of spiritual growth.</p><h2>A Catalyst For Individual Evolution</h2><p>Bitcoin's impact extends far beyond the realm of finance. By embracing this digital currency, we embark on a transformative journey of self discovery, personal growth and spiritual enlightenment.</p><p>Through the cultivation of financial sovereignty, trust, emotional resilience and alternative paradigms of value, Bitcoin serves as a catalyst for our individual evolution.</p><p>As we practice mindfulness and gratitude, we become more attuned to the interconnectedness of the world and the vast opportunities for growth and expansion.</p><p>Bitcoin, when approached with an open mind and a willingness to learn, can be a powerful tool for self transformation, guiding us towards a life of greater authenticity, abundance and spiritual fulfillment.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Heliand.

These tools leverage the Lightning Network and bitcoin to seamlessly integrate with LLMs. They are built on the L402 protocol, a Lightning native authentication mechanism and Langchain, a library that simplifies working with AI agents by incorporating external data for advanced functionality.</p><p>One of the tools included in the release is LangChainBitcoin, which enables Langchain agents to interact directly with Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. It includes features such as LLM Agent Bitcoin Tools, which utilize OpenAI GPT function calls to enable developers to create agents capable of holding a bitcoin balance, sending/receiving bitcoin on Lightning and driving with a LND node. Another tool, the L402 HTTP API Traversal, is a Python wrapper for a LangChain LLM chain (APIChain) that allows agents to access L402 payment-metered APIs seamlessly.</p><p>Aperture, a drop-in reverse proxy server, is also part of the release. It implements the L402 protocol and transforms any API into a pay-per-use resource gated via L402 functionality on the Lightning Network. The latest version of Aperture now supports Lightning Node Connect protocol, enabling compatibility with various Lightning Nodes, such as Voltage, Umbrel, Start9, Raspiblitz and BTCPayServer.</p><p>The L402 protocol, introduced in 2020, is a standard for payment-metered APIs designed to utilize the existing HTTP 402 Payment Required status response code. It combines bitcoin and the Lightning Network to enable global micropayments for paid APIs. The protocol allows for authenticating and charging per use of internet-native services, addressing challenges faced by the AI developer community, such as the high cost of GPU training and limited accessibility to advanced LLM models.</p><p>By providing these developer tools, the creators aim to build more accessible AI infrastructure for both humans and AI agents. They are particularly excited about the AI4ALL hackathon, taking place this month, where developers can leverage these tools to unleash their creativity and innovation. The Lightning and AI communities are encouraged to explore the potential of these new tools and contribute to the development of the machine-payable web powered by Lightning.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMjY2NTkxMzgyODczMjQx/bitcoin-lightning-network.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin As The World’s First Over-Unity Power Generator]]></title><description><![CDATA[In a sense, Bitcoin achieves over-unity power generation by storing energy and creating additional value over time.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/converting-energy-to-stored-value-bitcoin-is-over-unity</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/converting-energy-to-stored-value-bitcoin-is-over-unity</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[energy consumption]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Kevin Melody]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyMzg0NjM5NzQwOTQ2MDc3/20220916_better-five-factors-making-bitcoin-miners-unique-energy-consumers---jaran-mellerud.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Kevin Melody, a node runner and real estate professional.</em></p><p>An “over-unity” power generator (similar to the concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_motion">perpetual-motion machine</a>) is a hypothetical device that produces more energy than is required to run it. Although there is quite a bit of controversy in this field, the mainstream scientific consensus is that over-unity power generation is impossible, because it defies the first law of thermodynamics. </p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics">According to this law</a>, energy can undergo transformations from one form to another, but the total amount of energy within a closed system remains constant. This principle is derived from empirical observations and has been validated through numerous experiments and theoretical frameworks. </p><p>In practical terms, this means that energy can neither be created "out of nothing" nor spontaneously disappear. It exists in various forms, such as mechanical, thermal, electrical, chemical and nuclear energy. These forms can be converted into one another, but the total amount of energy remains constant throughout the process. </p><p>However, it's important to note that the law of conservation of energy applies to closed or isolated systems where no external energy sources or sinks are involved. In open systems, such as those interacting with their surroundings, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/cellular-energetics/cellular-energy/a/the-laws-of-thermodynamics#:~:text=An%20open%20system%20can%20exchange,with%20its%20surroundings%2C%20not%20matter.">energy can be exchanged with the environment</a>, leading to changes in the system's total energy. </p><p>For proponents, the trick behind the concept of an over-unity power generator is that it does not, in reality, break the law of conservation of energy. On the surface, it appears to be a closed system (i.e., one that powers itself and keeps itself running as well as producing excess energy). But many of whom believe such an invention is possible do not claim that the device creates energy out of nothing. They claim that, once the device is started, it is able to draw energy from an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy">unproven source</a> and then use that energy to run itself forever as well as provide excess energy to be applied to some other useful purpose. </p><p>There have been many devices created that claim to be able to tap this “free energy” source, but to date, none of these devices has been empirically proven to work. However, there is a persistent notion that many of them do indeed work and that they are deliberately suppressed and withheld from the public. </p><h2>Are Over-Unity Devices Real?</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_suppression_conspiracy_theory">Conspiracy theories surrounding the suppression of over-unity devices</a> suggest that powerful entities, such as governments, corporations and energy conglomerates, actively prevent the development and dissemination of such technologies due to economic interests, desire to retain power and control, national security concerns, patent and legal issues and other related reasons. </p><p>If the conspiracy theories are true, then these technologies are able to be suppressed because they rely upon third parties for protection. For example, inventors typically file for patents, presuming that patent law enforced by governments will enable them to monetize their inventions without fear of theft or exploitation by bad actors. </p><p>However, governments are made up of people, and people are subject to bribery, extortion, coercion and their own personal biases, as well as many other influences. The common denominator is trust. If you have to trust a third party, you are subject to the honesty, integrity, ability and resources of that party.</p><h2>Enter Bitcoin, A Unique Energy User </h2><p>Enter Bitcoin: the first technological discovery in human history specifically designed to resist and disincentivize violence.</p><p>The Bitcoin network has survived primarily because the only way to attack it is to turn it against itself. But the Bitcoin network is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile_(book)">antifragile</a>: the harder it is attacked, the stronger it becomes and that includes attacks against itself! The only practical way to defeat it is via a 51% attack and, to date, there has never been a successful one carried out against the Bitcoin network. In fact, such an attack is so difficult and expensive that prospective attackers would benefit more by devoting the same resources to mining and spending bitcoin honestly. </p><p>As a result of this antifragility, the Bitcoin network has proven to be an extremely reliable way to convert energy to stored value. In a sense, Bitcoin is the equivalent of a battery that allows its users to retrieve nearly all of the energy provided to create/acquire it at any time in the future. In addition, due to its fixed supply of units, each unit will also capture <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2015/deflationary-technology-disruption-impact-money/">the deflationary effect of advancing technology</a>. The net result is that, in a way, users are able to take advantage of more energy in the future than what was required to create/acquire each unit at any given moment in time. </p><p>Therefore, the Bitcoin network effectively operates like an over-unity power generator by using the energy it receives from outside sources to run and protect itself as well as capturing additional outside energy over time. </p><p>Contrast this with the fiat system, which does claim to be able to break the law of conservation of energy by creating value out of thin air. But note that even the “strongest” fiat systems all require inflation to work for any period. Inflation is a euphemism for theft and all the users in such a system are participating in theft to one degree or another. The main benefactors are <a href="https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/the-cantillion-effect">those in charge of creating and distributing the monetary units</a>, but everyone who uses the system is counting on receiving some value from the productive efforts of others without having to contribute to those productive efforts themselves. For their own excess production, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law">rational people will seek a means of saving rather than spending</a>. </p><p>Thus, <em>all</em> fiat systems eventually fail because they require energy stolen by means of fraud and coercion from actual producers and actual producers save as much of their productive efforts in more efficient systems (e.g., real estate and equities). Since no new energy is created by the system, and far less energy is put in than is taken out, the system eventually fails due to lack of energy. </p><p>This is how the Bitcoin network ultimately wins: People who produce value will see it as a better means of escaping the parasitical fiat system, thereby depriving it of energy and effectively starving it to death.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Kevin Melody.

According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the startup aims to attract users who find the process of buying and selling Bitcoin challenging and struggle to understand exchange operations, catering to a broader audience seeking simplicity and convenience.</p><p>The press release stated that the funds raised will support Bipa's expansion in the market, attracting new users and developing new business-to-consumer (B2C) products. Parreira said, "Our mission is to make people using the Bipa application pay for coffee every morning." Currently, bitcoin usage remains niche in Brazil, with Bipa's primary focus on the local community. However, the company plans to broaden its reach and bring the financial and technological revolution of bitcoin to more individuals.</p><p>To coincide with its growth plans, Bipa has unveiled a new visual identity, emphasizing its accessibility and simplicity. The redesigned brand features a spring-shaped "B" logo, symbolizing impulse, and employs a lively and colorful palette. Parreira hopes that the rebranding efforts and improved user experience will encourage individuals outside the current Bitcoin ecosystem to join Bipa, with the goal of bringing over 15 million Brazilians into the Bitcoin community.</p><p>According to data from the Investor X-Ray report by the Brazilian Association of Financial and Capital Market Entities (Anbima), approximately 6 million Brazilians, around 3% of the population, declare investments in cryptocurrencies. With this investment round, Bipa aims to tap into this market potential and become the go-to option for those seeking an entry point into the bitcoin industry.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MjMxNzYxODMwNTUzMDkz/bitcoin-stack.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Startup Lab's Summer 2023 Cohort Gears Up To Propel Growth In The Bitcoin Ecosystem]]></title><description><![CDATA[Industry titans, investors and innovators come together in an expanded program to fuel Bitcoin innovation and collaboration.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-startup-labs-summer-2023-cohort-gears-up</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-startup-labs-summer-2023-cohort-gears-up</guid><category><![CDATA[bitcoin companies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investors]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Startup]]></category><category><![CDATA[Startups]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2023 18:57:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgyOTYxOTk5MDM3MDgwOTI4/img_5736.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="http://btcstartuplab.com/">Bitcoin Startup Lab</a> is gearing up for its Summer 2023 cohort, bringing together industry titans, investors and innovators to fuel growth in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

The move from the $10 trillion asset manager stoked plenty of excitement and concerns alike from bitcoin proponents, with many championing the potential for massive inflows from legacy institutional investors, while others pushed back, citing the risks that such a product structure could pose to the bitcoin market. The introduction of such a product could bolster bitcoin’s profile among traditional investors, but it’s vital to understand the potential implications.</p><p>This article delves into the BlackRock proposal, comparing it with existing bitcoin investment vehicles, assessing the potential risks and benefits and drawing parallels with the introduction of liquid investment vehicles into the gold market, which many analogize as bitcoin’s monetary predecessor. The goal is to evaluate the implications of such a product on the broader bitcoin market and institutional adoption, while keeping in mind the principles that underpin the potential of bitcoin to serve as a global neutral reserve asset and settlement layer. </p><h4>BlackRock's Bitcoin Trust Proposal: An In-Depth Examination</h4><p>BlackRock's submission of an S-1 with the SEC marks a significant development in the bitcoin investment landscape. Although not an ETF in name, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust application bears striking resemblance to an ETF in function by allowing for daily subscriptions and redemptions, distinguishing it from existing bitcoin investment vehicles like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).</p><p>In contrast to the current leading bitcoin investment product, Grayscale’s GBTC, BlackRock's trust proposes an in-kind redemption feature. This means investors aren’t tied to selling their shares and creating a taxable event; instead, they can opt for withdrawing bitcoin from the trust. This circumvents the tax implications that Grayscale investors face when selling their shares for fiat and then purchasing bitcoin.</p><p>However, it’s important to note that the proposed in-kind redemptions come with a big caveat: Only BlackRock’s authorized participants, essentially investment firms in good standing with BlackRock, can withdraw bitcoin from the product. This implies that the benefit of in-kind redemptions is essentially restricted to large-scale investors and institutions. </p><p>The trust is slated to adopt the <a href="https://www.onrampbitcoin.com/newsletter/blackrock-creates-bitcoin-vehicle-half-good-half-terrible">grantor trust model</a>, aligning its structure closer to the likes of gold investment trusts. This implies that owning shares of BlackRock’s trust would, for tax purposes, equate to owning the underlying asset, e.g., bitcoin.</p><p>Questions start to arise regarding potential risks with BlackRock's proposed trust structure, particularly with the possibility of rehypothecation. A common practice among traditional asset ETFs, rehypothecation involves lending out assets to market participants. If extended to the Bitcoin Trust, it could lead to a situation where investors only have a claim to bitcoin that has been lent out, a situation that could lead to investors owning paper claims to bitcoin rather than the asset itself.</p><p>Furthermore, the proposal gives BlackRock considerable latitude in case of a Bitcoin fork, allowing them to determine which Bitcoin version to back. This opens up the possibility for potential manipulation and could present risks to investors who may not align with BlackRock’s decisions.</p><h3>The Current Landscape Of Bitcoin Investment Products</h3><p>Delving into the current landscape of bitcoin investment products, let’s focus on two leading vehicles: the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).</p><p>First, there’s the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which has long served as a primary avenue for legacy financial institutions to gain liquid exposure to bitcoin. Operating as a closed-end fund trading over the counter, GBTC saw billions of dollars flow into it over the years. The product carries a hefty 2% annual fee as a percent of net asset value and does not offer redemption back into bitcoin, thus creating a one-way street for supply. This structure was once very appealing to investors looking to exploit a seemingly automatic arbitrage trade, especially when the premium for GBTC shares reached as high as 40%, leading to a reflexive dynamic between inflows into the trust and demand for spot bitcoin.</p><p>However, this feedback loop reversed as demand for GBTC shares wavered when institutions began to attempt to unwind the arbitrage trades they had put on — meaning selling GBTC to realize the gain — which caused the premium to turn into a discount, with shares trading less than the net asset value of the bitcoin within the trust. The dislocation of GBTC from its net asset value alongside its inferior liquidity profile relative to spot bitcoin itself resulted in a market that liquidated all overleveraged participants who were using GBTC as collateral. </p><p>GBTC’s relatively high 2% annual fee has also come under scrutiny, especially as cheaper investment vehicles have emerged. As a result, GBTC shares came under immense pressure during the later months of 2021 and throughout 2022, with the discount to net asset value plummeting to almost negative 50%. </p><p>Besides GBTC, there is also BITO, which marked a significant milestone in the history of bitcoin investment products. As the first bitcoin-linked ETF available on a U.S. exchange, BITO opened the doors for investors to gain simple, indirect access to bitcoin exposure through a securitized ETF that has exposure to bitcoin futures contracts. However, as a futures ETF, BITO doesn't hold bitcoin directly. Due to the nature of futures contracts, the fund exposes investors to rollover risk, particularly when the futures curve is in contango — meaning futures prices are higher than current spot market prices — which causes their holdings to decay relative to the price of bitcoin over long periods of time. </p><p>Displayed below is the relative returns of GBTC and BITO shares against bitcoin since the launch of BITO, and since the start of 2020.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>A Closer Look At BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust: Potential Implications &amp; Risks</h3><p>Given the intricate design of BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust, its implications and potential risks raise serious concerns. There is an excellent post written by Allen Farrington, aptly named <a href="https://allenfarrington.medium.com/trust-me-bro-fb5a25964634">Trust Me, Bro</a>, which details some of the fine print and seemingly opaque risk models that an otherwise “bullish” ETF application from BlackRock contains. Below is a summary of some of his points in this section, but Farrington’s piece is well worth a read.</p><p>From a broader perspective, BlackRock’s trust could amass a considerable amount of Bitcoin, which isn’t necessarily a problem in and of itself, but bitcoin investors should pay close attention and remain vigilant of the possible second-order effects. BlackRock could in theory “sell bitcoin” to many financial institutions in the form of its iShares ETF, which is subject to rehypothecation and opaque ownership, unlike bitcoin UTXOs which exist on a transparent and immutable ledger. </p><p>Second, in terms of monopolistic pricing, it is likely that the existence of an ETF will place significant pressure on bitcoin exchanges, where the trading costs of an ETF are a mere few basis points compared to the rates of 50 bps to 100 bps charged by many exchanges for spot purchases. This could lead to consolidation of liquidity and put price-setting into the hands of BlackRock (or another entity with the dominant ETF).</p><p>In addition to accumulating a significant share of the circulating bitcoin and having a heavy hand in setting the price, BlackRock could create a narrative around any specific bitcoin that has yet to enter or has left the perceived safety net of the trust. This may look like spreading stories of dirty coins that could have been used by criminals, terrorists, drug dealers, etc., and would have a negative impact on fungibility of the asset because it would essentially create two tiers of bitcoin.</p><p>If BlackRock paints the picture of clean bitcoin within their trust versus the dirty bitcoin outside of it, they can then turn to banks to encourage opting into the trust’s version of Bitcoin since it will be viewed as “safe” from a regulatory perspective, further consolidating the ownership of bitcoin and allowing banks to offer their clients access to “bitcoin” which will actually be paper claims to the underlying asset as mentioned earlier.</p><p>Also within the trust filing is a section that provides BlackRock an option to choose the “appropriate network” should there be a time when Bitcoin faces an adversarial change in consensus and undergoes a hard fork. The filing specifies that BlackRock’s choice may not necessarily be in line with the most valuable fork. While this is likely a simple form of due diligence, by amassing a significantly large share of bitcoin that has the backing of equally large banking institutions and is held by a large portion of retail investors looking for simple exposure to bitcoin, it’s possible that BlackRock could instigate a hard fork or side with a consensus proposal that changes the fundamental aspects of Bitcoin which make it unique and valuable in the first place.</p><p>As mentioned above, there are also redemption concerns with the way this trust is structured. Only authorized participants, meaning investment firms, can withdraw bitcoin from the trust. Average, everyday investors will not be the ones able to redeem bitcoin from the trust in the first place, and since the authorized participants have to be in good standing with the firm, it’s possible that BlackRock could refuse redemptions — even to institutional investors.</p><p>All those concerns notwithstanding, there are historical examples of the creation of ETFs, namely gold, and their impact on the market.</p><h3>The Impact of Exchange-Traded Products: The GLD Analogy</h3><p>There’s many comparisons and contrasts between gold and bitcoin as investment vehicles. This article doesn’t dig into those but rather highlights the analogy and market impacts of a gold ETF in the past. By far, the biggest question of a bitcoin BlackRock ETF is: What does it mean for the price, market cap, liquidity, adoption, demand, etc.? This is not a new bitcoin-centric startup launching an investment vehicle, but rather the largest financial institution in the world that carries weight for market adoption in the age of passive investment vehicles.</p><p>For comparison, let’s look at the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), the largest gold ETF by assets under management (AUM) that started in 2004. It’s still one of the largest ETFs in the market today with $58 billion AUM. In November 2004, the <a href="https://www.spdrgoldshares.com/usa/historical-data/">ETF had over $1 billion in total asset value</a> in the first few days and then hit $50 billion by 2010.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Compared to many of the top ETFs in the market, GLD has been one of the best performing ETFs since its inception, only behind QQQ and Vanguard’s Growth ETF. This only accounts for looking at ETF performance since GLD’s start date as opposed to comparing similar start dates of other ETFs.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk5MTcyNjkzODE4NDE5MDg3/etf-performance.png" height="287" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>GLD is just one of a few large gold ETFs on the market. Total gold ETF products are estimated to have $220 billion in AUM as of last month. In 2022, gold in tonnes held by ETFs accounted for 1.66% of estimated above ground gold supply. A much larger share of gold supply, around 15%, resides in central bank reserves heavily dominated by the United States, Germany, Italy, France, Russia, China and Switzerland. </p><p>Obviously, it’s not easy to separate the impact of a widely adopted gold ETF on gold’s price over the last two decades, but it’s clear that the ETFs, even accounting for only a small amount of gold supply, have had a significant impact on the market. The GLD ETF was a major shift in how investors could purchase gold and essentially opened up gold buying to the masses while increasing gold market volumes and overall liquidity. In a limited way, there’s already been some of that impact via the GBTC trust with all its limitations. Compared to bitcoin today, GBTC’s 3.2% of circulating supply was a primary driver of bull market mania despite locking up only a small share of bitcoin supply. </p><p>Coupled with new narratives and a bit of gold mania into 2011, the GLD ETF was a key spark for a 350% rise over 6 years. Bitcoin is on a path to go through a similar shift where a more comprehensive ETF with more regulatory clarity will offer it to the masses, both institutional money and 401K or IRA style accounts. It’s not the self-custody bitcoin this publication advocates for, but it is a significant development in the market that many will likely opt for as it’s a market need for those wanting financial exposure to bitcoin on a larger scale, without the responsibility of holding their own keys.</p><p>But what about price suppression schemes, similar to the ones that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty-idUSKBN26K325">big banks have historically used to tamper the price of gold</a>? Bitcoin’s design characteristics largely shield it from the type of price manipulation that traditional assets like gold have historically experienced. Unlike gold, whose physical nature makes it hard to verify, assay, secure and transport — leading to dependency on futures contracts that can be manipulated — bitcoin exists on a transparent and immutable ledger. </p><p>Furthermore, Bitcoin's digital nature and decentralized structure enable virtually cost-free and near instant settlement of transactions, which allows for manipulation and price dislocations in the futures market to be settled with ease compared to gold, which is much more costly to store and transport. Hence, the type of price suppression seen in the gold market is fundamentally challenging to replicate in the bitcoin market.</p><h3>Conclusion: The Future Of Bitcoin ETFs And The Path Forward</h3><p>After all of the Bitcoin ETF conflict and regulatory debate over the years, it’s becoming clear that BlackRock is likely a leading candidate to advance some sort of new bitcoin investment vehicle in the United States. The SEC’s delay in clarity and regulation over the years, all but seems part of a broader plan to get the market’s dominant bitcoin ETF investment option into the hands of one of America’s largest traditional finance institutions. Although other ETFs may get approved, it’s likely a winner-takes-all market or an oligopoly in terms of initial flows, competition and size of AUM.</p><p>Based on the standard procedural timelines, the best guess is that an ETF approval is on the horizon for sometime in early 2024. It’s a timely move as it will coincide in the same year as Bitcoin’s next halving. Ideally, this is the perfect time for institutional investors to get exposure to bitcoin while also playing into a gold-like-mania narrative, to drive increased market interest right before Bitcoin’s planned supply issuance schedule gets cut in half.</p><p>Although helpful for price and boosting institutional demand and access, be wary of the second- and third-order effects of this ETF. Wide adoption of BlackRock’s ETF, complete with bitcoin IOUs, will offer more paper bitcoin variants to emerge. This could lead to a small cohort of institutions having a significant impact on overall price and market liquidity because of the large size of their financial flows. Other effects may include rehypothecation, determining “clean” versus “dirty” bitcoin and influence of new institutions on future hard-fork scenarios. </p><p>In summary, this type of investment vehicle is an inevitable path for an asset that is gaining institutional adoption at the same time as the market expands with many others demanding bitcoin exposure. BlackRock is free to purchase bitcoin like anyone else. Ultimately, it’s up to the market to decide and create better bitcoin custody solutions over time that can outcompete pseudo-bitcoin ETFs and IOU-like products.</p><hr><p><em>That concludes the excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine PRO. </em><a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/subscribe"><em>Subscribe now</em></a><em> to receive PRO articles directly in your inbox.</em></p><figure>

Since then, central banks around the world have started operating a <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1969-1976/nixon-shock">fiat-based monetary system</a> with floating exchange rates and no currency standards at all. <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL">The money supply has been rising steadily ever since</a>. This forced market participants to look for ways to invest their money to protect against this inflation and one of the most popular investment assets has been real estate. </p><p>In the past, people owned real estate for its utility value, which is characterized by the fact that you can live on it or use it for production. Nowadays, however, it serves the world as the primary asset to store value. <a href="https://businessday.ng/business-economy/article/two-reasons-real-estate-is-worlds-most-preferred-store-of-wealth/#:~:text=Over%2067%20percent%20of%20the">Around 67% of global wealth ($ 330T) is stored in real estate</a>.

    </figure><p>As a result, it is no longer possible for most people to afford their own home. In addition, regulation and inflation have made construction significantly more expensive, for example, due to the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-esg-requirements-disrupting-office-investment-market/">increased building requirements because of so-called “ESG” guidelines</a> and the <a href="https://www.builderonline.com/data-analysis/building-material-prices-increase-14-3-on-year-over-year-basis_c">increase in raw material prices</a>. Property owners pass this price increase onto tenants in the form of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/28/how-much-higher-rent-will-go-in-2023-according-to-experts.html">increased rents</a>.<br></p><h2>From Utility To Speculation</h2><p>Real estate has become a speculative investment object because it is used as a store of value,<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dont-tokenize-use-bitcoin"> </a>a former function of money that is no longer possible <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dont-tokenize-use-bitcoin">due to decades of monetary inflation that has decimated peoples' purchasing power</a>.</p><p>The exorbitant increase in housing costs is one of the biggest problems of the fiat-based financial system because it has created a multitude of secondary problems. When the number-one store of value in the world, real estate, becomes increasingly expensive, and thus inaccessible, people can no longer save and plan for the future. When house prices and rents become increasingly expensive while money loses purchasing power, people can no longer afford adequate housing, leading to a deterioration in living standards.</p><p>In addition, aside from being used to store value, real estate is the most commonly used form of collateral in the traditional banking system. It is frequently used by a borrower to secure the repayment of a loan to a lender. Banks lend to people and institutions that own real estate. This has created an exclusive financial system as real estate has become unaffordable. In an inflationary environment where money loses value over time, it is a problem if most cannot borrow because saving is not an efficient way to accumulate capital. Debt becomes necessary to be productive. </p><p>These developments, which can be observed worldwide, are among the main drivers of wealth inequality. </p><h2>From Speculation To Utility </h2><p>Real estate should be reduced to its utility value as a dwelling or place of production, rather than used as a store of value by proxy if we ever hope to solve the growing gap in wealth inequality. Since bitcoin is a nearly perfect store of value, it offers a straightforward solution to the housing crisis. </p><p>The properties associated with bitcoin make it an ideal store of value. The supply is finite. It is easily portable, divisible, durable, fungible, censorship-resistant and noncustodial. Real estate cannot compete with bitcoin as a store of value. Bitcoin is rarer, more liquid, easier to move, harder to confiscate and cheaper to maintain. You don’t have to worry about daily maintenance, rent or repairs. It is easily accessible and cheap to store. </p><p>You can buy any amount large or small. You can self-custody bitcoin. All you need to store it safely is a basic computer without internet access and a BIP39 key generator - or a $50 hardware wallet. </p><p>People can buy bitcoin to store value instead of doing so through a home or rental property. As a result, real estate prices will fall and allow people to afford buying a home for its utility value. </p><h2>Bitcoin Presents A Solution</h2><p>As explained in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jssradfVJ4&amp;t=8s">recent episode of “The Hard Money Show,”</a> real estate has become a store of value in a world where fiat currencies are losing power, with many negative implications for society. But Bitcoin presents a solution.</p><p>As Bitcoin adoption increases, the money that would otherwise be invested in real estate, and some that is already invested in real estate, will flow into bitcoin. As pointed out above, this will make housing affordable.</p><p>By functioning as an actual store of value, bitcoin will absorb the monetary premium that real estate has accumulated over the past decades due to the broken monetary system. Under a Bitcoin standard, housing will eventually collapse to its utility value. The easy access to Bitcoin will create a financial system that is far more accessible than it is today. </p><p>Unfortunately, this will not solve the problem of rising rents in the short term. This is a structural problem of the fiat system. Due to the ever-increasing supply of money, it loses purchasing power over time and prices rise. However, as our financial system adjusts to a Bitcoin standard, deflation will cause prices to fall. </p><p>It should also lead to a more decentralized and less regulatory form of governance, as governments increasingly become service providers. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Leon Wankum.

If you wanted to get the latest version of your computer's operating system (OS) or the newest version of Bitcoin Core, for example, you'd need to buy it physically at the store or have it mailed to you. You'd then load the disk or USB stick into your computer, and make a copy of the new software onto your local disk.</p><p>As a developer writing code, you'd have to physically hand out copies of your programs to friends and family. Or you'd work for a large corporation that had relationships with companies and computer stores, which would figure out how to get the software you wrote distributed to their clients and customers.</p><p>With the advent of always-connected computers, the landscape of software distribution forever changed. Now, instead of having to physically pick up a copy of the bits in a program, you can easily download a copy of it from the internet.</p><p>This made it much easier for new developers to write apps that anyone can download. The problem now, however, is answering the question: Where on the internet should users download the new software from?</p><h2>The Hacker's App Store</h2><p>The way that mobile phone ecosystems solve the problem of new application distribution is through a program on your phone called the "App Store" (or the "Google Play store" on Android). </p><p>Developers upload the latest copy of their apps to either Apple's or Google's servers. Those companies then send out a silent notification to all of the phones that have the app installed, and the app gets updated in the background on users' phones, without the users’ involvement.</p><p>If you're a user and you want to add a new app to your phone, in most cases you'll be able to find it in the App Store, and download it from there.</p><p>But not all software is available as a mobile phone app. Some software projects are desktop apps or tools that developers use to write new pieces of software. These applications need a distribution channel too. On desktop operating systems, we tend to call the "App Store" software by the term "package managers." They manage the packages of software that you download onto your computer.</p><p>Modern package managers consist of a central server, sometimes called a repository, that can keep track of the latest version of the app, and a client-side application which runs on the package user's computer. </p><p>If you're a developer, you've probably run into “homebrew” or “apt-get install” somewhere in your life. “Homebrew” and “apt” are package managers.</p><p>In the way package managers work, the client-side application will check in with the central repository occasionally to see if there's any new updates for any of the currently-installed packages. Or, if you have the right OS and the right permissions set, maybe your computer will automatically run these checks, download and install the latest version of an app.</p><p>(As an aside, you can add other sources of software packages to your local package-manager client. If a developer self hosts their apps instead of uploading them to the central repository, you'd need to add their self-hosted website to the list of places to look for updates in your own package-manager client app.)</p><h2>What If We Could Reproduce Everything? </h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/nixbitcoinorg?lang=en">Nix</a> is a package manager that aims to bring reproducible builds to all of the packages that it helps to distribute.</p><p>Nix solves the problems with software distribution by keeping detailed track of all of the inputs to a build, uniquely identifying every input and using the same ones as the original builder did. This ensures it's able to build the same thing every time and on any machine.</p><p>Nix hashes every input and output of a build; this makes it easy to identify when an input has changed. When the inputs to a build change, the outputs are guaranteed to also change. </p><p>One big problem with reproducible builds is that different users will have different versions of the inputs that a program needs to be built with. Every new program that you build on your machine might need a different version of its input in order to be reproducible. </p><p>Nix fixes this by keeping track of builds by hash lists, and only using inputs that match the list of hashes it expects. The tradeoff is that Nix uses a lot more disc space and can often take a bit longer to download, as it'll need to download the correct inputs to a binary build process if you don't have them on your computer already.</p><p>I like to joke that Nix was only made possible thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore's law</a>, which means that we now have enough extra disk space to not need to worry about having multiple copies of the same program, just in slightly different versions.</p><p>So, Nix makes it possible to distribute a reproducible build of your software much much more easily, which means that a user can reliably rebuild your software on their machine and have it just work, no questions asked.</p><p>As a small aside, note that what "reproducible" means for a Nix build is that "if a package works on one machine, it will also work on another." This isn't the same as the reproducibility that Bitcoin Core developers try to guarantee for official Bitcoin binaries, which <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-process.md#building">have a separate process</a> to check that they're bit-for-bit identical.</p><h2>Nix And Bitcoin</h2><p>Distributing open-source software in a way that's easy for end users to get running, and is reproducible on any system, is a very useful and important feature. It makes it easier for anyone to start using the project and also easier for new developers to start contributing back to the project.</p><p>A few years ago, a set of intrepid developers launched a repository of the most common Bitcoin software projects that are packaged up as Nix packages and modules.</p><p>Packages make it much easier for anyone using the Nix package manager to install and start running a Bitcoin node, on almost any architecture. You don't have to worry about installing the right dependencies before running the build commands, and the project will build from source on your own machine. It's pretty ideal in terms of quickly being able to download, build and run a Bitcoin node from scratch.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/fort-nix/nix-bitcoin">Nix-Bitcoin repository</a> provides Nix “modules,” which are configurations for software applications that are meant to work on <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>. The Nix-Bitcoin modules allow anyone who's running NixOS to reproduce a build of Bitcoin Core and other Bitcoin open-source projects, and quickly get them running on their machines with minimal fuss.</p><p>In an interview for this article, Jonas Nick, one of the <a href="https://github.com/fort-nix/nix-bitcoin/commits?author=jonasnick">lead maintainers of the Nix-Bitcoin project</a>, had the following to say about using the project:</p><p>"The main benefit that Nix-Bitcoin gets from Nix/NixOS is declarative config management. Configuring your system using the Nix programming language allows for abstraction, so you can modularize your logic to reuse and test individual components. This allows managing complexity, which inevitably occurs when building systems, and helps to build a correct and secure system. For example, a lot of the security features that Nix-Bitcoin provides would be very annoying to maintain if we didn't have the module system. Reproducibility in NixOS also helps a lot with updates, because we know exactly what is running on the systems of our users. Finally, with NixOS can also get errors at evaluation time instead of at runtime."</p><p>Bitcoin Core isn't the only project that's packaged up for distribution on Nix.</p><p>There's also Core Lightning, BTCPay Server and a number of other projects. For the most part, these projects are added and bundled up for distribution on Nix by fans of the Nix package-management system, not the developers who are writing the software. For a more complete list of available packages, check out the “modules” list in the <a href="https://github.com/fort-nix/nix-bitcoin#features">Nix-Bitcoin GitHub repository</a>.</p><h2>Why Not Nix Everywhere? </h2><p>If Nix is such a great change to the way that Bitcoin projects are built and shipped, why doesn't everyone use it? The truth is that Nix is a big project that's a bit difficult to get into. The learning curve for using Nix is quite steep, and the paradigm of running Nix as a package manager can be quite different than most are used to.</p><p>NixOS started as a research project by <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11773365">Eelco Dolstra in 2003</a>, and has slowly been building a following and user base since then. </p><h2>Bitcoin++ Berlin: Expanding The Use Of Nix In Bitcoin</h2><p>By organizing the upcoming <a href="https://btcpp.dev/berlin23">Bitcoin++ conference</a> in Berlin, we aim to change this. <a href="https://btcpp.dev/">Bitcoin++</a> is a developer-focused conference series which focuses on different topics in the Bitcoin developer space. Originally started in Austin, Texas, in 2022, the most recent conference in late April 2023 focused on Layer 2 technologies in Bitcoin, such as <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-ark-plans-to-scale-private-bitcoin-payments">Ark</a>, the Lightning Network</p><p>and validity rollups.</p><p>The upcoming Berlin conference, planned for October 6 and October 7, 2023, aims to be a “Nix-pilling” event for the Bitcoin developer ecosystem. The core maintainers of the Nix-Bitcoin project on Fort Nix will be in attendance (including Nick, Pavol Rusnak and Eric Sirion, to</p><p>name a few). The two-day event will be full of hands-on workshops and lectures</p><p>designed to teach developers from across the ecosystem about how to use Nix to package</p><p>their projects and better bundle their development dependencies so that new</p><p>contributors can start coding and contributing faster, as well as demonstrate how fast and easy it is to deploy software using modules on NixOS.</p><h2>Additional Article References</h2><ol><li><a href="https://blog.devgenius.io/reproducibility-with-nix-991ad466c92e">Reproducibility with Nix</a></li><li><a href="https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2020-07-26-nix-bitcoin/">Interview with “nixbitcoindev”</a></li><li><a href="https://nixos.org/learn.html">Where to start</a></li><li><a href="https://nickler.ninja/slides/2023-pizza.pdf">Why Nix-Bitcoin, for Bitcoiners</a></li></ol><p><em>This is a guest post by niftynei.

Then, <a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/what-are-ordinals-a-beginners-guide-to-bitcoin-nfts">a late 2021 privacy upgrade</a> had the unintended consequence of allowing data storage on the Bitcoin blockchain, resulting in <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/quantifying-bitcoin-inscriptions-ordinals">NFT-like inscriptions</a> and BRC-20 tokens, both applying <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/concerning-ordinals">Ordinal Theory</a> for asset tracking. </p><p>The popularity of NFT-like Ordinal inscriptions and the experimental BRC-20 token standard has <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges">driven up transaction costs</a> across the Bitcoin network. The frothy demand for “stamping” limited block space with new data pushed transaction costs so high that in May 2023, Binance twice <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/05/08/binance-pauses-bitcoin-withdrawals-for-the-second-time-in-24-hours/">had to pause BTC withdrawals</a>, a risky and undesirable step for a global exchange. To help manage the transaction costs, Binance <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/501886">announced it would start using the Lightning Network</a> — a decentralized, Layer 2 network designed for fast transactions bypassing the underlying Bitcoin blockchain— to process BTC withdrawals.</p><p>While some argue that Bitcoin should stick to being digital gold, I don’t see it that way. </p><p>As a store of value, bitcoin will continue to provide a trustless alternative to central banking; other uses of its immutable blockchain don’t diminish this function. On the contrary, emergent uses of the Bitcoin blockchain will drive more efficient use of the limited block space, leading to broad adoption of Lightning Network as a scaling solution for bitcoin as a global currency. The Lightning Network’s growth will provide a trustless alternative to centralized payment processors, expanding Bitcoin’s utility.</p><h2>Challenges Faced By BRC-20 Tokens</h2><p>The BRC-20 token standard is extremely new — <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-a-brc-20-token-standard-an-overview">created in March 2023</a>. If its name sounds familiar, that’s because it’s somewhat akin to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-erc20-and-what-does-it-mean-ethereum/">ERC-20 tokens</a> such as Shiba Inu and MakerDAO that run atop the Ethereum network. Whereas Bitcoin has traditionally been about storing and transmitting value, BRC-20s allow for other assets to be “minted” in an Ordinal inscription. Now, a slew of BRC-20s have popped up for trading and speculation, many in the form of meme tokens, from <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/piza-brc-20/">PIZA</a> to <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/meme-brc20/">MEME</a>. As of June 26, 2023, the market cap for BRC-20 tokens was over $260 million, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/brc-20">according to CoinGecko</a>. </p><p>But all of this minting is driving bitcoin transaction costs higher. That’s not necessarily bad for bitcoin miners, who earn BTC by processing transactions. CoinDesk <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/08/ordinals-upend-bitcoin-mining-pushing-transaction-fees-above-mining-reward-for-first-time-in-years/">reported</a> in early May 2023 that some BTC miners were earning more by collecting transaction fees than they were by creating new BTC. That’s quite a lot, considering each block reward currently nets miners 6.25 BTC (worth roughly $188,000 at the time of writing).</p><p>As for whether this is good for users, that’s debatable. The average bitcoin transaction fee recently hit a two-year high, <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee">peaking at $30.91</a> on May 8, 2023, despite a bear market; those abstaining from BRC-20s are likely grumbling about increased fees. On the other hand, the introduction of the BRC-20 token standard has inspired deeper conversations about network scaling for Bitcoin.</p><h2>Already Making An Impact</h2><p>At the moment, BRC-20s lack some of the utility of their ERC-20 cousins. They don’t, for instance, use smart contracts, and their utility is mostly the same as <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-pfp-nfts/">PFP NFTs</a>, leading many to argue they’re not worth the cost.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether the demand for Bitcoin-based tokens is sustainable or whether such activity will get redirected to other, more permissive or centralized networks. </p><p>In one scenario, higher fees could force Bitcoin’s traditional users away from the network. This is unlikely. Bitcoin’s unchanging and conservative monetary policy remains the primary attraction; the network has no real competition in this regard as a hedge to monetary debasement.</p><p>But assuming Ordinal inscriptions and BRC-20 tokens show the same staying power as memecoins and NFTs on other networks — Shiba Inu, remember, has a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/">market cap of $5 billion</a> and Bored Apes are virtually a household name — they will keep driving transaction fees above their historical average.</p><p>This could have long-term impacts on Bitcoin users.</p><p>In particular, higher transaction costs create a demand for more efficient transactions. While some of this can be done at a protocol level (e.g., <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-segwit">SegWit</a>, the contentious 2017 upgrade to Bitcoin that enabled leaner transaction sizes by separating the signature data from the transaction data), much of it can come from scaling technologies on a second layer. </p><p>Enter: the Lightning Network, which batches transactions via long-term smart contracts and uses Bitcoin’s underlying security to allow fast and cheap payments.</p><h2>Future Solutions</h2><p>Lightning Network fees are extremely modest compared to on-chain counterparts. While the fees do fluctuate, the overall network fees have not increased as a result of BRC-20s or inscriptions. The network currently charges fees to reward network node operators. According to data available via Amboss’ Bitcoin Lightning Network analytics platform, the <a href="https://amboss.space/stats?params=eyJtZXRyaWMiOiJmZWVfcmF0ZV9tZXRyaWNzIiwiY2F0ZWdvcnkiOiJuZXR3b3JrTWV0cmljcyIsInN1Ym1ldHJpYyI6Im1lZGlhbiIsInRpbWVFbnVtIjoiMXkiLCJzY2FsZUVudW0iOiJBYnNvbHV0ZSJ9">median fee remains 0.002%</a>. Compare that to traditional payment networks, which charge <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/credit-card-processing-fees/">2% to 3%</a> of the payment amount every time you swipe your credit card.</p><p>The Bitcoin community is currently subsidizing the creation of the payment network, driving Lightning fees extremely low. Even with increased demand over time, sustainable fee rates for Lightning should grow to around 0.03%, based on less generous operator behavior.</p><h2>Primed To Become The Default Global Payments Processor</h2><p>The combination of Bitcoin monetary policy and Lightning’s transaction network is a potent one.

I've visited 45 countries, lived in nine and covered all continents except Antarctica.</p><p>After years of globetrotting, I thought that part of my life would have been over by now. But just when I began to feel the desire to settle down and set roots, something happened: I discovered Bitcoin. My life, then, was radically changed. Not only has it transformed my worldview, but it's also reignited a fire in me to keep moving and seek out people who have gone through the same awakening. </p><p>Combining my passions for adventure and hard money, I've recently begun to focus on visiting emerging Bitcoin circular economies across the globe. From helping me save time and money to making me feel more protected and connected with the people I meet along the way, using Bitcoin has been a game changer for my travel experiences. </p><p>In this piece, I discuss how Bitcoin has helped me fix common money issues known to travelers everywhere and how it's made my journeys more special in multiple ways. </p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Bitcoin Helps Travelers Save Time</h2><p>If I had a sat for every time I've had to deal with payment-related issues in a foreign country, I'd have a big enough stack to make Michael Saylor jealous. Whether it was finding a currency exchange with decent rates, looking for a store that accepted my cards or calling my bank to resolve credit card issues, I've wasted so much precious time on these problems that just thinking about them frustrates me.</p><p>In a few scenarios, it's even resulted in the disruption of my itinerary and a significant dose of anxiety, as when it happened during a trip to a remote island in the Philippines in 2015. Though I had a great time, it wasn't long before I found myself running out of cash, with no ATMs and no currency exchange offices in the area. Ultimately, I was saved by the only Western Union office in town — when it finally opened two days after my crisis began.</p><p>Had the locals and I known about Bitcoin then, my journey would have gone as planned, and my stress levels would have remained stable the entire time. </p><p>Fast forward eight years, and I returned to the Philippines, but this time, my experience with money matters was much better. Why? Because I chose the island of Boracay, <a href="https://thechainsaw.com/business/bitcoin-island-boracay-philippines/#:~:text=Not%20only%20can%20tourists%20pay,local%20currency%2C%20the%20Philippine%20Peso.">also known as “Bitcoin Island,”</a>&nbsp;as my destination. </p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4OTg3NDc1NTAxMTk3MjY4/paying-with-bitcoin.png" height="371" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>Thanks to the many merchants now accepting Philippine pesos via the Bitcoin Lightning Network rail, I was able to deal with all payments digitally. This prevented me from wasting time dealing with cash, ATMs and currency exchange offices and allowed me to do more of what I wanted to do: enjoy the island. </p><p>Bitcoin has helped me save time. </p><h2>Bitcoin Helps Travelers Save Money</h2><p>As a backpacker, I was always very conscious of my budget. Street food, hostels and overnight bus rides were my bread and butter, but one thing I could never avoid was those unwanted and often unexpected expenses that come with the territory. </p><p>Think of credit card fees, which, in Guatemala, <a href="https://www.frommers.com/destinations/guatemala/planning-a-trip/money">can cost up to 10%</a>, and ATM fees which, in Thailand, <a href="https://www.thethailandlife.com/atm-thailand#:~:text=Withdrawal%20fees&amp;text=The%20large%20majority%20of%20banks,per%20transaction%20(approximately%20%244.50).">can amount to $6 per withdrawal</a> for foreign bank cards plus your bank fees. Even currency exchange rates are costly, as I have found that they generally charge 10% for their services. These small numbers may not seem like much, but they add up quickly, which means a lot for someone traveling on a budget.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4OTg3NDc1NTAxNTI0OTQ4/bitcoin-accepted-here.png" height="371" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>But that has never been an issue when visiting Bitcoin communities. That's because the only fees involved in bitcoin payments are transaction costs, which are often negligible or non-existent. And I've also enjoyed the benefits beyond these hotspots, as many businesses nowadays offer a discount if you pay in bitcoin. If you've ever bought tickets to a Bitcoin conference, you might know what I'm talking about. </p><p>Bitcoin has helped me save money. </p><h2>Bitcoin Enhances Travelers’ Safety</h2><p>Whenever I share tales of my solo adventures, the topic of safety always comes up. While street smarts and wise decisions have helped me avoid real danger, I've had to deal with a different kind of unpleasantness multiple times: fraud. </p><p>In Vietnam, I got scammed by a taxi driver with fake Vietnamese dong notes. In Bali, my travel card was cloned, and I only found out when the culprits tried to withdraw money in the middle of the night. To this day, I have no idea how they did it. And I've lost track of how many times I felt my heart racing while using an ATM in a questionable location or at odd hours of the day or night and walking away with three days’ worth of cash in my bag.</p><p>Navigating exclusively on Bitcoin eliminates all of those concerns for me. And it makes perfect sense. When you're not dealing with cash, ATMs or credit cards, your risks are minimized, and your peace of mind is maximized. </p><p>My only goal is keeping my phone safe, though even if I lose it, I can still access my funds by recovering my wallet on a new device. That's why it's important to back up your seed phrase, people!</p><p>Bitcoin has enhanced my safety.</p><h2>Bitcoin Makes Traveling More Meaningful</h2><p>Poverty, weakening currencies and countless unbanked individuals are some of the biggest afflictions that developing countries face today. Call it selfish or exaggerated, but paying locals for their goods and services in bitcoin feels more rewarding than giving them pieces of paper that are guaranteed to lose value.</p><p>During a visit to Bitcoin Lake in Guatemala, for instance, it was wonderful to see how many merchants in the local market accepted bitcoin. It allowed them to attract more customers, make more sales and prompted more conversations about the significant changes they've gone through since using bitcoin as money.</p><p>Being able to pay hard-working people in Bitcoin feels more authentic and makes for a more memorable exchange and bonding experience. It renders tourism more meaningful and worth all the time and effort that goes into planning a trip to these unique places around the world. </p><p>Bitcoin has made my travels more meaningful.</p><p>Needless to say, my travel experience hasn't been the same since I discovered Bitcoin. Understanding money and its profound effects on every aspect of our lives has significantly changed the way I look at the world and walk through life everywhere I go. </p><p>As an avid wanderer, I want to see more places embrace Bitcoin in the future. It will help empower the communities, boost the economies and attract the attention of Bitcoiners like myself, who will want to encourage and support them in any way they can. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by HodlingCarla.

In the realm of Bitcoin heresy, before you prepare to hang me from the gallows for that statement, permit me to express my final thoughts. Allow me to provide a brief introduction — I am not a galaxy-brained, shadowy super coder. I must admit to my relative ignorance in the fields of computer science and cryptography. I do not work within the Bitcoin industry. Instead, I am an ordinary pleb, toiling away in construction to make ends meet, striving to maintain humility and gain a comprehensive understanding of the true nature of Bitcoin. So, why do I say that Bitcoin must change?</p><p>Let us commence by reflecting upon the adage, "Not your keys, not your coins," which resounds as one of the loudest mantras in the Bitcoin community, and rightfully so. When your private keys are held by a centralized exchange or custodian on your behalf, you effectively surrender control over your funds. This situation introduces counterparty risk, as you become reliant on the security practices and integrity of the third party entrusted with your keys.</p><p>The philosophy underlying "not your keys, not your coins" aligns with the broader principles of decentralization and censorship resistance. These principles seek to empower individuals with financial sovereignty and eliminate the necessity for intermediaries. It underscores the significance of personal responsibility, security and self-reliance in this digital era where governments increasingly employ technology as a tool for controlling individuals.</p><p>Now, you may ask, what is the issue at hand? Well, the truth of the matter is that, under the current implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, self custody does not scale. Many Bitcoin enthusiasts choose not to critically analyze this reality. However, we cannot ignore the consequences of ignoring reality. </p><p>Recently, the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges">BRC-20 minting issue</a> thrust this challenge into the spotlight within the community. The event triggered an explosion in the base layer fee market, resulting in exorbitant costs to confirm transactions. Regardless of your opinion on BRC-20, the incident provided us with a glimpse of the future if the network continues to expand. Try to envision, in all honesty, the exacerbation of this situation with 8 billion users. As activist Anita Posch pointed out <a href="https://twitter.com/AnitaPosch/status/1655459803957739520?t=vheLiKcJZV5pMnemaWokrA&amp;s=09">in this tweet</a>, custodial solutions would become the only means of onboarding new network participants. While there are <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/fedimint-adds-new-bitcoin-custody-solutions">federated protocols aiming to disintermediate custodial risk by spreading it among multiple custodians</a>, this solution remains fundamentally different from self custody.</p><p>Recently, human rights activist Alex Gladstein <a href="https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1662128272975745024?t=41V9ClnVRMa7f2s7S3WTvQ&amp;s=09">posed a thought experiment focused on this issue</a>:</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1662128272975745024"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>To my dismay, over 54% of respondents to his scenario deemed it a success. This sentiment is perilous, as such a scenario undermines Bitcoin's ethos of self sovereignty and censorship resistance. It may not come as a surprise, though; this poll may indicate that more people prioritize "number go up (NGU)" over individual liberty.</p><p>Whenever the scaling issue arises, a common response is to invoke the notion that Bitcoin scales in layers, and that the base layer can ossify while additional layers facilitate the onboarding of the global population. However, <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_trollz/status/1663640665056485376?t=4W29G5__Hr04xZ93lFFlWQ&amp;s=09">as Shinobi reminds us</a>, "Layer two is not a magic incantation. For layer twos to optimize and improve, new functionality on the base layer is required. Layer twos are literally just things built on the functionality of layer one. The limitations of layer two are a direct result of layer one limits."</p><p>Accepting this reality can be daunting, especially for individuals like myself who are not computer science majors or cryptographers. We adore Bitcoin, and the prospect of change can be intimidating because we are unaware of what we don't know. There is a non-zero possibility that any alteration could lead to Bitcoin's failure. Consequently, many of us stubbornly dig our heels into the sand and advocate for the ossification of the base layer to ensure, in our minds, that Bitcoin remains intact.</p><p>If you, like me, believe that "not your keys, not your coins" should be an option for all participants in the network, present and future, we must embrace Bitcoin's malleability before it is too late. In the <a href="https://twitter.com/lopp/status/1622593393036611585?t=0vUtwlo7p7hbnCQ-MteRpw&amp;s=09">words of Jameson Lopp</a>:</p><blockquote><p>"Bitcoin is sound money. But it's not just digital gold. Bitcoin is programmable money. Unlike gold, it is a technology that can be upgraded. We need not throw that property out the window. There is still much about Bitcoin that can be improved without violating its soundness... The nature of how network protocols ossify means that the changes necessarily must happen earlier rather than later; it becomes impossible to coordinate changes once a protocol is adopted at a mainstream level.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>And to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/should-we-be-worried-about-bitcoin-ossification/?sh=73256e762b6a&amp;s=09">quote Lopp once again</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Ossification is a side effect of growth, not an explicit decision unto itself. There is no way to really know when we’ve gone too far until newly proposed changes simply cease to gain any traction. Now, the real problems of ossification become clear: once we cross an invisible line in the future, Bitcoin will be ‘set’ as it is, with no more updates practically possible.</p><p>“Before this happens, developers and users need to think about what Bitcoin’s ultimate code base should look like. We can see from past debates surrounding things like the SegWit fork that bitcoiners are both divided and passionate about many issues, and there’s almost certainly no answer to this question that everyone will agree on. This is, of course, part of the problem driving ossification in the first place.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Only time will reveal whether we have already crossed that invisible line of base-layer ossification. However, until that day arrives, it is crucial for all users who cherish Bitcoin for its properties of self sovereignty and censorship resistance, as well as its potential to truly separate money from the state, to embrace changes with an open mind. Engage in the various discussions within the developer community. Implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity">principle of charity</a> in your observations and discussions. Personally, as an attendee of <a href="https://twitter.com/chibitdevs?lang=en">ChiBitDevs</a>, I can attest that those in the developer community are extremely welcoming and enjoy assisting non-technical users in grasping complex engineering matters that reside at the forefront of development.</p><p>Let me leave you with <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_trollz/status/1663221188506664962?t=jt9zOHh3awEPr4iVztUfCQ&amp;s=09">one final quote from Shinobi</a> to contemplate: "What if the spooks (government) want you vehemently against any further changes to Bitcoin so that our only viable long-term scaling options are banks they can try and regulate and capture?" </p><p>Tick tock, next block.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Michael Matulef.

Fiat food, fiat jobs… and fiat athletes. In this article, I introduce ideas about what it means to be a Bitcoin athlete — an archetype that I seek to embody in my professional pickleball career and a template for the 21st century professional athlete. </p><h2>Fiat Athletes Vs. Bitcoin Athletes</h2><p>Fiat athletes compete to earn fiat money. They store their time and energy (aka, their wealth) in manipulated money that steals from them, they trust companies not to censor them and they often live high time preference lifestyles. </p><p>Bitcoin athletes are a new breed of elite, professional athletes. Bitcoin athletes store their wealth in sound money that protects them from theft, they leverage decentralized protocols like Nostr to create uncensorable, peer-to-peer relationships with their fans, they embody Bitcoin values and they live a low time preference lifestyle. </p><p>Fiat athletes build digital identities on platforms created by companies that have the ability to censor what they say and that divide them from their fans. Bitcoin athletes build digital identities on open-source protocols that can’t censor what they say. These protocols enable Bitcoin athletes to connect directly with their fans. </p><p>Fiat athletes trust banks to hold their money and leak energy with every exchange between fiat currencies when traveling to different countries. Bitcoin athletes hold their own money and conserve energy by using global money when traveling to compete. </p><p>Fiat athletes trust politicians to maintain monetary integrity. Bitcoin athletes run nodes and verify that the monetary policy of Bitcoin is enforcing a 21 million supply cap. </p><p>Fiat athletes live fiat lifestyles and propagate fiat values to their fans. Bitcoin athletes live Bitcoin lifestyles and propagate the values of the Bitcoin protocol to their fans — the values of truth, freedom and personal responsibility. </p><p>Fiat athletes live at the mercy of banks and politicians who control their money and the companies who control their financial sponsorship. Bitcoin athletes are sovereign and without masters. Their money is governed by mathematics and they are directly supported by their fans, who zap them sats at the speed of light. </p><p>Fiat athletes are motivated by fame and fiat riches. Bitcoin athletes are motivated by the mission to spread financial literacy to 8 billion people on earth and unlock unprecedented peace and human flourishing. Bitcoin athletes play for a purpose beyond money. They’re playing to save the money. </p><p>Fiat athletes use centralized money, centralized social media and centralized sponsorship models. They have relationships with intermediaries (banks, platforms and companies) that have the power to censor or control them if they don’t tow the line. Bitcoin athletes use decentralized money, decentralized social media and decentralized sponsorship models. They use protocols in order to restore direct relationships with their fans and reduce (or eliminate) their reliance on banks, platforms and companies. </p><h2>Winning With Bitcoin</h2><p>I believe a Bitcoin world will forge Bitcoin athletes, this new type of professional athlete who is financially energized directly by their fans, lives in alignment with values of the Bitcoin protocol and uses their influence to improve financial literacy and fix the money. The elite athlete of the 21st century will build their career on Bitcoin and be powered by the Lightning Network. </p><p>As a professional pickleball player, I’m on a mission to demonstrate this new template myself. I seek to master my sport by testing myself against the best pickleball players in the world and I play for Bitcoin. </p><p>Part of my mission as a Bitcoin athlete is to help fiat athletes make the jump over to a Bitcoin world, to help them understand Bitcoin and secure their bits of information in cyberspace (property, identity, data, etc.) with encrypted energy. That process often begins with me sending them 21 sats after a game so they can experience the magic of Bitcoin firsthand and then helping them set up a Nostr account so that fans can directly support them financially. </p><p>I believe the professional athletes of the 21st century will be powered by Bitcoin. They will connect directly with their fans with zaps and will store their life energy in scarce, digital, encrypted money. They will run nodes, share proof of work and connect with fans on Nostr. They will be uncensorable, unstoppable and sovereign in their quest to financially support their careers. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Obiwan Satoshi.

The VLS solution, an open-source Rust library and reference implementation, separates a user's private keys from their Lightning node, providing an extra layer of protection against potential compromises and theft of funds. According to the announcement, VLS offers a level of security unmatched by other solutions in the ecosystem.</p><p>"We're thrilled to announce the VLS beta release, a major step forward for Lightning network security, and we're excited to share it with developers and companies in the Bitcoin ecosystem," stated the VLS team. They encouraged developers and companies to try out the VLS Beta release, participate in the feedback process and test the software with sample CLN or LDK nodes to help enhance the security of the Bitcoin Lightning Network.</p><p>The VLS beta release introduces various features designed to safeguard against malicious nodes and enhance user protection. These features include working with CLN and LDK, encrypted cloud state backup, disaster recovery capabilities, a complete set of Layer 2 and Layer 1 validation rules, heartbeat generation and an allowlist for approved destinations. However, it's important to note that while VLS is secure against common ways of stealing user funds, it may not cover all possible scenarios of fund loss. Therefore, the team advises running VLS in testnet or with limited funds until the production release.</p><p>VLS provides a unique approach to Lightning Network security by sequestering private keys and secrets in hardened policy signing devices. The reference implementation in Rust ensures that proposed transactions are safe to sign by applying a comprehensive set of validation rules. By incorporating UTXO Set Oracles to provide proofs of unspent UTXOs, VLS offers additional protection even in the case of a complete compromise of the node software.</p><p>Looking ahead, the VLS roadmap includes plans to run signers on platforms with limited resources, improve performance for embedded processors, and add features such as extended BOLT-12 support and VSS integration.

Then they apply a cryptographic hash function of the previous block's header to the new block. Finally, they try to solve the proof-of-work problem. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/who-created-bitcoin">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> adopted a proof-of-work (PoW) <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-nakamoto-consensus-bitcoin">consensus mechanism</a> to resolve the Byzantine Generals' Problem, establishing a transparent and objective protocol.</p><h2>What Is Proof Of Work (PoW)?</h2><p>Proof of work is literally proof that work has been done to validate the network’s transactions and generate new bitcoin. It is the consensus mechanism and algorithm that uses computing power to verify transactions and add them to the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-bitcoin">Bitcoin blockchain</a>. Such a mechanism allows the Bitcoin network to be trusted and remain decentralized. </p><p>PoW resolves the Byzantine generals' problems, which may fail a distributed computer system for different reasons, not only of malicious nature, but perhaps a software defect, a hardware malfunction, or a well-coordinated attack by a bad actor. They can all be difficulties that prevent nodes from reaching consensus on distributed networks. </p><p>The Byzantine Generals’ Problem is only common to decentralized systems, where it’s more difficult to come to an agreement. </p><p>Bitcoin resolves the Byzantine Generals’ Problem by providing a way to communicate and transfer value safely without the need to trust one another through a network of nodes that agree on the truth before it is timestamped. Once one node has recorded a transaction, a copy is propagated to all other nodes in the network. PoW was created to achieve this objective. </p><h3>Why Is Proof Of Work Important?</h3><p>Proof of work is often misunderstood or underestimated, as many consider it a wasted effort on a poor system design; they claim that entering a transaction on any other digital ledger could be made instantly and with no effort. This is why proof of work is necessary for the ledger’s security and how it prevents any one party from compromising it. The effort is not wasted however, if it empowers a network to be an alternative to the current monetary system and its various flaws.</p><p>The significance of proof of work lies in its ability to serve as a tangible expense for generating bitcoin and safeguarding its credibility. It would be exorbitant to execute a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network with the intention of creating counterfeit coins or carrying out deceitful Bitcoin transactions. If any entity tries to compromise the Bitcoin network, it would have to redo all previous proof of work quickly enough to outpace the network's continuous proof of work. For this reason, Bitcoin has <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/">unforgeable costliness</a> characteristics and is immutable since it is nearly impossible to change confirmed transactions.</p><p>To maintain stability in the proof-of-work system, Nakamoto implemented a simple yet genius solution referred to as the difficulty adjustment algorithm, which regulates the difficulty level of discovering a new block every 10 minutes. This is crucial to prevent the discovery of new blocks from happening too quickly as more miners join the network. It also ensures that the mining process does not become too slow if the mining activity drops. </p><h3>Proof Of Work Versus Proof Of Stake</h3><p>We’ve seen how <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-why-bitcoin-wont-change">PoW is a good use of energy</a> to secure Bitcoin while forcing everyone to adhere to the same fixed rules, including the interdiction to issue more bitcoin to increase the supply.</p><p>The security difference between the two consensus mechanisms holds great importance. Proof of work requires energy consumption to ensure that Bitcoin maintains its position as the most secure network worldwide, whereas proof of stake (PoS) does not resolve the problem of possible interference from malicious entities. Instead, PoS sacrifices security for scalability, making it a faster blockchain, albeit one that cannot be trusted. Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus mechanism is expensive, and motivates participants to only publish truthful information. </p><p><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/proof-of-stake">Proof of stake</a> is the consensus mechanism for most altcoins, digital penny stocks, and other Ponzi schemes marketed as alternatives to bitcoin. Its consensus mechanism works through “staking,” which requires investors to lock the chosen protocol’s tokens into the system so that the token cannot be spent. However, the higher the number of tokens staked, the higher the chance of validating a block of transactions. </p><p>Considering that most altcoin tokens are issued to insiders and developers before they became publicly available, it’s easy to figure out how poorly decentralization is designed in proof-of-stake networks.</p><p>The primary differences between the two mechanisms are highlighted here:</p><h4>Proof Of Work</h4><ul><li>Validation is performed by a network of miners</li><li>Competitive nature uses lots of energy and computational power to determine the probability of finding a new block</li><li>Proof of work has a real-world physical cost to production, which insulates the network from attack</li><li>There is an economic and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-is-a-net-benefit-to-the-environment">environmental advantage to proof of work</a></li></ul><h4>Proof Of Stake</h4><ul><li>Validation is done by participants who offer their tokens as collateral</li><li>Less energy is used, but the amount of stake or number of coins determines the probability of validating a new block</li><li>Proof of stake has no real-world cost of production, which leaves the network vulnerable to attack</li><li>There is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-not-proof-of-stake-solves-energy">no environmental advantage to proof of stake</a></li></ul><p>In proof of stake, it’s easy to acquire a 51% stake and then change the rules of the protocol to one’s benefit, and relatively straightforward to censor network participation and activity, such as declining a person or entity's transactions by not including them.</p><h2>How Proof Of Work Works</h2><p>Proof of work was previously achievable using central processing units (CPUs) and graphic processing units (GPUs). However, due to the vast amount of electricity required, it can now only be performed using specialized computers operated by miners, known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).These serve to input transaction data, information from the previous block header, and a nonce (random number) to guess the result of hash functions. </p><p>Hash functions are mathematical functions. In Bitcoin, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-mining-protects-the-bitcoin-network">SHA-256 is the hash function algorithm</a> that transforms your input data — anything that can be represented in ones and zeros — into the output, a string of 64 characters, which will be unique and perfectly correlated to the input data.</p><p>From how it works, it is impossible to figure out a resulting output from a publicly visible input other than through expensive ASIC-generated rapid guessing. </p><p>On the other hand, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-mining">miners want to optimize their work</a>. To be profitable, they must increase the number of hashes (or guesses) per second that their devices can produce while using the cheapest and most reliable energy source.</p><p>Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment makes mining an even more competitive industry.<em> </em>In simple terms, proof of work is similar to buying lottery tickets with a prize draw every 10 minutes. The more tickets you buy, the greater the statistical likelihood of winning the lottery. In ASIC terms, a Bitmain Antminer S19j Pro can operate at 104TH/s, which basically means 104 trillion guesses, or tickets, per second.</p><p>Due to the increased competition, it's become harder for individual or solo miners to mine bitcoin since 2012, when ASICs became necessary. Yet, they can now join a mining pool to increase their chances of getting rewarded with bitcoin, though the funds would be split among the pool members. </p><h2>Advantages And Disadvantages</h2><p>Proof of work is necessary to keep Bitcoin secure, immutable, and always decentralized. Here are the primary benefits and drawbacks of Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism.</p><h3>Advantages </h3><ul><li>Decentralization, i.e., the real breakthrough of the technology</li><li>Censorship resistant, as a result of decentralization</li><li>Immutability, the blockchain is nearly impossible to reverse</li><li>It’s a fair and objective system based on robust protocol rules and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoins-rules-are-enforced-by-physics">laws of physics</a></li><li>High level of security: PoW economically incentivizes miners to protect the network</li><li>Carbon and methane capture: Bitcoin exploits wasted energy to issue more coins and verify transactions</li><li>By monetizing energy, PoW speeds up the rollout of renewable energy networks, and also improves load balancing on existing grids, making them more efficient and secure</li></ul><h3>Disadvantages</h3><ul><li>Slower transaction speeds</li><li>Mining expenses (OPEX &amp; CAPEX) are very high but necessary for proof of work</li><li>PoW consumes a lot of energy, but this has been <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-is-a-net-benefit-to-the-environment">proven to encourage</a> innovation in renewables and wasted energy exploitation</li></ul><h2>Criticism Of Proof Of Work</h2><p>Criticism of Bitcoin's energy consumption is common. Since Bitcoin requires a substantial amount of energy to protect the network, proof of work is an easy attack vector by those whose interests are more aligned with the pre-existing fiat financial system. </p><p>However, the widespread narrative fails to acknowledge that Bitcoin is, in reality, driving innovation in the technology that generates clean energy and exploits wasted energy.</p><p>How? Bitcoin miners need to find the most cost-effective energy sources to be profitable. As a result, affordable energy for Bitcoin mining is increasingly coming from renewables, as well as from wasted and "stranded" energy sources, rather than relying on fossil fuels.</p><h3>Renewables</h3><p>Since renewables — primarily wind and solar — are among the cheapest energy sources, Bitcoin miners are incentivized to subsidize their innovation, to the benefit of everyone.</p><p>Many misunderstand that energy consumption doesn’t directly produce carbon dioxide emissions, but the source may. The effect on carbon emission comes from energy production, not consumption. </p><h3>Wasted Energy</h3><p>Flared natural gas is an example of wasted energy: To avoid the high costs of transporting natural gas from remote locations, oil companies that produce it are recommended to either release the gas into the atmosphere or literally “flare” it to limit environmental impact. However, flaring it safely also has a cost, and if gas drillers could use a gas generator to power Bitcoin miners, that wasted energy is turned into good usage — producing bitcoin!</p><h3>Stranded Energy</h3><p>As Bitcoin mining operations can be located anywhere in the world, they are increasingly attracted to “stranded” energy, which is often too remote for populated areas, like ocean currents or desert sun. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/profiting-on-biogas-with-bitcoin-mining">Biogas is another such option</a>, which produces reliable energy, but is oftentimes not connected to the grid. </p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p>How is the difficulty level of the proof-of-work problem determined?</p><p>Depending on how many hashes per second are mining on the network, the hash function’s complexity will increase or decrease accordingly so that it takes miners an average of 10 minutes to find a new block across the global network.</p><p>Can brute force solve the proof-of-work problem?</p><p>The only way to resolve the proof-of-work problem is through brute force, a general problem-solving technique, and an algorithmic paradigm that searches all the possible solutions to a given problem before finding the most satisfactory one.</p><p>What happens to proof of work when all the bitcoin has been mined?</p><p>When all the bitcoin has been mined, proof of work will still be needed for validating transactions, for which miners will receive a fee.</p><p>Are there any viable alternatives to proof of work?</p><p>To produce a decentralized, immutable, censorship-resistant, secure cryptocurrency like bitcoin, there is no secure alternative to proof of work.</p><p>What happens if two miners solve the proof of work problem for the same block simultaneously?</p><p>The block that appears in the longest chain will be chosen, which is the one that has the “greatest combined difficulty” of the hashes used and took the most computational power to create it. </p><h2>The Final Word </h2><p>Purposely misleading politicians and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/greenpeace-intensifies-campaign-against-bitcoin-after-ethereum-merge">organizations</a> have an advantage in criticizing Bitcoin’s proof of work and financing projects to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/white-house-condemns-energy-use-of-mining-bitcoin">discredit Bitcoin</a> for its energy consumption. The advantage is to keep the current system as it is, beneficial to them, under the disguise that Bitcoin is wrong and harmful to humanity and the Earth.</p><p>Bitcoin is disruptive; it’s the hope humanity needs and must be discovered and understood to be fully appreciated. Proof of work is necessary to empower the transition to a new monetary system and a different world, and the effort required to produce it makes it even more worthy.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk5MDMyNTU3MDg4NTQ4NjI1/proof-of-work-feature-image-w_text.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sabre56 Partners With Arkon Energy For Ohio Data Center Consultancy Deal]]></title><description><![CDATA[Leading hosting provider Sabre56 deepens its strategic partnership with Arkon Energy, consulting on their new Ohio data center acquisition.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sabre56-partners-with-arkon-energy-for-ohio-data-center-consultancy-deal</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sabre56-partners-with-arkon-energy-for-ohio-data-center-consultancy-deal</guid><category><![CDATA[Data Center]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2023 14:36:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzNTEyMTIxODA2MzY2MTQ3/bitcoin-code.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="https://www.sabre56.com/">Sabre56</a>, a leading hosting provider and Bitcoin and digital asset mining consultancy, has signed a consultancy deal with <a href="https://www.arkonenergy.com/">Arkon Energy</a> for the management of Arkon's recently acquired data center in Hannibal, Ohio.

In a recent hearing at the Senate Banking Committee, she cited <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/chinese-businesses-fueling-the-fentanyl-epidemic-receive-millions-in-cryptocurrency-payments">a report</a> from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, indicating that digital currencies, particularly bitcoin, are being used to fund the fentanyl trade in China. But this is a clear obfuscation of the facts and a willful disregard for concepts in logic. </p><p>Let's put this into perspective: Any technology can be used for good or ill but we do have a responsibility to address and mitigate any potential misuse. The proportion of illicit transactions in digital assets is actually quite small compared to the overall transaction volumes. </p><p><a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">According to Chainalysis</a>, illicit transactions made up only 0.15% of all cryptocurrency transactions in 2021, down from 0.62% in 2020. In comparison, <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/overview.html">according to the UN</a>, it is estimated that annual money laundering amounts to 2% to 5% of global GDP. Furthermore, the Chainalysis report argues that the transparency of blockchain technology allows for better analysis and tracking of illicit activity compared to traditional financial systems. </p><p>So, while we should certainly aim to reduce the amount of illicit activity being fueled by cryptocurrencies, it's crucial to remember that illicit activities are not unique to cryptocurrencies. Consider this quote written <a href="https://cryptoforinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/An-Analysis-of-Bitcoins-Use-in-Illicit-Finance-By-Michael-Morell.pdf">in a report by former CIA Acting Director Michael Morell</a>: </p><p>“The broad generalizations about the use of Bitcoin in illicit finance are significantly overstated. The blockchain ledger on which Bitcoin transactions are recorded is an underutilized forensic tool that can be used more widely by law enforcement and the intelligence community to identify and disrupt illicit activities. Put simply, blockchain analysis is a highly effective crime fighting and intelligence gathering tool.” </p><p>We respect Senator Warren’s office and her commitment to public safety, but we must also speak truth to power, especially when powerful elected officials manipulate statistics for a political agenda. The suggestion that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are primarily tools for illicit trade is absolutely false. It is a misrepresentation that is being used as propaganda to push for tighter regulation and potentially infringe on the freedoms that these decentralized systems provide. </p><h2>Why Attack Bitcoin?</h2><p>Such misconceptions about bitcoin and digital assets suggest a lack of understanding within the government about these innovative technologies. It is concerning when these misinterpretations are used to justify attempts to limit the freedoms that these systems afford. To put it more succinctly, this is a willful mischaracterization of an emerging technology that has the potential to empower individuals and decentralize power away from governments. </p><p>All governments throughout history have abused their authority of coinage and seigniorage, so a free-market tool that threatens that system would clearly be a target. Figures like Senator Warren have been issuing dire warnings about the use of cryptocurrencies in illicit transactions, while calling for greater regulation of the sector. These statements are clearly attempts to exploit the situation to push an anti-decentralization and anti-innovation agenda, resulting in greater government control and limits to the freedoms of individuals. </p><p>Instead, our mission should be to foster understanding and acceptance of this innovative technology, emphasizing the transformative potential and the inherent freedoms that Bitcoin can provide. We should defend the right to freedom and privacy that these decentralized systems protect. As such, we can't stress enough the importance of educating our legislators about bitcoin and digital assets. Accurate understanding is key to developing fair and effective regulation that protects consumers without stifling innovation. It is our responsibility as members of the Bitcoin community to ensure that our voices are heard, our technology is understood and our rights are protected.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Lee Bratcher and Mark Shut.

This move comes after several other major players in the financial industry have also made similar filings, cementing Bitcoin's position as a sought-after asset among traditional investors.</p><p>The momentum began with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/blackrock-nears-filing-bitcoin-etf-application-leveraging-coinbase-custody">BlackRock</a>, one of the world's largest asset management firms, filing for a spot bitcoin ETF application.

The plebs that make up the group have wide-ranging skill sets across multiple industries, such as education, finance and information technology, in addition to holding blue-collar jobs. This grassroots movement has lofty goals. As early member Mark Maraia stated in an interview for this article, CLOs have embarked on a mission of helping “Lightning rails rule the Earth.”</p><h2>Diagnosing Before Prescribing</h2><p>While Maraia and many others in the group have sales experience, the goal is not about “closing the deal”: Self-appointed members of CLO, who call themselves “chief Lightning officers,” meet local, prospective Lightning point-of-sale (PoS) merchants with a fact-finding mindset: they build relationships with these local merchants and uncover their pain points. While it’s easy for Bitcoiners to say “Bitcoin fixes this,” CLOs attempt to, as Maraia puts it, “diagnose before you prescribe.” </p><p>The biggest frictions discussed by the group have been high fees, delayed settlements, the security of in-house funds, friction during international business transactions and overreaching government regulations. But, as anyone who has studied the Lightning Network enough has realized, it has boundless potential to reduce fees, “lightning” quick final settlement, increased security and privacy, not to mention its ability to be borderless and permissionless.</p><p>The goal of the first few meetings of CLO was to determine which industries were ripe for Lightning adoption. Of the early suggestions were cannabis dispensaries, coffee shops (oh, the irony — paying for coffee with bitcoin), food trucks and non-chain restaurants, local sports teams and craft brewers, to name a few. During each meeting, the group brainstorms other industries that would benefit from utilizing the Lightning payments network (LPN). The group agrees that local Bitcoin meetups should all be working toward having merchants at their meetup spot accept Lightning payments. Some already are, like <a href="https://www.meetup.com/boulder-bitcoiners/">Boulder Bitcoin</a>, which created an LNURL/QR code that funds meetup event items such as drinks and pizza. <a href="https://twitter.com/BTCLincolnLand">Lincolnland Bitcoin</a> is in the process of obtaining the <a href="https://geyser.fund/project/bitcoinlightningatm">World’s Smallest Bitcoin (Lightning) Hobby ATM</a> so that local plebs can convert their spare change into bitcoin.</p><h2>Member Successes</h2><p>One CLO member, <a href="https://twitter.com/midsummer21mil">Holly Young</a>, recently shared <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/onboarding-portugal-to-bitcoin-lightning">her experience hosting a Lightning workshop in Portugal</a> for merchants and local small business owners. Aside from being called a “spammer” and accused of “promoting a Ponzi scheme or profiteering,” Young had a productive experience. Thanks to the help of a tech-savvy family member, attendees of her workship were able to successfully create Coinos accounts. In <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/onboarding-portugal-to-bitcoin-lightning">an article for Bitcoin Magazine</a>, Young described her motivation, “For me personally, the possibility of hooking the vendors up with the Bitcoin community and the Bitcoin community with people producing goods of genuine value is a key driver in organizing events of this kind.” </p><p>Since that workshop, Young has received several requests for similar one-on-one support. She is increasingly assured of Lightning’s potential “as more and more of us devote time and energy to helping it along its natural path to success,” she told me.</p><p>Another CLO member, <a href="https://twitter.com/the_brischster">Ryan Brisch</a>, has had recent success onboarding a local restaurant to accept bitcoin via the Lightning payments network. Brisch, who recently started a business called “Lightning Network Solutions” which helps merchants set up the ability to accept Lightning payments, explained the process in his own words for this article. </p><p>“Thanks to my local Bitcoin group, I learned about a <a href="https://bitcoin-grill.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/menu-bitcoingrill.pdf">new restaurant called Bitcoin Grill</a>, but that they weren't yet set up to accept bitcoin payments on chain or via Lightning,” he said. “After having my discussions with a couple business owners, including a restaurateur, I decided to call the restaurant and asked to speak to one of the owners. From there I scheduled a meeting. The first attempt was a dud, the owner had something come up and left me hanging.” </p><p>As any Bitcoiner knows, this is a common problem; most people require multiple touchpoints before being able to grok Bitcoin/Lightning. </p><p>Brisch continued, “After learning their Bitcoin journey, I showed him the IBEX solution. He was blown away by how easy it was to use and asked if he could sign up for it on the spot! So, we walked through the sign-up process and created a couple of BPTs (Bitcoin payment terminals) on a couple of their iPads.” </p><p>From there, Brisch took the time to follow up by training the servers. As previously stated, the goal is not to close the deal but rather to build a relationship with local merchants. Brisch foresees more follow-up training to ensure a smooth transition.</p><p>Another tool in the CLO members’ toolbelts is inviting and interviewing businesses built on Lightning. The CLO members realize that every merchant has needs specific to their situations. Therefore, they don’t prescribe one solution; rather, they stay platform agnostic. The group has so far sought out the expertise of the following: <a href="https://twitter.com/AnalysFalchuk">Analys Falchuk</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/ibexpay">IBEXPay</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Dooowta">Michael Atwood</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/OshiApp">Oshi</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/adamsoltys">Adam Soltys</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/coinoswallet">Coinos</a>. In addition, a large part of meetings discuss the pros and cons of various Lightning infrastructures. And it’s not like there are just a few to sift through (see image below). Of the many options, <a href="https://twitter.com/walletofsatoshi">Wallet of Satoshi</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PhoenixWallet">Phoenix</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MuunWallet">Muun</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Lightsats21">LightSats</a> and <a href="https://blixtwallet.github.io/">Blixt</a>, as well as payment processors like <a href="https://twitter.com/BtcpayServer">BTCPay Server</a> and plenty of others, have been analyzed.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Maraia believes Lightning adoption will gain traction in 2023. His reasoning is as follow:</p><p>“(There are a) dizzying number of companies that are innovating like crazy. Lightning companies are like Legos. People will use the Lightning payments network without knowing it. The Lightning payments network is the Trojan horse (for bitcoin adoption). (We’re) building a community of problem solvers in payments. Lightning can go places and do things fiat can’t.”</p><p>If you run a Lightning business or you’re a pleb wanting to help further Lightning adoption in your area, consider reaching out to the <a href="https://t.me/+46xTJG4PnEE5NGJh">CLO Telegram group</a>. Find a <a href="https://bitcoin-only.com/meetups">Bitcoin meetup</a> in your area. Locate <a href="https://btcmap.org/">merchants accepting bitcoin and Lightning</a> in your area. Adoption won’t happen on its own. It takes individuals like you and me willing to go the extra mile. </p><p>Like nodes on a network, we are the ones disseminating the boundless benefits of these revolutionary technologies in a peer-to-peer payment system that is soon to cover the globe.

The "proof" acts as confirmation that a participant has met the requirements to validate a block of transactions, signifying their good-faith participation. One such consensus algorithm employed to generate new blocks, distribute new cryptocurrency, and validate transactions is proof of stake (PoS).</p><p>This mechanism provides an alternative to the original consensus method, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/proof-of-work">proof of work (PoW)</a>. Rather than the energy expenditure necessitated by PoW, PoS requires validators or miners to make contributions to the network from their own holdings of the blockchain's native cryptocurrency, i.e., their “stake.”</p><p>To avoid losing their stake, validators are incentivized to operate honestly and reach a consensus on the order and validity of transactions. PoS miners are selected based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold or "stake" in the network; therefore, the more cryptocurrency a validator stakes, the more likely they will be chosen to create the next block. </p><p>Read More &gt;&gt; <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoiners-guide-to-proof-of-stake">Technical Guide To Proof Of Stake</a></p><h2>Comparison With Proof Of Work</h2><p>Instead of stakes, PoW requires considerable computational resources and energy consumption to validate transactions and create new blocks. For this reason, people assume proof of stake is more energy efficient and less resource intensive than PoW. Yet, we will learn later in this article that this is a somewhat false assumption.</p><p>Both consensus mechanisms aim at producing new blocks and validating transactions. They must also maintain the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/proof-of-work-is-objective-proof-of-stake-is-not">security and integrity</a> of the blockchain network, but they do so in different ways.</p><p>In PoW, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-mining">miners compete</a> to solve the Byzantine Generals’ Problem faster and reach a consensus on the validity of transactions. The quickest miner to complete the target hash creates a new block and receives the block reward, the network's token of value. By selecting the chain with the most work, the network overcomes any ambiguity, and double spending is prevented due to requiring at least 51% of the global hash power for a double spend block to catch up. </p><p>In <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/ethereum">Ethereum’s</a> PoS, by means of comparison, the double-spending problem is solved using “checkpoint blocks” at various points in time, approved by a two-thirds majority vote through a stake to “assure” everyone in the network about the “truth” of the system.</p><p>Another significant difference between PoS and PoW is the incentives and the ethics behind them. In a PoS network, incentives hide a negative (penalty-based) connotation since validators may lose their stake if they act maliciously. This contrasts with PoW, where miners are only incentivized to behave honestly to be rewarded with cryptocurrency through a positive (reward-based) incentive system. </p><p>Bitcoin miners who attempt to break the rules by producing poorly formatted blocks or invalid transactions will find their blocks ignored by full nodes. As a result, they will incur substantial electricity costs. Moreover, they would need to command 51% of the hash power to build upon older blocks; otherwise, these chains will lag behind, leading to even more costly energy waste. </p><p>One of the most heated debates in consensus mechanisms is decentralization and the ability to maintain this decentralization. PoW decentralization is secured by an active network of full nodes, in addition to miners, a vital feature that isn’t reflected in PoS consensus mechanisms. The importance of nodes in PoW was marked in the blocksize war of 2017 when the small block supporters won the battle against big blockers by starting the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-independence-day-how-this-watershed-day-defines-community-consensus">user-activated soft fork (UASF) movement</a> and voting for the BTC chain instead of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). That historic Bitcoin event emphasized how nodes could win against big corporations and that miners do not control the network, unlike PoS validators.</p><h2>How Proof Of Stake Works</h2><p>In a proof-of-stake network, participants can be miners or validators who verify and authenticate transactions and create new blocks based on the amount of the blockchain’s native cryptocurrency they hold or "stake" in the network. </p><p>Validators are randomly selected to add the following block based on their stake; the more cryptocurrency a validator has staked, the more likely they will be chosen to validate transactions and create new blocks.</p><p>When a validator is chosen to create a new block, they need to validate all the transactions in the block and add them to the blockchain. To validate the transactions, the validator must check that they are valid, are not “double spending,” and that the sender has enough cryptocurrency to make the transaction.</p><p>Once all transactions are validated in the block, a new block is created and added to the blockchain. At that point, the successful validator is rewarded with native tokens for their work.</p><p>In a proof-of-stake network, consensus is achieved when most validators agree on the state of the blockchain. If a validator creates a block that is not accepted by the majority of validators, the block is rejected, and the validator may lose their staked cryptocurrency.</p><h2>Valid Criticisms Of Proof Of Stake</h2><p>Although proof of stake is often perceived as more energy efficient and less resource demanding when compared to proof of work, these assumptions can be easily refuted, showing that decentralization and security are compromised with proof of stake and that PoS is a mirror image of the current monetary system, which is known to be particularly energy inefficient, as well as unfair to the majority of participants. </p><p>One key argument against the perceived advantages of proof of stake is the concentration of wealth and power this can lead to. In a PoS system, validators with more stake (or wealth) have a higher probability of being chosen to validate transactions and create new blocks. This results in a rich-get-richer scenario, where the wealthiest validators gain even more control and influence over the network. The table below from Nansen Research provides a clear picture of the staking landscape within the Ethereum proof-of-stake system.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>This concentration of power contradicts the principles of decentralization, as a small number of validators can potentially dominate decision-making processes. Unlike proof of work, where miners have to invest in computational power, proof of stake allows validators to accumulate wealth and control the network based on their initial stake, rather than their ongoing contributions to the system.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Another valid criticism of proof of stake is the pre-mine configurations many cryptocurrencies, including ether (ETH), are based on. Mining tokens before their public launch means that founders, stakeholders, and developers may access a lot of wealth and have a considerable advantage over any other investors or validators who later join the network. While such a design could also apply to proof-of-work blockchains, it is more often used in the proof-of-stake ecosystems, because in such systems, it’s possible to have a greater share of the validation process, due to the absence of nodes.</p><p>Common critiques of the PoS consensus mechanism:</p><ul><li>Lack of decentralization: validators who hold a large amount of cryptocurrency have a higher chance of being selected to create new blocks, receive rewards, and they have more influence over the network, leading to a concentration of power in the hands of a few validators. This could lead to a situation where a small group of validators controls the network and its rules, potentially compromising its security and decentralization and reinforcing existing wealth inequalities. </li><li>The validation process can be manipulated: since the network could be manipulated by owning 51% of the tokens in circulation, it is easier to influence the transaction validation than with a 51% attack on PoW, which requires controlling 51% of a network’s current computational power.</li><li>Security: in PoS, the network's safety depends on the amount of cryptocurrency held by validators, making it more vulnerable to attacks if a large number of validators were to collude.</li><li>Complexity: there are various types of proof of stake, such as delegated PoS (DPOS), leased PoS (LPOS), pure PoS (PPOS), and other hybrid types. These are all variants of an overengineered system, which is difficult for anyone to truly explain and understand. The more complex a system is, the more likely it is to fail.</li><li>Environmental impact: proof of stake (PoS) is often criticized for its environmental impact, mirroring the concerns associated with the existing monetary system. Unlike proof of work (PoW), which <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-not-proof-of-stake-solves-energy">incentivizes the expenditure of energy</a>, PoS systems are considered less energy intensive. However, the proliferation of blockchains relying on inefficient PoS mechanisms collectively exacerbates their environmental footprint.</li><li>Nothing-at-stake problem: the nothing-at-stake problem is a theoretical weakness in PoS, where validators have little to lose by creating multiple versions of the blockchain. In a PoS network, validators could create multiple versions of the blockchain, hoping that one version will become the "correct" version. This could lead to a situation where the network is unable to reach a consensus, compromising its security.</li><li>Difficulty in determining the right amount to stake: determining the optimal amount of cryptocurrency to stake in a PoS network is challenging. Validators must balance the desire for higher rewards with the risk of losing their stake.</li></ul><h2>Would Bitcoin Ever Move To Proof Of Stake? </h2><p>Ethereum’s recent shift from PoW to PoS in September 2022 sparked ideas across the corporatized environmental world that Bitcoin should do the same and therefore abandon the “extreme energy consumption” required by its consensus mechanism. </p><p>Changing Ethereum to a PoS system <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-not-proof-of-stake-solves-energy">won’t/didn’t reduce energy consumption by 99.95%</a>, as it fails to take into account that expensive enterprise farms and corporations use enormous amounts of energy to subsidize the work necessary to complete PoS transactions globally.</p><p>The <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/greenpeace-seeks-to-change-bitcoin-code">Greenpeace “Change the Code” campaign</a> funded by Ripple Labs to discredit the energy usage of Bitcoin’s proof-of-work system is a typical example of how the corporate world does not encourage change and, instead, promotes the perpetration of an elitist system that is now fully mirrored in Ethereum’s consensus mechanism.</p><p>Besides proposing a new revolutionary and fair monetary system, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoins-energy-revolution-happening-now">PoW fosters renewable energy innovation</a> and the use of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/profiting-on-biogas-with-bitcoin-mining">stranded and wasted energy</a> which will benefit the environment more than a supposedly energy-efficient PoS system in the long term. Proof of stake is merely better at concealing the energy purchases made by the corporations that enable its validating mechanism.</p><p>Thankfully, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-will-never-change-to-proof-of-stake">Bitcoin’s code is highly resistant</a> to these types of attacks and was purposely developed this way. It is improbable that a proposal to change the code would even pass any initial stage of consideration by the developers, let alone the community. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In free markets, it is important to allow both proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanisms to coexist and evolve in ways that are profitable and beneficial to their respective supporters. Bitcoin, as an innovative monetary system, not only brings about technological advancements but also strives to have a positive impact on the environment. Educating individuals about the significance of PoW in this transformative process is a responsibility that Bitcoin enthusiasts understand and embrace.</p><p>If you're concerned about wealth protection, financial inclusion, and fostering a better environment for all life on earth, the ideal choice is a currency that is borderless, permissionless and embodies pristine hard money and freedom technology.</p><p>This type of money, which is impervious to censorship and safe from confiscation, highlights the superiority of proof of work over proof of stake. In years to come, Bitcoin may likely be the only token of value, and the decision to support proof of work will be seen as obvious in hindsight.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4OTkwMTMzMjgwNjQ2OTI5/proof-of-stake-feature-image-w-text.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4OTkwMTA0ODI2NDg4Nzg4/unnamed.png" height="302" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4OTkwMTIyODExNjY0MzQw/unnamed-1.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[MicroStrategy's Aggressive Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy Secures 0.726% of Total Supply]]></title><description><![CDATA[MicroStrategy continues to dominate the corporate bitcoin space with an aggressive acquisition strategy.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microstrategys-secures-0-726-of-total-bitcoin-supply-with-latest-buy</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microstrategys-secures-0-726-of-total-bitcoin-supply-with-latest-buy</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[michael saylor]]></category><category><![CDATA[bitcoin treasuries]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[microstrategy]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jun 2023 17:02:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MjMxNzYxODMwNTUzMDkz/bitcoin-stack.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>MicroStrategy, the leading public corporation in terms of bitcoin holdings, has once again demonstrated its aggressive bitcoin acquisition strategy. The company recently announced the purchase of an additional 12,333 BTC for approximately $347.0 million, at an average price of $28,136 per bitcoin. This brings MicroStrategy's total holdings to an impressive 152,333 BTC, acquired at an average price of $29,668 per bitcoin. With a total of 21 million bitcoins set to ever exist, MicroStrategy now controls approximately 0.726% of the total available supply.</p><p>This latest move by MicroStrategy further solidifies its position as the largest public corporation holder of bitcoin. MicroStrategy's journey with bitcoin began in August 2020, and despite <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microstrategy-buys-2500-btc-despite-sale">selling some of its holdings</a> for tax loss harvesting in December 2022, the company has consistently increased its bitcoin collection. In fact, shortly after the sale, MicroStrategy acquired an additional 2,500 bitcoin, further bolstering its already significant holdings. With their current holdings, MicroStrategy now controls approximately 0.726% of the total 21 million bitcoins that will ever be mined.</p><p>In addition to its relentless accumulation of bitcoin, MicroStrategy has recently revealed plans to leverage <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microstrategy-launch-bitcoin-lightning-apps-2023">Lightning</a> for enterprise infrastructure services and content monetization solutions. The company's chairman, Michael Saylor, has been actively spearheading the mission of advancing Bitcoin adoption and development.</p><p>The latest acquisition of bitcoin by MicroStrategy reinforces the company's belief in the long-term viability of the digital asset. With Marathon being the only other company holding a substantial amount of bitcoin compared to MicroStrategy, and this acquisition being larger than their entire holdings, it is clear that MicroStrategy's aggressive acquisition strategy positions it as a dominant force in the corporate bitcoin space, controlling a significant percentage of the limited supply.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MjMxNzYxODMwNTUzMDkz/bitcoin-stack.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tether Signs Agreement With Country Of Georgia To Develop Bitcoin And Peer-To-Peer Infrastructure]]></title><description><![CDATA[A Memorandum of Understanding signed by Georgia and Tether seeks to foster innovation and growth in the decentralized technology industry.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tether-and-georgia-sign-mou-to-develop-bitcoin-and-peer-to-peer-infrastructure</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tether-and-georgia-sign-mou-to-develop-bitcoin-and-peer-to-peer-infrastructure</guid><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[peer to peer]]></category><category><![CDATA[Georgia]]></category><category><![CDATA[Tether]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jun 2023 16:12:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxMDc2OTYwOTgwNDQ0NTI2/handshake-spending-transaction.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Tether has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Government of Georgia, aiming to position the country as a central hub for peer-to-peer (P2P) technology.

Any Bitcoiner who's done the research knows that bitcoin the asset is radically undervalued. And I wholeheartedly agree! But even though bitcoin, the asset, is undervalued, it pales in comparison to how much the Bitcoin network is undervalued. I have long held that Bitcoiners, as a group, are undervaluing the Bitcoin network as much or more than no coiners are undervaluing bitcoin the asset.</p><p>So, it is with some amusement that I observe the fierce debate between the Bitcoin purists who believe that the use of the Bitcoin network (i.e., the immutable digital ledger) is <em>only</em> for sending value (bitcoin), and the inscriptions, Ordinals and BRC token crowd which says and does otherwise.</p><p>In my opinion, what most Bitcoin purists are missing is the difference between bitcoin the asset and the immutable digital ledger, also called “the timechain.” The highest and best use for the immutable ledger is holding and sending value, but it is <em>not</em> the only use, as inscriptions and BRC tokens are showing us. </p><p>In addition, I’ve always thought of the network and protocol (the immutable digital ledger) as a place where I can post a message <em>that cannot be changed</em>. Hence, when the <a href="https://declarationofmonetaryindependence.org/">Declaration Of Monetary Independence</a> (DoMI) was first published on October 31, 2021, I had a fellow Bitcoiner make permanent note of it in the timechain. </p><p>I believe it can be found at block height 707,575. And when we created the 2023 version of DoMI that people signed in Miami at the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/declaration-of-monetary-independence-to-reappear-at-bitcoin-2023">Bitcoin 2023 event</a>, I had another Bitcoiner create an inscription for it. Both can now be found on the immutable ledger. I totally understand why many want to use the timechain only for money, but I consider it naive to think it will only be used for that purpose. </p><h2>One Man’s Nonsense Is Another Man’s Meaning</h2><p>Where I get worked up is in how little the market (<em>all of us</em>) values the timechain. In my opinion, there isn’t a single person on the planet who values the network properly… yet. </p><p>What inscriptions and BRC tokens do is increase the perceived value of the timechain. Overall, that’s a plus. Until the network is valued at 250 sats per $1, it’s <em>insanely</em> underpriced!</p><p>Even in the era of inscriptions and BRC tokens, the immutable ledger is still <em>radically</em> undervalued and the cost for putting data on it is way below where an intelligent market will put it. </p><p>It’s as if Satoshi Nakamoto invented two things: One, a new kind of scarce digital money <em>and</em> two, an immutable ledger to keep track of every satoshi. Using a metaphor to make the point, he/she/they invented a new kind of railcar <em>and</em> the tracks the railcar runs on. </p><p>We silly human beings, who are slavishly obsessed with money, give 99.9% of our attention to the asset and almost none to the network (i.e., the timechain) even though the network is as mind blowing as the asset. More impressively and often ignored is this: Nakamoto had to invent a new way to keep time in order to allow the immutable ledger to remain decentralized. Do we celebrate, applaud and value this new method of keeping time? Not really. As of this writing, at block height 794,076, we still just assume and take for granted that this new timekeeping method will keep working for decades. Tick tock, next block. </p><p>We all need to be a bit more humble and, I dare say, reverent about this immutable ledger and appreciate that some people will “waste” block space putting stuff in the timechain that will endure as long as it keeps ticking. Who am I to tell another how to value it? <em>Today, every single Bitcoiner undervalues and underpays for the use of this immutable digital ledger.</em></p><p>Consider this carving into a 300-year-old, majestic oak tree: “Satoshi loves the timechain.” </p><p>To those who love majestic oak trees, such an inscription might be seen as vandalism or horrific. To the person who did the carving, it might represent a labor of love to have inscribed that message into the tree. The tree doesn’t care, only people do. </p><p>Rather than waste any more human energy arguing about inscriptions and Ordinals, I’m going to take my cue from Bitcoin’s timechain. The timechain is absolutely neutral about how we humans make use of it in the same way that the tree does not care what carvings you make into its trunk.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Mark Maraia.

The Division cited concerns about Prime Trust's unsafe and unsound operations as well as its insolvency. This move follows a Cease-and-Desist Order issued on June 21, 2023.</p><p>The court petition revealed that the company owes more than $82 million in fiat cash, and that the company lost access to what it describes as “legacy” wallets holding cryptocurrency in 2021. </p><p>The petition states:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>"In January 2021, PRIME reintroduced specific legacy wallet forwarding addresses to customers (“Legacy Wallets”). It is understood PRIME did so because of limitations associated with creating new wallets within the Fireblocks platform. PRIME purportedly believed that these legacy wallets existed on the Fireblocks platform or were configured to forward to wallets accessible on the Fireblocks platform. However, it is understood that on or about December 2021, PRIME discovered that it was unable to access the Legacy Wallets and the cryptocurrency therein. It is understood that from December 2021 to March 2022, to satisfy the withdrawals from the inaccessible Legacy Wallets, PRIME purchased additional digital currency using customer money from its omnibus customer accounts. PRIME is reported to have been making efforts to regain access to the Legacy Wallets. However, as of the date of this Petition, PRIME has been unable to do so.”</p></blockquote><p>On top of this previously unknown blunder, the petition detailed the “unsafe” financial state of the firm, saying:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“In addition to the above, it is reported that the frequency of customer withdrawals from PRIME have recently increased. Furthermore, many of the withdrawals were for large sums. As such, at or about the time of the instant Petition, it is understood that PRIME’s financial status is such that it owes, in fiat currency, $85,670,000 to its clients but has $2,904,000 in fiat currency (equaling an $82,766,000 fiat currency liability). As to digital currency, PRIME owes $69,509,000 to its clients but only has $68,648,000 in digital currency … As such, PRIME would be unable to satisfy all of its withdrawals.”</p></blockquote><p>According to the released statement, the Division's petition seeks the appointment of a receiver who will assume control over Prime Trust's day-to-day operations and conduct a thorough financial examination. The receiver will then determine the best course of action to protect the company's clients, which may involve rehabilitating Prime and returning it to private management or liquidating the company altogether.</p><p>In a statement, the Nevada Financial Institutions Division emphasized that it is unable to provide legal advice or counsel to Prime's customers.

Vishal, who previously worked for a financial regulator in Abu Dhabi, explained that MiCA is a comprehensive set of regulations for cryptocurrencies that treats them as financial services. He highlighted that MiCA brings uniformity to the registration and anti-money laundering requirements for crypto asset service providers across Europe, allowing for passporting of licenses throughout the region.</p><p>When asked about the impact of MiCA on Bitcoin specifically, Vishal stated that MiCA does not differentiate between different cryptocurrencies and treats them all equally. He mentioned that while MiCA is not the first regulatory framework in the world, it is the first in Europe and similar to what the UK is doing with its regulation.</p><p>Regarding the implications for companies operating as crypto asset service providers (CASP), Vishal explained that they will be regulated based on the services they provide rather than the underlying asset class. “...your cap requirements, your risk mitigations, everything is around the services that you're doing.” Different services such as custody, trading platforms and advice will have specific requirements and risk mitigations.</p><p>Vishal also mentioned that the MiCA regulation will have varying requirements based on the size of the service providers. Larger providers will have more capital and governance controls to ensure consumer protection. He noted that there is still more to come in terms of guidelines for marketing and treatment of stablecoins and NFTs, remarking that “There will probably be separate tools developed for them in the future, but not yet.” </p><p>When asked about the regulatory environment in Europe compared to the U.S., Vishal emphasized that regulators often need time to catch up with innovation, and the power of innovation drives the industry. He believes that Europe's crypto-friendly regulations have been attracting firms and he expects more players to set up shop in the region. “It's just a matter of time before you see a lot more of these players and new startups coming up with new, more innovative products or services,” Vishal stated.</p><p>In terms of the global impact of MiCA, Vishal suggested that other regions may adopt similar regulatory stances or incorporate aspects of MiCA into their own legislation. However, he noted that growing the talent pool within the industry is also crucial for its development.</p><p>For everyday cryptocurrency users, Vishal emphasized that they need to understand that industry firms are now treated as financial service providers under MiCA. He also highlighted the importance of the ability to passport licenses and serve the wider European market from a single center.</p><p>Overall, the MiCA regulation in Europe aims to provide a comprehensive framework for regulating crypto assets as financial services, bringing uniformity and consumer protection to the industry. While some aspects are still under development, MiCA is set to become law by the end of next year, with potential implications for the global industry.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxNTY1MTQ0NDExNjEyODM1/ac-btc.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Things Are Brewing In Prague]]></title><description><![CDATA[At BTC Prague, techno ambiance permeated, meandering paths collided and a rockstar moment stole the show.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-conference-summary-from-btc-prague</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-conference-summary-from-btc-prague</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Prague]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Europe]]></category><category><![CDATA[Conference]]></category><category><![CDATA[michael saylor]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Joakim Book]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jun 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwOTE3NzExNjQ2MTcyNzU3/aa-btc-4.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Joakim Book, a research fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research and contributor to HumanProgress.org and the Mises Institute.</em></p><p>The first thing that met attendees when entering the venue at BTC Prague’s inaugural conference was the smell: a strong, new-rubber-type of scent that permeated most of the main stage area. The second was the light — or the absence thereof: it was dark, with massive screens at regular intervals and neon lights shining elegantly across the ceiling. </p><p>What likely remains etched into participants’ memories is the dim, purple haze and those comfy, white VIP sofas in the front (paying up for VIP tickets has its perks!). A large BTC logo and slowly bobbing lamps hanging above the panelists on the main stage brought a spooky, somewhat nauseous feel — like the whole stage was slowly twirling. As if I weren’t already lightheaded from my travels, endless conversations and lack of sleep that I wholeheartedly blame on the many pre-, side- and after-events going on in Prague’s thriving nightlife.</p><p>As I took it all in, I pulled out my notepad and scribbled, “The techno raves of my teenage years called and want their ambience back.” </p><p>For the first few sessions of all three days, it was empty in the main hall. Eerie, even. <em>Where is everybody?</em></p><h2>Meandering Paths</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsQPHcX8WyM&amp;ab_channel=Trezor">expo hall</a> seemed to be where most of the cool kids hung out; the rest perhaps basking in the morning sun along the river in downtown Prague. </p><p>Littered with hundreds of Bitcoin companies and thousands of participants, the expo hall was dominated by a two-story centerpiece booth occupied by SatoshiLabs. It reached out, symbolically, into the four corners of the space with each section dedicated to its four business brands, one of which, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/satoshilabs-introduces-vexl-foundation-with-bitcoin-app-and-financial-tyranny-index">Vexl Foundation’s KYC-free, peer-to-peer bitcoin app</a>, launched during the conference. Around it, lining the edges of the football-field-sized hall were miners, hardware wallet makers, a dozen or so different backup-on-steel products, book publishers and plenty of merch and consumables. There were so many booths hidden behind something else, in fact, that after several walkthroughs I <em>still</em> found new companies or conference booths I hadn’t noticed before. I live and breathe the Bitcoin space and yet I didn’t know half of these companies or their products: Bitcoiners truly are prolific, new products and companies popping up like mushrooms after the rain (to anglicize a <a href="https://english.radio.cz/theyre-springing-mushrooms-after-rain-8598408#:~:text=The%20phrase%20to%20listen%20out,like%20mushrooms%20after%20the%20rain%E2%80%9D.">Czech saying</a>). </p><p>The official language of the conference, by the way, was broken English of that comical and vaguely European kind; it was a nice change from the avalanche of Americanesque that otherwise <a href="https://youtu.be/WZ6Rl46k-HU?t=41">dominates the Bitcoin space</a> and Bitcoin conferences. </p><p>What was not different about this event was that the audience mostly consisted of pretty fit dudes in the primes of their lives. Some brought their wives and kids, too, giving the venue a somewhat family-friendly vibe. It’s palatable that self-responsibility in money also translates into self-responsibility in other domains. In the age of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dr-jordan-peterson-bitcoin-2022-blessing">Jordan Peterson</a>, Joe Rogan and Ben Shapiro, it’s not too surprising that this message resonates most powerfully with young(-ish) men. </p><p>Somewhere between the venue and the stop at the end of the red metro line went a clear transition from the fiat world to the Bitcoin world. As I traveled toward the conference each day, I started seeing colorful wristbands, Bitcoin-themed clothing and the kind of fit, confident and extravagant clientele that outs us as Bitcoiners. Upon entering the venue, I switched out my Google Pay for a Lightning wallet app since absolutely everyone accepted Lightning. Once in a while, a merchant politely asked if I wished to pay with card or Lightning, but most of the time, they just presented me with an invoice. Exchange of monetary energy can be precisely this simple; never does the difference between the Bitcoin world and the outside world feel more pronounced. </p><p>The coffee barista at the grand El Salvador booth diligently made the conference’s best coffee, all day, every day — for anyone with the patience to stand around and watch him carefully brew it, anyway. Then again, if you wanted to <em>buy </em>coffee from one of the food trucks outside, have fun staying in line for 20 minutes. But the food was great, as were the benches and beanbags for socializing and soaking in the Prague summer heat — until the humid summer cascades shoved the thousands of participants inside, crowding everything into festival-like proportions. </p><p>Among the many impromptu meetings and reunions, scheduled or happenstance, some stood out: the selfie with an idol, thanking a podcaster or author for their valuable work, connecting in real life with personas or nyms that before were nothing but words, voices or profile pics. </p><p>In the middle of the expo hall, I suddenly felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned around to see a tall, slick, dark-haired man about my age. The face was familiar — <em>very</em> familiar — but from another time, another place. <em>“Do you remember me?”</em> My brain worked like an overclocked ASIC to find the solution to this cryptographic puzzle; in the five-second block time expected for this sort of interaction, I couldn’t quite do it. He reminded me that we studied economics together at university in what felt like a lifetime ago; we were on the same study abroad program to the same city but hadn’t kept in touch since. He returned there for a few years after we graduated but was now back in his native Prague. He told me that he finds the money broken, the runaway prices absurd. He’s a new arrival to Bitcoin, having won his ticket to the conference at his first Bitcoin event just a few months back. </p><p>“I’m learning so much,” he said. </p><p>Two meandering paths, united by Bitcoin: Everyone comes here eventually, in their own way, at their own time. It’s a beautiful thing. </p><h2>The Rockstar Moment</h2><p>For the oversized main stage to be filled up, we would have to wait for Michael Saylor’s two appearances. Saylor, who’s rapidly approaching rockstar status in the Bitcoin world, gave an absolutely mesmerizing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mhu6dxj7qk&amp;ab_channel=BTCPrague">keynote speech</a> on the third day, but the hall had also been clogged up for a fireside chat he had with <a href="https://twitter.com/Eric_BIGfund/status/1667220927204020224">Eric Weiss</a> the day before. The overflowing room that had echoed somewhat empty for many previous sessions was now so littered with spectators that the air conditioners running at max capacity couldn’t keep up. As his characteristic “Bitc-<em>oing</em>” echoed across the hall, Saylor’s talk literally took our breath away. </p><p>Bitcoin is an ethically good thing, it’s a moral imperative, he pointed out. Bitcoin and Bitcoiners carry a superior ideology that we “don’t have to apologize for.”</p><p>The tour de force that was the keynote lecture dealt with the U.S. dollar’s collapse against hard assets. That’s not a revolutionary notion in these circles, but the way Saylor packaged the message might be: By holding cash, you’re “on the wrong side of an economic war.”</p><blockquote><p>“There’s an endless economic war raging worldwide and it’s been raging since the beginning of time and it’s going on right now. That war is over the redistribution of economic energy, and we call that <em>wealth</em>…</p><p>“No amount of hard work is going to solve the problem of being on the wrong side of that economic war.”</p></blockquote><p>Technology is an order of magnitude more important than hard work; it doesn’t matter how hard you dig or how good you are with a shovel when the next guy shows up with an excavator. What Saylor added is that <em>government policy</em> is an order of magnitude more important than technology. On a decadal or centennial timeframe, the gains from technology — always in competition with the next thing that makes it obsolete — are siphoned away, drowning under the never-ending money expansion at the root of society’s many troubles. </p><p>The energy in the room was as fever-pitched as during the “Satoshi Rockamoto” concert the night before. The uncomfortable realization began to shine through: “Maybe your work doesn’t matter as much as government policy.” I can’t outwork the pernicious effects of a crumbling money inflating away my economic contributions. </p><p>The conclusion, blatantly obvious to most participants, is that you need to exit — physically as well as monetarily. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/erik-dale">Erik Dale</a>, the Norwegian influencer and podcast host of “<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6ZfuSe6OyxCSKK12qitC6m">Bitcoin For Breakfast</a>,” told us as much in his <a href="https://twitter.com/EuroDale/status/1668194678372458496">opening lecture</a> the day before: The week of the conference, “might have been the first time we have seen net immigration of Bitcoiners <em>to</em> Europe,” he said. Usually, we Europeans just take our “FU money” and exit our crumbling museum of bureaucrats and overburdened, public Ponzi schemes. </p><p>But perhaps we overlooked the Bitcoin hub that is Prague — home to <a href="https://satoshilabs.com/reach-out">SatoshiLabs</a>, to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/braiins">Braiins</a>, to a <a href="https://www.generalbytes.com/en/contact-us">company behind Bitcoin ATMs</a>. Martin Kuchař, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-kuchar/?originalSubdomain=cz">the co-founder of the conference</a>, kept praising the Czech Bitcoin scene every chance he got: “I see BTC Prague as another Czech project that confirms the importance of the Czech Republic for Bitcoin,” he said in a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/legendary-investor-michael-saylor-speak-130300777.html">pre-conference interview</a>.</p><p>Things are indeed brewing in Prague. Perhaps not all is lost for Europe.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Joakim Book.

This development marks a notable shift in the stance of traditional banks towards bitcoin, as HSBC has previously been cautious in embracing it.</p><p>Reporting by CoinDesk <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/26/hong-kongs-hsbc-allows-customers-to-trade-bitcoin-ether-etfs-but-thats-not-really-news/">highlighted</a> that HSBC's decision to enable bitcoin ETF trading for its customers comes after several prior developments that saw other banks also allow such activity. Notably, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/samsung-launches-bitcoin-etf-hong-kong">Samsung Asset Management launched</a> the Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Prior to that, the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/hong-kong-bitcoin-etf-receives-53-million">CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF</a> launched on the same platform, receiving approximately $53 million in initial investments. </p><p>The decision by HSBC to allow its customers to trade bitcoin ETFs comes amidst a surge of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/valkyrie-investments-joins-flurry-of-firms-filing-for-spot-bitcoin-etfs">institutional interest</a> in bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., potentially igniting a race between countries to attract capital with these products. </p><p>The developments are also indicative of the evolving attitudes towards bitcoin among financial institutions. As traditional banks begin to embrace bitcoin, it signals a potential shift towards wider adoption and integration of bitcoin into the mainstream financial system. The merits of this are <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/print/apocalypse-fednow">debatable</a>, but on the surface, that appears to be what these moves signify.<br><br>ETFs are popular investment vehicles, and the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs would open up new opportunities for institutional investors to participate in the bitcoin market within a regulated framework. While this comes at the cost of many of the inherent properties that make bitcoin valuable, institutions prefer the rails of regulation and are more likely to be trusting of firms like BlackRock. There are, of course, exceptions to this such as <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microstrategy-purchases-6455-btc-pays-off-205m-loan">MicroStrategy</a>, a company that holds its own bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzOTk5NDg5MTkzODEzNTA5/bitcoin-domino.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[MicroBT Brings ASIC Manufacturing To America In Partnership With Riot Platforms]]></title><description><![CDATA[One of the largest Bitcoin miner producers has partnered with America’s largest mining firm to bring ASIC production onshore.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microbt-brings-asic-manufacturing-to-america-in-partnership-with-riot-platforms</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microbt-brings-asic-manufacturing-to-america-in-partnership-with-riot-platforms</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Asics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Riot Platforms]]></category><category><![CDATA[whatsminer]]></category><category><![CDATA[Public Miners]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[MicroBT]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jun 2023 13:47:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgzMjM5NTgzMDQxOTg3NjIy/img_4431.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="http://bitcoin/">Riot Platforms</a>, the largest public U.S. Bitcoin mining company in terms of developed capacity, has made a groundbreaking announcement regarding a partnership with Bitcoin ASIC manufacturer, <a href="https://www.microbt.com/#/">MicroBT</a>. The two major bitcoin companies will bring the production of MicroBT’s ASICs to America. The collaboration aims to secure miners for Riot's Corsicana facility, significantly boosting the company's mining capabilities. According to a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine, this development comes as Riot's Corsicana facility is set to increase the company's developed capacity to 1.6 GW.</p><p>“This agreement directly repudiates every major criticism of our industry,” the press release stated. “For those concerned about our energy consumption, these machines will be more efficient than ever … For those who say Bitcoin mining data centers do not actually create jobs, we are helping to create hundreds of jobs, between the MicroBT manufacturing facility in Pennsylvania, and our state of the art data center coming to Corsicana, Texas.” </p><p>One of the key highlights of this partnership is the expected increase in Riot's self-mining hash rate capacity. The press release states that by mid-2024, upon the full installation of the machines from this order, Riot's self-mining hash rate capacity is projected to surge by approximately 61% to over 20 EH/s. This significant boost in capacity further establishes Riot's position as a leading player in the Bitcoin mining industry.</p><p>Moreover, this partnership between Riot and MicroBT also marks a pivotal moment for the industry. Bitcoin miner manufacturing has traditionally been concentrated in Asia, but this new partnership with Riot strengthens the domestic supply chain in the United States. It expands the options available to Bitcoin miners, offering them a robust selection of machines.</p><p>Importantly, the collaboration between Riot and MicroBT will not only have a positive impact on the industry but also on local job creation. The machines will be manufactured by MicroBT at a new facility in the United States, generating employment opportunities in the local area.</p><p>Riot's partnership with MicroBT signifies a major milestone within the Bitcoin mining industry. With the increased hash rate, domestic manufacturing and job creation, this collaboration is set to shape the future of Bitcoin mining in the United States and contribute to the growth of the industry as a whole.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgzMjM5NTgzMDQxOTg3NjIy/img_4431.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[BTC Prague And The Value Of In-Person Bitcoin]]></title><description><![CDATA[The BTC Prague event showcased the importance of live Bitcoin education, connections and celebration.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/btc-prague-demonstrated-the-value-of-bitcoin-events</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/btc-prague-demonstrated-the-value-of-bitcoin-events</guid><category><![CDATA[Europe]]></category><category><![CDATA[Prague]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Conference]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marek Feder]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jun 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzNTEyMTIxODA2MzY2MTky/bitcoin-adoption-map.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Marek Feder, the editor in chief of Investro and a Bitcoin journalist who recently attended the BTC Prague event.</em></p><p>Let’s start with a disclaimer: I am not associated with the organizers of BTC Prague in any way, so in this article, I only provide my personal experience and views as an attendee. And one more disclaimer: I have not been to many Bitcoin conferences, so my takes and impressions from BTC Prague might be old news for some of you. However, I do believe that it was the first “huge” Bitcoin conference not only for myself, but also for countless others from Central Europe, so it might be nice to sum up the whole experience. </p><h2>A Conference Literally For Anyone</h2><p>The fact that the cheapest ticket to BTC Prague was only <a href="https://blockdyor.com/btc-prague/">9 euro</a> (about $11) means that this conference was literally for anyone. There were obviously some limitations to this access, but the cheapest ticket got people to the exposition area as well as to two stages, which was definitely well worth it. This was probably one of the nicest touches by the organizers, as they made this conference available for masses, even outside of Bitcoin. </p><p>This was further enhanced by the fact that the programming on the “Czech Stage” was entirely about Bitcoin basics. It contained talks about what money is; introductions to Bitcoin, privacy and self-custody; explanation of the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum; and much more. </p><p>For two days, newcomers to the Bitcoin world could have listened to some of Bitcoin’s finest from the Czech Republic and Slovakia and receive educations equal to those gained from studying for hundreds of hours. I believe this highlights the importance of in-person conferences and affordable events that can help with orange pilling the mainstream. </p><h2>Industry Day Rulez!</h2><p>While the main conference presented on the Czech Stage and programming for Bitcoin beginners took part on <a href="https://www.btcprague.com/program/">June 9 and June 10</a>, the industry day content focused on businesses started on June 8, and I believe this was the best day for making connections and new friends. </p><p>First of all, during the day, there were “only” two stages with talks and keynotes (the Czech Stage was not open at that time), meaning that there was less of an official program. This allowed people to spend more time in the well-thought-out and inspiring exposition area, where they could find dozens and dozens of companies and Bitcoin organizations.<a href="https://www.btctimes.com/news/three-booths-at-btc-prague-2023-that-benefit-all-bitcoiners"> With more than 70 stalls and booths</a>, attendees had a chance to talk to mining businesses, wallet providers, Bitcoin book shops, education organizations and countless other Bitcoin-related businesses. </p><p>And since the expo area was not as crowded on industry day, it provided the best chance for attendees to have in-depth conversations with all of the attending businesses. Having spent much of the first day in the expo area, I was really surprised by not only the openness and friendliness of all the participants, but also their willingness to have very thorough and informative discussions with anyone who was willing to listen and ask questions. </p><h2>A Top-Notch Program </h2><p>Michael Saylor, Adam Back, Eric Weiss, Giacomo Zucco, Stephan Livera, Marek “Slush” Palatinus, Ben Perrin, Peter McCormack, Rockstar Dev and many, many others <a href="https://www.btcprague.com/speakers/">spoke at the event</a>. The BTC Prague conference had an incredible lineup with Bitcoin experts, developers, entrepreneurs, influencers and business people flying from literally all across the globe. The keynotes, discussion panels and talks were incredible. </p><p>As of this writing, the recordings for only two of the on-stage presentations have been released on the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BTCPrague"> official YouTube channel</a>. However, both of them are well worth a watch. Saylor’s “The Future Of Bitcoin” and Zucco’s “Ordinals Are Retarded,” for instance, filled the main hall to the last seat as people listened to these inspiring and educational keynotes. I highly recommend watching both of them.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Mhu6dxj7qk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>The talks also included some<a href="https://www.investro.com/most-important-bitcoin-related-announcements-from-btcprague"> interesting announcements</a> from the speakers, but detailing what was announced would probably take up a whole article alone. Nevertheless, the announcements by<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/satoshilabs-introduces-vexl-foundation-with-bitcoin-app-and-financial-tyranny-index"> Vexl Foundation</a>, AmityAge, Fedimint and Aleks Svetski are worth looking into in particular</p><h2>A Plethora Of Fascinating Side Events </h2><p>Before the conference, some of my Bitcoin friends had mentioned that the most important parts would be the expo area and side events. As weird as that may sound, I now understand why they felt that way. While I was not able to personally attend all of the side events, I heard only the best feedback and opinions about the likes of “<a href="https://www.btcprague.com/dev-hack-day/">dev/hack/day</a>,” a Nostr meetup and other events. </p><p>If the attendees really wanted to enjoy the talks and keynotes, and thus did not spend a lot of time in the expo area, the side events were an ideal chance for talking to people in a less formal way. From my observation, the vast majority of the employees from the conference stalls and booths were out and meeting with people even during the side events, giving the attendees a chance to talk with them in a more relaxed manner. Often, this was accompanied by a pint of renowned Czech beer at a restaurant serving homemade specialties of the local cuisine, making it even more pleasant. </p><h2>Room For Improvement</h2><p>Well, there is not much that I would have changed or that I believe is necessary to improve to make this event even more spectacular. However, one minor improvement might have led to even more satisfaction from attendees, yet, it was not related to the program, speakers or booths:</p><p>The food trucks were a source of friction that might be improved in the next event. At times, extremely long queues meant that people were waiting for their food for way longer than they should have, which could cost them precious time in such a tightly-packed conference schedule. </p><p>Additionally, while Lightning Network payments were available in all of the possible food court areas, with the exception of common areas of the hall, where I assume it was just not possible to accept Lightning payments, the food trucks often battled with this payment option.</p><p>I witnessed several problems with accepting Lightning as a payment method for food or drinks myself. Whether that was due to internet connection, problems with the operations of point-of-sale devices or mobile wallets, or just the pure frown on the face of a food vendor who was obviously tired of yet another “Bitcoin freak” paying with this internet money, the whole payment-in-Lightning experience could have been improved. </p><p>Obviously, this was not a big deal and I can hardly imagine a conference of this size being completely without flaws. And it should be noted that Lightning payments were available, if the vendors and buyers showed a bit of patience. </p><p>All in all, this was not critical to the overall feeling and outcome of the conference, but should the organizers strive for improvement for the next year, I would probably start here. </p><h2>Will You Attend BTC Prague 2024? </h2><p>And, speaking of next year, the organizers have officially announced that the<a href="https://www.btcprague.com/"> second BTC Prague conference</a> will take place, unsurprisingly, in Prague, between June 13 and June 15, 2024. If the level of the next year’s conference should be anywhere near the event I attended, it will be a blast for sure.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Marek Feder.

However, time is scarce, so we can't talk to everyone. But what if you could multiply your efforts and help someone close to you benefit from Bitcoin in the process? If you're looking for an orange-pilling opportunity with the most asymmetric upside, consider talking about Bitcoin and the Lightning Network with your barber or stylist.</p><h2>The Perfect Environment</h2><p>Once you sit down in the chair and that cape goes around your neck, you know you’re both going to be there for a while. As a Bitcoiner, that can only mean one thing: You have been given the gift of time to talk about Bitcoin.</p><p>Few routine interactions last as long as a haircut or salon appointment. Even fewer grant you the freedom to discuss any topic of your choosing. Additionally, the setting naturally limits distractions, such as phone usage. That makes the time you spend in your barber's or stylist's chair the perfect environment to talk about Bitcoin.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>A Trusted Relationship</h2><p>How long have you been with your current barber or stylist? Relationships between clients and stylists often span years, if not decades. There is a bond between you that is rooted in trust, and this connection fosters a level of intimacy rarely found outside of familial settings. People often share secrets with their stylists and barbers that they wouldn't disclose to anyone else. Clairol's iconic ad campaign captured this sentiment with the tagline, "Only her hairdresser knows for sure."</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>A Force Multiplier</h2><p>Your barber or stylist likely has the broadest network of anyone you know. People from every walk of life, including business owners, accountants, teachers, firefighters and politicians, sit in their chairs, sometimes for hours. It is likely that no one else in your sphere of influence has the amount of time and trust to help others learn about and understand Bitcoin. The same unique factors that create the ideal environment for you to talk with them about Bitcoin are the exact reasons why they have the potential to orange pill others.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>The Right Approach</h2><p>To discuss Bitcoin with your barber or stylist, consider their interests and what might best resonate with them. Are they concerned about rising costs? Do they have family members living in authoritarian countries? Choose your approach based on your understanding of their needs.</p><p>If you're unsure about your approach or just recently began going to a new barber or stylist, don’t talk to them about Bitcoin. Talk to them about Lightning instead.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Lightning As A Cheat Code</h2><p>As the saying goes, "The way to a man's heart is through his stomach." Similarly, the way to a business owner's heart is through their wallet. People naturally follow their incentives, and your barber or stylist will be intrigued if you discuss how Lightning payments can increase their profits. Share some benefits of accepting Lightning payments, such as:</p><ul><li>Fast: Funds are available immediately</li><li>Cheap: <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-lightning-network-is-1-000x-cheaper-than-visa-and-mastercard-data">Significant savings</a> compared to typical credit card fees</li><li>Final: No chargebacks</li><li>Growth: Reaching a new client base and expanding their business</li></ul><p>Once they are curious, demonstrate the ease of using Lightning by having them download your favorite Lightning wallet and sending them some sats. Then, have them send you half the sats back. Show them the minimal fees and remind them that those funds are theirs (final) the moment they receive them. The combination of hearing you describe the benefits, seeing how easy it is to use and doing a transaction themselves is a powerful, persuasive mechanism to pique their interest and demystify the process.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Is your color still processing, or are you getting a shave? If you are there for a longer appointment, they might have time to express concern about bitcoin's volatility. If they do, explain that, just as the price of Visa’s stock doesn’t affect the value of their credit card transactions, the price of bitcoin doesn’t have to affect the value of their Lightning payments. You can also introduce them to services like <a href="https://www.ibexpay.io/">Ibex</a> or <a href="https://strike.me/">Strike</a> which can protect them against price fluctuations. </p><p>If they wonder how accepting Lightning can help them find new customers, show them how tools like <a href="https://btcmap.org/">BTC Map</a> and <a href="https://satmap.app/">Satmap</a> offer free marketing for their shop or salon, or how tools like <a href="https://www.oshi.tech/">Oshi</a> and <a href="https://joltzrewards.com/">Joltz Rewards</a> make it easy for them to engage with and retain their new Bitcoin clients. </p><p>Most importantly, remember that they do not need to commit to the Bitcoin revolution on day one. Instead, get them interested and experiencing the benefits of Lightning first. They'll want to know more soon enough.</p><p>Finally, you do not have to cover all of these elements in one visit. Conversion can take time. Luckily, you’ll be back in a few weeks for your next visit and can pick up where you left off.</p><h2>The Finishing Touch</h2><p><br>Introducing your barber or stylist to Lightning payments can enhance their business and help you promote Bitcoin to a broader audience by leaning on the unique relationship you share with them.

Yet, every year, the debate continues about whether bitcoin should evolve to become something more. Can “digital” gold also be the world’s currency? Could Bitcoin’s blockchain be used to register assets of value? Should it?</p><p>This conversation has peaked with the launch of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges">Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens</a>, driving even more demand to the Bitcoin blockchain. And understandably so — Bitcoin’s peerless security and stability made it known as the blockchain of value. Now that it is possible to store a growing range of assets there, people want to. This is welcome news for the store-of-value proponents, as demand for bitcoin should drive up the price. </p><p>But more transactions also mean more competition, and if you want your transaction to go through, that means more fees and longer confirmation times. This is not ideal for the supporters that prefer bitcoin as a currency and the growing competition for block space is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/ordinal-concerns-bitcoin-decentralization-and-block-space">already affecting the ability to register assets</a>. </p><h2>The Economist’s Evolutionary Theory</h2><p>This dilemma isn’t new for Bitcoin. Its intentional restriction of the block size and transaction capacity has pioneered great tech, like the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/how-does-the-lightning-network-work">Lightning Network</a>, and instigated debates over adopting <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/colored-coins">colored coins</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-miners-and-core-developers-release-segwit-hard-fork-agreement-1457018394">SegWit</a> and other Core changes.</p><p>And Bitcoin is not an exception. When other blockchains came into the market, their ability to handle ERC-20 tokens, NFTs and other operations restricted their popularity. Ethereum was faced with similar limitations, but somewhat resolved them with technical upgrades. However, this led DApps to find shelter in alternative chains. This led to severe interoperability issues, but the economist’s "evolutionary theory" held true: The market moves in the direction of maximum opportunity.</p><p>Looking from an economist's perspective, it's crucial to note that bitcoin's utility as a store of value is still not widely adopted beyond our sector. During the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, we were curious to see how the crisis (the very kind that Bitcoin was designed for) would stimulate demand for the cryptocurrency. What surfaced instead was that, while some people did buy and HODL, others clearly still preferred to save in their fiat currency and happily accepted fiat currency support payments. Even as these fiat payments, unfortunately, have been severely depreciated due to inflation, widespread global investment and adoption of bitcoin didn’t materialize. </p><p>But what is happening behind closed doors? Bitcoin is entering the treasury reserves of many institutions, banks and countries. They realize its value, and are already using it as a hedge against the next financial or global crisis. </p><p>When considering the future, the pandemic is really an example of why we should be optimistic about the point that Bitcoin has reached. Although it is not the global reserve (yet), it has succeeded. It took Google around 17 years from its founding, and 11 years from its IPO, to reach a <a href="https://disfold.com/company/alphabet-inc/marketcap/">$500 billion market cap</a>. Bitcoin did this <a href="https://www.globaldata.com/data-insights/financial-services/bitcoins-market-capitalization-history/">in less than 12 years</a>, and didn’t sell our data to advertisers to do it. Not only that, but it has advanced significantly while still being a proof-of-work blockchain. There are many other chains that have continuously and expensively iterated, facing diminished returns. Not Bitcoin.</p><p>However, we know it is impossible for Bitcoin to evolve into what everyone wants it to be. There is no way (yet) to create a blockchain that can be a store of value, a mode of transaction and a home for NFTs, tokens and other valuable assets. But if the market seeks a one-stop blockchain for all of these uses, then either Bitcoin will become it or another blockchain will. </p><h2>Bitcoin’s Race To Lose</h2><p>Of course, this “one blockchain to rule them all” thinking drove many people to Ethereum, and its domination has yet to materialize. Bitcoin could learn from Ethereum’s mistakes and use this time to re-define its identity and purpose in the market. For certain, it will remain the first and still most successful example of widespread digital currency that also solves the problem of trust. A truly decentralized, self-sovereign monetary system needs trust. Bitcoin provides that trust — and brilliantly does so with trustlessness. Whatever it evolves into, this is core to its value as a system.</p><p>And Bitcoin, being the freest market that has ever existed, will indeed continue to evolve. Its independence drives its adaptability to changing market conditions, and that is what makes it, still, the blockchain of choice for many. </p><p>Of course, as a free market, we can only influence it through our daily actions. That is not a flaw of Bitcoin. This is its best feature, and the surest predictor of its ongoing successful evolution.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Paolo Tasca.

While many are too scared of thinking about it, a large number of people simply feel that they lack the know-how for setting one up or want to wait until they have children before they feel the need to sort out their afterlives.</p><p>Over the last year or so, I decided to have this “will” discussion with myself, and after much thinking and many hours of research, the answer for the best method of inheritance to establish in my own will seemed obvious: Bitcoin. </p><p>As things stand in the world today, you are bound to end up with issues if you don’t set up a will. Let’s say that you kick the bucket tomorrow without an inheritance plan drawn up. The first thing that might happen is that all of your <a href="https://trustandwill.com/learn/dying-without-a-will">assets could be frozen</a> until the courts take their sweet time digging through every detail of your estate. This alone can take from several months to several years, depending on where you live and the assets that are in your name. If you were married and died intestate (without a will), your spouse might end up having to find an executor, which often costs a lot of money, and then comes the months of paperwork and infighting with long-lost relatives who might suddenly start showing up at your doorstep. Along with all of this drama could come the taxman, ready to act as the grim reaper of the assets you leave behind, often taking huge percentages of your life savings. </p><p>With all this in mind, setting up your will with BTC can solve many problems for those who you leave behind in the land of the living. I will be going through some of my thoughts on this and explaining exactly why I have decided to set up my will with Bitcoin.</p><h2>Advantages Of Bitcoin Over Traditional Assets</h2><p>To me, it all came down to two aspects, with the first being accessibility. With physical assets, you end up having to do more than just paperwork when passing on your property after death. Whether it is gold bars, a cellar of investment-grade whisky or expensive paintings, there is a certain level of expertise needed to move these items from one place to the next and then to look after them properly. </p><p>Bitcoin solves this for me. Here you have an asset that doesn’t need anything other <a href="https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/wallets.html">than a 256-bit long combination</a> to be accessed globally, without your next of kin having to wait months to gain access to frozen accounts. This combination can hold all of the value that I wish to pass on, without the need for any fancy, temperature-controlled room or two-ton safe. This way, value can easily be transferred to and accessed by beneficiaries across the globe without the need for intermediaries.</p><p>The other aspect of BTC that makes it good to use as an inheritance device is its privacy aspect. We all know that Bitcoin's blockchain technology is as safe as can be, thus eliminating any security risks, but what about privacy? Sure, it might be possible to track who owns BTC if you know who a wallet belongs to, but as with most of us HODLrs, we tend to keep things on the downlow. </p><p>So, BTC offers security, accessibility and privacy, but it also occurred to me that there might be some issues with this scheme, so I got to listing them and thinking each one through.</p><h2>The Challenges And Risks Of Transferring Bitcoin</h2><p>Security seemed a no-brainer with respect to keeping my stash of coins safe for those I want to leave it to, but then again, how does one transfer said coins or pass a wallet on in a safe way? Setting up a smart contract that will execute upon your demise seemed to be the perfect solution, but then <a href="https://www.reuters.com/science/elon-musks-neuralink-gets-us-fda-approval-human-clinical-study-brain-implants-2023-05-25/">Elon Musk started those human trials with his brain implants</a>, so this idea might still be a few years off. </p><h3>Knowhow</h3><p>So, you might be thinking, go old school and get a safety deposit box at a normal bank to leave your private key in a well-protected spot, and include instructions in your will that will make the situation clear to those you left behind. But even then, there is a certain amount of technical competence that will be required for your beneficiaries to be able to navigate the intricacies of Bitcoin ownership. </p><p>Using BTC has become significantly more straightforward than it was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/justinoconnell/2019/12/23/the-2010s-in-bitcoin-the-year-2010/">back in 2010</a>, but it still requires a level of technical understanding which can pose a challenge for heirs who may not be familiar with cryptocurrencies. The solution here is obvious: Educate your people about the glories of Bitcoin before you end up six feet under.</p><h3>Value And Distribution</h3><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/052014/why-bitcoins-value-so-volatile.asp">Bitcoin's price fluctuations</a> might be something that could scare people off from even considering this asset as a store of value that can be passed on, but there is no doubt in my mind that one day, even a single satoshi will be worth a pretty penny. </p><p>The problem comes from the fact that, while I am still alive, I want to continue using crypto exchanges to trade and add to my supply of bitcoin. So, how can an ever-evolving bitcoin stack be evenly divided after my death? Well, this is really quite simple, just allocate a percentage of your coins to each beneficiary. This way, you can keep adding to your nest egg, and it doesn’t matter how many coins you have or how volatile the market might be, the right percentage will make it into the right hands.</p><h2>Tools For Bitcoin Inheritance Planning</h2><p>OK, so, in my dive down the BTC-will rabbit hole, I did manage to find a few tips and tools that should be helpful when planning what happens to your stuff once you enter the eternal rest. Let me just briefly touch on two of them:</p><h3>Multi-Signature Wallets</h3><p>This one is perfect for those who are scared that one of their relatives will try to swindle the rest or something like that. One way you might use multi-signature wallets can be in your lawyer and beneficiaries each having to authorize a transaction in order for it to be carried out. This added layer of security can be an easy way of setting up your will without going through too much technical trouble. For me, this multi-signature wallet approach is a fantastic idea and one I have already implemented.</p><h3>Bitcoin Estate Planning Services</h3><p>Believe it or not, I wasn’t the first person to think of this. Specialized bitcoin estate planning services are out there and they offer solutions to securely manage and transfer bitcoin holdings after you breathe your last. These services can help a ton by providing expert guidance and reducing the risk of loss or mishandling of the bitcoin by those who are not too clued in with blockchain technology. While I personally see the value in these services, it’s just not my cup of tea.</p><p>No matter the path you choose to implement a BTC will, one thing that should always accompany your last will and testament is a dossier of comprehensive documentation giving clear instructions on all of your wishes. Clear documentation is essential, and the more concise the instructions, the less room will be available for interpretation and arguments from beneficiaries.</p><h2>Impact Of Bitcoin As A Legacy</h2><p>To me, it all comes down to building a legacy and playing a part in the future of Bitcoin, even from beyond the grave. Democratizing wealth is the perfect way to help push the ideas of a better world through blockchain technology and BTC forward, and by incorporating it into my will, I feel like it helps this cause along. </p><p>I always aim to promote financial inclusivity and would like to empower my heirs with exposure to a transformative asset that has already and will continue to shape the world into something glorious. Supporting Bitcoin in this way also aligns with my belief in the potential of decentralized technologies to reshape the future of finance and society as a whole.</p><p>By choosing Bitcoin as a legacy, I hope to, at the very least, spark conversations about digital assets, educate my heirs, inspire them to explore the opportunities presented by emerging technologies and empower them to approach the evolving financial landscape with confidence.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Konstanin Rabin.

Built using LDK and BDK, LDK Node provides a straightforward interface and an integrated on-chain wallet, allowing developers to quickly and easily establish a Lightning node within a day.</p><p>Unlike its predecessor LDK, which offers extensive customization options but requires a deeper understanding of protocol fundamentals, LDK Node focuses on simplicity and ease of use. With a reduced API surface comprising around 30 API calls, LDK Node simplifies the integration of self-custodial Lightning nodes in various use cases while hiding protocol complexities.</p><p>The initial release of LDK Node includes several design choices and modules. The integrated BDK wallet handles on-chain data, and chain data can be sourced from an <a href="https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora">Esplora</a> server, with support for <a href="https://electrum.org/">Electrum</a> and bitcoind RPC planned for the future. Gossip data can be obtained via Lightning's peer-to-peer network or the Rapid Gossip Sync (RGS) protocol. LDK Node also offers the means to source entropy for Lightning and on-chain wallets, as well as generate and persist entropy bytes to disk.</p><p>LDK Node is specifically designed to facilitate the integration of self-custodial Lightning nodes in mobile applications. Its features are tailored for mobile deployments, with integration options available for Swift, Kotlin, Python and Flutter. By offering language bindings and compatibility with mobile environments, LDK Node aims to simplify the process of deploying self-custodial Lightning nodes on end-user devices.</p><p>Looking ahead, the development team behind LDK Node has already started working on the next release, which will introduce support for sourcing chain data from Electrum or bitcoind RPC and persistence to a Versioned Storage Service (VSS) backend. Integration with the Language Server Protocol (LSP) specification is also in progress. The team is actively considering adding server-grade modules in the future.</p><p>For developers interested in exploring LDK Node, the <a href="https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-node">GitHub repository</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/ldk-node/0.1.0/ldk_node/">API documentation</a>, and <a href="https://crates.io/">Rust Crate</a> provide further resources. Additionally, <a href="https://github.com/reez/Monday">there is a showcase called Monday Wallet</a>, an example wallet built with LDK Node Swift bindings, demonstrating the capabilities of the library in real-world applications.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMjY2NTkxMzgyODczMjQx/bitcoin-lightning-network.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Catawba Nation Is Seeking Seasoned Banking Regulators To Help Grow Their Bitcoin-Friendly Jurisdiction]]></title><description><![CDATA[With state-level jurisdictional sovereignty, the Catawba Digital Economic Zone seeks to create an environment conducive to the growth of the digital asset industry.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/catawba-nation-is-seeking-seasoned-banking-regulators-for-bitcoin-friendly-jurisdiction</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/catawba-nation-is-seeking-seasoned-banking-regulators-for-bitcoin-friendly-jurisdiction</guid><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category><category><![CDATA[Banking]]></category><category><![CDATA[Regulation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislation]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2023 16:27:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwOTE3NzExNjQ2MTcyNzU3/aa-btc-4.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>The Catawba Nation, a sovereign federally recognized tribal government, has established the <a href="https://catawbadigital.zone/">Catawba Digital Economic Zone</a> (CDEZ), a special jurisdiction within the Catawba Reservation in South Carolina, aimed at empowering emerging digital technology companies, including Bitcoin companies. The CDEZ has recently achieved a significant milestone with the enactment of the Banking and Financial Services Code, a comprehensive legal framework that combines the best practices from the financial codes of South Dakota, North Dakota and Wyoming.</p><p>The CDEZ Banking Commission, an integral part of the regulatory landscape within the jurisdiction, is now seeking experienced banking regulators and financial experts to shape the future of the zone's banking practices. The commission's responsibilities include authorizing banking operations, granting bank charters and ensuring competitive equality among financial institutions. Additionally, the commission will oversee various aspects of bank operations such as mergers, branch openings and closings and changes in location, with periodic examinations to ensure regulatory compliance.</p><p>"The Catawba Digital Economic Zone offers a unique opportunity for seasoned banking regulators to contribute to the development of a robust digital banking system," said a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine. "We are seeking applicants with expertise in policymaking, financial regulations and banking to harmonize traditional and digital banking practices while fostering innovation."</p><p>The CDEZ's invitation to potential regulators and financial experts highlights its commitment to maintaining the integrity and stability of the financial sector within the zone. The commission holds the authority to enforce disciplinary actions, including the removal of individuals engaged in unlawful banking activities or unsafe practices.

    </figure><p>In the cryptocurrency world, bold bets and outrageous predictions are not uncommon. And yet, Balaji Srinivasan, a prominent and occasionally-controversial figure in crypto and tech, made major finance headlines when he announced a daring wager that bitcoin <a href="https://qz.com/balaji-srinivasan-lost-1-million-in-a-bizarre-bitcoin-1850399034">would reach a staggering $1 million per coin within 90 days</a>. </p><p>The Bitcoin and larger crypto community immediately began analyzing what drove him to make such a daring statement. Srinivasan predicted this <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1636797265317867520">on March 17, 2023</a> — when bitcoin was trading at $26,000 in the middle of a bearish market. The <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1637625020792049664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1637625020792049664%7Ctwgr%5E5fa19b38c10dd3afc5c1d0bf3ab065dec500e95b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fembedly.forbes.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3D3ce26dc7e3454db5820ba084d28b4935schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fbalajis%2Fstatus%2F1637625020792049664image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3D3ce26dc7e3454db5820ba084d28b4935">terms of the bet</a> stated that if the bitcoin price did not reach $1 million by June 17, 2023, he would pay out $1 million to the other party, Twitter pundit James Medlock. The bet would settle in USDC stablecoin. Srinivasan estimated the odds at forty to one. </p><p>Many were skeptical about the pronouncement, calling it clout chasing, a marketing ploy and even a pump-and-dump scheme. Swan Bitcoin co-founder Cory Klippsten brought up Srinivasan's <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonkochkodin/2023/03/20/who-is-balaji-srinivasan-and-why-should-we-care-about-his-1-million-bitcoin-prediction/?sh=3b00ac1a5bd1">history of promoting altcoins</a>, which earned him the ire of Bitcoin Maximalists. Many in the crypto world were dumbfounded yet intrigued enough to investigate what made him take the bet and whether he would be good for the money if he were to lose. </p><p>Along with his audacious prediction, Srinivasan talked about the Federal Reserve's money printing and dollar devaluation. He <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638731349489238017">warned</a> against the Fed's rate hikes, saying they weren't anti-inflation but <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/balaji-srinivasan-warns-about-the-fed-s-trillion-dollar-printing-press/ar-AA18YPfU">a smokescreen aimed at propping up a banking system</a> on the brink of collapse. </p><p>Fast forward to May 2, 2023, when Srinivasan <a href="https://decrypt.co/138632/balaji-srinivasan-burns-1-million-bitcoin">conceded his bet early</a> and said it had been closed out "by mutual agreement." Medlock <a href="https://twitter.com/jdcmedlock/status/1653453502365196288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1653453502365196288%7Ctwgr%5E9d6fe1ce7435b7059c327214211d5aa604b56bc2%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fjdcmedlock%2Fstatus%2F1653453502365196288image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07">acknowledged the payment</a> on his Twitter account. </p><p>In a video <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1653449321185169409">posted and pinned on his Twitter profile</a>, Srinivasan explained the previously-veiled reasoning behind his public relations stunt. Outside of his explanation, this article delves into the possible motivations behind Srinivasan's audacious bet, explores his background and involvement in the crypto industry and reviews the impact of such announcements on the global Bitcoin community. </p><p>Furthermore, I will discuss why, despite the short-term failure, Srinivasan's stunt may hold some validity for the future, exploring the financial and economic conditions in which bitcoin could potentially be an <a href="https://youngandtheinvested.com/how-to-open-crypto-account-for-minors/">ideal long-term investment</a>, and could eventually reach a value of $1 million.</p><h2>Understanding Srinivasan's Background</h2><p>To properly dissect the controversial bet, it's essential to understand its maker's significance within the crypto industry and beyond. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balaji_Srinivasan">Srinivasan is a well-known entrepreneur, technologist and investor</a> who has significantly contributed to the cryptocurrency industry. </p><p>He co-founded 21 Inc., a Bitcoin mining startup that later became Earn.com, a model allowing senders to pay users in crypto to reply to emails. Earn.com was subsequently acquired by Coinbase in April 2018 and launched as Coinbase Earn. Balaji then became the first CTO of Coinbase. Coinbase Earn shut down in 2019.</p><p>Srinivasan is renowned for his deep understanding of technology and ability to identify emerging trends in the industry. He joined venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz as a general partner in 2013. He holds a master’s degree in chemical engineering and in electrical engineering. He has previously taught at Stanford University. He has sometimes been hailed as a polymath because of his multiple involvements in various tech spaces. </p><h2>Possible Motivations Behind The Bitcoin Bet</h2><h3>Attention And Publicity</h3><p>By making such an extravagant bet, Srinivasan courted substantial attention and media coverage. As such, Srinivasan's bet may have been a strategic move to gain visibility for himself and his viewpoints within the crypto community. </p><h3>Challenging Conventional Thinking</h3><p>Through a publicity stunt, Srinivasan may have sought to challenge skeptics and provoke discussions on the transformative power of Bitcoin. Such bold statements can spark debate and encourage critical analysis of cryptocurrencies' underlying technologies and economic principles.</p><h3>Advocacy For Bitcoin</h3><p>While he has been criticized for promoting altcoins and pump-and-dump schemes, Srinivasan remains an ardent supporter of Bitcoin and its potential to disrupt traditional financial systems. The $1 million bet could have been an attempt to showcase his unwavering belief in Bitcoin's future success and encourage others to consider its potential. </p><p>Some critics, however, saw it as an attempt at price manipulation. It could also have been an attempt on his part to regain credibility and position himself as a “mostly Bitcoin” advocate after his previous, alleged attempts at alt-crypto promotion. </p><h3>A Means Of Raising Public Alarm</h3><p>It also may be that he genuinely feels strongly for a cause and saw the bet as a means of starting a robust discussion around a pressing economic issue involving inflation and the benefits of bitcoin as a safe haven asset.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>The Effects Of Exaggerated Bets On Bitcoin Culture</h2><p>Exaggerated bets and pronouncements have become a part of the Bitcoin culture, with enthusiasts and experts constantly making predictions about future prices and market movements. While these bold claims generate excitement and media attention, they can contribute to unrealistic expectations, market manipulation and excessive speculation. </p><p>Influencers need to exercise restraint because the Bitcoin and larger cryptocurrency communities are highly reactive and trade the news. Moreover, investors and participants in the space need to exercise caution, conduct thorough research and base their decisions on sound analysis rather than relying solely on sensational predictions.</p><h2>Burning $1 Million To Prove A Point</h2><p>As noted above, on May 3, 2023, Srinivasan <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1653449321185169409?s=20">posted a video</a> on his official Twitter account with the stark caption, "I burned a million to tell you they're printing trillions."</p><p>Whether this is a genuine and sincere effort to sound the alarm on the U.S. government and the Fed's harmful policies or a mere save for a failure at price prediction is best left to the reader to judge. However, Srinivasan made several valid points that push his argument about hyperinflation and its dangers.</p><p>"I wanted to tell you in a provable way — to send a provable signal — that the economy was wrong. I'm not in the habit of burning a million bucks for the sake of it," he said in the video. "There's something wrong with the economy, and the state is not telling you about it. And things could unwind very fast." </p><p>He then pointed to the speed of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) to the government's subsequent printing of $300 billion. He also mentioned that after SVB, there have been $500 billion in outflows from small lenders to money market funds and big banks. </p><p>He compared the speed of these phenomena to the span from concrete COVID-19 announcements to the sudden implementation of lockdowns — from Ben Bernanke's announcement of a "<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2008/04/10/bernanke-says-us-could-be-facing-a-mild-recession.html">mild recession</a>" in 2008 to a full-fledged global financial crisis, which took just two quarters to unravel. </p><p>"In each of these cases," Srinivasan added, "too slow was being too late."</p><p>Srinivasan argued that in today's U.S. economy, "many things are breaking at once." The most glaring issue, in his opinion, is the U.S. debt ceiling, wherein markets were predicting a high probability of sovereign default. He quoted "Dr. Doom" economist Nouriel Roubini, saying that most U.S. banks are near insolvency. Roubini has confirmed this sentiment, saying that U.S. regional banks <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nouriel-roubini-us-regional-banks-certainly-face-credit-crunch-2023-5">face a credit crunch</a>. </p><p>Furthermore, he drew parallels to 2008, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/02/briefing/bank-failures-first-republic-bank.html">successive bank failures</a> within a short period and commercial real estate prices crashing by double digits. Traditional safe havens like bonds, he contended, aren't safe. Insurance is under pressure as well. </p><p>He also mentioned the phenomena of <a href="https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/de-dollarization-what-happens-if-the-dollar-loses-reserve-status">de-dollarization</a>, decreasing U.S. dominance on the global stage, as manifested by the movement of other countries away from the USD as their medium of exchange or store of value. He also pointed out the reallocation movements of smart money and central banks toward gold. </p><p>Afterward, he asked whether anyone sees infinite dollar printing continuing for centuries or whether other — shorter — timelines are more probable. Could the system collapse happen within months, years or decades? He made a probability estimate for each. He proceeded to recommend that if you believe the system collapse may happen sooner than the highly-optimistic span of centuries, you must take appropriate action.</p><p>He then confirmed his reason for the bet: to raise public alarm at his own expense. While this is a radical way to draw attention to a thesis, it does put the spotlight on brewing economic problems and on Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Will Bitcoin Reach $1 Million Anyway?</h2><p>While Srinivasan's bet did not materialize as expected, it does not necessarily discredit the possibility of bitcoin reaching a value of $1 million per coin in the future. Several economic and financial conditions could contribute to such a scenario:</p><h3>Widespread Institutional Adoption</h3><p>Increased acceptance and adoption of bitcoin by institutional investors, banks and governments could drive significant demand and price appreciation. Institutional involvement would provide legitimacy and stability to the market, attracting more capital and increasing the price.</p><h3>Limited Supply And Halving Events</h3><p>Bitcoin's scarcity is a crucial factor in its value proposition. As the supply of new coins decreases due to the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-the-halvening">halving events</a> that occur roughly every four years, the reduction in the inflation rate could exert upward pressure on the price, potentially leading to substantial appreciation.</p><h3>Global Economic Instability</h3><p>Economic crises, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hyperinflation.asp">hyperinflation</a> or a loss of faith in traditional financial systems could prompt individuals and institutions to seek alternative stores of value, such as bitcoin. In such circumstances, the demand for bitcoin as a hedge against inflation or economic uncertainty could skyrocket, potentially driving the price to extraordinary levels.</p><h2>Future Potential</h2><p>Balaji Srinivasan's bold bet on Bitcoin reaching $1 million per coin within 90 days was a daring move that captured the attention of the crypto community and the media. Despite the short-term and possibly intentional failure of the bet, Srinivasan's bet raised essential questions about the future potential of Bitcoin. </p><p>Given the right economic and financial conditions, including widespread institutional adoption, limited supply and global economic instability, bitcoin could very well reach $1 million per coin. But, as with any investment, caution, thorough research, and a long-term perspective are essential when considering the possibilities and risks associated with bitcoin.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Ivan Serrano.

Last week, the Powell-led central bank had decided to temporarily pause rate hikes&nbsp;— the fastest and most aggressive interest rate increases in U.S. history —&nbsp;in their mission to battle the massive <em>price</em> inflation found downstream from the lockdown-induced <em>monetary</em> inflation via stimulus measures. Less than a month away from the announced July launch of FedNow, an inter-bank communication platform, Powell finds himself at a crossroad of monetary policy, regulation and capital requirements before the formal founding of the digital dollar system.</p><h2>The New Dollar: FedNow &amp; USTs, Not Retail CBDCs </h2><blockquote><p>“The status of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency is very important.” <br></p><p>- Jerome Powell, June 21, 2023</p></blockquote><p>The dollar has been digitized for a long time; be it the Zelle or Venmo credits in your retail account, or the dollar balance in your checking account at Bank of America. But generally speaking, the mechanisms behind the transfer of Treasuries and other reserve assets backing these numbers on a screen have remained at the technical agility of a fax machine. The dollar may be the world reserve <em>currency</em>, and can be transacted via intermediaries on obvious centralized banker rails, or less obviously on Ethereum rails via ERC-20 tokens in the form of popular retail stablecoins, but the U.S. Treasuries held by these novel credit creators remain the world reserve <em>asset</em>. These bonds are strictly issued by the U.S. Treasury to be sold to the private sector to create dollars, incentivized with yields dependent on the federal funding rate set by the Federal Reserve. The public has generally feared the direct issuance of some form of retail CBDC (central bank digital currency) due to surveillance concerns and currency seizure from a centralized issuer, but fewer realize both the level of financial surveillance already imposed by banks, never mind the ability for these trusted third parties to censor, blacklist and even expose retail to their counter-party risk. All of these actions are made increasingly possible via the digitization of the currency with an encroaching reliance on centralized payment rails, but up until next month, the communication network for interbank asset trades has remained lossy and slow.</p><p>FedNow, slated to launch next month, serves multiple purposes, but perhaps none as important as creating a much more efficient lever for the Fed to have 365/24/7 control on overnight banking rates, such as SOFR, effectively setting the cost of borrowing short-term liquidity between fractionalized private banks attempting to meet their depositors’ withdrawals. You have probably heard the phrase “reverse repo” once or twice, but the underlying mechanic is often misunderstood. The “repo” stands for a repurchasing agreement; essentially a contract between two entities in which Bank A, with excess dollar liquidity, agrees to lend cash to Bank B, with overnight liquidity needs, via a short-term loan collateralized by Bank B’s assets such as USTs, with the conditions that Bank B will <em>repurchase</em> their securities, usually the next morning (“overnight”), plus a percentage-based fee that Bank A gets to keep. A reverse repo is essentially the same behavior, except that Bank A is bond-rich, cash-poor and thus asking Bank B for dollar-denominated liquidity. This exact scenario came to fruition within the recent regional bank failures in the U.S., and the Fed created new mechanisms to backstop the liquidity needs of the depositors. In the case of the ever-growing reverse repo market, Bank B is routinely the largest American banks, and sometimes even the Fed directly. FedNow is a digital lever, made possible via the internet, for complete centralized control on the overnight rate of borrowing dollars, the necessary transferring of Treasuries between banks, and thus the reshoring of dollar-denominated activity away from the Eurodollar market, and back to the United States within the scope of the Fed and the Treasury. </p><h2>Private-Entity Dollar Issuance</h2><blockquote><p>“We would not support a central bank digital currency for individuals. If we did have a CBDC, it would be intermediated by banks.” <br></p><p>- Jerome Powell, June 21, 2023</p></blockquote><p>Shortly after the fall of FTX last fall, the NY Fed launched their digital dollar pilot program, featuring BNY Mellon, PNC Bank, Citi, HSBC, Mastercard, TD Bank, Truist, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo, as well as cooperation with SWIFT. Notable within this quorum of too big to fail private sector banks is the inclusion of BNY Mellon, the largest U.S. bank, who holds treasuries for popular stablecoin USDC, and PNC Bank, the former 22.4% owner of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, who only earlier this week filed with the SEC for approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. The SEC has recently made waves themselves by filing their own notices against Binance and the publicly listed Coinbase for brokering sales of unregistered securities in the form of cryptocurrency tokens. While BUSD, the Binance-issued USD stablecoin, was listed as being an unregistered security, USDC, the Circle-issued USD stablecoin, second in market cap value behind only Tether, was left off the notices, despite listings on both exchanges. Powell took the idea of stablecoins being important to the Fed and the greater U.S. dollar system a step further this morning when he insinuated that not only are stablecoins not a security, they are money. "We do see payment stablecoins as a form of money, and in all advanced economies, the ultimate source of credibility in money is the central bank…We believe it would be appropriate to have quite a robust federal role in what happens in stablecoins going forward."</p><p>He went on to further articulate his views on not needing a direct-issued government dollar, and instead relying on the private sector banks to continue their role of government debt purchasing via USTs in order to create credit via dollars in retail accounts. "We would not support accounts at the Federal Reserve by individuals…such accounts would be managed through the banking system.” In February, the SEC served a Wells Notice to Paxos, the issuer of BUSD, directly limiting Binance’s ability to compete in the dollar creation industry. Via the signatures from the arms of regulation from the Fed, the Treasury, the SEC and even the Department of Justice, the entities allowed to make digital dollars are being hand selected in front of our eyes. In order to continue the cycle of needing to purchase government-issued debt to create dollars, the U.S. government has moved to direct policy, regulatory comment, and even disciplinary action on off-shore dollar creation, changing the landscape for stablecoins, and even the dollar itself, forever, mere moments before the founding of the digital Federal Reserve. </p><h2>Basel III</h2><blockquote><p>“Basel III is an international capital requirement we should go ahead and complete.”<br></p><p> - Jerome Powell, June 21, 2023</p></blockquote><p>As American commercial banks begin to integrate digital assets such as bitcoin and dollar-derivatives such as stablecoins, the need to ensure the public that on-sheet liquidity for speculative action on commodities exists creates a unique opportunity to tilt regulation in the favor of the dollar. Basel III would require any bank wanting to hold bitcoin, other digital assets, or even gold, would also be required to hold an equal-part dollar to dollar-denominated valuation of their investments. This sudden comment on adoption of this international capital requirement would force a net-demand for dollars in the U.S banking system, despite a high monetary inflationary environment. For banks or registered investment vehicles looking to offset inflationary effects by purchasing alternative reserve assets such as bitcoin, this regulation would mean that an increase of valuation of bitcoin in a dollar-pair would also increase the need for dollar liabilities on their balance sheet. Want to run a responsible bank and meet capital requirements while also holding bitcoin on your balance sheet? Better be prepared to also hold a lot of dollars. The idea of the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-birth-of-the-bitcoin-dollar">Bitcoin-Dollar</a> is a parallel to the petro-dollar system, which was upheld from the gold window closing via the Nixon shock until only somewhat recently. By creating a monopoly on the in’s and out’s of oil to strictly U.S. dollars, the U.S. was essentially able to re-peg their inflating dollar to an ever-demanded energy commodity, and create a mass buyer of dollars. As the Fed and SEC circle the waters on both regional banks and private issuers of stablecoins, the downstream effect of Basel III will create permanent demand for dollars, even in a “hyperbitcoinization” environment. Powell mentioned the Fed doesn’t have specifics on proposals for capital requirements at this time, but that there will be a future proposal that comes to the Fed board later this summer.</p><h2>BlackRock ETF</h2><blockquote><p>“Let me tell you, it’s not who the President is. It’s who’s controlling the wallet of the President.” <br></p><p>- Serge Varlay, BlackRock Recruiter</p></blockquote><p>The recent application filing from BlackRock, an investment firm with assets under management totalling $10 trillion, has kicked off a filing spree from other institutional asset managers in the race for the first approved exchange-traded fund offering exposure to bitcoin. WisdomTree, Bitwise, and Invesco have all since filed to the SEC seeking to launch Bitcoin ETFs, despite a universal rejection of every spot Bitcoin ETF application previously filed, notably including NYDIG, CBOE, and Fidelity. The newly found resurgence in confidence of approval perhaps comes downstream of BlackRock’s near perfect record of getting ETFs approved, sitting at a 575 to 1 success rate. Within iSHARES Bitcoin Trust Form <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1980994/000143774923017574/bit20230608_s1.htm">S-1</a> Registration Statement was their disclosure of using Coinbase for bitcoin custody, as well as a notice of potential conflict of interest within an affiliate of theirs acting as investment manager to a money market fund, the Circle Reserve Fund, which the issuer of USDC uses to “hold cash, U.S. Treasury bills, notes and other obligations insured or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Treasury and repurchase agreements secured by such obligations or cash, which serves as reserves backing USDC stablecoins." It later states that “an affiliate of the Sponsor [BlackRock] has a minority equity interest in the issuer of USDC." The S-1 includes a line stating the “price of bitcoin may be affected due to stablecoins (including Tether and USDC), the activities of stablecoin issuers and their regulatory treatment." The Cash Custodian and Trust Administrator of the BlackRock ETF is listed as the aforementioned digital dollar pilot program partner Bank of New York Mellon.</p><p>While ETFs are often used as a mechanism to short commodities by large financial institutions, the recent signaling from the most important U.S. regulatory bodies reveals a real possibility of increased digital dollar creation and an increased purchasing power of the demand-inelastic reserve asset, bitcoin. There is perhaps no larger investment firm than BlackRock, and no larger banking entity than Bank of New York Mellon. There are few government bodies more influential on the global economy than the Fed and the SEC. </p><p>Welcome to institutional adoption. Just don’t fucking dance.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4ODI5MTkzNjA4ODk3ODk5/goodpicture1.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Valkyrie Investments Joins Flurry Of Firms Filing For Spot Bitcoin ETFs]]></title><description><![CDATA[A newly updated spot bitcoin ETF by Valkyrie Investments adds to a slew of institutional filings following BlackRock’s.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/valkyrie-investments-joins-flurry-of-firms-filing-for-spot-bitcoin-etfs</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/valkyrie-investments-joins-flurry-of-firms-filing-for-spot-bitcoin-etfs</guid><category><![CDATA[Valkyrie]]></category><category><![CDATA[Spot Bitcoin Etf]]></category><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[ETFs]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 21:01:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyODY4MzAyMTgyMjI5NzEy/markets-price-chart.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Amidst a surge of activity within the ETF space, Valkyrie Investments has made significant moves to establish its presence once again.

Notably, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/blackrock-nears-filing-bitcoin-etf-application-leveraging-coinbase-custody">filed a spot bitcoin ETF application</a>, perhaps taking advantage of recent regulatory scrutiny to facilitate its entry into the market.

This application signals the increasing competition among firms aiming to launch bitcoin ETFs, as they recognize the demand for regulated investment products in the space, along with the first-movers advantage possible.</p><p>In addition, Bitwise <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1671582463489974278?s=20">filed a 19b-4 form</a> to renew their spot bitcoin ETF filing, while Invesco <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1671328943104831488?s=20">renewed their filing</a> for a spot bitcoin ETF.</p><p>As firms like Valkyrie, BlackRock, Bitwise, Invesco and WisdomTree enter the race for an ETF approval, they all equally aim to provide investors with more accessible and regulated avenues to participate in the bitcoin market. These developments underscore the continued growth and maturation of the bitcoin industry, with ETFs emerging as an important tool for investors seeking exposure to bitcoin in a regulated manner, albeit at the cost of certain properties inherent only to native bitcoin.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyODY4MzAyMTgyMjI5NzEy/markets-price-chart.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[CleanSpark Acquires Two Bitcoin Mining Campuses, Allowing For Expansion Of Hash Rate And Mining Capacity]]></title><description><![CDATA[Over 6,000 latest-generation mining machines will be hosted, enhancing mining efficiency and revenue prospects.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-acquires-two-bitcoin-mining-campuses</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-acquires-two-bitcoin-mining-campuses</guid><category><![CDATA[Public Miners]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[CleanSpark]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 13:54:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4ODIyMzE0NjgxMzEzMDMx/img_20230620_185701_277.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>CleanSpark Inc., a prominent Bitcoin mining company, has announced its plans to acquire two turnkey <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-mining">bitcoin mining</a> campuses in Dalton, Georgia, for $9.3 million in an all-cash deal.

It also continues to position us as one of the most power-efficient miners on an energy-per-hashrate basis,” said Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark. “These two additional sites are testament to our deepening ties with rural communities in Georgia and the regional expertise we are developing there as a large, flexible load. Importantly, our efforts are generating economic growth for the suburban and rural areas where our operations are located.” </p><p>Gary A. Vecchiarelli, CFO of CleanSpark, highlighted the financial impact of the acquisition, stating that it will be immediately beneficial to the company. “Importantly, this acquisition is fully paid for from our existing cash reserves and we expect it to almost immediately start driving revenue to our bottom line,” Vecchiarelli said.</p><p>The company’s purchase comes as Bitcoin inches closer to the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/halving">halving</a> in 2024, in which miners will see the bitcoin reward for their efforts cut in half. If a company relies heavily on newly minted bitcoin as a source of income, their revenue will decrease unless they increase their mining efficiency or the price of bitcoin rises significantly.

I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked at the price increases over the past few years after our conversation and I wondered: Will this alternative currency continue to rise in value, or is it a big Ponzi scheme that will soon collapse in on itself?</p><p>I started to read up on the subject and quickly realized that the influencers on Twitter were often playing with the emotions of their audiences — with fear and greed, to name the most common ones. I could hardly believe some of the exaggerated posts, and yet they drew me in.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/BTC_Archive/status/1379127189321420808"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>It was obvious to me that social media influenced private individuals in their actions when it came to Bitcoin. In my studies, I learned about many theories and models in media psychology, which I can apply to the Bitcoin market and which might help others do the same.</p><h2>Media Psychology Concepts And Bitcoin Twitter</h2><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uses_and_gratifications_theory">uses-and-gratifications theory</a> assumes that recipients choose the medium that can best satisfy their needs. Depending on the medium, a person seeks information, entertainment, personal identity (reinforcement of one's own values) or integration and social interaction (exchanges among like-minded people). For me, I mix all four motives right away. </p><p>The involvement concept, which suggests that a recipient can still be involved with the content of an article even days after reading it, if that person is directly affected by the developments or the views represented. However, this does not mean that attitudes can be permanently changed. The more involved a judging individual is in a topic, the less he or she can be influenced by persuasion from other opinions. The interplay between the emotions of greed and fear and the resulting experienced tension diminishes over time and with experience. </p><p>In my environment, everyone, without exception, has confirmed this phenomenon. After your first bitcoin purchase, for instance, you are susceptible to being easily manipulated. With every additional hour that you deal with the matter, your opinion becomes stronger. You may accept price distortions more and more easily and, in the meantime, see the incentive to buy sats at a lower price.</p><p>Remaining mindful of why you are on Bitcoin Twitter in the first place, and how the content there is impacting you, will help you navigate it.</p><h2>How To Handle Bitcoin Twitter</h2><p>The enormous price gains are, in my opinion, the strongest narrative that draws retail investors into the bitcoin market. The most common type of posts that I see on Bitcoin Twitter are positive price forecasts. These generate clicks, have the potential to trigger fear of missing out (FOMO) and entice private investors to make rash purchases.</p><p>How strongly an individual reacts to information with positive connotations, or to information with negative connotations in a phase of strong price decay, and whether an action results from this, ultimately depends on the motive and the experienced emotions of a recipient, as well as the behavior of the influencers consumed. But the natural human trait of being guided by emotions means that new investors could pay the highest prices at the end of an upswing and sell these positions at losses when prices correct, in fear of a total collapse. This is why anyone entering the Bitcoin space this way should keep in mind the psychological factors at play.</p><p>One suggestion I have is to remain strong-minded. If someone’s investment goes into the red, their mood usually dips. But losses and gains don't materialize if you don't cash out. But I believe that four out of five people don't hold to this, emotionally. That's where you have to be tough as nails. There is an age-old wisdom that should be drilled into every private investor: You can never catch two things, the top and the bottom. "Simply doing nothing" is historically best in a market that is going up in the medium to long term.</p><p>Another valuable lesson for me was to realize that, in today's globally-connected world, it has become increasingly difficult to separate the clickbaiters and scammers from the valuable content with strong communities. This means that someone who wants to learn about Bitcoin via Twitter should first do the work of "separating the junk from the good sources" in their own research. An investment should never be made based on just one opinion or source.</p><h2>Manipulation Via Media</h2><p>Manipulation via media is by no means a new phenomenon and media history shows that it can hardly be eliminated with regulation. </p><p>But social media accelerates the impact of contributions and enlarges spheres of influence, accentuating the problem. My goal is to motivate critical engagement with media, even knowing that, globally, this is a difficult endeavor. After all, the ability to critically examine media and one's own emotional reactions would be a considerable benefit in all areas of life.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Thierry Berger.

These firms often have close ties to regulators and are much more effective at complying with regulations as a result of their scale, and as such, the current environment is seemingly ripe for disruption.</p><p>Indeed, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/blackrock-nears-filing-bitcoin-etf-application-leveraging-coinbase-custody">a recent filing by BlackRock</a>, the world’s largest asset management firm with more than $8 trillion under management, for a spot Bitcoin ETF is another sign that these institutions see the current environment as an opportunity for expansion into the sector. </p><p>SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has repeatedly <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1541421073262120960?s=20">claimed</a> that bitcoin is <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1629573858104582144?s=20">not a security</a>, but a commodity, effectively keeping it out of the realm of SEC regulation. As a result, institutions like BlackRock may perceive bitcoin to be the safest cryptocurrency to offer products for, although this newly announced EDX exchange will feature other cryptocurrencies as well.</p><p>Overall, the development indicates that BlackRock is not the sole major traditional finance institution paying attention to bitcoin — everyone wants their slice of the pie, and regulators have served up that pie fresh out of the oven.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NDg4MTA1ODc5ODczMDI5/economic-chart-analysis.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Brink Renews Grant For Sebastian Falbesoner's Review Of BIP324 To Enhance Bitcoin's Censorship-Resistance]]></title><description><![CDATA[The focus of Falbesoner’s work seeks to bring greater privacy to Bitcoin node operators through encryption.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/brink-renews-grant-for-sebastian-falbesoners-review-of-bip324</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/brink-renews-grant-for-sebastian-falbesoners-review-of-bip324</guid><category><![CDATA[brink]]></category><category><![CDATA[encryption]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technical]]></category><category><![CDATA[Grants]]></category><category><![CDATA[Privacy]]></category><category><![CDATA[development]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bip]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jun 2023 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxOTg4NDM3NTk3ODg5OTkx/20220830_better-the-four-pillars-of-bitcoin-adoption---stefan-ristic.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Bitcoin research and development center, Brink, has <a href="https://brink.dev/blog/2023/06/20/bip324/">announced</a> the renewal of a year-long grant for Sebastian Falbesoner, also known as theStack. “As part of his grant renewal application, he emphasized the importance of BIP324 Version 2 P2P transport and why he plans to spend his review time on the project,” the announcement read.</p><p>BIP324 aims to address the vulnerability of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer (P2P) communication layer, where messages are currently transmitted unencrypted. Sebastian highlights the need for opportunistic encryption between Bitcoin nodes to combat censorship, privacy breaches, and other attacks. He explains, "BIP324 tries to counter these deficiencies by adding opportunistic encryption between Bitcoin nodes, making it significantly harder for adversaries to conduct these attacks."</p><p>The proposal incorporates a protocol that obscures the initiation of connections between peers, ensuring minimal information is revealed to external observers. This is achieved through the use of <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/759.pdf#page=25">ElligatorSwift</a>, a modern elliptic curve point encoding scheme. Additionally, an extra chunk of random bytes, known as "garbage," is exchanged during connection initiation to further obfuscate the size of packets, hindering detection by potential attackers.</p><p>Sebastian expressed his fascination with BIP324's pseudorandom approach, stating, "If we imagine a world where this v2 encrypted transport protocol is used predominantly ... censorship of any Bitcoin participant on the network level will be significantly harder." He highlights that deep packet inspection and man-in-the-middle attacks would become far more challenging to execute.</p><p>Recognizing the significance of BIP324 for ensuring Bitcoin's censorship-resistance on the P2P layer, Brink has extended Sebastian's part-time grant for another year. Sebastian plans to conduct thorough code reviews, test the remaining BIP324 pull requests, and run a publicly accessible BIP324-compatible node once a functional pull request is available.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxOTg4NDM3NTk3ODg5OTkx/20220830_better-the-four-pillars-of-bitcoin-adoption---stefan-ristic.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Is Actually A Store Of Energy, And That Changes Everything]]></title><description><![CDATA[Serving as a currency backed by energy of any source, bitcoin has solved problems that have been tied to money throughout history.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-currency-that-stores-energy-unlocking-the-future</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-currency-that-stores-energy-unlocking-the-future</guid><category><![CDATA[energy consumption]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fiat]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[The history of money]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Shane Neagle]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jun 2023 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyMzg0NjM5NzQwOTQ2MDc3/20220916_better-five-factors-making-bitcoin-miners-unique-energy-consumers---jaran-mellerud.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Shane Neagle, the editor-in-chief of “The Tokenist.”</em></p><p>Time and time again, we see the mainstream media <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html">taking advantage</a> of Bitcoin’s perceived exploit: energy consumption. For the Bitcoin network, this path has become all too familiar.</p><p>Just look at what happened in May 2021, when Elon Musk effectively “broke” bitcoin’s price as Tesla <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203">announced</a> it would no longer accept BTC as payment, citing environmental concerns. The price of a single bitcoin <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/05/13/bitcoin-tesla-elon-musk-climate/">dropped by nearly $8,000</a> in the two hours following the announcement. There are countless similar cases as well.</p><p>But the takeaway is this: It’s very clear that the perception of Bitcoin’s fundamentals goes far beyond the security of the network, the soundness of the code and the asset’s limited supply. Bitcoin’s energy consumption plays a role, too. So big of a role, that it significantly impacts not just the price of bitcoin, but its regulatory framework as well. For better or for worse, this really can’t be argued.</p><p>But what if Bitcoin’s energy consumption was <em>actually</em> a good thing? What if Bitcoin functioned as a “store of energy” that provides a superior alternative to any monetary system we’ve ever seen?</p><p>Fortunately, the concept of an energy-backed currency is not as radical or novel as people may think — it has been around for more than a century. But the necessary conditions (i.e., the technology) did not yet exist to facilitate such a game-changing development for civilization.</p><p>That technology now exists, however, and it’s called Bitcoin. Let me explain.</p><h2>Money And ‘Life Energy’</h2><p>The evolution of human civilization largely centers upon the resolution of one key question: How do we appraise the true value of goods and services?</p><p>More specifically, how do we assess such value in the most uniform and effortless manner possible?</p><p>Consider the era of <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/the-bottom-line/managing-your-finances/a-history-of-the-trade-and-barter-system">ancient barter systems</a>, when a uniform system of fiat currency had yet to be conceived. Exchanging crops or livestock for services was commonplace. However, this system was fraught with inefficiencies, as it was heavily reliant on the mutual coincidence of wants. Consider a fisherman looking to trade his fish — but only for salt which he needed to preserve his future catch from spoiling. Any individual looking to trade for fish, must now have precisely what the fisherman wanted: salt.</p><p>In such a scenario, it’s easy to see how the principle of supply and demand is skewed.</p><p>Determining an equitable exchange for unique, non-fungible items poses a distinctive challenge. How do we ensure that both parties are duly rewarded for the energy they’ve invested — their “life energy” — in producing the product or service they’re selling?</p><p>This concept of “life energy” refers to the time, effort and creative energy that individuals pour into their work. Every human has a finite time span that they convert into tangible, productive output — a <em>measurable</em> form of energy.</p><p>But in this system of bartering, <em>life energy</em> isn’t appropriately accounted for. Rather, external factors heavily influence the value of a product or service — frequently to the detriment of the life energy devoted to its production.</p><p>Ideally, we need a system that allows for the accumulation and storage of this expenditure of energy — which we can refer to as “surplus energy” — and its associated value.</p><p>The advantages here go far beyond the individual who expended such energy. The metaphorical lifeblood of any economy is this concept of “surplus energy.” If this flow is impeded or clots, it leads to a less vibrant, stagnant economy. If it’s properly stored and fluid, it can lead to innovation and breakthroughs which benefit the society at large.</p><p>If we don't establish accurate mechanisms, capturing and storing surplus energy or value becomes impossible.</p><p>Hence, it becomes vital to measure this energy output in the most streamlined manner possible, to ensure fair compensation for — and ability to capitalize on — the energy expended. In this respect, a significant landmark in civilization’s journey was the evolution from bartering to commodity money, eventually leading to the use of portable, interchangeable and standardized metal coins.</p><h2>A Historical Devaluation Of Life Energy</h2><p>The Roman Empire built itself on economic efficiency by minimizing money friction. Its blood was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius">denarius currency</a>, molded out of the limited supply of precious metals. The limited nature of the denarius allowed for it to serve as a store of value.</p><p>Concurrently, the denarius’ portability as a store of value allowed it to spread across every corner of the empire, easily transported and traded by various merchants. Consequently, the economic circulatory system <a href="https://www.moneymuseum.com/en/for-sunflower/the-fall-of-the-roman-denarius-460">overflowed with energy</a>. As the friction within the exchange of goods and services was minimized, new specialized labor markets could form, which increased productivity and innovation.</p><p>In monetary terms, all was good. The Roman civilization achieved a commodity currency which facilitated economic expansion. Such a standardized currency, portable and limited as it was, stored and efficiently captured Roman energy into productivity and economic growth. </p><p>Until it didn't, by decree.</p><p>As each Roman emperor desired to expend more energy than the currency allowed, they started to erode the denarri’s store of value. </p><p>The denarius remained portable and fungible, yet it began to falter in its ability to accurately represent people's life energy outputs. The silver content of each denarius became smaller and smaller, eroding the currency’s ability to maintain value and, ultimately, purchasing power.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Today, we understand this as inflation. With each currency debasement cycle, people lost confidence that their life’s energy output was properly measured, quite <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042015/how-does-money-supply-affect-inflation.asp">similar to what’s happening today</a>:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The United States is in a peculiar historic position in which <a href="https://kenaninstitute.unc.edu/kenan-insight/how-the-u-s-exports-inflation-through-a-strong-dollar/">it can export domestic inflation</a> thanks to the status of the dollar as the global reserve currency (GRC). Therefore, wages can keep growing at an inflationary pace. But, <a href="https://tokenist.com/the-us-debt-ceiling-crisis-explained/">as debt ceilings have become debt ladders</a>, no one knows for sure for how long this will be sustainable.</p><p>And it is definitely not sustainable in many other countries with double- and even <a href="https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/triple-digit-inflation/">triple-digit</a> inflation rates.</p><h2>Money: What Needs To Be Fixed?</h2><p>So, what patterns can we observe from our monetary history?</p><p>First, to properly measure life’s energy outputs, the gauge needs to be fungible and standardized, facilitating a feasible calculation of the value of nonfungible goods and services. Second, the gauge needs to simultaneously <em>store value</em> and <em>be</em> <em>portable</em>.</p><p>These baseline elements provide people with a tool to accurately transform their limited time and energy — life energy — into a productive, well-compensated energy output.</p><p>When we look at all modern fiat currencies, their stores of value rest on shaky grounds. The problem is, central banks have replaced emperors — but their decrees are no less disruptive.</p><p>At a fundamental level, the exchange of funds between employers and employees is the exchange of energy. But neither employers nor employees control this compensatory energy’s current(cy). That energy’s current is provided through <em>currency</em> — and it’s entirely controlled by central banks.</p><p>Thus, it is central banks that uniquely possess the authority to modify that energy current over time, echoing the practice of ancient Roman emperors.</p><p>The biggest influence on a currency’s store of value is its supply and issuance schedule. Central banks and Roman emperors alike have had a tendency to radically change available supply, negatively impacting this attribute.</p><p>In turn, this negatively impacts people’s ability to capitalize on their expended energy.</p><h2>Energy Currency As New Milestone Technology</h2><p>From bartering and commodities, to metal coins and fiat paper currency, history’s monetary experiments have delivered actionable conclusions. </p><p>Alongside portability, maintaining the integrity of the currency’s store of value is of the utmost importance. For this to be achievable, it must not rely on arbitrary decrees.</p><p>And this is precisely the revolution Satoshi Nakamoto brought with his <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin white paper</a>. The trust must be removed from the centralized entities which have complete control over monetary systems — and the ability for individuals to capitalize on their expended energy through labor: “an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,” as Nakamoto <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">put it</a>.</p><p>The question then shifts to: How do we <em>secure</em> that new component of trust?</p><p>Past intellectuals have argued for backing money with units of energy. Namely, in John Maynard Keynes’ <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/collected-writings-of-john-maynard-keynes/keyness-early-lectures/37A3CBC28BAA6C04725F688B410E3E5D">lectures of 1912 to 1913</a>, which provided the intellectual framework for a means of measuring money “in terms of units of electrical energy.”</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Bitcoin: An Energy-Secured System Of Energy Transference</h2><p>In the case of Bitcoin, that new component of trust is secured through <em>energy</em>.</p><p>Bitcoin is not only portable but digitally portable, complementing our digital era. It’s not merely scarce, but its scarcity is defined in an energy-agnostic way. This links back to Ford’s dream of an energy-backed currency, but with a fundamental difference. Ford’s envisioned energy currency, tied to the world’s largest power plant, would have been susceptible to vulnerabilities associated with centralization. In contrast, Bitcoin leverages energy from any source available.</p><p>The decentralized nature of computing power creates a resilient and robust system. It is through this energy itself that the Bitcoin network secures this new component of trust — cryptographic proof.</p><p>In this light, it is no coincidence that <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1330150691671846919?lang=ta">Michael Saylor</a> paints the vision of Bitcoin as the solution to the problem of how to store energy over time and across space.</p><p>Returning to one of the first points mentioned, where Bitcoin’s perception goes beyond its own fundamentals, two questions remain: How durable should Bitcoin be to external factors? Are there any legitimate threats out there?</p><p>Just look at new technology which is developing at breakneck speeds. Artificial intelligence (AI) is anticipated to heavily impact the finance world — from <a href="https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/book/rf-lit-review/2020/rflr-artificial-intelligence-in-asset-management.pdf">long-term investing</a> and portfolio management to <a href="https://thetradinganalyst.com/human-vs-ai-trading-signals/">shorter-term options trading</a>. Yet with the development and mass integration of AI, reality and illusion will become intertwined. Separating the two will become an arduous task.</p><p>How will such significant innovations impact Bitcoin?</p><p>Bitcoin is poised to endure such technological revolutions. The immutable nature of the blockchain allows for a degree of verifiability which the development of AI will create a greater need for. Yet even more importantly, Bitcoin advocates see how Bitcoin represents something of a vocation, rather than an asset merely for speculation and profit. This type of “larger than life” support will only help Bitcoin to endure life-changing innovations, political regime changes or any other existential “threat” that may arise in the future.</p><p>Yet there remains an ongoing absence of the proper framework when it comes to Bitcoin’s energy consumption, as I’ve tried to articulate here.</p><p>According to a recent poll, for example, <a href="https://www.creditdonkey.com/buy-bitcoin.html">76% of investors</a> want BTC to be more “environmentally friendly” — which misses the mark when it comes to the relationship between Bitcoin’s energy use (or, in other words, its means of securing the network) and our ability to effectively capitalize on the life energy we devote.</p><p>With its distinctive ability to store and transfer energy, the Bitcoin network fixes this dilemma.</p><p>Not only is the network secured by energy, but it has the potential to effectively enable individuals to properly capitalize on the use of their life energy. This means Bitcoin has already ventured into the unprecedented territory of an energy currency — not just for the benefit of the individual, but of society at large.</p><p>History is here and the journey has just begun.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Shane Neagle.
