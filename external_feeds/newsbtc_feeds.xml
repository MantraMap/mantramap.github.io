					<description><![CDATA[Ahead of Gold, US Treasury, the S&#38;P 500, and others, banking giant Goldman Sachs ranks Bitcoin (BTC) in the top 1 best-performing asset year-to-date, per a Twitter user. Related Reading: MakerDAO Passes Proposal To Deploy $100 Million USDC In Yearn Finance Vault According to Goldman Sachs, Bitcoin has outperformed its cryptocurrency pairs and those major financial institutions of the traditional market with a risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio) of 3.1. The Sharpe Ratio is used to measure market volatility-adjusted performance; the higher the ratio, the better the investment, currency, or stock in terms of risk-adjusted returns. Bitcoin Takes The Lead In Broad Market Recovery On smaller timeframes, Bitcoin continues its quest to regain lost territory. Slowly but steadily, Bitcoin is attempting to break above the resistance level of $23,800. Bitcoin appears to have a healthy pullback below the resistance line in search of bullish momentum. Despite the recent crisis of not only the cryptocurrency market with the collapse of FTX and the world economy in free fall, bringing consequences for investors and institutions, the market has also noted the comeback of market makers on cryptocurrency exchanges.  In contrast with Goldman Sachs&#8217; report, according to an annual report by CoinGecko, Bitcoin is the worst-performing asset among the major currencies, with a significant decline of 64%. CoinGecko also noted that since January 2022, the trading volume in the spot market has decreased by 67%.  The new year for Bitcoin and the market started positively, with $200 billion bulking the volume and volatility sheets, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin&#8217;s year-to-date solid rally has shifted market sentiment. Analysts seem bullish in the short term, expecting the cryptocurrency to increase to as much as $30,000. However, in the long term, economist Lyn Alden said that Bitcoin could be in &#8220;considerable danger&#8221; in the second quarter of 2023 as liquidity risks increase.  As the price of Bitcoin consolidates below the resistance zone, the cryptocurrency is looking for a trendline break to position itself above the $24,500 level, representing its next obstacle.  The rising 20-day moving average at $20,700 and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the overbought zone near 80 suggest that BTC&#8217;s bullish trend line can continue and conquer new regions. Conversely, bears are ready to stall the Bitcoin price action to the upside and turn the momentum and direction of the market, but bulls seem unwilling to surrender. Speculation is on the rise with no certainties in the market and the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings.  Related Reading: Cardano’s Aggressive Development Activity Will Withstand Bear Assault At $0.3?

					<description><![CDATA[In the hopes of generating yield while offering users what its best known for, MakerDAO, the issuer of the Ethereum-based stablecoin, DAI, has approved a proposal to deploy $100 million of Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) in a Yearn Finance yield-generating account called a “vault.” The proposal, submitted on January 9, aims to look for a way MakerDAO could split its treasury allocations and earn yield. MakerDAO To Generate Yields From Yearn Finance Vault Following the approval of the MIP92 (Maker Improvement Proposal 92), MakerDAO plans to begin depositing $100 million USDC to the Yearn finance vault to earn a 2% yield annually, approximately $2 million every year on its YearnFi investment.  Related Reading: MakerDAO Could Replace Governance Token, Will It Provide Enhanced Incentives?

					<description><![CDATA[The crypto market’s rally is losing strength, forcing significant cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano, back to their support regions. The latter has been deploying products and development that hint at a longer bullish trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Profit-Taking Spikes, Will BTC Price Recover? As of this writing, Cardano (ADA) trades at $0.35 with a 5% loss in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, ADA’s price still recorded some profits as the bulls made their stand against a spike in selling pressure. Cardano In The Olympus Of Development Activity Data from research firm Santiment indicates that the Cardano ecosystem is vibrating with development activity. Currently, this blockchain ranks number 3 in the metric, according to the number of commits on the software development platform GitHub. As seen in the chart below, Cardano’s development activity over the past 30 days records over 330 GitHub commits for the different projects on this blockchain. Only Polkadot and its experimental environment Kusama have seen more development activity, with 441 commits. As the chart above shows, the price of Cardano (ADA) has been moving in tandem with its developments and the general market sentiment. As more developers onboard the blockchain, the ecosystem is more appealing to investors. ADA records a 38% rally over the past 30 days. In the coming weeks, this blockchain will deploy a new upgrade for its smart contract programming language, Plutus. This update will enable support for the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Schnorr. These new components will allow developers to provide more security and build cross-chain capabilities. Plutus was designed to operate as an easy-to-use and accessible programming language. Thus, people might feel even more incentive to build on this blockchain. Related Reading: Here’s What Might Have Triggered Ethereum’s Decline Below $1,600 It remains to be seen if ADA’s price will extend its recent trend and follow its spike in development activity. According to Input Output Global, Cardano’s lead developer company: This upgrade will bring greater interoperability and secure cross-chain #DApp development to #Cardano, making it easier for developers to work with other blockchains. Developers would otherwise need to spend extra time, effort, and funds to implement ECDSA and Schnorr over the SECP elliptic curves in #Plutus, increasing potential security risks and using an unrealistic amount of resources.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After what has been two weeks of an incredible rally for the price of Ethereum, the digital asset seems to be running out of steam. ETH’s price has now declined once more below $1,600 after a sharp downturn on Tuesday. The culprit for this seems to be growing FUD across the community. FUD Could Have Been The Trigger According to Santiment, the social dominance of Ethereum grew rapidly in the last couple of days. While this can sometimes be a good thing, it tells a negative story this time around. Ethereum is now dominating 21% of cryptocurrency discussion on social media and the on-chain data aggregator says this might be evidence that FUD might be behind the dip. However, this may not be the only reason. Related Reading: Money Leaves ADA, SOL To Small Cap Altcoins, Here’s Where It’s Headed A report from Bitcoinist had previously shown that profit-taking in large assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum had been ramping up with the increase in price. Santiment also highlights this in its post, pointing to the spike in the profit-taking ratio on January 20. Taking this in concert with the growing FUD, it presents a recipe for disaster for the digital asset. ETH social dominance indicates FUD &#124; Source: Santiment Another prominent event was the Wormhole attacker started moving the stolen funds around. On Monday, the attacker moved over $155 million in ETH to OpenOcean which they proceeded to exchange for staked ETH tokens such as stETH and wstETH. The dumping of these coins on the open market saw sell pressure mount on ETH during this time. It contributed to the already declining momentum, resulting in the current dip in the price. Can Ethereum Recover From Here? Despite the recent decline, the overall sentiment for Ethereum is still skewing largely toward buy. This is because the cryptocurrency is still trading well above its 50-day and 100-day moving averages. And even with the decline, it continues to trend around its 200-day moving average. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Could See Another 30% Rally What this shows is that, at least in the short to mid-term, there is still a lot of bullish sentiment surrounding the digital asset. Add in the ample support that has built up around $1,500 over the last couple of days and Ethereum is still presenting as a formidable choice of investment. ETH price falls below $1,600 &#124; Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com Investors are also seeing good profits during this time with 57% of all holders in profit. Figures like these also help to push a bullish narrative for the digital asset as more investors try to take advantage of the dip and move into the green. Overall, as long as ETH maintains its momentum and trading volume continues rising, it’ll retest the $1,600 resistance once more.  ETH’s price is changing hands at $1,555 at the time of this writing. Its price is down 5.27% in the last 24 hours but trading volume is up 11.91% over the same time period to be sitting at $9.32 billion.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows Bitcoin short-term holder profit-taking has spiked, will this lead to a correction in the price of the crypto? Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Has Surged Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, instances of the current trend have led to declines in the crypto&#8217;s price in the past. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;Spent Output Profit Ratio&#8221; (SOPR), which tells us whether the average Bitcoin investor is selling their coins at a profit or at a loss right now. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the holders as a whole are realizing some profits on their selling currently. On the other hand, values below the threshold suggest the overall market is leaning towards loss realization at the moment. Naturally, the indicator being exactly equal to 1 implies the average holder is just breaking even on their distribution right now. One of the two main segments of the BTC market is made up of the &#8220;short-term holders&#8221; (STHs), which is a cohort that includes all investors who acquired their coins within the last 155 days. The holders who have been sitting on their coins for more than this threshold amount are called &#8220;long-term holders&#8221; (LTHs). Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR specifically for the STHs: The value of the metric seems to have risen in recent days &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH SOPR (as well as its 7-day moving average) has surged and broken above 1 recently. This means that as the BTC rally has taken place, the STHs have come into profits and they are now selling to harvest these gains. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Declines 6%, Gets Flipped By Litecoin In Market Cap Again The chart also includes data for the 7-day triple exponential average (TRIX) of the STH SOPR. The TRIX is a momentum oscillator that shows the percentage change in a metric&#8217;s moving average after smoothening it exponentially three times (hence the name). From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that during this bear market, whenever the STH SOPR 7-day TRIX has hit a positive top, the price of Bitcoin has noticed a local top formation as well and has subsequently gone down. It looks like most recently, the 7-day TRIX of the STH SOPR has shot up again, and the metric seems to be curving inside now, potentially moving toward a top formation. This pattern looks similar to the instances seen earlier in the bear market, which could suggest this Bitcoin rally may be heading toward the same fate as those previous ones. Though that would be only if the pattern does complete and the indicator makes the top. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Rally Stalled For Now The analyst has also posted the chart for the 2018-2019 bear market, to see how the current rally compares with that of April 2019. The trend in the STH SOPR 7-day TRIX in the 2018-2019 bear market &#124; Source: CryptoQuant Interestingly, the rally of April 2019 only felt a short-term pullback from the first big spike in the indicator; it was only with the second spike that the price topped out. There have been some similarities between the current rally and that of April 2019 already, which may mean that the current one could also shrug off this first spike in the indicator and continue its momentum, just like the past rally. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $22,900, up 5% in the last week.

Naturally, the indicator being exactly equal to 1 implies the average holder is just breaking even on their distribution right now.</p>
<p>One of the two main segments of the BTC market is made up of the &#8220;<a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-declines-short-term-holders-take-profits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short-term holders</a>&#8221; (STHs), which is a cohort that includes all investors who acquired their coins within the last 155 days. The holders who have been sitting on their coins for more than this threshold amount are called &#8220;long-term holders&#8221; (LTHs).</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR specifically for the STHs:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone aligncenter" src="https://img.cryptoquant.com/352589/quicktake/IQiAY_5f6505e4ce8c655506f873a04a59e06015c98fd0a6bb0997bd18d0df1d7a2171.png" alt="Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR" width="1280" height="694" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH SOPR (as well as its 7-day moving average) has surged and broken above 1 recently. This means that as the BTC rally has taken place, the STHs have come into profits and they are now selling to harvest these gains.</p>

<p>The chart also includes data for the 7-day triple exponential average (TRIX) of the STH SOPR. The TRIX is a momentum oscillator that shows the percentage change in a metric&#8217;s moving average after smoothening it exponentially three times (hence the name).</p>
<p>From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that during this bear market, whenever the STH SOPR 7-day TRIX has hit a positive top, the price of Bitcoin has noticed a local top formation as well and has subsequently gone down.</p>
<p>It looks like most recently, the 7-day TRIX of the STH SOPR has shot up again, and the metric seems to be curving inside now, potentially moving toward a top formation.</p>
<p>This pattern looks similar to the instances seen earlier in the bear market, which could suggest this Bitcoin rally may be heading toward the same fate as those previous ones. Though that would be only if the pattern does complete and the indicator makes the top.</p>

<p>The analyst has also posted the chart for the 2018-2019 bear market, to see how the current rally compares with that of April 2019.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone aligncenter" src="https://img.cryptoquant.com/352589/quicktake/comment/dRdVV_859b6e2b11cd0e30cd00ffa80cae3bdfd54af6a99119236fd9aea1478b98d9d9.png" alt="Bitcoin 2018-2019 bear market" width="1280" height="694" /></p>

<p>Interestingly, the rally of April 2019 only felt a short-term pullback from the first big spike in the indicator; it was only with the second spike that the price topped out. There have been <a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/repeat-april-2019-bitcoin-rally-levels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some similarities</a> between the current rally and that of April 2019 already, which may mean that the current one could also shrug off this first spike in the indicator and continue its momentum, just like the past rally.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $22,900, up 5% in the last week.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[For traders thinking Solana is controlled by the bears, a popular crypto market analyst, Chris Burniske, is giving a fresh perspective of hope for the major altcoin.    According to the former lead of Ark Invest&#8217;s crypto department, those who think that SOL is generally bedridden in a bearish mood are mistaken. SOL Sets To Make a Breakthrough Burniske said that the Ethereum killer still has a breakthrough opportunity to rally its price despite its reverse down at a resistance level. The prominent analyst urged traders not to be extremely bearish on SOL as the coin would eventually retrace its value. He expects the crypto&#8217;s retracement to occur within the next few months.  Related Reading: Solana Keeps Positive Radiance But Bears Could Dampen The Mood At This Level Burniske, however, cautioned that investors might experience price decline due to the market volatility, which might heighten and cause massive losses for traders who have opened long positions in their leverages. Since the start of the year, Solana has been in a bullish mood and showing signs of resilience and bravery, actually benefiting from the recent market bullishness. Based on the daily and weekly trading movement since the beginning of the year, the current bearish action of SOL can be regarded as a mere retracement, something which is generally seen in other risky assets. Most Ethereum killers, including Solana, are witnessing a similar kind of price reversal, which signals no major panic on the part of the SOL price. Solana Price Analysis Shows Buy Signal Burniske’s projection seems to be right based on technical price analysis. Over the past three months, Solana moved in a sideways trajectory trend at an average price of around the $14 mark. But within the last two weeks, Solana has surged its value by over 68% to trade at an average price of $23.59. At the time of writing, Solana is currently trading at $23.18, down 5.50%, with a trading volume of $801,611,149 in the last 24 hours. The altcoin’s market cap stands at $8.6 billion, which puts it the 10th largest cryptocurrency, according to Coinmarketcap. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Outperforms Top Coins With 28% Gains On Weekly Chart As per the TradingView chart below, the presence of a bullish hammer in the candlesticks signals the buyers are taking back control and pushing the price back above. The green indicator shows the sellers’ inability to drive the price of an asset further down. The 50-day and 200-day moving average settings on the 4-hour price chart further support this bullish trend. The presence of the golden cross, as it is indicated by an asset’s short-term moving average crossing above its long-term moving average, signals a switch from a bear trend to a bull trend. Based on price analysis, the current sentiment is bullish, as this can also be seen in the RSI stands at 64.22, showing that Solana is in the bull territory. Generally, the technical analysis shows that Solana has the potential to regain its value, though it may experience some corrections triggered by macro events.   Featured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shiba Inu has once again been flipped by Litecoin in terms of market cap as the meme coin has recorded losses of 6% in the past 24 hours. Shiba Inu Is Down More Than 6% Today The year 2023 so far has overall been a pleasant time for SHIB holders as the coin is up around 40% year-to-date. But in the past day, the market hasn&#8217;t been so kind on the meme coin as its price has observed some significant decline. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading around $0.00001132, down 6% in the last 24 hours. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the price of the asset over the past month: The value of the crypto seems to have sharply risen during this period &#124; Source: SHIBUSD on TradingView As can be seen in the above graph, Shiba Inu caught an upwards momentum in the first week of this month and continued to rapidly rise until forming a local top above the $0.00001270 level around a week ago. In the days that followed, however, the coin mostly displayed a sideways movement, until today came around and the asset plunged. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Just Saw Technical Correction But Key Uptrend Support Intact Over the last seven days, SHIB is now down around over 8%. For comparison, rival coin Dogecoin has only seen a decline of less than 2% in this period, while Bitcoin has observed decent profits of almost 7%. One question arises here: why did Shiba Inu see such a drop? According to crypto whale tracker service WhaleStats, the DOGE-cousin coin has been the most traded token among the top 100 Ethereum whales today: 📰 JUST IN: $SHIB @Shibtoken flipped $NMR for MOST TRADED token among top 100 #ETH whales Check the top 100 whales here: https://t.co/N5qqsCAH8j (and hodl $BBW to see data for the top 5000!)#SHIB #NMR #whalestats #babywhale #BBW pic.twitter.com/WnD70M3mVj &#8212; WhaleStats (tracking crypto whales) (@WhaleStats) January 25, 2023 While high trading activity from whales can sometimes have a bullish effect on the price, as it may be a sign of accumulation from them, today&#8217;s movements from this cohort may actually have been done with the purpose of selling instead, which would provide an explanation behind the decline in the crypto&#8217;s price.

Bitcoin Rally Shows Similar Break Above These Key Levels Nonetheless, the 500 largest ETH whales were still holding onto more than $600 million worth of SHIB as of yesterday, so even with some short-term selling today, this cohort might have some large long-term positions still set up. 🐳 The top 500 #ETH whales are hodling $606,186,035 $SHIB$149,861,656 $BEST$87,204,580 $LOCUS$82,520,983 $MATIC$70,925,015 $BIT$68,961,547 $LINK$64,312,686 $QNT$62,585,574 $UNI Whale leaderboard 👇https://t.co/tgYTpOm5ws pic.twitter.com/5EWZ77PN4k &#8212; WhaleStats (tracking crypto whales) (@WhaleStats) January 24, 2023 Litecoin Has Flipped SHIB In Market Cap Again Litecoin and Shiba Inu have been fierce rivals on the list of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap in recent weeks, with both coins getting a chance to take the lead at a few different points. With SHIB&#8217;s most recent drawdown, LTC has once more overtaken the meme coin as its decline hasn&#8217;t been as sharp. The below table shows where the two coins stand in the wider crypto sector right now. Looks like SHIB has a market cap of $6.2 billion now &#124; Source: CoinMarketCap From the table, it&#8217;s visible that Shiba Inu has now dropped to being the 14th largest crypto in terms of market cap, while Litecoin has moved up to the 13th position. The coin just below SHIB is the stablecoin Dai, and it&#8217;s not too far off from the meme coin&#8217;s market cap. This means that if SHIB continues to decline, it may quickly fall down to the 15th spot. Featured image from Ferhat Deniz Fors on Unsplash.com, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-517426 size-large aligncenter" src="https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chart-37-860x319.png" alt="Bitcoin Price Chart" width="860" height="319" srcset="https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chart-37-860x319.png 860w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chart-37-460x170.png 460w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chart-37-768x285.png 768w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chart-37-750x278.png 750w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chart-37.png 969w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></p>

<p>As can be seen in the above graph, Shiba Inu caught an upwards momentum in the first week of this month and continued to rapidly rise until forming a local top above the $0.00001270 level around a week ago. In the days that followed, however, the coin mostly displayed a sideways movement, until today came around and the asset plunged.</p>

<p>Over the last seven days, SHIB is now down around over 8%. For comparison, rival coin <a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-whale-5m-doge-coinbase-bearish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dogecoin</a> has only seen a decline of less than 2% in this period, while Bitcoin has observed decent profits of almost 7%.</p>
<p>One question arises here: why did Shiba Inu see such a drop? According to crypto whale tracker service WhaleStats, the DOGE-cousin coin has been the most traded token among the top 100 <a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-surges-whales-elevated-activity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum whales</a> today:</p>

<p>While high trading activity from whales can sometimes have a bullish effect on the price, as it may be a sign of accumulation from them, today&#8217;s movements from this cohort may actually have been done with the purpose of selling instead, which would provide an explanation behind the decline in the crypto&#8217;s price.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the 500 largest ETH whales were still holding onto more than $600 million worth of SHIB as of yesterday, so even with some short-term selling today, this cohort might have some large long-term positions still set up.</p>

<h2>Litecoin Has Flipped SHIB In Market Cap Again</h2>
<p><a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/litecoin/litecoin-expecting-a-pullback/">Litecoin</a> and Shiba Inu have been fierce rivals on the list of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap in recent weeks, with both coins getting a chance to take the lead at a few different points.</p>
<p>With SHIB&#8217;s most recent drawdown, LTC has once more overtaken the meme coin as its decline hasn&#8217;t been as sharp. The below table shows where the two coins stand in the wider crypto sector right now.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-517432 size-large aligncenter" src="https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/data-1-860x451.png" alt="Shiba Inu Vs Litecoin Market Cap" width="860" height="451" srcset="https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/data-1-860x451.png 860w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/data-1-460x241.png 460w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/data-1-768x402.png 768w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/data-1-750x393.png 750w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/data-1.png 895w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></p>

<p>From the table, it&#8217;s visible that Shiba Inu has now dropped to being the 14th largest crypto in terms of market cap, while Litecoin has moved up to the 13th position.</p>
<p>The coin just below SHIB is the stablecoin Dai, and it&#8217;s not too far off from the meme coin&#8217;s market cap. This means that if SHIB continues to decline, it may quickly fall down to the 15th spot.</p>
