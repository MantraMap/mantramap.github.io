<p>BTC/USD Tests 30862 Target:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 5 July 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) retraced part of its recent pullback early in the Asian session as the pair moved back above the 31000 figure after trading as low as the 30870.63 area, representing a test of a downside price objective related to recent selling pressure around the 31333 and 31097 areas.&nbsp; The recent sell-off to the 29417.14 area represented a test of the 38.2% retracement of the appreciating range from 26165.98 to 31443.67.&nbsp; This depreciation occurred after BTC/USD rallied higher to the 30277 area, its strongest print in several trading sessions, and increased the possibility of a test of the 28604.83 area.&nbsp; The pair&rsquo;s recent print around the 31443.67 area was a twelve-month high and test of an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.</p>
