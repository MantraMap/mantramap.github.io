					<description><![CDATA[With the NFT market plummeting, more than 1,200 NFTs have been liquidated in the past three days, which is the most significant liquidation in the history of the NFT. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The NFT market plunged, and a series of large collections witnessed a dizzying drop in prices.</em></li>



<li><em>Over 1244 NFTs have been liquidated in the past four days, the largest liquidation in NFT&#8217;s history.</em></li>



<li><em>Among the most significant losers is the Azuki ecosystem native NFT.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>With the NFT market plummeting, more than 1,200 NFTs have been liquidated in the past three days, which is the most significant liquidation in the history of the NFT. The heaviest damage is the collections from the Azuki ecosystem.</strong></h5>

<p>CirrusNFT states there have been 1244 liquidations in the last 96 hours. This does not include forced sellers who sold their collateral to pay off loans before they were underwater. This is considered the most catastrophic liquidation in the history of NFT, and it shows no signs of stopping.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Over the last few days, we&#39;ve seen the worst liquidation cascade in the history of NFTs and its not really close<br><br>There were 1244 Liquidations in the last 96 hours (This  excludes forced sellers that sold their collateral to repay loans before they were underwater)<br><br>For referenceâ€¦ <a href="https://t.co/3cpy8tDHi5" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/3cpy8tDHi5</a></p>&mdash; Cirrus (@CirrusNFT) <a href="https://twitter.com/CirrusNFT/status/1675972560020967424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 3, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>During this liquidation, the Azuki ecosystem was the hardest hit. With 10-15 NFT loans liquidated, more than 630 Beanz and about 3% of total Beanz NFT liquidated. The good news is that the liquidation rate has slowed significantly in the last few hours, and there are not many loans under water anymore.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-177.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="680" height="525" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-177.png" alt="Bloody NFT Market, Over 1200 NFTs Liquidated in the Last 4 Days" class="wp-image-199857" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-177.png 680w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-177-300x232.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" title="Bloody NFT Market, Over 1200 NFTs Liquidated in the Last 4 Days 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Some of the hardest-hit NFT collections originate from the Azuki ecosystem. In the last week, the Azuki, Elemental, and Azuki Elemental Beanz collections have all seen their floor price <a href="https://coincu.com/199468-azuki-nft-floor-price-dropped-54-last-7-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drop</a> by more than 20% in just 24 hours as they have come under heavy criticism from the community.</p>



<p>Specifically, amid a chaotic market, the popular NFT creator still launched a new collection of Azuki Elemental and quickly collected $38 million in just 15 sales. However, the community feels highly disappointed. Elemental&#8217;s new design is generally no different from the original collection, Azuki (released in February 2022), and is accused by the community of defrauding users in the 20,000 ETH <a href="https://coincu.com/199572-azukidaos-lawsuit-zagabond-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reclaim lawsuit</a> announced yesterday.</p>



<p>Since Azuki&#8217;s Elemental collection dropped, the Azuki collection overall has dropped below 6 ETH. Furthermore, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) saw a 16% drop, falling below the 30 ETH mark regarding floor prices. On the other hand, Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) drops 20%, to less than 5 ETH.</p>



<p>Yuga Labs&#8217; latest crypto game product, HV-MTL, has dropped its floor price sharply. Yuga Labs is also down more than 24% since the beginning of this month.</p>

<p>According to a recent update, AzukiDao&#8217;s lawsuit has not been taken place, but last night, Azuki DAO&#8217;s management token contract <a href="https://coincu.com/199775-azukidao-suffers-exploit-leads-to-35-eth-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was attacked </a>because of a security flaw. The attackers have now extracted 35 ETH. Vulnerability is mainly because lines of code are not thoroughly tested. Currently, the contract has been suspended.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Digital Asset exchange Alliance (DAXA), will implement a virtual asset alert system from July 4.</em></li>



<li><em>The early warning system includes five categories: price fluctuations, trading volume, spiked deposit volume, arbitrage, and concentrated trading of a small number of accounts.</em></li>



<li><em>The alert system will focus on resolving the imbalance of user information by promptly informing the public of information that is not easily known through charts or order books.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Korean media reports, Digital Asset exchange Alliance (<a href="https://coincu.com/191385-daxa-ethical-standards-virtual-asset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DAXA</a>), which includes five major South Korean virtual asset exchanges, Gopax, Bithumb, Upbit, Korbit and Coinone, announced that the virtual asset alert system will start on July 4.â€‹</strong></h5>

<p>A virtual asset alert system has been implemented. The early warning system includes five categories: price fluctuations, trading volume, spiked deposit volume, arbitrage, and concentrated trading of a small number of accounts. It is enabled through real-time monitoring by various exchanges.</p>



<p>It is known that if an item that matches the specific conditions of each alert system is detected, it will be reported as a badge in the trading window of that item, and it will be displayed in 24 hours maximum.</p>



<p>When considering differences in trading volumes, etc., the internal standards of each member company are followed within the scope of the conditions.</p>

<p>BRC-69 is a revolutionary standard for creating recursive <a href="https://coincu.com/192136-bitcoin-developers-restricting-brc-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ordinals collections</a> quickly. This standard will be the engine that launches recursive collections on Bitcoin.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f7e8.png" alt="ðŸŸ¨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (1/7) GM! Today, we&#39;re excited to introduce BRC69, a revolutionary standard for creating Recursive <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ordinals?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#Ordinals</a> collections with ease.

<p>BRC-69 can reduce the costs of inscriptions for Ordinals collections by over 90%. This reduction is achieved through a 4-step process:</p>



<ul>
<li>(1) inscribe traits,</li>



<li>(2) deploy collection,</li>



<li>(3) compile collections,</li>



<li>(4) mint assets.</li>
</ul>



<p>The brilliance of BRC-69 lies in its simplicity. Minters only need to inscribe a single line of text instead of a full image. This text allows the final image to be automatically rendered on all ordinals-frontends, using solely on-chain resources, thanks to recursive inscriptions.</p>



<p>With this new standard, a perfectly rendered image. Unlike other SVG recursive collections, these images can be dragged, dropped, and saved as typical image-type Ordinals.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the BRC-69 offers great flexibility and allows for more improvements and features. For instance, launching collections with a fully on-chain pre-disclosure process is now possible. The new standard will be tested with upcoming launches on Luminex.</p>

<p>Scams and exploits became rampant as Ordinals introduced<a href="https://coincu.com/186748-bitcoin-ordinals-bitcoin-nft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> NFT-like digital media</a> etching and later meme tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. Last week, the Ordinals space saw an attack described by some users as the largest to date.</p>



<p>Earlier on June 9, a new meme token project called ORNG was launched through a fake website called &#8220;Luminux,&#8221; which many people mistook for Luminex.</p>



<p>Shortly after, Twitter users complained about their Bitcoin wallets being drained after signing a transaction to mint a new meme token. It is unclear exactly how much money was stolen in the attack, but the wallet involved in the scam obtained approximately 2.37 Bitcoins (worth around $63,000).</p>



<p>Luminex and Bitcoin wallet creation company <a href="https://coincu.com/188594-xverse-wallet-connecting-bitcoin-ordinals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xverse</a> are among the companies warning users about the scam and posting details on Twitter on how to avoid falling into the same trap.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, has accused DCG of fraudulent behavior and fostering a culture of lies and deceit.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Key Points:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Winklevoss accuses Digital Currency Group of fraud, highlighting trapped assets and deceitful practices in an open letter.</em></li>



<li><em>DCG was accused of evading responsibility and prioritizing litigation over resolution.</em></li>



<li><em>The letter presents a final offer, threatens legal action, and calls for accountability.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a scathing open letter addressed to Barry Silbert, the CEO of Digital Currency Group (DCG), Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of <a href="https://coincu.com/190296-gemini-fights-against-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gemini</a>, has accused the company of fraudulent behavior and fostering a culture of lies and deceit. The letter, written on behalf of 232,000 Earn users who have over $1.2 billion of assets trapped in Genesis, a company owned by DCG, highlights the dire situation faced by these users.</strong></h5>

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/180216-winklevoss-twins-loan-100m-to-gemini/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Winklevoss</a> reminds Silbert that it has been 229 days since Genesis halted withdrawals, and it has been 174 days since his last open letter to Silbert. He points out that despite detailed allegations of false and misleading statements made by Silbert, DCG employees, and DCG companies to creditors, no direct response or refutation has been provided.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Earn Update: An Open Letter to <a href="https://twitter.com/BarrySilbert?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@BarrySilbert</a> <a href="https://t.co/ErsYpcEjQD" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/ErsYpcEjQD</a></p>&mdash; Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1676024844641550337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 4, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The letter further emphasizes that <a href="https://coincu.com/191758-dcg-wants-to-consolidate-class-actions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DCG</a> has shown no intention of finding a global, consensual resolution with creditors and Earn users. Instead, Winklevoss claims that DCG has been buying time to raise money and avoid taking responsibility for the financial mess caused by fraudulent behavior within the company.</p>



<p>Specific allegations are made against DCG, including engaging in fraudulent transactions and falsifying balance sheets to hide Genesis&#8217;s insolvency. Winklevoss accuses DCG of manipulating the situation to evade responsibility and focus on litigation over a promissory note rather than prioritizing the interests of creditors and Earn users.</p>



<p>Winklevoss raises concerns about the abuse of the mediation process, which has granted DCG an indefinite forbearance on a $630 million debt owed to Genesis. This forbearance denies creditors and Earn users the funds they are owed and weakens their position in negotiations. He argues that the mediation process has been counterproductive, leading to delays and ballooning professional fees.</p>

<p>To put an end to the ongoing saga, Winklevoss presents a best and final offer to Silbert, which he deems fair and reasonable for all parties involved. Failure to accept the offer by the specified deadline will result in legal action, including lawsuits, turnover demands, and UCC litigation.</p>



<p>The letter concludes with a call for Silbert to do the right thing and acknowledges the disappointment in his behavior. Winklevoss contrasts Silbert&#8217;s alleged lack of accountability with the actions of another individual involved, Sam Bankman-Fried, who acknowledged the harm caused and attempted to rectify the situation.</p>

<p>As this dispute unfolds, creditors and Earn users eagerly await Silbert&#8217;s response and the potential implications for the resolution of their trapped assets. The cryptocurrency industry will also be closely watching this high-profile case, which sheds light on issues of transparency, accountability, and the responsible management of user funds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Nasdaq has refiled an application for a Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock with more details.</em></li>



<li><em>Coinbase will offer market monitoring for the ETF, addressing surveillance concerns.</em></li>



<li><em>Major financial institutions joining the Bitcoin ETF battle bring renewed confidence, despite Coinbase facing a lawsuit from the SEC.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to an <a href="https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/assets/rulebook/NASDAQ/filings/SR-NASDAQ-2023-016_Resubmission.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">application</a> made public on Monday, Nasdaq refiled an application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list an exchange-traded fund (ETF) by BlackRock that would represent the price of Bitcoin to include more specifics.</strong></h5>

<p>The exchange filed additional paperwork with the SEC indicating that Coinbase Global Inc. would offer market monitoring in support of the world&#8217;s biggest asset manager&#8217;s proposed ETF. The action occurred after the regulatory body said that issuers&#8217; first filings were unsatisfactory and lacked crucial information.</p>



<p>Fidelity Investments, Invesco, VanEck, 21Shares, and WisdomTree all amended their bids last week, as did a number of other firms.</p>



<p>Cboe Global Markets also submitted applications on behalf of major asset management Fidelity Investments and Ark Invest, both of whom picked Coinbase as its SSA partner.</p>



<p>According to the recent Nasdaq filing, the exchange agreed to a surveillance-sharing deal with Coinbase on June 8. Year to far, Coinbase has accounted for around 56% of dollar-to-Bitcoin trade on US-based platforms.</p>

<p>Based on a view of the SEC&#8217;s earlier judgments, the sponsor of a Bitcoin trust must engage in a surveillance-sharing arrangement with a regulated market of considerable scale to achieve regulatory approval.</p>



<p>Analysts believe that monitoring the crypto market will be critical to obtaining SEC clearance for a spot Bitcoin ETF. The monitoring might significantly minimize fraud and market manipulation, which were the primary reasons the SEC rejected about 30 spot Bitcoin ETF applications to yet.</p>

<p>For years, the SEC has denied such petitions, and there was a time in 2022 when most corporations hoped that the agency would modify its approach in the near future. But, the entry of big conventional financial institutions into the battle has sparked renewed confidence.</p>



<p>Last month, the government also sued Coinbase for failing to register as an exchange. Coinbase said in a letter filed last month in federal court in Manhattan that it will ask a judge to dismiss the SEC lawsuit, arguing that the regulator lacks the authority to pursue civil claims because the crypto assets trading on its platform are not &#8220;investment contracts,&#8221; and thus not securities.</p>

<p>Despite the news of filings for spot ETFs and speculation about whether the US Securities and Exchange Commission will approve them, Bitcoin has had a strong start to the week.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the BTC price is at $31,000, with trading volume up more than 57% in the past 24 hours. This is the 3rd time BTC has reached this price level in 2023.</p>

<p>As soon as BTC hit $31,000, the shares of crypto companies like <a href="https://coincu.com/198580-microstrategy-now-holds-4-6-billion-btc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MicroStrategy</a>, <a href="https://coincu.com/199344-coinbase-support-valkyrie-bitwise-btc-spot-etfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a>, Riot Blockchain, and Marathon Digital saw impressive gains.</p>



<p>On Monday, shares of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN), which was designated as the market for surveillance-sharing agreements in the ETF applications, jumped more than 10% to more than $80. MicroStrategy (MSTR) had its stock rise by roughly 10% to $375.</p>

<p>The increase in the price of COIN can be seen as a positive move from each exchange&#8217;s partnerships extended through adjustments of Bitcoin ETF spot applications.</p>



<p>Cboe has been working with a number of providers, including Fidelity, WisdomTree, and ARK Invest, to finally get an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF authorized by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the meanwhile, BlackRock is doing the same thing with Nasdaq.</p>



<p>Cboe refiled after their petitions were denied by the SEC for failing to name the exchange with whom they were collaborating on surveillance-sharing arrangements.</p>



<p>The Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 indices, on the other hand, stayed essentially unaltered, underlining Bitcoin&#8217;s apparent negative association with conventional equities markets.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cryptocurrency spot trading volumes dropped significantly in Q2, hitting the lowest level since 2020. Binance saw a notable decline of over 10%.</em></li>



<li><em>The SEC charged the exchange for operating an unregistered securities exchange, impacting the exchange&#8217;s market share.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance.US experienced a dramatic increase in quarterly volumes, surpassing Bitcoin and Ethereum trading with altcoins during the bull run.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Kaiko&#8217;s recent <a href="https://25446524.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/25446524/Kaiko_Research_Q2_Market_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>, spot trade volumes decreased drastically in the second quarter, dropping to the lowest level since 2020, with <a href="https://coincu.com/198927-binance-custody-license-in-germany/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> plummeting over 10%.</strong></h5>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://coincu.com/196317-binance-is-under-siege-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made</a> headlines in June when it initially charged Binance, <a href="https://coincu.com/197209-binanceus-now-reject-sec-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance.US</a>, and CEO Changpeng Zhao with running an unregistered securities exchange, broker-dealer, and clearing agency.</p>



<p>According to the report, Binance.US&#8217;s quarterly volumes increased dramatically, rising from $5 billion to $42 billion to $106 billion in only three quarters. Importantly, altcoin volume exceeded BTC and ETH volume combined over the duration of the bull run, which is quite rare for US exchanges.</p>

<p>Binance ended the previous quarter by reintroducing trading fees for the BTC-USDT and BTC-BUSD spot pairings, the report said. This, together with large SEC and CFTC cases, has resulted in the exchange market share of spot volumes falling from 64% to 53%. Its portion has gone to a number of exchanges, with Bybit and OKX faring the best in what is clearly a better market framework for exchange competition. Coinbase&#8217;s market share has fallen from 8% to 5.4%.</p>

<p>The report also mentions the USDT event temporarily fell to $0.995 in mid-June ahead of CoinDesk and Bloomberg publications revealing the stablecoin&#8217;s backing in 2021, which revealed that some money was in commercial paper issued by Chinese financial institutions. </p>



<p>The following chart depicts Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) for key USDT pairings, including those traded on DEXes. It suggests that there was significant USD selling on Binance exchange four days before the article was revealed and three days before USDT depegged, implying that bigger holders were aware of the upcoming news.</p>



<p>DEXs also facilitated considerable selling, with Uniswap V3 enabling $150mn net selling and Curve&#8217;s 3pool supporting $150mn net selling, divided approximately equally between USDT-USDC and USDT-DAI.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The cryptocurrency market has shown signs of recovery with a net influx of assets into digital asset funds for the second consecutive week, led by Bitcoin.</em></li>



<li><em>Crypto funds received $124.7 million in the week prior to June 30, following an inflow of $199.1 million the previous week.</em></li>



<li><em>Bitcoin dominated the inflows, receiving $123 million, while other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP, and Cardano also saw net inflows. </em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>While the cryptocurrency market recovered, there was a net influx of assets into digital asset funds for the second week in a row, with Bitcoin (BTC) leading.</strong></h5>

<p>According to a CoinShares report <a href="https://coinshares.com/research/digital-asset-fund-flows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> on July 3, all crypto funds received $124.7 million in the week before June 30.</p>



<p>After $199.1 million the previous week, more than $100 million in money poured into digital asset funds for the second week in a row, reflecting the market&#8217;s general sentiment.</p>



<p>According to the report, net inflows into cryptocurrency funds during the last two weeks were $334 million, or over 1% of total digital asset fund assets under management.</p>



<p>$123 million was pumped into Bitcoin funds by asset last week, representing 98% of overall inflows. The Ethereum fund received $2.7 million. Funds for Litecoin, XRP, and Cardano also had net inflows.</p>

<p>A short Bitcoin fund that bets on Bitcoin&#8217;s collapse has lost money for 10 weeks in a row, with $900,000 withdrawn. Notwithstanding the current bearishness for short bitcoin, the report states that it is still the second-best performing asset in terms of inflows year so far, with $60 million.</p>



<p>BTC&#8217;s price increased for the second quarter in a row. The price of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency grew by more than 8% between April and June.</p>



<p>Once BlackRock, the world&#8217;s biggest asset management, Fidelity Investments, and others filed for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, investors grew more hopeful.</p>



<p>Bitcoin trade volume has increased by more than 60% in the last 24 hours. The coin is still trading for more than $30,500.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Archway, a Cosmos-based incentivized smart contract platform, has launched its mainnet.</em></li>



<li><em>The blockchain aims to reward dApp developers and validators with its token supply.</em></li>



<li><em>Archway&#8217;s protocol utilizes a value capture engine to calculate gas generated by smart contracts in dApps and distribute tokens accordingly.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Archway, a Cosmos-based incentivized smart contract platform, has <a href="https://twitter.com/archwayHQ/status/1675837247537704961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> its mainnet.</strong></h5>

<p>The network intends to dedicate a part of Archway&#8217;s token supply to decentralized apps, with 25% going to app creators and the remaining 75% going to validators.</p>



<p>Developers that create apps using Archway, according to Archway co-founder Griffin Anderson, will have a major interest in the underlying protocol, similar to how validators and miners get paid for verifying the network.</p>



<p>On March 24, Phi Labs concluded a $21 million initial round of funding headed by CoinFund and Hashed, with participation from 1confirmation, IDEO CoLab, Figment, Blockchain Capital, Wintermute, Chorus One, stake.fish, Lemniscap, Cosmostation, and Hypersphere Ventures. The increased funds would be used to expand the company&#8217;s employees, create new products, and build up the Archway protocol. The team presently has roughly 20 full-time personnel, with hopes to increase that number to more than 50 by the end of the year.</p>

<p>The Archway protocol, invented by Phi Labs, is considered to be an incentivized smart contract platform built on <a href="https://coincu.com/189300-cosmos-serious-chaotic-legal-battle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmos</a> and paying developers. Its dApp developers will be paid in proportion to the value they generate. The value capture engine module, in particular, allows the protocol to compute the amount of gas created by each smart contract in the Dapp and immediately transfer the proportion of tokens gained via time distribution to the wallet address of each relevant smart contract.</p>



<p>For example, if a developer creates a stablecoin project utilizing Archway&#8217;s infrastructure, the network will give ARCH tokens to the originator every time a stablecoin is moved. Moreover, if a contract on Archway is called by another contract, both the calling contract and the originating contract will get ARCH tokens. This implies that if the stablecoin is utilized on another network&#8217;s dApp, both the stablecoin issuer and the calling contract will get ARCH.</p>



<p>There are many ways that project owners might use ARCH incentives to enhance the economics of minting, transferring, and burning stablecoins. Stablecoin issuers, for example, may choose to deposit their ARCH rewards into a reserve pool, and these ARCH tokens can then be utilized for specific DeFi transactions through issuance/transfer.</p>



<p>Earlier, on June 16, CoinList began selling ARCH tokens. Last year, CoinFund and Hashed launched a $21 million seed round for Archway creator Phi Labs.</p>
