It was developed to help businesses in the film, animation, gaming, and architecture industries complete complicated rendering projects quickly and affordably. To fulfill the need of large-scale rendering projects, the RNDR Network offers a scalable and decentralized solution by letting users leverage underutilized GPU capacity from other network participants to speed up their rendering processes. The RNDR coin is the in-network currency that may be exchanged for computer power, staked for network rewards, and used to elect leaders. In sum, the RNDR Network utilizes blockchain technology and distributed computing in an effort to completely overhaul the rendering process.

So, the recent uptick in RNDR should not come as a surprise: widespread consensus among the rendering community to get ready for the inevitable increase in demand. Render debuted in 2017 and spent the first half of 2018 in private sale. Render takes advantage of Ethereum&#8217;s built-in security features when uploading and transferring nodes to operators, as the network is based on the Ethereum blockchain.
