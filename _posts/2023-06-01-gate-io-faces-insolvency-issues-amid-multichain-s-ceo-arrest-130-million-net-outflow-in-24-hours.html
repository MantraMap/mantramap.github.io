Gate.io Denies Liquidity Issues  The rumors about Gate.io&#8217;s insolvency stem from a tweet alleging a connection between the exchange and Multichain following the arrest of Multichain CEO Zhaojun. The tweet claimed that Gate.io was facing insolvency due to its involvement with Multichain and the potential impact of Zhaojun&#8217;s arrest on the Multichain treasury. Despite these rumors, Gate.io has disputed insolvency claims and reassured its users that all funds are safe. The cryptocurrency exchange has recently stated to address rumors about its operations and withdrawals. Gate.io has reassured users that its operations are sound, withdrawals are working properly, and there are no problems with rumored operations or withdrawals. Furthermore, Gate.io emphasizes its commitment to providing users with safe, fast, and reliable virtual asset services and encourages users to be cautious of any unsolicited calls or messages claiming to be from Gate.io. The exchange currently holds $2.4 billion in assets, including 18% in Gate.io’s native token GT, 15% in Ethereum (ETH), 15% in Bitcoin (BTC), and other cryptocurrencies. Despite these reassurances, the increase in withdrawals from Gate.io highlights the impact that rumors and speculation can have on the crypto market, particularly in times of uncertainty. However, Gate.io has stated that it has no direct connection to Multichain and that Zhaojun&#8217;s arrest does not affect its operations. The exchange has also emphasized that all funds are held in cold storage, providing an additional layer of security for user assets. Binance CEO CZ Issues Warning Binance CEO CZ has recently advised investors to Secure Asset Fund for User (SAFU) after citing a tweet from Multichain, which reported multiple issues with their protocol due to unforeseeable circumstances. The tweet stated that the team had done everything possible to maintain the protocol running but could not contact CEO Zhaojun and obtain the necessary server access for maintenance. The tweet also mentioned an issue with the scanning node network of Router5, which affected the normal cross-chain service of some chains. To protect users&#8217; interests, the corresponding cross-chain service for the affected chain was suspended on the User Interface (UI). This issue was also reported to have occurred on Router2 the week prior.
