The regulator explained that the defendants falsely claimed that Coindeal &#8220;would generate investment returns of more than 500,000 times for investors.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>SEC Takes Action Against Coindeal Crypto Fraud</h2>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced Wednesday that it has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-2.pdf">charged</a> the creator of crypto investment scheme Coindeal and seven others in connection with the $45 million fraud.</p>
<p>Describing Coindeal as &#8220;a brazen and far-reaching unregistered offering fraud conducted between at least 2018 and 2022,&#8221; the securities regulator detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Coindeal … raised more than $45 million from sales of unregistered securities to tens of thousands of investors worldwide.</p></blockquote>
<p>The SEC explained that creator Neil Chandran and promoters Garry Davidson, Michael Glaspie, Amy Mossel, and Linda Knott &#8220;falsely claimed that investors could generate extravagant returns by investing in a blockchain technology called Coindeal that would be sold for trillions of dollars to a group of prominent and wealthy buyers.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the regulator said no Coindeal sale ever occurred and no distributions were made to investors. The defendants &#8220;collectively misappropriated millions of dollars of investor funds for personal use, and Chandran used investor funds to purchase items such as cars, real estate, and a boat,&#8221; the SEC wrote.</p>
<p>The securities watchdog also charged AEO Publishing Inc., Banner Co-Op Inc., and Bannersgo LLC for their involvement in the fraudulent crypto investment scheme.</p>

<p>Daniel Gregus, director of the SEC&#8217;s Chicago Regional Office, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We allege the defendants falsely claimed access to valuable blockchain technology and that the imminent sale of the technology would generate investment returns of more than 500,000 times for investors.</p></blockquote>
<p>The director added: &#8220;As alleged in our complaint, in reality, this was all just an elaborate scheme where the defendants enriched themselves while defrauding tens of thousands of retail investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>In June last year, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indicted Chandran on three counts of wire fraud and two counts of monetary transaction in unlawful proceeds in connection with the Coindeal crypto fraud scheme.</p>

<h2>Top IRS Official Says Crypto Is Here to Stay</h2>
<p>Thomas Fattorusso, acting special agent-in-charge of the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI)&#8217;s New York office, talked about cryptocurrency in an interview with The Wall Street Journal earlier this week.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t be hostile to the technology. We have to embrace it,&#8221; the IRS official emphasized, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cryptocurrency is here to stay. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, it isn&#8217;t going anywhere anytime soon and it&#8217;s becoming more legitimate. As the years roll on, it becomes more sophisticated.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fattorusso explained that the IRS is looking to partner with crypto companies. &#8220;My thought is that those relationships will develop as the years go on and [as] the companies become more comfortable with dealing with the federal government. I don&#8217;t see how we can operate in this space without it,&#8221; he opined.</p>

<p>Commenting on the IRS cooperating and partnering with crypto firms, Fattorusso shared:</p>
<blockquote><p>That&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re always working toward … that&#8217;s always the end goal — to have those partnerships and to have a relationship that isn&#8217;t contentious, more of a symbiotic relationship.</p></blockquote>
<p>He believes that partnering with federal agencies &#8220;helps them [crypto companies] in their legitimacy.&#8221; The IRS official added: &#8220;This is a new industry for everybody. I think we&#8217;re still trying to feel our way around it. The companies are feeling their way around it.&#8221;</p>
<p>In November last year, IRS Criminal Investigation chief Jim Lee said that the tax authority is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/irs-building-hundreds-of-crypto-cases-official-says-7-billion-in-crypto-seized-in-2022/">building</a> &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of crypto cases.</p>

However, a number of experts, computer scientists, and cryptographers do not believe the researchers have made a significant discovery, based on the scientific paper published in Dec. 2022.</strong></p>
<h2>Quantum Computing Race Heats Up as Chinese Researchers Claim Breakthrough in RSA Encryption</h2>
<p>In Sept. 2022, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-vs-quantum-computers-us-government-says-post-quantum-world-is-getting-closer-cisa-warns-contemporary-encryption-could-break/">warned</a> that a post-quantum world was coming soon and stressed that contemporary encryption techniques could break. Months later, in December 2022, a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12372.pdf">scientific paper</a> published by 24 Chinese researchers claimed to have broken 2048-bit RSA encryption using a quantum computer. The paper follows a <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2022/04/china-may-have-just-taken-lead-quantum-computing-race/365707/">report</a> from April 2022 that detailed that China was &#8220;taking the lead&#8221; in the quantum computing race.</p>

<p>Basically, a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/breaking-bitcoin-crypto-proponents-discuss-honeywells-6-qubit-quantum-computer/">quantum computer</a> is a type of computational device that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena and can perform operations on data faster than classical computers can perform computational tasks. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA</a> is named after its creators, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, and is widely used on today&#8217;s computer systems. It is an example of a public-key cryptography system, which means that modern computers often use it to encrypt and decrypt messages.</p>
<p>On January 5, 2023, the Financial Times (FT) <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b15680c0-cf31-448d-9eb6-b30426c29b8b">reported</a> on the paper that alleges Chinese researchers have claimed success in breaking RSA encryption. FT questioned a few experts about the paper, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cryptography-Apocalypse-Preparing-Quantum-Computing/dp/1119618193">Roger Grimes</a>, a computer security expert and author, told FT: “It’s a huge claim — It would mean that governments could crack other governments&#8217; secrets. If it’s true — a big if — it would be a secret like out of the movies, and one of the biggest things ever in computer science.”</p>
<p>There is also a Google Groups <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/AkfdRQS4yoY/m/3plDftUEAgAJ?pli=1">conversation</a> where people are debating whether Chinese researchers have factored in 2048-bit integers. <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/about/">Bruce Schneier</a>, a computer security and cryptography expert, published an <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/01/breaking-rsa-with-a-quantum-computer.html">analysis</a> and stated that the paper relies on a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/933">disputed paper</a> written by Peter Schnorr, a German mathematician. Schneier also shared his opinion with the Financial Times about the so-called quantum computing breakthrough. &#8220;We have no empirical proof that the [new] quantum algorithm overcomes the Schnorr scaling problem,&#8221; Schneier told the FT. &#8220;There&#8217;s no reason to believe it won&#8217;t—but there&#8217;s no reason to believe it will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quantum computing&#8217;s potential to break contemporary encryption techniques has worried crypto proponents for some time. However, some believe that if quantum computers can break encryption, it will be a closely guarded secret. When asked if he thought a quantum computer could break Bitcoin&#8217;s cryptography, Bitcoin evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos once <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5wc9bj/is_bitcoin_quantumproof_andreas_explains/">said</a>, &#8220;The last thing they are going to use that on is Bitcoin.&#8221; Antonopoulos added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cause the moment you use it on Bitcoin you announce to the world we have quantum cryptography that can break [the] elliptic curve — Guess what happens? Your nuclear rivals upgrade their cryptography very easily and try to implement quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking with the FT, cryptography expert Bruce Schneier concluded that while the researchers&#8217; paper may turn out to be unfounded, the race for a quantum computer to break encryption is heating up. &#8220;The betting is, as in all these cases, breaking RSA won&#8217;t work—but someday that bet will be wrong,&#8221; Schneier said.</p>

The share price plunge came just days after U.S. prosecutors reportedly seized collapsed crypto exchange FTX&#8217;s accounts held at the bank. Alan Lane, the CEO of Silvergate, denied allegations that the bank does not adhere to banking rules. </strong></p>
<h2>Silvergate to Cut Workforce by 40%</h2>
<p>The value of the shares of the crypto-focused bank Silvergate Capital reportedly plunged by more than 40% after it reported a sharp drop in its fourth-quarter (Q4) digital currency-related assets. Overall, the bank’s shares have seen their value drop by 69% since the crypto exchange FTX’s spectacular collapse in November 2022.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the more than $8 billion drop in crypto-related deposits, Silvergate said it would attempt to rein on losses by cutting its workforce by 40%. As explained by a Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/silvergate-capitals-crypto-related-deposits-plunge-fourth-quarter-2023-01-05/">report</a>, Silvergate’s preliminary earnings report appeared to blame crypto exchange FTX’s collapse for the drop in customer deposits from $11.9 billion in September to $3.8 billion by the end of Q4.</p>
<p>Silvergate’s confirmation of the drop in customer deposits came a day after a United States attorney told a bankruptcy court that U.S. prosecutors had seized bank accounts at the crypto-focused bank and Farmington State Bank. According to the report, court records show that the bank accounts held around $143 million.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>CEO Denies Bank Secrecy Act Violation Allegations</h2>
<p>Besides the $718 million loss incurred after it was forced to sell debt securities at $5.2 billion, Silvergate reportedly said it would “take an impairment charge of $196 million” on the blockchain-based payment solution it acquired from Diem.</p>
<p>In his conference call with analysts before the release of the preliminary earnings report, Silvergate&#8217;s CEO Alan Lane reportedly rejected assertions the bank does not adhere to know your customer and Bank Secrecy Act requirements.</p>
<p>“The misinformation out there is candidly very frustrating. We follow the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act for every account that we open, and we conduct ongoing monitoring,” Lane reportedly said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the time of writing, Silvergate’s after-hours (07:59 PM EST) share price was $11.93.</p>

However, Huobi&#x2019;s advisor Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, told the South China Morning Post that the layoff reports were untrue. A Huobi spokesperson later confirmed that the staff cuts are true and Huobi plans to maintain &#x201C;a very lean team&#x201D; going forward.</strong></p>
<h2>Huobi&#x2019;s Justin Sun Denies Layoffs Amid Controversy and Alleged Employee Protests</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/fintech-crypto-huobi-idUSL4N33R0ZA">reports</a>, digital currency exchange Huobi has laid off approximately 20% of its staff. Colin Wu first reported on the situation on Dec. 30, 2022, and <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1608774459124781059?s=20&t=NFrxEHxBgDWZrNA3c1oGnw">said:</a> &#x201C;Justin Sun&#x2019;s Huobi exchange will cancel all year-end bonuses, and will prepare to lay off the team of 1,200 people to 600-800 people, and cut the salaries of senior employees, according to several insiders.&#x201D; Wu later added an update on Jan. 5, <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1610615698254102529?s=20&t=NFrxEHxBgDWZrNA3c1oGnw">stating</a> that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Justin Sun&#x2019;s HR is communicating with all Huobi employees to change [their] salary form from fiat currency to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>/USDC; employees who cannot accept it may be dismissed. The move sparked protests from some employees.</p></blockquote>
<p>As speculation grew, Sun was <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3205330/justin-sun-exiled-china-born-crypto-guru-denies-lay-talks-crypto-exchange-huobi">asked</a> about the situation by reporters from the South China Morning Post (SCMP) and denied the layoffs were taking place. However, a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/06/huobi-exchange-token-down-11-on-reports-of-layoffs-internal-strife-at-company/">report</a> by Coindesk confirmed that the layoff speculation was true. &#x201C;With the current state of the bear market, a very lean team will be maintained going forward,&#x201D; a Huobi spokesperson told Coindesk via email.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/HuobiGlobal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@HuobiGlobal</a> is an exchange that was founded in 2013 and has since grown to become one of the most popular exchanges in the world. Huobi has a strong focus on technology and security,and it has implemented a number of measures to ensure the safety of its users and their assets.</p>
<p>&#x2014; H.E. Justin Sun&#x1F31E;&#x1F1EC;&#x1F1E9;&#x1F1E9;&#x1F1F2;&#x1F525; (@justinsuntron) <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1611260008171438081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In addition to the staff cuts, another <a href="https://twitter.com/Cryptadamist/status/1611129612217778176?s=20&t=Kb_ivRVwXsgdST5IhdpneQ">report</a> stemming from Twitter suggests that Huobi employees have created fake accounts on Twitter to complain to Sun about the situation. &#x201C;Apparently Justin Sun tried to dissolve the company (which would presumably leave all the employees unemployed),&#x201D; the report detailed. The report also <a href="https://twitter.com/Cryptadamist/status/1611154526643290116?s=20&t=Kb_ivRVwXsgdST5IhdpneQ">stated</a> that Huobi&#x2019;s issues were similar to the situation when the &#x201C;Hooexchange CEO rug pulled his employees.&#x201D;</p>
<p>On Jan. 5, 2023, Sun tried to reassure the community that everything was fine in a tweet published in Chinese. A rough translation of the tweet says:</p>
<blockquote><p>The recent business development momentum [Huobi Global is] good, and the core indicators have maintained high-speed growth. The average daily growth rate of the number of new registered users and capital inflows exceeds the peak in 2022. And the first thousand times coins such as Pi and Bonk were born, and the trading volume of related currencies ranked first in the industry, leading a number of industry hotspots and continuing to drive the recovery of the market.</p></blockquote>

<p>According to the <a href="https://twitter.com/Cryptadamist/status/1611166812476932099?s=20&t=cXEYtOJOPtpZ8EWSTkKEZA">Twitter report</a>, there have been many responses written in Chinese claiming that things are not going well at Huobi. One <a href="https://twitter.com/BitRunX/status/1610914266663759874?s=20&t=Kb_ivRVwXsgdST5IhdpneQ">specific tweet</a> written in Chinese alleges that Huobi&#x2019;s &#x201C;Merkle tree and trading volume officially announced by Huobi are fake.&#x201D; The individual adds that Sun should &#x201C;settle the wages of the employees&#x201D; and &#x201C;if you want to lay off employees, please abide by the labor law.&#x201D;</p>
<p>On Jan. 6, 2023, Sun <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1611297498588663810?s=20&t=Kb_ivRVwXsgdST5IhdpneQ">shared</a> several tweets stressing that the exchange was still in good standing, saying &#x201C;At [Huobi Global], we believe that the key to success in the world of cryptocurrency is to &#x2018;Ignore FUD and Keep Building.'&#x201D;</p>

Liquidity indicators are crucial for contract trading. There are always many bids and offers in a liquid market, and traders can easily enter and exit.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December 2021, MEXC launched the MX Token2.0 plan.

The crypto asset bonk inu (BONK) has a circulating token supply of around 41.5 trillion and it has managed to gather a market capitalization of around $63 million.</strong></p>
<h2>BONK Sees Market Cap Soar to $204 Million Before Plummeting to $63 Million in 24 Hours</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency community has been discussing a new meme token called <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bonk">bonk inu (BONK)</a>, a dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) wannabe that is now the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/meme-token">sixth-largest</a> meme coin asset today. According to the BONK development team and its &#8220;<a href="https://www.bonkcoin.com/one-pager">one pager</a>,&#8221; Bonk is &#8220;the first Solana dog coin for the people, by the people with 50% of the total supply airdropped to the Solana community.&#8221;</p>
<p>The airdrop boosted the price of solana (SOL) in recent times after the project has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/solana-struggles-to-remain-in-the-top-20-as-prior-ties-to-ftx-and-alameda-wounded-the-project/">dealing with negativity</a> stemming from its former relationships with Sam Bankman-Fried, Alameda Research, and FTX. &#8220;The Bonk contributors were tired of toxic &#8216;Alameda&#8217; tokenomics and wanted to make a fun memecoin where everyone gets a fair shot,&#8221; Bonk&#8217;s one pager further explains.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" title="BONK Meme Coin Sees Wild Price Fluctuations and Massive Holder Concentration" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bonkusdt_2023-01-06_10-03-30.png?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20230106%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20230106T152456Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=600&amp;X-Amz-Signature=074230d7c05db154c480aac5c7e781364254080f082891363e0d63eab7d1433b" alt="BONK Meme Coin Sees Wild Price Fluctuations and Massive Holder Concentration" width="1554" height="1158" /></p>
<p>The 50% of BONK distribution was split into fractions and 20% went to Solana-based non-fungible token (NFT) collectors. 15% was distributed to early openbook traders, 10% to Solana artists and collectors, and 5% to Solana developers. BONK started to see real-world value on Dec. 29, 2022, when it was trading for $0.000000086142 per token. By Jan. 5, 2023, it jumped to an all-time high (ATH) at $0.00000487 per BONK. But 24 hours later, on Jan. 6, BONK was down 67.9% since the token&#8217;s ATH.</p>

<p>The crypto asset&#8217;s market capitalization reached more than $204 million down to the Jan. 6 market valuation of around $63 million. While BONK has a circulating supply today of around 41.5 trillion, it once was around 56.02 trillion according to an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230103174841/https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bonk">archive.org snapshot</a>. According to the BONK team, much like shiba inu (SHIB), BONK tokens are burned to create scarcity.</p>

<p>On Jan. 5, the BONK team <a href="https://twitter.com/bonk_inu/status/1611133296955498498?s=20&amp;t=OP93Rptrdvn28RL_rsp9Mg">said</a> 5 trillion of the meme tokens were <a href="https://solscan.io/tx/3QPerPyNBrkmfkEEPmcTg4f7G5KHpxskDL3zcNyLvpuLcMgCnEPfezL43gaWpFnNc8fX6zYqwx3mFmJ2pmGbnvxS">destroyed</a>. Furthermore, there are 110,017 BONK holders and coincarp.com <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/bonkcoin/richlist/">data</a> indicates that the top ten holders control 36.81% of the supply. 20 BONK holders command 46.31% of the supply and 58.32% of BONK is held by 100 of the richest bonk inu addresses.</p>

Figures released today showed that the NFP fell to 223,000, down from a reading of 263,000 the month prior. Cardano was mostly higher, as it rose to a multi-week high.</strong></p>
<h2>Monero (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a>)</h2>
<p>Monero (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a>) surged to a two-month high of $158.11 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which came prior to the release of December&#x2019;s U.S. nonfarm payrolls report.</p>
<p>However, following the report, which showed that 223,000 jobs were added to the U.S. economy, the token fell to a low of $151.90.</p>
<p>Initially the surge in price came as <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a> broke out of a resistance level at $155.00, however as of writing, it is once again below this point.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a>/USD also moved lower as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved lower.</p>
<p>The index is currently tracking at the 61.37 level, which is marginally below a key resistance level of 70.00</p>
<p>Typically, the 70.00 level is an area where price is overbought, and this seems to have been used by bears as a perfect point of reentry.</p>

<h2>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>)</h2>
<p>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>) was another notable gainer in Friday&#x2019;s session, as it surged to a multi-week high.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>/USD raced to a peak of $0.2756 earlier in the day, and this comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $0.2651.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s rally sent <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a> to its strongest point since December 16, prior to prices consolidating during the holiday period.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, today&#x2019;s move also saw <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a> break out of a key price ceiling at $0.270, and the asset continues to trade above this point.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the RSI of 14 days is hovering above a resistance point of its own at 50.00, and is currently tracking at a reading of 50.90.</p>
<p>Should this bullish momentum continue to move in an upward position, then <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a> bulls will likely target a move above the $0.280 point.</p>

Since Dec. 13, 2022, BUSD&#x2019;s supply has been reduced by more than $5 billion, going from $21.84 billion to its current level of $16.77 billion.</strong></p>
<h2>Stablecoin Market Sees Fluctuations With BUSD Losing Significant Supply, Ties to Turkish Lira</h2>
<p>BUSD, the stablecoin founded by Paxos and Binance, has experienced a significant reduction in its circulating supply. Data shows that among the top ten stablecoins by market capitalization, BUSD has lost the most between Dec. 5, 2022, and Jan. 6, 2023. Tether managed to increase by 1.1% over the past month, and USDC jumped by 1.8% in the last 30 days. However, BUSD shed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230106003026/https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins">23.8%</a> during the last month and now has a market cap of around $16.77 billion. Since Dec. 13, 2022, BUSD has seen approximately <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221213123725/https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-usd/">5,066,884,674</a> net redemptions.</p>

<p>The reduction in stablecoin supply coincides with a time of significant speculation surrounding the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. Last month, Binance announced that Binance US would attempt to acquire Voyager Digital&#x2019;s assets, but the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-intervenes-in-binance-us-acquisition-of-bankrupt-crypto-lender-voyager-digitals-assets/">intervened</a> in the purchase. The SEC stated that it was &#x201C;formally investigating&#x201D; the debtors in the matter. In addition to the SEC, Alameda Research, a defunct trading unit of FTX, has also <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysb.312840/gov.uscourts.nysb.312840.813.0.pdf">objected</a> to Binance US&#x2019; purchase of Voyager&#x2019;s assets.</p>

<p>Of the more than $5 billion in BUSD redemptions, BUSD&#x2019;s supply shrank by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/stablecoin-busds-supply-shrunk-by-3-24-billion-in-3-days-market-cap-is-down-20-since-last-month/">3.24 billion</a> in three days from Dec. 13 to Dec. 16, 2022. Global trade volume was significantly higher at that time, as Dec. 13 statistics show that BUSD had around $9.38 billion in 24-hour volume compared to today&#x2019;s $4.41 billion. BUSD&#x2019;s top trading pair is tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>), but statistics from cryptocompare.com indicate that BUSD has a strong relationship with the Turkish lira. As of Jan. 6, 2023, metrics show that the lira represents <a href="https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/busd/analysis/USDT">2.45%</a> of all BUSD trades.</p>

<p>Turkey has been <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2022/11/09/everything-is-overheating-why-is-turkeys-economy-in-such-a-mess">experiencing</a> a sovereign debt and currency crisis <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018&#x2013;2022_Turkish_currency_and_debt_crisis">since 2018</a>. In early 2022, Bitcoin.com <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/turkeys-inflation-jumps-to-36-liras-value-plummets-citizens-flock-to-stablecoins/">reported</a> on the growing popularity of stablecoins in Turkey, when the lira represented 7.20% of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220103223623/https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-usd/">$3.51 billion</a> in 24-hour BUSD trades on Jan. 3. On Jan. 5, 2023, the Turkish lira accounted for $15,912,033 of Binance&#x2019;s 24-hour trades. In addition to the lira, other top BUSD trading pairs on Binance include <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a>. In addition to BUSD, the stablecoin DAI issued by Makerdao shed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230106003026/https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins">2.9%</a> last month, and GUSD, issued by Gemini, dropped by 3.8%.</p>

December&#x2019;s report is set to show an addition of 200,000 jobs to the U.S. economy, which would be down from November&#x2019;s figure of 263,000. Bitcoin was also slightly down ahead of the release.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) continued to hover slightly under the $17,000 level on Friday, as markets consolidated ahead of the latest U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP).</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s report is expected to show an addition of 200,000 jobs to the economy, lower than the previous figure for November which came in at 263,000.</p>
<p>Ahead of the data release, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD fell to a low of $16,738.90 in today&#x2019;s session, moving below a key support level of $16,800 in the process.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, today&#x2019;s decline comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continues to slip, after failing to break out of a ceiling at 51.00.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 47.24, and seems to be heading towards a support point of 43.00.</p>
<p>Momentum could still shift, should a stronger than expected NFP number get released, which could prompt the 10-day (red) moving average to move closer towards its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was also marginally lower on Friday, as prices attempted to remain above a key support point.</p>
<p>Following a high of $1,255.42 on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD fell to a bottom of $1,242.63 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> managed to remain above its recent price floor of $1,230 despite today&#x2019;s decline, which could still be broken, depending on the NFP number.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages continue to move closer, with an upwards crossover very likely.</p>
<p>Should such a move occur, the RSI will also need to move higher, and possibly break out of its current ceiling at the 57.00 mark.</p>
<p>This will also certainly increase the chances of ethereum climbing back above the $1,300 resistance point.</p>
