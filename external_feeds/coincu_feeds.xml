<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex is accused of violating state laws and regulatory requirements.</em></li>



<li><em>Florida OFR opposes Bittrex&#8217;s request for Automatic Stay and files a complaint.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange also surrenders its license, files for bankruptcy, and questions SEC jurisdiction.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a recent development, Bittrex, a cryptocurrency exchange, has come under scrutiny for allegedly violating multiple state laws, as <a href="https://casedocs.omniagentsolutions.com/cmsvol2/pub_47475/a9064de6-692c-4960-9f3f-8a02b62d2563_175.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> in court filings.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-410.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="618" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-410-1024x618.png" alt="Bittrex Faces Challenge From Florida Authorities With Pre-Bankruptcy Claims" class="wp-image-200658" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-410-1024x618.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-410-300x181.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-410-768x464.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-410-1536x927.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-410-2048x1236.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-410-750x453.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-410-1140x688.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bittrex Faces Challenge From Florida Authorities With Pre-Bankruptcy Claims 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>The Florida Office of Financial Regulation (OFR) has accused <a href="https://coincu.com/193211-bittrex-is-not-allowed-to-refund/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bittrex</a> of various violations, including the failure to properly segregate customer assets and maintain a sufficient surety bond.</p>



<p>The OFR&#8217;s filing opposes Bittrex&#8217;s request for Automatic Stay, which aims to prevent certain creditors from taking action against the bankrupt estate. Assistant General Counsel Brandon Greenberg highlighted that the regulator had previously advised the exchange on resolving the charges against it.</p>



<p>The OFR collaborated with financial regulators from Texas, Maryland, and Michigan in a comprehensive examination of the exchange from October 2022 to March 2023. Following the investigation, the OFR issued a three-count complaint against the exchange platform on April 17. On the same day, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Bittrex of violating federal laws related to operating as a securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-412.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-412-1024x512.png" alt="Bittrex Faces Challenge From Florida Authorities With Pre-Bankruptcy Claims" class="wp-image-200663" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-412-1024x512.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-412-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-412-768x384.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-412-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-412-750x375.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-412-1140x570.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-412.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bittrex Faces Challenge From Florida Authorities With Pre-Bankruptcy Claims 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>Despite the OFR&#8217;s suggestion to engage in discussions and explore avenues for settlement, Bittrex expressed disappointment over the enforcement action. The company later surrendered its money transmitter license on April 30 and subsequently filed for bankruptcy in Delaware on May 8.</p>



<p>The allegations against Bittrex highlight the increasing regulatory scrutiny faced by cryptocurrency exchanges and the importance of compliance with state and federal regulations. The case underscores the ongoing efforts of financial regulators to ensure integrity and legal compliance within the cryptocurrency industry.</p>



<p>The exchange is also questioning the <a href="https://coincu.com/181924-sec-charges-bittrex-violated-securities-law/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a>&#8216;s (Securities and Exchange Commission) power to regulate its activities based on securities offenses.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-413.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="650" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-413.png" alt="Bittrex Faces Challenge From Florida Authorities With Pre-Bankruptcy Claims" class="wp-image-200665" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-413.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-413-300x190.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-413-768x488.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-413-750x476.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bittrex Faces Challenge From Florida Authorities With Pre-Bankruptcy Claims 3"></a></figure></div>


<p><a href="https://coincu.com/200332-regulatory-pressures-plague-coinbase-causing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> filed a motion to dismiss the SEC&#8217;s accusations against the company last week. Motivating their stance, the exchange accused the government of overreach, claiming that crypto assets may not even be subject to its jurisdiction.</p>



<p>Bittrex has chosen to follow in the footsteps of Coinbase. While the exchange is in court as a result of bankruptcy processes, the move for dismissal of charges relates to distinct litigation, which was brought soon after the firm chose to depart America. It had already been under investigation since 2017 and had been in futile negotiations with the SEC since 2022 at that time.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Metaverse Strategy report from the European Commission, which was supposed to be issued the following week, has been postponed.</li>



<li>The European Commission&#8217;s focus on the metaverse is a positive sign for the virtual world industry.</li>



<li>As policymakers begin to address the potential policy issues surrounding, it will become a more stable and secure environment for users and investors alike.</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The European Commission <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/06/eu-metaverse-strategy-set-to-examine-privacy-competition-and-rights/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/06/eu-metaverse-strategy-set-to-examine-privacy-competition-and-rights/" rel="noreferrer noopener">has delayed</a> the release of its metaverse strategy, which was originally planned for next week.</strong></h5>

<p>The metaverse, a term used to describe a collective virtual shared space, is becoming increasingly popular in the world of cryptocurrency. The European Commission&#8217;s attention to the metaverse is a sign of its growing importance.</p>



<p>As virtual worlds continue to expand and evolve, it is crucial that policymakers address the policy concerns surrounding them. While the delayed release of the  strategy may be disappointing to some, it is an indication that the European Commission is taking this issue seriously and is working on a plan to address it. </p>

</figure>



<p>One of the main policy issues that the strategy will address is privacy. As virtual worlds become more sophisticated, the potential for data breaches and other privacy concerns increases. The European Commission&#8217;s strategy will examine how privacy can be protected in virtual worlds.</p>



<p>Another issue that the strategy will address is property rights. As the value of virtual assets increases, so does the need for clear property rights. The European Commission&#8217;s strategy will examine how virtual property rights can be established and protected.</p>



<p>Finally, the strategy will also address technical standards. As virtual worlds become more complex, it becomes increasingly important to establish technical standards to ensure interoperability and user safety. The European Commission&#8217;s strategy will examine how technical standards can be established and enforced in virtual worlds.</p>



<p>The European Commission&#8217;s focus on the metaverse is a positive sign for the virtual world industry. As policymakers begin to address the potential policy issues surrounding the Metaverse, it will become a more stable and secure environment for users and investors alike.</p>

<p>Marathon revealed that they produced 979 bitcoins in June, down 21% from the previous month. The company also reported that transaction fees in June fell to about 5.1% from 11.8% in May as market conditions cooled down. As of July 1, Marathon held a total of 12,538 BTC and chose to sell 700 bitcoins in June.</p>



<p>In terms of operational updates, approximately 18,500 of Marathonâs Bitcoin miners (c. 2.5 EH/s) were energized at Applied Digitalâs facilities in Ellendale, North Dakota, in June. The company&#8217;s operating fleet increased to approximately 149,900 Bitcoin miners, theoretically capable of producing approximately 17.7 EH/s, according to the manufacturerâs specifications, as of July 1, 2023. </p>



<p>Once all of Marathonâs previously purchased miners are installed, approximately 66% of the companyâs hash rate is expected to be generated by S19 XPs, which are approximately 30% more energy efficient than the prior generation of mining rigs.</p>

<p>In terms of financial updates, Marathonâs total BTC holdings increased to 12,538, all of which are unrestricted. The company opted to sell 700 BTC during the month of June and intends to sell a portion of its Bitcoin holdings in future periods to support monthly operations, manage its treasury, and for general corporate purposes. The company ended the month with $113.7 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet.</p>



<p>Despite the drop in bitcoin production and transaction fees, Marathon&#8217;s operating fleet and BTC holdings continue to grow. The company&#8217;s focus on energy efficiency with the S19 XPs and the sale of bitcoin holdings for corporate purposes demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and responsible financial management. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, Marathon appears well-positioned to adapt and thrive.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bitcoin maintains solid upward momentum, with the price zone above $30,000 being sustained for over two weeks.</em></li>



<li><em>Despite a drop below $31,000 after the release of the FOMC meeting minutes, demand for Bitcoin futures from institutional and professional investors remains strong.</em></li>



<li><em>BTC&#8217;s price is looking to break the $31,200 resistance level, with a potential target of $35,500 on the weekly chart.</em></li>

<p>Earlier, the Bitcoin price saw a substantial increase in <a href="https://coincu.com/197227-jerome-powell-raise-interest-rates-2-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling pressure</a> in the wake of the minutes of the United States Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in June.</p>



<p>While BTC has dropped below the $31,000 mark, the growth in demand for Bitcoin futures from institutional and professional investors remains, implying a price squeeze for the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) commodity is possible.</p>



<p>The second Bitcoin halving will take place in May 2024. A bull run is possible if the qualities identified during prior halving occurrences are maintained.</p>



<p>The largest cryptocurrency is up 1.4% to $31,200 on Friday, while the second-largest crypto, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>, has, in the last 24 hours, increased 0.75% to trade at $1,945. This can be said to be a step to create momentum for the upcoming rally of the coins with the largest market capitalization.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/199813-bitcoin-pushes-to-31000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> price is securely above the immediate support level of $30,500, with a much stronger support level of $30,000 predicted. BTC soared in June, regaining resistance above $31,000, boosted by various filings by businesses seeking to launch a spot <a href="https://coincu.com/200412-blackrock-ceo-praises-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin ETF</a>.</p>



<p>Looking at the daily chart, BTC&#8217;s price is looking to break its $31,200 resistance and move towards a further area. This is evident in the candlesticks retreating and trading higher each day.</p>

<p>More broadly, on the weekly chart, the price area where BTC could place its outlook is at $35,500, which is also its Fib %38.2 level since the drop early last year.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-402.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="623" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-402-1024x623.png" alt="Bitcoin Is Waiting For The Next Bull Run At $35,500" class="wp-image-200637" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-402-1024x623.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-402-300x183.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-402-768x467.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-402-1536x935.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-402-2048x1247.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-402-750x457.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-402-1140x694.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bitcoin Is Waiting For The Next Bull Run At $35,500 10"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTC 1W price chart. <em>Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The time is now quite favorable for investors to consider as the BTC price zone breaks above $32,000 and retracements in the near term. Waiting will limit the risk and it is safer to buy at the current resistance level.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>FTX Japan has postponed its resale plan in a recent development.</em></li>



<li><em>FTX Trading, the headquarters of the major crypto exchange that went bankrupt in 2022, is now rebuilding.</em></li>



<li><em>The branch in Japan has returned 80% of fiat currency, such as Japanese yen and virtual currency, to customers.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUB2339Y0T20C23A6000000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nikkei News</a>, FTX Trading, a major crypto asset exchange that went bankrupt in 2022, is undergoing reconstruction and plans to postpone the sale of its subsidiary FTX Japan in Chiyoda, Tokyo. The company is said to have communicated its intentions to the Japan Financial Services Agency through FTX Japan.</strong></h5>

<p>If the trading system used by the predecessor QUOINE (coin) of Japan FTX works well, the Japan Financial Services Agency could allow the Japanese company to resume operations before the end of the year.</p>



<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://coincu.com/184521-ftx-japan-delays-resale-to-restart-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX Japan&#8217;s</a> customer asset return process, launched in February, is progressing smoothly. FTX Japan has returned 80% of fiat currency, such as Japanese yen and virtual currency, to customers.</p>



<p>Of all the subsidiaries of the 2nd largest crypto empire in the market, only FTX Japan has not been severely affected by its strict adherence to Japanese exchange and reserve regulations.</p>

<p>At the end of June, the new CEO of FTX, John J. Ray III, said that the company had begun attracting interested parties to reopen the crypto exchange FTX.com.</p>



<p>Many people appreciate the FTX platform on a technological level, so it makes sense to attempt to reopen the exchange. The only big obstacle is the huge debt owed to creditors, of which former customers are only a part. Some customers have refused to accept only partial refunds. They could start a new legal proceeding that could delay reopening plans quite a bit.</p>



<p>However, if they can work around this by convincing former customers to accept only partial refunds, they may be able to reopen.</p>



<p>Failed crypto exchange FTX said it would launch a portal &#8220;in the next few weeks&#8221; for customers owed to global crypto trading platform FTX.com and its affiliates to state their requirements. The exchange has stated this on claims.ftx.com, where the portal will be hosted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance is upgrading its wallet infrastructure to enhance efficiency and fund security for users.</em></li>



<li><em>Selected deposit addresses and memos will be retired in batches, with impacted users receiving inmail notifications.</em></li>



<li><em>Users are encouraged to obtain new addresses and memos upon receiving notifications, while funds deposited into expired addresses remain safe and can be manually credited.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a bid to provide better efficiency and enhanced security measures for its users, leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance has <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/existing-deposit-addresses-to-be-retired-in-q3-july-september-2023-ffbe37cbd85f46db8fe3021ee3f85eb3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> significant upgrades to its wallet infrastructure.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-391.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-391-1024x683.png" alt="Binance Unleashes Wallet Upgrades To Enhance Efficiency And Security" class="wp-image-200609" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-391-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-391-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-391-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-391-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-391.png 1095w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Unleashes Wallet Upgrades To Enhance Efficiency And Security 13"></a></figure></div>


<p>The exchange will be retiring specific deposit addresses and memos in a phased manner across different networks, with affected users receiving inmail notifications.</p>



<p>To ensure a transition, Binance strongly advises seamless users to obtain new deposit addresses and memos (if applicable) upon receiving the official notification. It is important to note that users who have not received any notification are encouraged to continue using their current deposit addresses without any changes.</p>



<p>The retirement of old deposit addresses and memos will only affect users who receive specific notifications from Binance, and the expiry date of the old addresses will be clearly stated in the notifications. However, it is reassuring to know that funds into addresses remain safe and secure, and users can manually credit these deposits via the &#8220;Transaction History&#8221; page on the platform.</p>

<p>To obtain new deposit addresses and memos (if applicable), affected users can conveniently log into their Binance accounts on either the Binance app or website. The exchange&#8217;s ongoing commitment to enhancing user experience and security is evident in this wallet infrastructure upgrade, which aims to streamline operations and provide an even more secure environment for cryptocurrency transactions.</p>



<p>With these improvements, <a href="https://coincu.com/199795-binance-drops-spot-volume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> continues to demonstrate its dedication to maintaining the highest standards of service, providing user funds are well-protected, and upholding its position as a leading cryptocurrency exchange in the industry in the context of the exchange being subject to regulatory imposition in regions around the world.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://coincu.com/200226-binance-stops-multichain-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, from 08:00 UTC on July 7 until further notice, the exchange will halt support for the deposit and withdrawal of Multichain cross-chain bridge tokens created over the following network.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>

<p>This year&#8217;s growth of PENDLE has been spectacular. The token has risen from $0.044 at the start of the year to $1.75. The project&#8217;s token, which collects protocol fees while locked, is up roughly 4,000% this year, trading at levels last seen at the bull market&#8217;s peak two years ago. A spike of this size cannot be explained only by a recent listing. A close look into the on-chain data uncovers some intriguing insights into the factors behind the protocol&#8217;s extraordinary success.</p>



<p>Moreover, whales&#8217; accumulation of PENDLE might be seen as a significant vote of confidence in the protocol&#8217;s long-term potential. Pendle&#8217;s novel approach to yield farming, which allows users to tokenize and exchange future produce, has grabbed the curiosity of forward-thinking investors.</p>



<p>Inflows increased when Ethereum&#8217;s Shanghai upgrade went online in April, allowing for the first-time withdrawals of staked ETH. According to DeFiLlama data, approximately $40 million in stETH has been tokenized on the network since then.</p>

<p>Pendle, in addition to yield-splitting, has an automated market maker (AMM) where traders may buy and sell either the primary token or its related yield independently. On July 3, the AMM <a href="https://dune.com/kaysblc/pendle-all-in-one-by-kays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">observed</a> a significant increase in activity, with over 8,500 transactions.</p>

<p>Currently, the price of PENDLE is trading at $0.87, it broke the previous $0.66 resistance area and once reached the $1.75 mark. The current price is also close to the Fib %61.8 level. We need to wait for more signals to consider this price area.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>ShibaSwap, the first decentralized exchange, is set to launch, offering financial freedom.</em></li>



<li><em>Users can stake tokens and earn BONE through liquidity mining.</em></li>



<li><em>BONE will be the native token of the ecosystem.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shytoshi Kusama, the principal creator of Shiba Inu, unveils Shibapendence Day, an important milestone for the Shiba Inu community, with the highlight of ShibaSwap in a blog post published today.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-383-1024x577.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="577" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-383-1024x577.png" alt="ShibaSwap Unleashes A New Era Of Financial Freedom Dawns" class="wp-image-200578" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-383-1024x577.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-383-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-383-768x433.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-383-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-383-1140x642.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-383.png 1399w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="ShibaSwap Unleashes A New Era Of Financial Freedom Dawns 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>Kusama <a href="https://shytoshikusama.medium.com/shibapendence-day-13c31b01d9f5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stressed</a> the necessity of decentralization and breaking free from the shackles of centralized institutions that have long governed society.</p>



<p>The announcement focused on the launch of <a href="https://coincu.com/174194-shibaswap-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ShibaSwap</a>, the first genuinely decentralized exchange affiliated with the <a href="https://coincu.com/116987-shiba-inu-bone-shibaswap-top-trending/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shiba Inu</a> ecosystem. ShibaSwap, he claims, is at the vanguard of a wave of decentralized projects that share a shared vision of freedom and aspire to restore people&#8217;s authority. The DEX&#8217;s impending release seeks to permanently remove fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), backed by the ShibArmy&#8217;s unrelenting support.</p>



<p>The Shibapendence Day blog post offered appreciation to the loyal ShibArmy and recognized the various FUD theories around Shiba Inu but underlined the team&#8217;s devotion to their core aim.</p>

<p>ShibaSwap&#8217;s publication is a watershed moment in the fight against centralized authority. It provides a variety of features that enable users to actively engage in the ecosystem, eventually encouraging financial independence.</p>



<p>The DEX&#8217;s native token, <a href="https://coincu.com/121269-bone-shibaswap-soars-over-200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BONE</a>, is crucial to its liquidity strategy, serving as the principal token for ShibaSwap and other ecosystem initiatives. When it becomes online, the BONE supply starts at zero, with an increased emission of 1,000 BONE each block during the first two-week Liquidity Enhancement phase. This guarantees that BONE is widely distributed, resulting in an inclusive environment in which everyone has the chance to contribute. After the first phase, emissions will be reduced, with returns commencing at 100 BONE per block.</p>

<p>There are two ways to get BONE. Users may buy it on ShibaSwap with the exclusive ETH/BONE Pair, or they can farm it utilizing the accelerated rewards schedule by providing liquidity to chosen pairings on the DEX and &#8220;WOOFing&#8221; (staking) the LP (liquidity provider) tokens.</p>



<p>Kusama also emphasized the inclusion of multiple token pairings and their corresponding Allocation Points (AP) for BONE distribution. The AP determines the distribution weight for each pool, with higher AP pools getting more BONE per block.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>South Korea&#8217;s FSC revises code of conduct, requiring employees involved in virtual assets to declare their holdings.</em></li>



<li><em>The code applies to public servants engaged in virtual asset-related activities in the past six months, covering various tasks.</em></li>



<li><em>A new reporting form, &#8220;Report on Virtual Assets Possession,&#8221; records details of virtual asset holdings and aligns with existing financial regulations.</em></li>

<p>According to <em><a href="https://view.asiae.co.kr/article/2023070608470419647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asia Economic Report</a></em>, the FSC issued a revised draft of the &#8220;Code of Conduct for Public Officials,&#8221; requiring employees with virtual asset responsibilities not to invest using relevant undisclosed information while performing their duties and requiring internal employees to report details of virtual asset holdings.</p>



<p>The report&#8217;s target audience is public servants who are now performing virtual asset-related activities and workers who have performed such duties in the last six months. The tasks include developing and executing virtual asset rules or regulations, investigating and analyzing criminal cases involving virtual assets, administering and regulating virtual currency exchanges, support and management, and virtual asset technology development, among other things.</p>

<p>A new form for the &#8220;Report on Virtual Assets Possession&#8221; has also been introduced, which requires the kind of virtual asset owned, date of purchase, quantity, and amount to be recorded. In addition, the definition of virtual assets under the &#8216;Specified Financial Information Act&#8217; was incorporated in response to the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission&#8217;s request to amend the code of conduct for each institution. It also contains text to change the order of the provisions from &#8220;virtual currency&#8221; to &#8220;virtual assets.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a Twitter thread, Conor Grogan explained that many investors forgot about their cryptocurrency on-chain, or did not keep track of airdrops.</p>



<p>In 2016, the Ethereum blockchain forked and Ethereum Classic (ETC) was created. Anyone who held Ether (ETH) on-chain at that time received an identical amount of ETC through an airdrop. However, many investors never touched these new funds, according to Grogan.</p>



<p>Conor Grogan stated that it is common for investors to forget about their funds on-chain or not keep track of airdrops. As a result, he has helped retrieve six-figure amounts for investors in the past. In one instance, he even notified a Twitter user of 23 ETH that had been sitting untouched.</p>

<p>Locating these wallets is not an easy task. Grogan began by searching through the &#8220;ETC rich list&#8221; for accounts that had never used their ETC. After finding around 20 addresses that held over $250,000 worth of ETC, he went through each one, attempting to discover ways to get in touch.</p>



<p>Although he hit a number of dead ends with most of the wallets, he eventually discovered an address with the prefix &#8220;0x475.&#8221; Interestingly, the wallet contained a cryptocurrency called &#8220;EOSDAC,&#8221; which was airdropped to Ethereum holders in 2018.</p>



<p>Grogan used the new information to connect with the holder&#8217;s EOS wallet by utilizing the airdrop amount and snapshot date. Grogan&#8217;s efforts allowed him to track down the legal name associated with the 0x475 ETH address by poring over legal documents. As a result, he was able to inform the owner. </p>
