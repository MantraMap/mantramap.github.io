			            <description><![CDATA[According to case documents, a majority of users prefer immediate liquidation, with a few votes in favor of restructuring.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hodlnaut, a crypto lending platform that went under due to crypto winter, has been under judicial management since August 2022.</p>
<p>This decision shielded the firm from lawsuits that it would have had to deal with in return for far greater scrutiny from regulators.</p>
<h2>Terraform Labs Exposure Was The Main Culprit</h2>
<p>According to Hodlnaut’s leadership – who allegedly destroyed several documents indicating the full extent of their exposure to Terraform Labs – the main reason for their fall was the number of assets that they had invested in the latter. As previously <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-platform-hodlnaut-lost-190-million-from-terras-crash-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> by <em>CryptoPotato</em>, Hodlnaut had around $190 million invested into UST.</p>
<p>After trying to keep the platform afloat, Hodlnaut management eventually declared insolvency and placed themselves under judicial management, stating from the get-go that they plan to restructure the platform and bring it back.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, the crucial element for restructuring, namely fresh funding, failed to materialize.</p>
<h2>No Silver Lining</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, it was already <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/hodlnauts-creditors-prefer-liquidation-than-restructuring-plan-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">clear</a> that creditors did not see much hope in the resurrection of Hodlnaut and would prefer to recoup at least some of their assets following liquidation.</p>
<p>However, a new <a href="https://assets.ey.com/content/dam/ey-sites/ey-com/en_sg/generic/hodlnaut-pte-ltd-(ijm)/thirty-fourth-circular-04-25-2023.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">document</a> published by advisors Ernst&amp;Young confirms that any restructuring process is “unlikely to be achievable.”</p>
<p>The document confirms that, despite Hodlnaut’s best efforts, the firm has not been able to find a prospective investor that could provide the liquidity that would bring it afloat again.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the paper reveals that the creditors holding the lion’s share of the claims – about 55.38% &#8211; voted in favor of total liquidation. The creditors preferring a restructuring solution only control 2.42% of the claims against Hodlnaut, a large part of which appear to be actually controlled by the directors of the company itself.</p>
<p>As a result, the courts have opted to move in favor of liquidation should circumstances remain unchanged.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Counsel for Mr. Simon Eric Lee confirmed that there was no fresh injection of funds available. In the circumstances, the Court held that it was not satisfied that a potential compromise and/or arrangement could be approved without a fresh injection of funds and thus directed that the IJMs are to proceed with filing a petition to wind up the Company with a concurrent application to discharge themselves as IJMs.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The mediation proposal was vehemently opposed, especially by large creditors such as Samtrade Custodian and the Algorand Foundation, the latter having taken a large hit from the collapse of both 3AC and Hodlnaut.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Private stablecoins contain all of the same risks as CBDCs, says the former CFTC chief. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Christopher Giancarlo– former chairman of the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) thinks that the outright opponents of central bank digital currency (CBDC) are mostly wasting their breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During a speech at Consensus 2023 on Wednesday, he argued that government-backed digital dollars are largely inevitable, and will certainly exist in a world alongside private market stablecoins. </span></p>
<h2>The Growth of CBDCs</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The former politician – commonly referred to as “Crypto Dad” – said that money is “too important to be left to central bankers.”</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Money is as much a social construct as it is a government construct,” said Giancarlo. “The success of fiat money derives from the trust and the consent of ordinary citizens who place value in it.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As such, Giancarlo called for discussion and experimentation within the United States as to how a CBDC might be put in place – including the values it should embody. Over 100 foreign governments are already exploring such technologies, including 19 members of the G20. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whether or not the US deploys a digital dollar – CBDC is coming,” he continued. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_248134" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-248134" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-248134 size-large" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo_2023-04-26_19-21-28-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo_2023-04-26_19-21-28-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo_2023-04-26_19-21-28-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo_2023-04-26_19-21-28-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo_2023-04-26_19-21-28-50x28.jpg 50w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo_2023-04-26_19-21-28.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-248134" class="wp-caption-text">Crypto Dad 2(Consensus 2023)</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Stablecoins VS CBDCs</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Much attention among US regulators and the crypto industry alike has been paid to stablecoins – which have been pitched as effective private market alternatives to CBDCs. However, Giancarlo argued that private market digital dollars include all of the same <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cbdcs-are-aimed-at-tracking-purchases-and-controlling-our-money-us-congresswoman/" data-wpel-link="internal">risks</a> that are often associated with public market ones – including privacy issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is nothing inherently superior about non-sovereign digital currency in protecting privacy over central bank digital currency,” said GIancarlo. Private entities, he continued, could very well be <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/circle-ceo-talks-tornado-cash-sanctions-and-the-fight-for-privacy/" data-wpel-link="internal">put under government pressure</a> to conduct surveillance on their users to “disable financial transactions with disfavored groups and activities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Giancarlo concluded that the US should ultimately seek to provide a CBDC that embodies American values and can compete on the global stage rather than lose dominance to authoritarian digital currencies from rival nations. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The choice between stablecoins and CBDCs is a false choice,” he said. “The real choice is between financial freedom and financial control.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Under Giancarlo’s leadership, the CFTC greenlighted trading for Bitcoin futures on the CME in 2017. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">After leaving, Giancarlo founded the digital dollar project, which sought to research how a CBDC in the United States could be properly implemented. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Unbeknownst to many Mac users, the nine-page PDF remained hidden deep inside Apple's system files for five years. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The digital copy of Satoshi Nakamoto&#8217;s Bitcoin whitepaper was an Easter egg that was located earlier this month embedded within a test scanner app on macOS. But Apple has now removed it from the latest beta version of its operating system.</p>
<p>With the removal of the test scanner app called Virtual Scanner II from the beta, the Bitcoin white paper &#8211; along with all the other elements it was bundled up with &#8211; is also gone.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/04/25/apple-removes-bitcoin-whitepaper-from-macos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">report</a>, the document will no longer be available once users update to the MacOS Ventura 13.4 beta 3 that was rolled out to developers on Tuesday.</li>
<li>On the other hand, users who haven’t updated their Mac to the latest beta can still find the file by running a command.</li>
<li>In a blog post on April 5th, an American technologist Andy Baio revealed stumbling upon the Bitcoin white paper while trying to fix his wireless printer.</li>
<li>He went on to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoins-white-paper-has-been-in-every-macos-version-since-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">add</a> that the whitepaper&#8217;s PDF copy could have been added to the system with macOS Mojave, which was launched in 2018.</li>
<li>As the story gained significant traction, Baio later updated,</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A little bird tells me that someone internally filed it as an issue nearly a year ago, assigned to the same engineer who put the PDF there in the first place, and that person hasn’t taken action or commented on the issue since. They’ve indicated it will likely be removed in future versions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The discovery prompted several conspiracy theories, including speculation about the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto.</li>
<li>Subsequently, the controversial computer scientist and self-proclaimed &#8220;Bitcoin creator of Bitcoin,&#8221; Craig Wright, accused Apple of violating copyright laws.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Jeremy Allaire &#8211; CEO of Circle Internet Financial Ltd. &#8211; argued that US investors could soon relocate due to the lack of proper regulations and the growing banking crisis.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March caused severe issues for the stablecoin issuer.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Allaire thinks the US government should act quickly, highlighting the progress that the European Union, Singapore, and Hong Kong have achieved lately:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;It&#8217;s a critical moment here in the US, and, as I like to say, it&#8217;s really a moment for Congress to step up.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Merlin, which uses zero-knowledge sync (zkSync), has lost more than $1.8 million in a liquidity pool exploit hours after smart contract security firm CertiK audited its code.<br />
The hack <a href="https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x2744d62a1e9ab975f4d77fe52e16206464ea79b7" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span class="s1">occurred</span></a> on Wednesday morning during the public sale of Merlin’s native token, MAGE, with the attacker siphoning several assets, including USD Coin (USDC), Ether (ETH), and other illiquid tokens.</p>
<h2>Merlin’s LP Drained After Code Audit</h2>
<p>A few hours after the exploit, CertiK <a href="https://twitter.com/CertiK/status/1651088669187473408?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span class="s1">tweeted</span></a> that it was investigating the incident and working to understand its impact on the community. The security firm disclosed that its initial findings suggested that a private key management issue may have led to the hack and not an <span class="s1">exploit</span>, as widely believed.<br />
CertiK said it pointed out the centralization risk in the recent audit report for Merlin under the “Decentralization Efforts” section. The firm insisted that while audits could not prevent private key issues, they always ensured to highlight better practices for projects.<br />
As claimed in the audit dated April 24, 2023, CertiK <a href="https://skynet.certik.com/projects/merlin-dex" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span class="s1">recommended</span></a> that Merlin improve its centralized roles to a decentralized mechanism like multi-signature wallets to enhance security practices. The firm also asked the protocol to implement a timelock feature with a latency of at least 48 hours to avoid a single point of key management failure. CertiK has also promised to work with appropriate authorities if any foul play is discovered.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We encourage all community members to review this information and all audits fully. As we navigate this challenging situation, we want to assure you that we are taking all necessary measures to protect our community’s interests,” CertiK said.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Malicious Code Detected</h2>
<p>Interestingly, eZKalibur, another zkSync DEX and launchpad, <a href="https://twitter.com/zkaliburDEX/status/1651087592052359169?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span class="s1">revealed</span></a> it had identified the malicious code that enabled the hackers to drain Merlin’s funds. The DEX said it found two lines of code in the initialize function that gave the feeTo address <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/terraport-finance-exploited-for-2m-barely-10-days-after-launch/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span class="s1">approval</span></a> to transfer an unlimited amount of tokens from the contract’s address.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The SVB collapse that briefly caused USDC to de-peg from the dollar has only shaken confidence in the banking system, says Circle’s CEO. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jeremy Allaire, CEO of stablecoin giant Circle, spoke at Consensus 2023 on Wednesday about where companies like his fit into the current US dollar system and regulatory regime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The executive believes a widespread loss of faith in US Banking is contributing to “de-dollarization”, and that digital dollar stablecoins will help it retain its global dominance. </span></p>
<h2>A Safe Digital Dollar</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During a panel titled “ A 10-Year Rollercoaster Toward a New Model of Money,” Allaire said that the </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/circles-usdc-outflows-surpassed-10b-since-svb-collapse-tether-dominance-rises/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">collapse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March was a mere reminder of why Circle and other crypto firms were founded 10 years ago. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was a reaction to the global financial crisis of 2008,” he said. “ I personally spent a huge amount of time trying to understand the nature of money, how the banking system [works], the international monetary system – and that was before I had any sort of knowledge of Bitcoin or any of this,” he said. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitcoin’s whitepaper was published in 2008 as numerous massive bank failures in the United States left taxpayers footing the bill for risky decisions investment banks made with customer money. The network was the first of its kind to allow for trustless peer-to-peer payments in a digital manner, from which many more cryptocurrencies have followed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allaire noted that the idea of “sound money” permeates the crypto space a great deal, and that Circle’s idea was to introduce that to the world of fiat currency &#8212; in digital form. “That would dramatically change both the underlying safety of money, and open up extraordinary new opportunities for how you can arrange economic activity and financial activity,” he said.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_248079" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-248079" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-248079 size-large" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo_2023-04-26_12-20-12-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo_2023-04-26_12-20-12-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo_2023-04-26_12-20-12-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo_2023-04-26_12-20-12-768x576.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo_2023-04-26_12-20-12-50x38.jpg 50w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo_2023-04-26_12-20-12.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-248079" class="wp-caption-text">Jeremy Allaire (Consensus)</figcaption></figure>
<h2>De Dollarization</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The CEO said that there is a “very active de-dollarization taking place,” in response to the various banking failures in March, which exposed the US banking system’s underlying risks. Even federal regulators have recognized this in various government documents on stablecoins – including the President Working Group’s <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-us-government-has-released-its-stablecoin-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">report</a> – advocating that such assets should be backed by cash and US treasuries, rather than commercial bank deposits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes published an </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/global-de-dollarization-and-the-role-of-bitcoin-arthur-hayes/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">essay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> this month arguing that global “de-dollarization” may be a reality as various international deals point to nation-states seeking less dependence on USD. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A solution to the dollar’s falling dominance, Allaire claims, is stablecoins. “International is actually where the action is for stablecoins, and for USDC specifically,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When asked about lessons for crypto newbies, Allaire said to be patient when evolving big, systemic, institutional structures. After 10 years, the CEO said Circle has only just completed its “1.0” vision of the company. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The Bahamian regulators intend to ban algorithmic stablecoins and require crypto entities to provide feedback on their activities.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Securities Commission of the Bahamas reportedly plans to strengthen the domestic cryptocurrency regulatory framework after the collapse of FTX, which was based in the island nation. One such amendment will be the prohibition of algorithmic stablecoins and privacy tokens.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Bahamas was also where Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) &#8211; the former CEO of FTX &#8211; lived prior to his arrest. He currently resides in his parents&#8217; house in California, awaiting a trial that will determine whether he was guilty of committing fraud.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">More Supervision After the Failure</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-fall-of-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-a-timeline-of-ftxs-collapse/" data-wpel-link="internal">crash</a> of the once-leading cryptocurrency exchange &#8211; FTX &#8211; in November was one of the darkest events in the industry last year. The entity, valued at over $30 billion at one point, revealed severe liquidity issues and could not honor customer withdrawal requests. It filed for bankruptcy protection, triggering colossal investor losses. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The demise caused many to call upon implementing stricter rules on the sector to prevent another dark-case scenario. According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-26/ftx-fiasco-leads-bahamas-to-propose-a-stronger-crypto-rulebook?leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a>, the financial watchdog of the Bahamas has taken steps in that direction.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It intends to require digital asset businesses to report their activities. The new legislation will touch upon staking, insisting users disclose their process of pledging coins to support the operation of blockchains.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Securities Commission of the Bahamas will also enforce stricter supervision on exchanges and ban algorithmic stablecoins and privacy tokens.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The bill provides the ability for the Commission to prescribe annual activities at digital asset businesses, as necessary,&#8221; it stated.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The FTX catastrophe is not the only reason the regulator imposed new laws. It outlined the efforts of the authorities of the European Union, Hong Kong, and New York, who have recently displayed intentions to protect crypto users by implementing stricter regulatory frameworks. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Bahamian residents can provide feedback on the proposed rules until May 31. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Bahamas: SBF&#8217;s Short-Lived Paradise</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The picturesque island nation has gained additional popularity lately, but this time not for its turquoise waters and sandy beaches. FTX moved its headquarters from Hong Kong to the Bahamas in September 2021, outlining the Caribbean country as a crypto hub. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the collapse of the exchange last year and the rumors that SBF and his colleagues </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://stories.marca.com/en/amp/ftx-party-house-bahamas-drugs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">organized</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> lavish parties in his luxurious penthouse on the back of failed investors left a dark stain on the island. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The American authorities surprisingly allowed him to stay in his parents&#8217; house in Palo Alto, California, under a whopping $250 million bond.

			            <description><![CDATA[The partnership follows a similar agreement between the crypto exchange and German digital lender N26. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Austrian cooperative banking company &#8211; Raiffeisenlandesbank Niederösterreich-Wien (RLB NÖ-Wien) &#8211; has partnered with Bitpanda to roll out crypto investment services through the latter&#8217;s software as a service (SaaS) offering.</p>
<p>With this collaboration, RLB NÖ-Wien has become the first major traditional bank in the European Union to move into digital assets.</p>
<h2>The Partnership</h2>
<p>Alongside crypto investment, the Austrian company will also focus on the potential implementation of stocks and ETFs, crypto, commodities, as well as precious metals as part of its offering with a budget of as little as one euro. The main aim is to help the bank customers &#8220;reach their financial ambitions,&#8221; the official <a href="https://blog.bitpanda.com/en/european-first-raiffeisenlandesbank-partners-bitpanda-offer-digital-asset-investment" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">press release</a> noted.</p>
<p>Bitpanda CEO Eric Demuth highlighted the complexity and lack of inclusivity in the financial market. The exec, in a statement, said the company intends to simplify the process and make investing accessible to everyone.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It is about simple, intuitive products that do not require a user manual. With Bitpanda Technology Solutions you have we have created a software-as-a-service infrastructure that enables our partner banks to offer their customers all assets digitally. Rounded off by regulated and secure custody of all assets. We look forward to our common path.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As part of the deal, RLB NÖ-Wien has signed a letter of intent with Bitpanda. The evaluation process for a concrete offer is expected to conclude by the year-end.</p>
<h2>Addressing Crypto Regulatory Landscape</h2>
<p>The partnership comes days after the European Union (EU) lawmakers gave their final <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/eu-lawmakers-give-final-approval-to-the-mica-crypto-legislation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">approval</a> to the long-awaited regulatory framework &#8211; Market in Cryptoassets (MiCA) &#8211; which seeks to set up a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto-assets, focusing on disclosure and consumer protection.</p>
<p>First proposed in December 2020, MiCA will bring in new rules for the industry across the bloc and is expected to be published in the Official Journal of the EU this summer. Provisions for stablecoins will be rolled out in late June 2024. Subsequently, provisions guiding crypto asset service providers are likely to be implemented by the end of next year.</p>
<p>The move is being touted as a notable example of the EU&#8217;s evolving approach to crypto regulation, which is in contrast to the United States&#8217; regulation-by-enforcement method.</p>

<p><em>MyEListing integrates with Coinbase Commerce to create ASAP Program</em></p>
<p>Austin, TX – MyEListing.com, a free commercial real estate listings and data platform, has partnered with Millennial Title, and Championship Title to create a marketplace where anyone in the world can buy and sell US residential &amp; commercial real estate with crypto via an integration with Coinbase Commerce, and close within one business day.</p>
<p>The initiative is called the <a href="https://myelisting.com/asap/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ASAP (Accelerated Sale And Purchase)</a> program. MyEListing.com hosts the marketplace, Coinbase Commerce converts the buyers’ crypto into cash for the seller, and Millennial Title as well as Championship Title handle the title work.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This initiative will drive innovation in the crypto and real estate industries,” says Caleb Richter, CEO of MyEListing.com. “Real estate commerce needs to be changed. It’s hard enough as it is to buy property in your local neighborhood, let alone in another state or country. With the ASAP program, anyone, regardless of the language they speak or where they are in the world, can purchase American real estate with crypto in as little as one business day.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Transaction times through the ASAP program are expected to be nearly 50x faster than current averages, bringing cost-saving convenience and greater accessibility to trade.</p>
<p>The program launches Thursday, April 20th for Texas-only properties and in June 2023 for other select states. Agents, brokers, and sellers in Texas can be the first to put their properties in front of a global audience, regardless of location, language, or currency, by submitting their properties to the ASAP program here: <a href="https://myelisting.com/asap/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://myelisting.com/asap/</a>.</p>
