					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price is again moving lower toward the $29,200 level. BTC must surpass $30,500 to attempt a fresh increase in the near term. Bitcoin is showing bearish signs and trading well below the $30,500 zone. The price is trading below $30,300 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $30,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it stays below the $30,500 resistance. Bitcoin Price Extends Decline Bitcoin price attempted a fresh increase above the $30,250 level but failed to gain bullish momentum. BTC stayed below the key $30,500 resistance zone. A high was formed near $30,447 before the price dropped below $30,000. It traded to a new weekly low at $29,669 and is currently correcting losses. It broke the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $30,447 swing high to the $29,669 low. The price was able to climb above the $30,000 level. Bitcoin price is now trading below $30,300 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. Immediate resistance is near the $30,200 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $30,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The trend line is near the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $30,447 swing high to the $29,669 low. The first major resistance is near $30,265. The main resistance is now forming near the $30,450 and $30,500 levels. A close above the $30,500 level might start a fresh increase. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The next major resistance is near the $30,850 level. Any more gains could open the doors for a move toward the $31,500 resistance zone. More Losses in BTC?

					<description><![CDATA[While most crypto market watchers remain focused on Bitcoin&#8217;s ongoing struggle with $31,000, Ethereum recently closed above the psychologically important $2000 level for the first time in weeks. Now poised to close lower for four straight days, let&#8217;s take an evidence-based approach and determine whether four consecutive days lower for Ether is historically bullish or bearish going forward. Let&#8217;s dive in! Ethereum&#8217;s Close Above $2000 Followed By Pullback After closing at an impressive multi-week high and back above the $2000 level on July 13th, Ether has pulled back for four consecutive sessions, one of the conditions we&#8217;ll test momentarily. To better add context to the test, we&#8217;ll also add two more conditions requiring that [1] Ether is above its 200ma and that [2] its 200ma is rising. Why? The 200ma and its slope both act as simple filters to help determine market regime. For example, this latest four day pullback in Ether occurs in an improving market in which ETH is above the rising 200ma. If the current four day pullback were occurring in a down trending market regime, we would require that ETH be below its declining 200ma. Ethereum Daily Chart  &#124; ETHUSD on TradingView.com What does this pullback in Ethereum suggest for its price? To find out, we&#8217;ll look at all signals since inception, and also compare those signals to a simple &#8220;buy and hold&#8221; approach. This will provide us with a baseline to better understand today&#8217;s test results. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Breaks $2,000 As The Bulls Take Over Crypto Market Four Days Down Compared To Buy And Hold The holding time graphic below shows historical results for Ether&#8217;s current technical setup on top with a simple &#8220;buy and hold&#8221; approach on the bottom. In other words, we&#8217;ll show hypothetical results using various holding times solely for when Ethereum has closed lower for four straight days while above its rising 200ma on top. The bottom results will act as a baseline, assuming a hypothetical purchase of ETHUSD with no conditions whatsoever and an exit n-days later. Average Trade Comparison  &#124; SOURCE: REKTelligence, Tableau While both approaches show positive average trade results over every exit we tested from 7 days through 90 days, our baseline &#8220;buy and hold&#8221; actually outperforms the current technical setup of four days down. The single exception is the &#8220;exit in 90 days&#8221; in which the current setup slightly outpaces the historical average &#8220;buy and hold&#8221; trade, beating it 62.1% to 59.4%. But while the average trade statistic remains important, it does not always tell the whole story. When looking at a comparison of the largest hypothetical losses for both approaches using the same conditions described earlier, note that the largest losses (i.e., worst trades) for the current four days down setup are far lower than for a simple &#8220;buy and hold&#8221; approach. This largest loss comparison indicates that while the current setup may not beat &#8220;buy and hold&#8221; in terms of average trade, Ethereum may currently have a lower than usual risk exposure &#8211; something most experienced traders will appreciate.

In other words, not overly exciting and apparently lacking any meaningful edge at the moment. That said, risk also appears lower than usual relative to the &#8220;buy and hold&#8221; largest loss stats. Traders take note. Ethereum may now be offering its typical return profile based on its current technical setup, but with a lower overall risk exposure.

					<description><![CDATA[As one of the biggest stablecoins, USDC is one of the major players in the crypto industry. However, the stablecoins have seen better days, as the stablecoin has seen its market cap drop drastically over the past few months. Related Reading: 29% Of Bitcoin’s Circulating Supply Is Now Presumed Lost Forever The second-largest stablecoin has seen its market cap drop by over $1.4 billion in just the last few days thanks to a surge in redemptions.  $1.4 Billion Redeemed In One Week The stablecoin market was rocked this week by a massive redemption of USDC. According to Circle and data obtained from Coinmarketcap, the supply of USDC decreased by $1.4 billion in just seven days as Circle&#8217;s rate of token burning outnumbered the rate of new token creations. This led to a market cap drop from $27.4 billion to $26.9 billion in a 7-day timeframe. This comes as the overall supply of USDC has been on a steep decline since the beginning of the year, plummeting from $45 billion to its present level of $26 billion. The worst drop in USDC’s market cap this year came during the height of Silicon Valley Bank&#8217;s shutdown.  USDC market cap plunges &#124; Source: Glassnode According to Nansen, Circle burned $1.6 billion in USDC in a single day. During this period, Circle’s market cap fell by more than $10 billion. This came as investors rushed to redeem USDC due to Circle having cash reserves in the failed bank. What Does This Mean For USDC? The rush to redeem USDC over the course of the past year has prompted doubts about the reserves underpinning the stablecoin. But the stablecoin market appears to be doing just fine in terms of maintaining its peg to the US dollar. Circle also maintains that the USDC cryptocurrency is backed 1:1 by cash and other monetary equivalents.  USDC market cap sitting at $27.25 billion &#124; Source: Market Cap USDC on Tradingview.com In March of this year, Circle switched to short-term maturity bonds. This means that the USDC reserve is now held 80% in short-dated US treasuries and 20% in cash deposits within the US banking system. Given this, there are worries among investors as redemptions at this scale could strain the reserves if they’re invested in less liquid assets. This would explain the high volume of redemptions over this time.

Overall, most of the stablecoin market remains split between USDT and USDC, making up more than 83% of the total stablecoin market cap.  For now, USDT has the higher momentum. While USDC’s market cap has slipped throughout the year, data shows USDT has added over $15 billion to its market cap. Featured image from Cryptonomist, chart from Tradingview.com]]></description>

Overall, most of the stablecoin market remains split between USDT and USDC, making up more than 83% of the total stablecoin market cap. </p>
<p>For now, USDT has the higher momentum. While USDC’s market cap has slipped throughout the year, data shows USDT has added over $15 billion to its market cap.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Crypto exchange Binance has been the subject of intense regulatory scrutiny over the last few months and BNB has suffered as a result. Even now, as it seems the crypto exchange is beginning to find its footing once more amid regulatory wolves circling, its native token is still under immense selling pressure. This is evidenced by the BNB open interest, which has now skyrocketed to new all-time highs. BNB Open Interest Reaches New All-Time High In an interesting turn of events, BNB shorts are ramping up even at a time when the crypto market seems to be on a recovery trend. According to a Twitter post by analyst Dylan LeClair, this has caused the open interest in the digital asset to rise exponentially. Related Reading: Crypto Liquidations Cross $300 Million Amid Massive Market Recovery The chart shared by LeClair shows that BNB&#8217;s open interest is now sitting at $400 million. This is over four times higher than the previous all-time high for the digital asset which was $50 million back in 2020. And unlike then, the surge in open interest right now is more bearish than it is bullish. Hmmm, some interesting flow in $BNB futures: &#8211; Perpetual futures open interest is seeing new highs as funding rates have gone deeply negative (-200% APR for next funding period) (Chart #1) &#8211; looks as if someone is getting ahead of some bad news flow. &#8211; The last time BNB… pic.twitter.com/1B27OkjvPx — Dylan LeClair 🟠 (@DylanLeClair_) July 17, 2023 This current increase has seen funding rates move above negative 200% and yet traders continue to short the altcoin. The fact that traders are choosing this route despite the high cost to do so points to the expectations of a massive crash coming for the digital asset. As LeClair points out, this could mean that the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) is finally leveling charges against the crypto exchange. “And people in the know are positioning accordingly.” Will The Altcoin Survive a DoJ Lawsuit? As already demonstrated by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against the Binance crypto exchange, a lawsuit from regulators would have an adverse impact on the price of BNB. When the SEC sued the exchange in early June, the price of BNB plummeted by over 20% over a few days period.  BNB price continues to hold above $240 &#124; Source: BNBUSD on TradingView.com Given such a response, a lawsuit from the DoJ would be even worse because of its implications. And if this were to happen this week, then another 20% decline from here would see the digital asset lose its footing above $200.

One reason for this could be the Arkham sale being carried out on the Binance launchpad. As this sale requires BNB for subscriptions to participate, it has provided temporary buy pressure for investors to participate. However, once the sale ends on July 18, this temporary plug would be eliminated and the cryptocurrency will likely fall back to the $230 territory.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price is pulling back after a strong finish in the crypto market last week. However, this past Sunday night’s weekend close was also the close of the 4-week BTCUSD chart, which has potentially confirmed a high timeframe continuation pattern. If the continuation pattern is indeed valid, it could point to 3-6 months of an extended uptrend, making 2023 an extremely bullish year in the end. Here is everything you need to know about the bullish continuation pattern and what it could mean for the crypto market. Bullish Candlestick Continuation Pattern To Light Up Second Half Of 2023 2023 has been an interesting year in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin has been mostly bullish, but nothing compared to what we’ve witnessed in the past — as recently as 2020. Meanwhile, altcoins have been long suffering an onslaught from the US SEC. This has kept Bitcoin further at bay against the US Dollar, while eating up altcoin capital on the BTC pair. Despite an important week for the industry and BTCUSD setting a new high for the year, Bitcoin lost some momentum and is now trading below $30,000 per coin. However, before the correction happened, the 4-week BTCUSD candle also closed on Sunday night. Related Reading: Perfect Storm: Why Bitcoin &#38; Crypto Are Poised For A Dramatic Recovery The 4-week timeframe is slightly more sensitive than the monthly at between 2 to 3 days less, sometimes offering unique signals from the 1-month. Sunday night’s close forever marked the chart with the last candle necessary for a completed Rising Three Method pattern. The Rising Three Method is a bullish Japanese candlesticks continuation pattern. It consists of a large white candle, followed by three small-bodied candles in a row. After the period of consolidation, a large white candle closes above the trio of black candles, engulfing them all. The Rising Three Method pattern &#124; BTCUSD on TradingView.com Bitcoin Buyers Make A Statement: Rising Three Method Pattern Completes The pattern shows that after a pause, buyers resume control. By making this statement, bulls could gain control of Bitcoin over the next 3 to 6 months. The reason for the timing, is due to the length of each candle’s session. After a Japanese candlestick pattern confirms, its expected results should appear within the next 3-5 candlesticks. 3-5 sessions of 4 weeks total, equals roughly 12 to 20 weeks, or around 3-5 months. That timing would take any potential bull rally through the end of the year. For further validation of the fact upside should appear within 3-5 candles after a confirmed signal, we can see that a morning star pattern completed during the first candlestick close of the year. The second candle of the year was a doji, then this bullish continuation pattern formed. All of this combined tells a possible story of a continued bull market for the rest of the calendar year. Related Reading: The One Ingredient Missing From A Full-Bore Bitcoin Bull Run The Japanese candlestick continuation pattern also comes with plenty of confluence through a confirmed bullish crossover of the LMACD. The technical indicator suggests a momentum shift supportive of more upside in Bitcoin. Will this continuation pattern result in a strong bull market breakout?

					<description><![CDATA[Uniswap, the leading decentralized exchange (DEX), has announced the launch of UniswapX, a permissionless and open-source protocol for trading across automated market makers (AMMs) and other liquidity sources.  According to the announcement, UniswapX aims to improve self-custody swapping and grow on-chain trading by offering better prices through the aggregation of liquidity sources, gas-free swapping, protection against maximal extractable value (MEV), and no cost for failed transactions.  Uniswap Latest Protocol Launch  UniswapX addresses the growing complexity of on-chain routing and the fragmentation of liquidity pools resulting from the increasing number of customized pool designs.  The protocol outsources routing complexity to a network of third-party fillers who compete to fill swaps using on-chain liquidity like AMM pools or their private inventory. This allows swappers to use the Uniswap interface without worrying about getting the best price and ensures that transactions are always transparently recorded and settled on-chain. Related Reading: zkSync Unveils Boojum Upgrade: The Ultimate Solution For Scalability And Security? Per the announcement, gas-free swapping is a key feature of UniswapX. Swappers sign a unique off-chain order, which is then submitted on-chain by fillers who pay gas on the swappers&#8217; behalf.  This eliminates the need for swappers to pay gas or hold a chain&#8217;s native network token to trade. MEV protection is also provided by UniswapX, which returns MEV that would be left on the table to be captured by an arbitrage transaction to swappers through improved prices. UniswapX also has plans to launch a cross-chain version later this year that combines swapping and bridging into one seamless action.  This will provide users with the ability to exchange between different blockchain networks in a seamless and trustless manner. This is made possible through the use of bridges, which are specialized smart contracts that enable the transfer of assets between different blockchain networks. In addition, instead of receiving a bridge-specific token, users can choose which assets to receive on the destination chain.  Strong Resistance Causes UNI To Retract After the announcement of the launch of the UniswapX protocol, the price of Uniswap&#8217;s native token, UNI, experienced a surge of around 3%. UNI reached a high of $6.152, a level not seen since April 2023. The excitement generated by the launch of this new protocol led to a surge in demand for UNI, as traders anticipated improved user experience and better prices for on-chain trading. Related Reading: XRP Crosses 1 Million Trades Per Minute Following Court Ruling However, UNI faced a strong resistance line at this same level, causing the token to retrace and lose all the gains generated by the announcement. At present, UNI is trading at $5.738, down by 1.4% in the last 24 hours. Despite this recent dip, UNI has posted significant gains in the 30-day timeframe, with a staggering 28% profit. On the flip side, according to Token Terminal data, Uniswap&#8217;s market cap (circulating) currently stands at $4.76 billion, representing a 28.3% increase over the past 30 days. The market cap (fully diluted) is $5.77 billion, up 26.01% over the same period. Uniswap&#8217;s total value locked (TVL) is currently $3.67 billion, a decrease of 0.54% over the past 30 days. The price fees (P/F) ratio (fully diluted) stands at 17.50x, indicating that the market values Uniswap&#8217;s future earnings potential at a premium. Uniswap&#8217;s trading volume (annualized) is $349.19 billion, representing a decrease of 8.05%. In terms of user activity, Uniswap has had an average of 69.640 daily active users over the past 30 days, representing an increase of 2.7%.  Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Sui blockchain platform is witnessing a surge of activity, mainly due to its new Web3 game, Sui 8192. Not only is this game boosting blockchain engagement, but it&#8217;s also contributing to the bullish run of Sui&#8217;s native token, SUI. SUI scan has shown Sui 8192 contributed to the transaction spike on the network. In the past 24 hours alone, the game has drawn 258 million transactions on the Sui blockchain. Developed by Ethos, a Sui wallet maker, the game is intended to spark interest in Web3.

					<description><![CDATA[According to recent findings from blockchain analytics company IntoTheBlock, around 29% of the total Bitcoin circulating supply is now presumed lost forever after remaining stagnant for over five years. Bitcoin was designed to be scarce, with only 21 million coins ever to be mined, but the very features that make the cryptocurrency so attractive to investors can sometimes lead to investors losing their assets forever, especially in cases where private keys are forgotten.  Related Reading: Why Ripple’s Victory Against The SEC May Be Short-Lived: Legal Expert Stagnant BTC Addresses Are Growing Over Time In a recent tweet by IntoTheBlock, the company called attention to the high number of dormant bitcoin addresses. &#8220;Our data shows that 29% of $BTC hasn&#8217;t moved in over 5 years.

					<description><![CDATA[In the wake of a favorable court ruling in the Ripple vs. SEC case, XRP has witnessed an extraordinary surge in demand and trading activity. With over 1 million trades per minute globally, XRP has become the center of attention for investors worldwide.  This unprecedented growth comes after a period of legal uncertainty and trading restrictions, positioning XRP for potential success in the cryptocurrency market. XRP&#8217;s Milestone: Over 1 Million Trades Per Minute Sparks Growth Visionary entrepreneur and self-proclaimed &#8220;Crypto Crusader,&#8221; known as Nick on Twitter,  swiftly recognized the unparalleled growth potential inherent in XRP. Related Reading: Why Ripple’s Victory Against The SEC May Be Short-Lived: Legal Expert Taking to social media, Nick expressed his awe at the surging demand for XRP, emphasizing its relentless upward trajectory in a tweet. With unwavering confidence, Nick firmly believes that this remarkable milestone is merely the inception of XRP&#8217;s extraordinary journey. Also, XRP experienced a significant surge in trading volume, reaching $10.4 billion on July 13. However, while this figure appears impressive, it is worth noting that it only ranks as the 76th largest volume in XRP&#8217;s history.  This observation highlights the immense potential that XRP possesses, suggesting that the recent surge in volume may be just the beginning. A tweet from Leonidas, the host of the popular crypto YouTube channel XRPArcade, underscores this point, stating, &#8220;On July 13th, XRP&#8217;s volume spiked to $10.4 billion. Even though this seems like a big number, historically, this was XRP&#8217;s 76th largest daily trading volume recorded on CoinMarketCap (CMC). The highest was almost $37 billion on April 6th, 2021.&#8221;  This historical context emphasizes that XRP has achieved even higher trading volumes in the past, indicating the potential for further growth.  XRP price sitting at $0.73 &#124; Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com Daily Volume Surges 18-Fold Following Court Ruling And Exchange Relisting The court ruling that declared XRP as not a Security favored the altcoin as XRP witnessed a dramatic surge in trading volume, increasing from $613 million to $11.2 billion within a single day.  The ruling by the Southern District Court of New York has reignited investor interest in XRP, leading major exchange platforms such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Crypto.com to relist the asset.  The market responded with XRP&#8217;s value soaring by 85% from $0.47 to $0.87, with the token currently trading at $0.78 despite the market drawdown.

This surge propelled XRP to become the fourth largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, trailing only Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Tether USD (USDT).  The derivatives market also witnessed increased interest, with funding rates and open interest for XRP derivatives reaching the highest levels of the year, indicating growing confidence among traders.

					<description><![CDATA[zkSync, a blockchain network that aims to make digital self-ownership universally accessible, has announced a major cryptographic upgrade to its proof system.  The upgrade involves transitioning to a new STARK-based proof system called Boojum, which, according to the announcement, offers world-class proving performance and reduces hardware requirements for decentralization. zkSync Era Moves To Boojum Boojum is a Rust-based arithmetization and constraint library that implements the upgraded version of the ZK circuits for zkSync Era and the ZK Stack. The library offers several compelling properties, including PLONK-style arithmetization. PLONK-style arithmetization refers to the use of PLONK (Permutation-based Linear-based SNARKs for transparent, universal, and upgradable proofs) as the underlying zero-knowledge proof system.  PLONK is a relatively new proof system that provides several advantages over previous systems, such as Sonic and Halo. Specifically, PLONK is designed to be more transparent, universal, and upgradeable, making it a good choice for zkSync&#8217;s upgraded proof system. Related Reading: Celsius Is Selling, More Pain For BNB, LINK, And SNX? According to the announcement, the move to a STARK-based proof system represents a dramatic performance improvement and will help ensure low latency for finality and support for increased levels of activity on zkSync Era and other ZK Stack-based systems.  The GPU provers used for Boojum require just 16 GB (GygaByte) of RAM, a significant reduction from the hundreds of GBs of RAM needed by prevalent proof systems.  By reducing the amount of RAM required to run the GPU provers from hundreds of GBs to just 16 GB, zkSync will be able to use cheaper machines for increased horizontal scalability. This will likely have a positive impact on the cost of using zkSync. This means that more people will be able to participate in the network and contribute to its decentralization, ultimately leading to a healthier and more robust network. Furthermore, to ensure a smooth transition, zkSync is running the new proof system alongside the existing one in a testing phase called mainnet shadow mode.  The network is generating and verifying &#8220;shadow proofs&#8221; for Mainnet blocks to further test and optimize the system with real production data from zkSync Era&#8217;s user activity. This testing is being done off-chain to find edge cases and bugs, and to continue reviewing the implementation. zkSync is also open-sourcing the Boojum codebase to allow anyone to use the new proofs and verify them using a command-line interface (CLI) tool.  Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Price Momentum Builds As Open Interest Climbs – Details The network is confident that Boojum and its commitment to innovation and user-first design are the next steps forward for a more secure, scalable, and efficient zkEVM. However, according to the announcement, the migration to the new proof system will only happen after further audits and security reviews are completed. Overall, the move to Boojum is a significant step towards a future of user-powered, decentralized proof generation. The increased performance and reduced hardware requirements will help zkSync and other ZK Stack-based systems achieve greater scalability and accessibility, making digital self-ownership more accessible to everyone.
