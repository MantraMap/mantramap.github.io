<p>Last year, many key figures in the cryptocurrency industry made it known that they were bullish on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin hitting new price levels.</p>



<p>As the year progressed, the market saw Bitcoin and other leading altcoins record a massive price drop. Many notably bearish events forced investors out of the cryptocurrency market as losses significantly skyrocketed.</p>



<p>However, the new year is showing to be more promising than the year before, and market players expect certain events to go into motion this year. Most of these events, if they happen, have the potential to ignite an ultra-bullish rerun.</p>



<p>One such event, which the crypto market has highly anticipated, is the possible addition of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dogecoins-future-could-follow-this-bullish-trajectory-to-1-doge-price-thanks-to-elon-musk/">Dogecoin</a> to Twitter as a payment option for users on the platform.</p>



<p>Although Elon Musk is stepping down as the CEO of Twitter, he maintains that he remains in charge until he finds a fitting candidate to replace him.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the chances of Dogecoin, the meme coin that Musk had previously bought in the past, and also recently said was going “to the moon”, making it to Twitter, is very high. </p>



<p>If Musk remains CEO at Twitter this year and digital currencies are introduced to the platform, Dogecoin might be one of the few assets to debut on the platform. This will not only increase its adoption across the globe but also stir interest in crypto from traditional investors worldwide.</p>



<p>Another event poised to set the ball rolling for crypto in 2023 is the EIP-4844 rollout for Ethereum.</p>



<p>EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding, is Ethereum’s attempt at reducing its sky-high gas fees while keeping Ethereum decentralized.</p>



<p>When asked by another crypto proponent what he is bullish on for 2023, Buterin says it is “Reaching the &#8220;basic rollup scaling&#8221; milestone in the roadmap diagram. That means: EIP-4844 rolled out, rollups partially taking off training wheels, at least to &#8220;stage 1&#8221;. </p>



<p>As many key players have explained, Ethereum could see massive adoption from investors and developers alike if it succeeds in solving its scaling issue.</p>



<p>If EIP-4884 debuts this year, Ethereum (ETH) could also benefit, as prices are bound to skyrocket with more adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another remarkable event that the market is on the look out for is the verdict of the ongoing <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripples-win-in-xrp-lawsuit-against-sec-proves-pivotal-what-to-expect-from-the-market-this-year/">SEC vs Ripple lawsuit</a>. The SEC has received a lot of criticism for gathering multiple cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency firms.</p>



<p>As such, industry figures maintain that a win for Ripple is a win for the entire cryptocurrency community. Ripple has continued to sign numerous partnerships since the lawsuit was filed in December 2022. And as the market has speculated, XRP could hit roof levels as a result of the win.</p>



<p>Judge Torres, a U.S. District Court Judge Analisa Torres, is envisioned to make a summary judgment on or before the 31st of March 2023 </p>

<p>Shiba Inu’s choking token supply is about to get a massive cut once the much-awaited <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-whale-activity-surges-on-hype-around-the-upcoming-shibarium-launch/">Shibarium network</a> launches, a Saturday update by&nbsp; Shibarium’s official Twitter handle “Shibarium Network” has revealed.</p>



<p>According to the post, each transaction on Shibarium will burn SHIB.</p>



<p>“<em>While on our last post, we wanted to remind everyone that BONE serves as the required gas token for operability within Shibarium; we also would now like to formally announce that each Shibarium transaction will burn SHIB,”</em> read the announcement.</p>



<p>Burning refers to sending tokens to a dead wallet address to reduce the circulating supply. Since its launch in 2020, Shiba Inu, the world’s second-largest meme cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has always posed a problem for the community due to the massive number of tokens in supply.</p>



<p>Whereas close to half of SHIB supply has already been destroyed, its adherents continue pushing for more burning tactics to reduce the remaining 589.6 trillion tokens. Theoretically, token burning is anchored on the fundamental economic principle that when supply exceeds demand for a good or service, prices fall and vice versa.</p>



<p>The announcement comes after the team hinted at Shibarium layer-2 protocol “launching soon”. In a thread of tweets on January 5, the developers thanked the Shiba community for “bringing such energy and excitement” surrounding the upcoming Shibarium Beta Network, which they noted would be a phased introduction.</p>



<p>The SHIB community was also forewarned against falling for rumours that other tokens apart from BONE would be required to utilize Shibarium.</p>



<p><em>“</em><em>This is to confirm and validate, from us, the official source, that BONE is and remains the only token selected for gas fees and use. No other tokens will be necessary to operate within the protocol.”</em></p>



<p>According to the developers, Shibarium had been developed for Shiba Inu and not for the sake of other projects who claim ownership or speculation surrounding its operability dependency on any other tokens.</p>



<p>Furthermore, they noted that the layer 2 protocol belongs to the community adding that it would create a strong foundation for innovation and growth for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Although the developers have yet to issue a soft date for the protocol’s launch, rumours suggest it could happen within the first quarter of 2023.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu community has been <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-primed-for-strong-recovery-as-ecosystem-mulls-introducing-stablecoin-before-year-end/">buzzing with excitement</a> at the prospects of the launch providing a boon for the ecosystem’s tokens. In the past week, SHIB and BONE have grown by 23.68% and 29%, respectively, according to CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<ul>
<li>The sidechain toolkit is aimed at scaling Cardano.</li>



<li>It is a milestone in Cardano’s Basho era – focusing on growth and adoption.</li>
</ul>



<p>Input Output Global (IOG), the developer of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-30-recovery-in-a-week-has-ada-whales-back-in-accumulation-mode/">Cardano</a>, is working on a toolkit for building customized sidechains &#8211; aimed to achieve scalability while maintaining the blockchain&#8217;s security. The toolkit also allows the building of DApps on top of the blockchain, leveraging the benefits of its infrastructure.</p>



<p>Described as a means to create a family of sidechains, the toolkit enables interoperability within Cardano. As a proof of concept, IOG has created an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible sidechain to be released as a public testnet before the end of the month.</p>



<p>Once the testnet goes live, according to the blog, developers could try out the platform by running Solidity apps. On the same note, IOG informs developers that for the EVM sidechain, data should be finalized on the main network before deployment on the sidechain.</p>



<p>According to the announcement, the toolkit&#8217;s components include the main chain, Plutus scripts, which allow for cross-chain transactions and asset transfers, and a chain follower for tracking main-chain data and events on the sidechain. It also comprises the sidechain module, which decrypts the mainnet data and executes the required ledger adaptations.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-sidechain-lets-users-maintain-their-consensus-on-top-of-the-main-chain"><strong>The Sidechain Lets Users Maintain Their Consensus on Top of the Main Chain</strong></h2>



<p>Besides, the new development enables the sidechain to operate its consensus and deploy its features, all connected to the main chain through a bridge that allows for the inter-chain transfer of tokens.</p>



<p>IOG has outlined some of the functions that can be completed with the sidechain and comprise the support for multiple consensus algorithms, ledger policies, and languages. Others are the secure launch of sidechains, small chains and experimentation, incubation, and research.</p>



<p>The company has also noted the benefits for the DApps developers using the toolkit: interoperability, testability, scalability, and compatibility. Interoperability &#8211; where a sidechain can maintain its consensus while benefiting from the infrastructure of the main chain, besides the transfer of assets.</p>



<p>The new toolkit is also scalable in that transactions are quicker and relieves the main chain from congestion. It is also ideal for testability, as with testing DApps on specific sidechains, where any adjustment can be made to the sidechains without touching the main chain. The sidechain toolkit is part of the Basho era of the Cardano – which focuses on scalability and throughput.</p>

Incoming Rocket Fuel? Now, according to Global Marco CEO Raoul Pal, the ETF is the next rocket fuel for the market. An ETF, he said in a recent Twitter exchange, will lead to a brand new level of support for bitcoin as well as an increase in price. This was in response to a tweet that claims that bitcoin is consolidating in price ahead of an ETF approval. “This is my view.. The ETF is the next rocket fuel for this market. The Wall of Money keeps coming but it takes time for everyone to get internal approvals. I have so many conversations helping hedge funds, Family Offices and Asset Managers each week. All happening and more…” he said. Bitcoin, in the last few months, saw a significant bull run and a new all-time price high of over $65,000 per token. Now, the price hovers around $50,000 and has remained steadily in that price range for the last few weeks. Some believe that the market is prepping for another bull run but needs something to trigger it and Pal feels that the ETF is what is needed. Regardless of what the price effect will be of an ETF approval, it cannot be denied that it will make it easier for investors to put money into bitcoin and other cryptos and will also lead to even more mainstream acceptance for bitcoin." decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Samsung-Galaxy-Smartphones-To-Support-Crypto-Hardware-Storage-Device-Ledger.jpg 1200w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Samsung-Galaxy-Smartphones-To-Support-Crypto-Hardware-Storage-Device-Ledger-300x175.jpg 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Samsung-Galaxy-Smartphones-To-Support-Crypto-Hardware-Storage-Device-Ledger-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Samsung-Galaxy-Smartphones-To-Support-Crypto-Hardware-Storage-Device-Ledger-768x448.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>South Korean electronics giant, Samsung, will launch a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), opening up the possibility for exposure to Bitcoin in one of Asia’s biggest markets.

With the current rush of institutional support that bitcoin has seen in the last few months from companies like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, there is talk of more pressure being put on the SEC to approve a bitcoin ETF at some point. Incoming Rocket Fuel? Now, according to Global Marco CEO Raoul Pal, the ETF is the next rocket fuel for the market. An ETF, he said in a recent Twitter exchange, will lead to a brand new level of support for bitcoin as well as an increase in price. This was in response to a tweet that claims that bitcoin is consolidating in price ahead of an ETF approval. “This is my view.. The ETF is the next rocket fuel for this market. The Wall of Money keeps coming but it takes time for everyone to get internal approvals. I have so many conversations helping hedge funds, Family Offices and Asset Managers each week. All happening and more…” he said. Bitcoin, in the last few months, saw a significant bull run and a new all-time price high of over $65,000 per token. Now, the price hovers around $50,000 and has remained steadily in that price range for the last few weeks. Some believe that the market is prepping for another bull run but needs something to trigger it and Pal feels that the ETF is what is needed. Regardless of what the price effect will be of an ETF approval, it cannot be denied that it will make it easier for investors to put money into bitcoin and other cryptos and will also lead to even more mainstream acceptance for bitcoin." decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Samsung-Galaxy-Smartphones-To-Support-Crypto-Hardware-Storage-Device-Ledger.jpg 1200w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Samsung-Galaxy-Smartphones-To-Support-Crypto-Hardware-Storage-Device-Ledger-300x175.jpg 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Samsung-Galaxy-Smartphones-To-Support-Crypto-Hardware-Storage-Device-Ledger-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Samsung-Galaxy-Smartphones-To-Support-Crypto-Hardware-Storage-Device-Ledger-768x448.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div>
<p>South Korean electronics giant, Samsung, will launch a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), opening up the possibility for exposure to Bitcoin in one of Asia’s biggest markets. The company&#8217;s asset management arm is looking to track the spot price of Bitcoin as it floats an ETF investment opportunity rooted in both Bitcoin and micro-bitcoin futures of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).</p>



<p>ETFs are aggregated funds allocated to a broad range of investment portfolio components and tradeable on exchanges. They function and fluctuate much like mutual funds but have the advantage of near-liquidity because of the possibility of sale on an exchange.</p>



<p>Though not exchangeable with an actual Bitcoin, this ETF—the second to happen in less than a month—will go a long way in signalling growing acceptance for digital assets in the region. Over $73 million was raised before the debut day of the first ETF, which took place in mid-December.</p>



<p>Hong Kong stands as Asia’s lone fertile ground for crypto-based ETF trading following China’s brutal clampdown on cryptocurrencies to pave the way for a native CBDC. The region, which promised to distinguish itself from China and ease the path for crypto investors, now joins Canada, Australia, the United States and Europe as countries and regions with a successful ETF launch.</p>



<p>Already swelling with speculation, Bitcoin notched up the ultra-formidable $18,000 support in the early hours of Thursday, leaving the crypto community a little positive effect on the prospects of new retail investors into crypto. Samsung has already disclosed its plans to remain at the forefront of crypto innovation.</p>



<p>The company, which ranked top amongst crypto’s top 40 institutional investors, currently has over 13 crypto companies under its investment belt and has so far, contributed significantly to the $6 billion poured into crypto in the past two years. In August last year, the company officially tendered its application for a virtual asset license in South Korea, gathering more grit to the rumours of a proposed digital exchange.</p>



<p>Its latest flagship Galaxy phone, the S22 series, is already pre-installed with hardware support for Bitcoin and a select other cryptocurrencies on its native Samsung wallet. With a $53 million LATAM- focused metaverse investment and a creator-driven partnership with Polygon’s Web3-based TV streaming feature, Savage App, Samsung believes strongly that the future lies in the advancement of technology and the creation of a market for younger generations who use them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Terra Classic has proposed to remove LUNC token re-mints and to increase validator rewards.</li>



<li>The proposal received overwhelming support from the community and Binance.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/terra-classic-leads-festive-season-gains-as-btc-holds-steady-above-16k/">Terra Classic (LUNC)</a>, introduced following the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, is having a major network <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-support-the-terra-classic-lunc-network-upgrade-936229a46dfb4b78abe0b80b20174ba5">upgrade</a> this weekend, at epoch 15,029, on January 14, 04:50 UTC, which will take about three hours to complete.</p>



<p>The upgrade follows a proposal on Terra Research Forum to depreciate the seigniorage reward policy and increase gas fees by five times. The proposal – which has garnered 96% votes in favour – seeks to achieve fewer mints and more token burns, rewards for stakers and validators, and additional funding for the blockchain’s developers and community pools.</p>



<p>In a post dated January 13, Binance, the leading crypto exchange by volume, pledged to support the upgrade by, among other things, ensuring that there would not be a disruption in trading of LUNC, USTC, and ANC. However, the trading pairs will not be available through the Terra Classic network starting January 14, 03:50 (UTC).</p>



<h2 id="h-binance-to-support-normal-trading-of-terra-classic-pairs-and-the-technical-aspects"><strong>Binance to Support Normal Trading of Terra Classic Pairs and the Technical Aspects</strong></h2>



<p>The exchange has also pledged to take care of the technical requirements for all the holders of LUNC, USTC, and ANC across Binance accounts. Once the update is done, Binance will resume deposits and withdrawals for the Terra Classic network if it is stable.</p>



<p>Initially, 10% of LUNC tokens were re-minted from the 0.2% burn tax in each epoch and added to the community pool. Past the update, the seigniorage reward policy would be set at zero, stopping LUNC from re-minting from burns. Binance – which currently accounts for half the trading volumes of LUNC – has supported Terra’s efforts to restore the network after its epic collapse in May 2022 – through monthly LUNC burns.</p>



<p>Amidst the upgrade, LUNC is getting a positive sentiment, which could be partly tied to the support it is receiving from a notable industry player like Binance. The token &#8211; which ranks 40th with a market capitalization of $1 billion – rose 6% Friday to an intraday high of $0.0001777, according to CoinMaketCap data. Its weekly gains stand at 11.6%.</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to slug it out with Ripple in the more than two years old case. In its latest filing, the regulator has opposed Ripple&#8217;s motion to seal several categories of documents filed in connection with cross-motions for Summary Judgment.</p>



<p>The SEC states in the Jan. 9 partial opposition that many documents Ripple proposes to redact from public scrutiny are too essential. The documents will play a key role in summary judgment and hence cannot &#8220;overcome the presumption of public access,&#8221; the SEC noted.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The SEC highlights five categories of documents out of the 11 Ripple proposed to redact as having this importance. The first category is Ripple&#8217;s proposal to redact documents related to its financial information.</p>



<p>The securities watchdog explains that it is opposed to Ripple sealing the entirety of its financial records. The SEC notes that financial records from 2013 to 2020 are at the heart of the case and therefore require public disclosure. The SEC adds that these records will also not harm Ripple&#8217;s market competitiveness.</p>



<p>The SEC&#8217;s arguments follow a similar path in making a case for unsealing the other four categories of Ripple documents. These include  Ripple&#8217;s contract terms, the identity of third parties, compensation information, and individual defendants&#8217; personal and financial information.</p>



<h2 id="h-ripple-also-opposes-the-sec-s-motion-to-seal-certain-documents">Ripple also opposes the SEC&#8217;s motion to seal certain documents</h2>



<p>On the same day, Ripple also filed its opposition to the SEC&#8217;s motion to seal certain documents connected to cross-motions for summary judgment. The fintech giant points out that the Court recognizes that the presumption of public access to judicial documents is currently at its strongest.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Hence, it urges the court to deny the SEC&#8217;s motion to seal emails related to Bill Hinman&#8217;s speech. This is because the SEC uses parts of the document in its arguments for summary judgment. The document is of high public interest in the case, Ripple also notes.</p>



<p>The defendants further requested that the court reject the SEC&#8217;s request to seal their experts&#8217; names and identifying information. Ripple argued that the SEC has failed to differentiate between the circumstances of each expert. Similarly, three of the experts are already publicly known through their disclosure.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Whether or not the Court ultimately determines those documents are relevant is beside the point; they are part of the summary judgment record and there is no compelling basis to keep them sealed. The SEC’s motion should be denied,&#8221; the filing said.</em></p>

<p>Ripple&#8217;s XRP has emerged as one of this week’s best crypto assets <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-looks-to-retake-20000-as-ether-xrp-cardano-traders-bank-on-a-massive-bull-run/">in price performance</a>. The altcoin, which has peaked traders’ interest in the last few days, surpassed its counterparts to secure gains as high as 15%.</p>



<p>The move is commendable for XRP bulls, mainly because the feat was achieved when most of the leading altcoins by market valuation recorded upsets in price value.</p>



<p>Santiment, a cryptocurrency market intelligence platform, details the bullish pattern in a recent tweet, explaining the upsurge in XRP’s price can be credited to the spike in network address within the past week.</p>



<p>Santiment adds that XRP has also seen a spike in social dominance, which has triggered interest in the asset and resulted in a price upswing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="664" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-3-1024x664.png" alt="" class="wp-image-77143" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-3-1024x664.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-3-300x195.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-3-768x498.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-3.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It is worth noting that XRP bulls have managed to roll over gains into Friday. At report time, XRP’s 24-hours gains are still up 2.89%. Additionally, the asset’s 7-days performance above 12% hints that XRP bulls are building upward momentum. With prices currently at $0.37, the next few days remain crucial for the altcoin.</p>



<h2 id="h-there-are-many-more-reasons-to-remain-bullish-on-ripple-and-xrp"><strong>There are many more reasons to remain bullish on Ripple and XRP</strong></h2>



<p>Meanwhile, XRP has also benefited from a recent move from whales. As reported by WhaleAlert, whales have been moving large amounts of XRP tokens.</p>



<p>This week, a colossal number of whale acquisitions were spotted, causing XRP’s price to spike.</p>



<p>The price of XRP quickly reacted to the moves, with a 10% upswing in price, as of when the purchases were carried out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ripple supporters are also looking for the final verdict from the ongoing SEC vs Ripple case. Dan Gambardello, a popular crypto pundit, has predicted that the case will get a ruling soon. He <a href="https://zycrypto.com/metrics-point-to-strong-bullish-cases-for-xrp-in-2023-as-landmark-ruling-in-ripple-v-sec-lawsuit-nears/">expects the ruling</a> to result in a change in the current state of the entire cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>Per his recent tweet:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I think we&#8217;ll see a ruling on the Ripple case by March. Considering the timing of the market cycles, this could be a huge pivot point for a crypto shift from bear to bull on the macro.”</em></p>

<p>Days after the epic collapse of Sam Bankman Fried’s crypto empire, details have emerged that FTX’s Dubai subsidiary transferred $10M to a little know US firm owned by Alameda Research.</p>



<p>According to a Jan 9 report by DL News, citing sources familiar with the matter, FTX FZE, also known as FTX-MENA, conducted a $10 million bank wire transfer for the funds to Alameda-owned North Dimension on November 16. One document revealed that New York-based bank JP Morgan received the funds.</p>



<p>Following the transfer, a document marked as “restricted” showed that about $460,000 worth of assets were left in the account. According to court documents, FTX ZE held at least three bank accounts in Dubai. Notably, the UAE&#8217;s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority which is the crypto regulating authority in the country, suspended FTX FZE&#8217;s license in November after approving it in July.</p>



<p>Based on bankruptcy documents filed last November, North Dimension Inc was listed as one of the 130 companies in Sam Bankman-Fried’s sprawling empire. However, unlike FTX, its name assumed a low profile, and little was known about its business.</p>



<p>Still, despite North Dimensions&#8217; opaqueness, regulators noted that the firm played a crucial role in the mess at FTX. In fact, they contended that FTX officials wanted it that way to help <a href="https://zycrypto.com/did-ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-just-violate-house-arrest-by-cashing-out-648000-in-eth/">move FTX funds</a> with little to no scrutiny. On Dec 21, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission referred to North Dimension as a “Delaware-registered wholly-owned subsidiary of Alameda” that “deliberately did not have a name that was readily identifiable” with the hedge fund.</p>



<p>North Dimensions, a subsidiary of Alameda Research-the trading firm founded by Bankman-Fried, was used to siphon user funds from FTX to Alameda, according to a complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission last month. Interestingly, an investigation by NBC News revealed North Dimension Inc., founded in 2020, was also registered as a fake online electronics company on a website that has since been brought down.</p>



<p><em>“If John Ray(FTX Bankruptcy lawyer) authorized this, it&#8217;s fine. If not, it&#8217;s embezzlement and bankruptcy fraud. I have a hard time seeing a bank approve that wire after the bankruptcy was filed unless John Ray approved it,” </em>J.W. Verret, a professor of securities law at George Mason Law School, noted.</p>



<p>Last week, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to criminal charges of defrauding FTX customers and using FTX funds to prop up Alameda. Later on, Caroline Ellison- The former CEO of Alameda Research and Gary Wang, an FTX co-founder, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftxs-sbf-bags-250-million-bail-could-face-up-to-100-years-in-jail-as-close-associates-plead-guilty/">pleaded guilty</a> to all fraud charges against them and have reportedly been cooperating with prosecutors.</p>

<p>Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has warned investors against dabbling with cryptocurrencies, likening the asset class to “the wild west”. </p>



<p>Speaking alongside SEC commissioner Caroline Crenshaw during a Wednesday meeting with US Army on Twitter spaces, Gensler advised the soldiers against getting caught up in the FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) narrative that is being driven around cryptocurrencies. According to him, the fact that cryptocurrencies were <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-will-continue-treating-crypto-assets-like-other-securities-regardless-of-their-technology-gary-gensler/">largely non-compliant</a> with basic US financial regulations, highly speculative and volatile, disqualified them as worthy investment vehicles.</p>



<p><em>“The reason some of them are not under the agency is because of non-compliance. Most of these assets are not complying with the securities laws but they should be.”</em> Gensler said before adding, “<em>It’s the wild west</em>.”</p>



<p>He further predicted an <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-chair-gensler-predicts-destructive-ending-for-defis-100-billion-industry/">epic failure for most crypto projects</a>, likening them to any other business startup.</p>



<p><em>“Most of these 10 or 15 thousand tokens will fail. That’s because venture capital fails,</em> and new startups fail. History also tells us that there is not much room for micro currencies. So, don’t get caught up in the FOMO, the fear of missing out; please<em> don’t get caught up in that.”</em></p>



<p>On the other hand, Mrs Crenshaw advised the soldiers to be wary of the significant risks posed by cryptocurrencies, adding that it was important if they chose to invest in assets they “really” understood.</p>



<p><em>“It’s important to understand that crypto is novel and speculative. There are really reduced investor protections because most of them have not chosen to come under the SEC limits- so they are outside our traditional fundamentally important protections,” </em>she said.</p>



<p>According to her, although the blockchain was transparent, the crypto sector had been infiltrated by nefarious actors aiming to perpetuate scams and hide their bad dealings.</p>



<p><em>“So, if you are considering investing in crypto give careful consideration to how much of your portfolio to devote to it and certainly no more than you can afford to lose,”</em> she concluded.</p>



<p>Gensler’s comments come even as the industry faces an unprecedented number of bankruptcies by leading crypto firms. In the past two years, crypto has been a hot sector, attracting a wall of money from both retail and institutional investors. However, since November 2021, cryptocurrencies have retreated sharply, worsening the situation after the Terra Luna collapse in May last year.</p>



<p>Last November, the epic tumble of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire deteriorated things further, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-community-calls-for-congressional-probe-into-sec-gary-genslers-ties-to-bankrupt-ftx/">dragging the SEC</a> right in the middle for its alleged failure to put the necessary guard rails to prevent FTX’s collapse.</p>

<p>After an epic battle for control at the beginning of January, Bitcoin bulls managed to topple bears this week, with the price soaring past $18,000 on Dec 12 for the first time since mid-December.</p>



<p>At press time, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by traded volume was exchanging hands at $18,687 after a 7% increase in the past 24 hours. Earlier in the day, the price rose as high as $18,780, marking the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-cardano-eye-explosion-to-new-highs-bitcoin-recaptures-17k-as-exchange-signals-tilt-bullish/">sixth consecutive day</a> for the asset to print a bullish candle.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-2-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-77100" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-2-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-2-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-2-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-2-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-2-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>For most of the day, the crypto market remained green, with Ethereum adding roughly 6% to tap a two-month high of $1,400. On the other hand, Cardano, Solana and XRP traded mostly sideways, adding about 5% each.</p>



<p>Avalanche was the biggest gainer among the top 20 coins by market capitalization, adding 21.11% in the past day. On Wednesday, the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/avax-sees-massive-boost-on-avalanches-partnership-with-amazon-web-services/">network partnered</a> with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to scale blockchain services for businesses and governments. Overall, the global crypto market cap rose by 4.78% to tap&nbsp;$900 Billion,&nbsp;marking the largest single-day push this year.</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s impressive ascent over the past seven days has been attributed to a return of big social dominance spikes as the asset’s plunge offers extremely discounted prices. After being kept at bay by poor market liquidity towards the end of 2022, onchain data shows that whales with 1,000 to 10,000 BTC added around 20,000 BTC to their holdings between Jan 5 and Jan 11.</p>



<p>Today, Glassnode noted that over 13% of the circulating supply had returned to profit, making it a significant milestone since mid-2022.</p>



<p><em>“As Bitcoin rallies to $18.2k, over 13% of the Circulating Supply has returned to profit. The observed sharp move upwards in this metric helps to confirm that a large volume of BTC was acquired between $16.5k and $18.2k,” </em>wrote Glassnode sharing the chart below.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/uSSYt_yyQgZQhSxGfRIwy5ZqJpoRcAJ8LTaFbC45fSyfO7Dj2QraJVGgzB-JyxxD18kgDsU8wnyA0nFT2Nm5dm5VeOoWkUSl-PkCM6uEa01pMjjvZA1xENZUMxuxYF-Mu_P97fJ_l6HMpHub2bs31xyBOj81AvcwTcCD7icWBYiV_8vFbiZVK4U3Xu2LGFMQ3nZJFa_eEw" alt=""/></figure>



<p>On the other hand, observers have attributed <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-is-positioned-to-outperform-bitcoin-bloombergs-top-strategist-asserts/">Ethereum’s recovery</a> to the impending Shanghai upgrade. The upgrade, due in March, will allow users to unstake and withdraw their Ether which has been locked into the Beacon chain since December 2020. Furthermore, the upgrade is expected to reduce centralization on Ethereum, allowing more projects to onboard and, as a result, liquidity to flow into the ecosystem.</p>



<p>That said, the markets seem to be pricing that in advance. 3,000 new shark addresses (holding 100 to 10,000 $ETH) have shown up on the network over the past week bringing the total number of shark addresses since Feb 2021 to 48,556.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, onchain data showed that shark and whale addresses holding different cryptocurrencies have been accumulating Tether, the top stablecoin by market cap, as they prepare for the next bull run. According to Santiment, <em>“There are now 21,459 addresses that hold $100k or more USDT, just 1% from a new all-time high.”</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Ferrari announces the termination of its partnership with the Velas Blockchain after 12 months.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The premature ending of the sponsorship deal is rumoured to cost Ferrari up to $55 million in losses.</li>



<li>Several racing teams in the Formula One have ended their partnerships with virtual currency service providers in the last year.</li>
</ul>



<p>Scuderia Ferrari, the racing arm of luxury automobile brand Ferrari, has decided to terminate its contract with Velas, with insiders claiming that multiple contract breaches and fears of bankruptcy fuelled the premature ending.</p>



<p>Ferrari revealed its official list of sponsors ahead of the new season, but Velas was conspicuously absent from the exclusive bunch. Only last year, Velas Blockchain was unveiled as a blockchain partner in a multi-year deal worth over $30 million.</p>



<p>A core focus of the partnership between both entities was the creation of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) for fans. Insiders claim that Ferrari breached several clauses related to digital collectibles amid claims that Velas was tethering on the brink of bankruptcy.</p>



<p>It is unclear if Velas had any exposure to FTX’s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/a-deliberate-move-shark-tank-star-kevin-oleary-blames-binance-for-ftx-collapse/">implosion</a> back, but the termination might cause Ferrari losses of up to $55 million as both parties head to court. Data from CoinMarketCap shows a steep decline of 95% from its all-time high in Nov 2021, with some suggesting that a bleak future for the platform may have forced Ferrari to terminate the deal. </p>



<p>Ferrari extended the terminations to its data analysis partner Snapdragon ahead of the new season, which financial experts believe could set the racing team back by $25 million.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-bad-streak-for-formula-one">A bad streak for Formula One</h2>



<p>Formula One teams are turning their backs on crypto partnerships following a series of unsavory incidents in the virtual currency ecosystem. In the wake of the digital asset exchange&#8217;s liquidity issues, Mercedes took a $15 million hit after it severed its contract with FTX.</p>



<p>Red Bull Racing partnership followed suit, deciding not to renew its agreement with The Tezos Foundation over an unfortunate case of strategy misalignment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mercedes’ team lead Toto Wolff predicted that more teams would be forced to terminate their deals with crypto firms as advertising regulators tighten the noose around advertising guidelines relating to digital asset investments.</p>

<p>CNBC’s mad money host Jim Cramer has implored crypto investors to “sell everything”, terming the sector as a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/no-real-value-cnbcs-jim-cramer-predicts-deeper-crypto-crash/">house of cards</a>.</p>



<p>The veteran markets reporter made the utterances Tuesday when asked about his thoughts on the ongoing crypto sector onslaught, particularly with the massive jobs cuts by Coinbase.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;This whole thing is just a house of cards,” </em>Cramer,67, said during an interview with Squawk Box host Andrew Ross. “<em>I don&#8217;t think anyone should be in any of these. I think everything should be sold,” </em>he added.</p>



<p>He went on to criticize Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), suggestively referencing them as one of the biggest examples of all that is wrong with crypto.</p>



<p><em>“Does anyone really own NFTs? I don&#8217;t even know what to do with a fungible token. What do you do with a non-fungible token?” </em>he asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He went on to warn that the SEC would soon come knocking, potentially toppling crypto prices further as Gary Gensler “has had it”. </p>



<p><em>“There isn’t anything that’s not going to be manipulated and investigated, and the SEC is going to come in and sweep everything.”</em></p>



<p>Cramer’s comments come after he referred to investors who own various cryptocurrencies as idiots last month, asking the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to conduct “a big sweep” on the crypto sector. At the time, the former hedge fund manager <a href="https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1606510226655436800">told</a> CNBC that he “would not touch crypto in a million years because I wouldn’t trust the deposit bank” and advised crypto investors to try getting their money out.</p>



<p>That said, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cnbcs-jim-cramer-describes-xrp-solana-dogecoin-as-giant-cons/">Cramer’s messages</a> have often been downplayed by the crypto community, more so for making market forecasts that turned out to be wrong.</p>



<p><em>“Thanks for the bottom signal Jim Cramer,”</em> one tweep commented after Cramer’s latest warning.</p>



<p>“<em>For 25 years, I have listened to JC. I came to view him as entertainment and self-serving. I watched him get banned from CNBC. I saw him implode at a Robin Hood charity benefit as his The Street.com stock price collapsed. I would never put any value on his recommendations</em>,” another said.</p>



<p>Since 2020 the Mad Money host had been a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/why-cnbcs-jim-cramer-changed-his-mind-on-outlaw-currency-bitcoin/">strong advocate for Bitcoin</a> and Ether before he sold his stash in mid-2021, citing ransomware and china’s bitcoin crackdown concerns. Last week, he advised investors to drop crypto from their balance sheet, stating that <em>“it&#8217;s not too late to get out of ANYTHING created or related to crypto”.</em></p>

<p>US Bank, Goldman Sachs, has announced plans to lay off 3,200 workers, starting this week. Falling 2% short of its intended cut-back, close to 629 workers will heave a sigh of relief as they continue to keep their jobs alongside the rest 45,300 workers who make up the bank’s total workforce. The bank, disclosed the decision on Tuesday, adding that such measures are crucial in the face of unfavourable market conditions.</p>



<p>The crypto-friendly bank had, in September, pushed the pedal on a large swathe of corporate lay-offs, labelling it an annual routine pruning of selected underperformers, even as a large majority of Wall Street big players like Morgan Stanley, Barclays, and Citigroup continued to grow leaner to survive.</p>



<p>With over $900 billion in valuation and close to $29 in profits last year, investors remained confident, CEO David Solomon, had had enough stashed for prolonged downturns. Much of its public confidence stemmed from the bank’s decision to roll out a $10 million bail-out fund for trustworthy crypto firms affected by the fallout of FTX.</p>



<p>Solomon strongly believes that though the market may currently be embattled, the fundamental technology–blockchain–is largely unscathed.</p>



<p>In the past few months, Goldman Sachs has stood out remarkably as one of the few mainstream traditional financial institutions with both feet adventurously planted in crypto. Over the last five years, it has invested in over 11 digital asset startups, even pouring close to $410 million into a Euro-based blockchain digital bond with the European Investment Bank (EIB), alongside Santander and Societal Generale.</p>



<p>This time, the 2022 Global Finance Best Investment Bank is throttling up the path of crypto with the launch of a Digital Asset Platform (GS DAP). The platform, which has been built to facilitate the exchange and transaction of digital bonds such as the one issued last year with the EIB, runs on Canton, a private blockchain compliant with the defence against money laundering (DAML) code of operation.</p>



<p><em>“Our goal from the outset has been to help our clients realize the benefits of end-to-end digital lifecycle processing across tokenized assets, digital currencies, and other financial instruments,” said Mathew McDermott, Global Head of Digital Assets at Goldman Sachs. “We are pleased to bring this DAML-based solution to market and continue to find efficiencies that will improve the velocity of transactions.”</em></p>



<p>Goldman Sach is up 0.65% today with an NYSE share price of $359.76 as of the time of reporting.</p>

<p>A new wallet address fraud that targets careless copy pasters is becoming rampant, according to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/paypal-teams-up-with-metamask-to-enable-ethereum-purchases-in-the-us/">MetaMask</a>. In a series of tweets yesterday, the MetaMask team took steps to warn unsuspecting users of a growing type of scam called “address poisoning.”</p>



<p>Scammers extract the first and last four alpha-numerical combinations in a wallet address and use them to create a fake new address. A $0 transaction is then sent from the newly created fake address to replace the matching stored address in your transaction history. Address poisoning targets crypto users who blindly copy and paste addresses in their transaction history without a much-needed extra cross-check.</p>



<p>The security update, however, was greeted with displeasure from a section of the crypto community who believe the world’s largest crypto wallet provider may have acted too slowly to bring it to public notice. A Twitter user Tuzun (0xTuzun), who had posted a public warning of the incident as far back as December 2nd, 2022, gave further insight into the nature of the attack and the scope of wallets affected.</p>



<p>According to Tuzun, over 340,000 addresses have been poisoned since December 2022, fleecing nearly 95 wallets of unsuspecting victims of approximately $1.6 million. The analysis puts the total cost of the attacks at a little over $25,000, signalling a profit margin above 6,000%.</p>



<p>Exploitation on BSC and ETH addresses date back to the 22nd and 27th of November 2022, respectively, with a broad range of attackers emanating from regions of the Asian time zone, according to Tuzun’s findings.</p>



<p>Tuzun had used the on-chain monitoring platform, Xplore, to track down some suspected culprits, further recommending that MetaMask upgrade its UI features to make users identify wallet addresses in transaction history by colour markers. Users were also advised to double-check the alpha-numerical composition on wallet addresses beyond the first four digits before transferring funds.</p>



<p>The poison address scam adds to the list of growing scams in the crypto industry that resulted in a collective loss of over $3.5 billion last year.</p>



<p>Last May, MetaMask signed a partnership with Asset Reality–a Saas tool for crypto asset recovery–aimed at helping victims of crypto scams recover their stolen assets. Eight months later, it is unclear how much asset recovery progress both companies have made. MetaMask is yet to respond to the affected users and any feasible compensation plans for losses incurred.<br></p>
