										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">AVAX price has dropped to an all-time low.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">DeFi volume declined to $1.7 billion from a record high of $20 billion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/avalanche"><u>Avalanche</u></a> price has been in a strong sell-off in the past few months as demand for the AVAX token weakened. The token plunged to a low of $11.81, which was its all-time low. It has plunged by more than 91% from its highest level on record, giving it a market cap of more than $3.6 billion.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">AVAX moves to record low</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Avalanche is a leading blockchain that seeks to become the best alternative to Ethereum. It is a proof-of-stake network that is well-known for its blazingly fast speeds and low transaction costs. It also has more throughput features.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Avalanche has been adopted widely in key industries like decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, the metaverse, and non-fungible tokens. Some of its top apps in its ecosystem are Benqi, Aave, and Trader Joe.</p>
<p dir="ltr">AVAX price has dropped recently as interest in tokens plummet following the spectacular collapse of leading platforms like Terra and FTX. As I wrote in this&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/binance-coin-price-prediction-is-all-this-fear-warranted/"><u>report</u></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>crypto investors have pulled more than $11 billion from Binance, the biggest exchange in the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Avalanche has also seen activity in its network crash. For example, the total value locked (TVL) in its DeFi apps has crashed from over $20 billion to just $1.7 billion. Most dApps in its ecosystem like Wonderland, Trader Joe, Stargate, and Platypus Finance have seen withdrawals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Monetary policy also has had a role in the collapse of Avalanche prices. While America&rsquo;s inflation dropped in November, it remained above the Fed&rsquo;s target of 2.0%. As a result, the Federal Reserve decided to hike interest rates by 0.50% and signaled that it will continue hiking in the coming months.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This explains why cryptocurrencies and stocks have plunged after the Fed meeting while bond yields have risen sharply.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Avalanche price prediction</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/21/1671623867371-0d3c242f-0988-4821-bc36-5645923a45b2.png" style="width: 476px;height: 236.413px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="476" height="236.413"></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AVAXUSD/?exchange=COINBASE">AVAX chart by TradingView</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The daily chart shows that the AVAX price has been in a strong bearish trend in the past few months. As it dropped, the coin managed to move below the important support level at $13.65, which was the lowest level on June 19.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Avalanche also dropped below all moving averages while oscillators like the MACD and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) continued falling. Therefore, AVAX price will likely continue falling as the crypto bubble continues bursting. If this happens, the next key level to watch will be at $10. A recovery above $14 will invalidate the bearish view.</p>

<li>Celsius Network is set to hold auctions for its assets in January 2023.</li>
<li>30 potential bidders have already signed non-disclosure agreements.</li>
<li>The crypto lender has also been given a green light to return some of the customers&rsquo; funds.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-lender-celsius-hires-restructuring-lawyers-cel-price-pumps-and-dumps/">bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network</a> is set to hold an auction of its assets on January 10 and it has already received 30 potential bidders. The auction was originally set to be held on December 15 this year but has since been pushed to next year.</p>
<p>With the bidding deadline of December 12 already passed, 125 parties have been contacted so far and 30 potential bidders have already signed non-disclosure agreements.</p>
<p>The assets set to be auctioned include Celsius retail platform and mining business.</p>
<p>The crypto lender has received several bids proposing different business structures and potential transactions from bidders looking to acquire its assets. For example, some have suggested migrating Celsius customers to the acquirer&rsquo;s platform along with the assets.</p>
<p>Celsius also revealed that it has received a number of single-asset bids.</p>
<p>As of November 25, Celsius company held crypto assets worth about $2.6 billion. However, even with that many assets, Celsius is still $1.2 billion short of being able to pay off its debts even if it were to combine its crypto assets with its non-crypto assets.</p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-cel-price-on-the-decline/">filing for bankruptcy on July 13 </a>this year, the Celsius mining operations have been successful, generating positive operating cash flow every month this year as the company continues to <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/celsius-gets-approval-for-a-new-bitcoin-mining-plant-as-it-seeks-financial-stability/">deploy additional mining rigs</a>.</p>
<h2>Reopening withdrawals</h2>
<p>On December 20, bankruptcy judge Martin Glenn approved a motion that Celsius had filed on September 1 and allowed the company to reopen withdrawals for some of its customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The assets that will be eligible for withdrawal are &ldquo;ineligible Withhold Assets,&rdquo; the amounts less than $7,575 held in the custody program, and funds that were transferred from the Earn or Borrow Program into the custody program within 90 days of Celsius filing for the Chapter 11.</p>

<li>Donald Trump collection has enjoyed a highly successful launch</li>
<li>Problems with the NFTs are many, however, with suspicious activity behind the scenes</li>
<li>The collection sums up a lot of the bubble-driven noise that has collapsed I the space this year</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>There is nothing worse than when an otherwise-riveting movie wraps up via an underwhelming ending. You leave the cinema feeling cheated, a sour taste lingering in your mouth.</p>
<p>As far as <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/">cryptocurrency</a> goes, the year 2022 looks like it is getting the perfect ending. This has not been a happy movie, it should be said. Markets have cratered this year, scandals have been aplenty and the phrase &ldquo;Chapter 11&rdquo; has become uncomfortably commonplace.</p>
<p>And now we are closing it off with a Donald Trump NFT collection catching mainstream media attention. The collection has surpassed 7,000 <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/what-is-ethereum/">ETH</a> in volume &ndash; that is a cool $8.5 million at time of writing. Floor price for the collection started below $100 but is now close to $400.</p>
<h2><strong>What are Donald Trump&rsquo;s NFTs?</strong></h2>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s collection dropped this month, 45,000 collectibles which look like sports trading cards. They feature the former President in all kinds of variant stances, such as standing in front of Mout Rushmore with Trump&rsquo;s face added on, or holding a rifle in military gear with a dog by his side .</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/21/1671622700048-ab0cf443-0969-41ac-ba10-3973432f0734.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="354"></p>
<p>But the apparent success of the project has led many to dig further into the project, with some funny results popping up. Twitter user @NFTherder noticed that a suspicious amount of the rarest NFTs in the collection were hoarded by a creator wallet.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Turns out Donald Trump minted a thousand of his own nfts to his vault wallet </p>
<p>Keeping a giant portion of the most rare nfts in his collection for himself</p>
<p>The 2nd minted nft was a rare 1-of-1, the chances &hellip; <a href="https://t.co/3m0MQGQydp">pic.twitter.com/3m0MQGQydp</a></p>
<p>&mdash; OKHotshot (@NFTherder) <a href="https://twitter.com/NFTherder/status/1604099659382784000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This &ldquo;Donald Trump Admin&rdquo; wallet holds 1,000 NFTs in the collection, despite a &ldquo;strict limit of 100 Trump Digital Trading Cards per purchaser/household&rdquo;. So not only are they breaking their own rule, but they have claimed some of the most expensive and coveted cards in the collection. The 1000 NFTs are also being held I the wallet that is receiving the royalties from secondary sales of NFTs o the market.</p>
<p>It gets a little more tragic, but far more amusing. People quickly realised that there were watermarks left on several of the images, betraying a lazy reliance on stock imagery. At first glance, the below NFT, #29355, seems like any other.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/21/1671622722357-9d5a7847-b42f-45a4-aebb-577be885b3d3.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="598"></p>
<p>But if you look closely next to Trump&rsquo;s left ear, an &ldquo;Adobe&rdquo; watermark is clearly visible. That&rsquo;s good stuff.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/21/1671622691547-a3dea2f4-933c-49b4-989c-dd03285da8bf.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="482"></p>
<p>It was far from the only one, too.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Someone found one of the NFTs still had a watermark from shutterstock on one of the Trump NFTs <a href="https://t.co/wmvAPhaRP2">pic.twitter.com/wmvAPhaRP2</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Morgan (@Helloimmorgan) <a href="https://twitter.com/Helloimmorgan/status/1604241174423822338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>There are other irregularities here, too. But I think I&rsquo;ve made my point.</p>
<p>In a year that has seen NFT volume crater by over 90%, the entire industry has taken a massive step back after its explosive arrival on the scene during the pandemic. The Bored Ape Yacht Club (which I have <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bored-ape-1-club-makes-me-sad-i-quit-my-trad-fi-job/">written about before</a>) has seen its floor price fall down to below $100,000 &ndash; seen as the flagship collection by most, it signals the trouble in the wider space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/21/1671622691424-3c7fba02-0bca-466f-9fc7-ad1180f59ce0.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="339"></p>
<h2><strong>Space cleans out the noise</strong></h2>
<p>In a way, the Trump drop is a nostalgic throwback to the crypto bubble, when speculative gambles like this were everywhere you looked. But really, this is a reminder that so much in the space remains nothing but noise, a lurch for quick money by opportunistic creators.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a torrid year for risk assets overall, but crypto has been ravaged like nowhere else. On the flipside, it is also the industry that saw the most amount of bubble behaviour, with 1000X screenshots all over Twitter, NFTs exchanging hands for hundreds of thousands of dollars and a complete lack of risk management across the board. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Closing the year out with this Trump NFT collection may not rival Lionel Messi&rsquo;s spectacular World Cup swansong, but in a way, it is exactly what 2022 deserves.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Binance Coin price has dropped sharply in the past few days.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Binance has continued to experience significant outflows.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Binance Coin price has come under intense pressure in the past few weeks amid rising concerns about the ecosystem. BNB has plunged by more than 37% from the highest level on November 9. The current price was close to the lowest level since July.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Binance outflows continues</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/binance-coin/"><u>Binance Coin</u></a> is the cryptocurrency that powers the Binance ecosystem. The BNB Smart Chain is an Ethereum rival that makes it possible for developers to build and deploy applications in all industries like decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT). It is also a leading player in the gaming industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Binance holds most of the BNB coin. However, it is worth noting that the coin is significantly different from FTX Token, which was used primarily for providing incentives to users in FTX&rsquo;s ecosystem. BNB has utility in that it is widely used to run some of the biggest parts of the BNB ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Binance Coin price has dropped because of the ongoing outflows in Binance. According to DeFi Llama, Binance has seen outflows worth over $9.25 billion in the past 30 days. Outflows rose to $1.6 billion in the past 7 days and $260 million in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">These outflows are mostly because of the mountain of red flags that I wrote about&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/binance-coin-price-prediction-a-mountain-of-red-flags/"><u>here</u></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>These red flags include the fact that Binance does not have a global headquarter. Instead, the company uses a decentralized model, which is a bit risky.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Further, the company does not have a quality auditor. Its recent financial results were audited by the South African branch of Mazars. For a company the size of Binance, you would expect it to be audited by a big 4 company. During the weekend, Mazars said that it will end its crypto work. As a result, there are increased worries that the company could implode.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Binance Coin price forecast</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BNBUSD/?exchange=BINANCE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BNB chart by TradingView</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The daily chart shows that the BNB price has been in a strong bearish trend in the past few days. In this period, it moved below the important level of $250 and then retested it today. It also moved below the 25-day and 50-day moving averages.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The coin has also formed a head and shoulders pattern, which is a bearish sign. Therefore, the Binance Coin will likely continue falling as sellers attempt to move below the important support level at $200. A move above the resistance point at $270 will invalidate the bearish view.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Algorand has produced a scalable platform since it was launched in 2019, the CEO said.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Algorand is working hard to deliver the tech without unnecessary effort, hype and speculation.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The company wants to forge ahead with institutional partnerships.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Algorand has always focused on delivering the tech</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Algorand Interim CEO Sean Ford, told Cryptoslate in a recent interview, that the blockchain project has always focused on delivering the tech. He added that Algorand has never focused on unnecessary hype and instead delivers on its technology.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/algorand/what-is-algorand/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Algorand is a public blockchain network</u></a> that was created by MIT professor Silvio Micali and has been around since 2017. Ford highlighted that credibility is important for the crypto space to move forward following the LUNA and FTX crashes that occurred earlier this year. He said;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;Keeping our promises is one of the major ways that web3 could regain credibility. Algorand, unlike many other projects, has always made this a priority &mdash; working hard to deliver the tech without unnecessary effort hype and speculation. Since its launch in 2019, Algorand has produced a scalable platform that provides security, fast finality, and (as Sean emphatically emphasizes), &ldquo;zero downtime.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Algorand to focus on institutional partnerships</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Algorand has entered some very important partnerships this year, including one with FIFA, the official governing body of football. Algorand became the official blockchain platform of FIFA following and&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/should-you-buy-algorand-ahead-of-the-world-cup-amid-a-sponsorship-deal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sponsorship and technical partnership deal</u></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As FIFA&rsquo;s official blockchain partner, Algorand has launched a marketplace for collectibles tied to FIFA&rsquo;s digital archives. Algorand&rsquo;s interim CEO explained that</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;There are many ways the partnership could evolve, from issuing bonds to creating composable tickets that &ldquo;take on a life of their own. The first step on its innovation journey is to start embracing new technology and drive benefits to engage more closely with fans.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Moving forward, Ford said Algorand would focus on establishing institutional relationships. He said;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;Traditional financial institutions have been more thoughtful and rigorous about understanding the technology and the benefits and pressure-testing the capabilities of technical partners. They are more rigorous because they have a fiduciary responsibility, and there are things they can&rsquo;t accept like downtime, lack of security, or lack of finality.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Ford concluded that despite the slow rate of adoption, the presence of institutional entities in the crypto market is inevitable. He said;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen a big pullback if you consider adopting new infrastructure &mdash; at least in our world. Our partners worldwide, like Koibanx in Latin America, are working with dozens of financial institutions and banks to adopt blockchain and Algorand and leverage it for their infrastructure. They&rsquo;re very active even in this climate.&rdquo;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Apecoin was one of the most talked-about crypto assets near the end of the last bull run. It&rsquo;s still one of the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/apecoin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>top 50 projects by market cap</u></a> as well. But in 2023 and beyond, there&rsquo;s a high chance every Apecoin price prediction will be outpaced by MCADE.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This article will explain why your Apecoin price prediction may be too high in the sections below.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Apecoin (APE)?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In the spring of 2022, Bored Ape Yacht Club released a utility and governance token for the APE ecosystem, Apecoin (APE). Holders of APE tokens not only have exclusive access to merch, games, services, and events but also have a say in what partnerships and programmes the Ape Foundation will support. In addition, third-party developers can also reward their participants with APE tokens.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Can APE compete with MCADE in the future?</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Metacade (MCADE)?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://metacade.co/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> is a virtual gathering spot and community hub that&rsquo;s set to be home to the latest, greatest GameFi and P2E games, similar to the way Steam operates for PC games. With so many different titles in the works, there will be something for everyone to enjoy in the Metacade. That&rsquo;s part of what makes the project so promising.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another reason for the optimism surrounding Metacade is its commitment to the community. It serves the community by offering many avenues for earning income online, such as P2E games, staking, prize draws, and even competitive tournaments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Plus, <a href="https://metacade.co/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> will give out funding via Metagrants to aspiring developers from the community with big ideas. The community will vote on who receives these grants to give users more of a say over what Metacade looks like moving forward. This will also help to ensure that there are always fun, new games to try on the platform with a valuable reason to keep coming back.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Metacade will be more successful than Apecoin &ndash; Here&rsquo;s why</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Now that we&rsquo;ve covered what Metacade is let&rsquo;s look at why the price prediction for it is higher than our Apecoin price prediction. Here are four factors to consider while you evaluate your Apecoin price prediction moving forward.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Metacade Offers Something for Everyone</h3>
<p dir="ltr">What makes Metacade special is its inclusion of many different Web3 gaming titles on one platform. Most projects only offer a single game for users to play. This means that if someone doesn&rsquo;t enjoy that game, they have no reason to continue engaging with the platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade&rsquo;s increasing library of titles gives users an ever-expanding list of reasons to engage with the platform. This helps keep user levels high and ensures long-term growth.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Apecoin Has Limited Appeal</h3>
<p dir="ltr">One thing to consider when making your Apecoin price prediction is that the project is an extension of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection. This NFT collection is one of the most popular on the market but also one of the most widely ridiculed in the crypto community.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many crypto enthusiasts dislike Bored Ape Yacht Club and its holders. These people are unlikely to ever engage with Apecoin which could hold the project back in 2023 and beyond.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Metacade is For More Than Just Gaming</h3>
<p dir="ltr">As a platform, Metacade does more than just give people access to the best games. It&rsquo;s also a socially active place where friends can spend time together and meet new people. Individuals who wish to work in Web3 could one day find their first jobs, doing things like testing games and managing communities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In this sense, Metacade has the scope to become like a virtual community square or town hall, providing an important social space for the future of the metaverse. Its potential goes beyond the gaming sector.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Apecoin Is Dependent on Too Much Going the Right Way</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.yuga.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Apecoin</u></a> will serve as the native currency of Yuga Labs&rsquo; upcoming Otherside metaverse world project. That&rsquo;s why Apecoin has managed to hold a relatively high market cap.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, if anything goes wrong with Otherside &ndash; such as not having many users at launch or experiencing delays &ndash; then Apecoin will suffer. The same is true of the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem in general.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This means that Apecoin is too dependent on other projects to succeed on its own. It&rsquo;s important to remember this while making an Apecoin price prediction.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Metacade (MCADE) seems to be the better investment opportunity</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Given everything this article has covered, it should be easier to see why the Apecoin price prediction is lower than the prediction for MCADE. Metacade offers a vast range of utilities across its platform and a potentially massive combined target audience from an exploding gaming sector. A platform with a variety of gaming experiences is much more likely to capture and successfully retain users at a significantly higher rate than a single-title experience.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The project&rsquo;s presale pricing began at 125 MCADE for $1 and will gradually increase in price to 50 MCADE for $1 by the time it ends. Metacade and its MCADE token stand to become one of the very best investments of 2023 and beyond. Potential investors should get into it before the hordes descend. The earlier a solid investment is made, the greater the potential to profit.</p>
<p><strong>You can participate in the Metacade pre-sale&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://metacade.co/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong><u>here</u></strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">OKCoin&rsquo;s CEO believes that the rising need for sound currency systems could result in the next bull run.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">More countries will follow El Salvador&rsquo;s footsteps and adopt digital currencies, the CEO added.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The next Bitcoin halving in 2024 could also trigger a surge in crypto prices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Three catalysts could ignite the next bull run</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Okcoin CEO Hong Fang, revealed in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRJDlDOUopY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recent interview</u></a>, that he believes three catalysts could trigger the next Bitcoin bull run. He mentioned this while talking to Kitco News earlier this week.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to Fang, the rising need for sound currency systems, caused by the failures of current centralised monetary systems, could serve as a catalyst for the next crypto bull market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He added that he envisions a scenario where more countries will follow El Salvador&rsquo;s footsteps and make Bitcoin a legal tender. Fang said;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;I think from a macro perspective, we continue to see challenges out there&hellip; I think the World Bank recently came out saying that a dozen countries may default on their own country&rsquo;s debt next year, which is a failure of a centralized monetary system. I would suspect that the fundamental need for a more sound money will continue to build in the background, something like El Salvador, but maybe of a larger size.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Bitcoin halving could trigger the next bull cycle</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">According to Fang, the next&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/halvening-explained-infographic/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Bitcoin halving</u></a> event in 2024 could also trigger a bull cycle. He stated that;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Bitcoin has its own [halving] cycle. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s coincidental that the past crypto cycles have somewhat coincided with the Bitcoin [halving] cycle, but that may also be another catalyst&hellip;I think the third potential catalyst is real projects. Every time we have a bull market with Bitcoin, with DeFi [decentralized finance] and NFTs [non-fungible tokens], that was because a lot of builders, they built projects in the last bear market. So I think that all of the projects that are being built right now, when there is a little more substance that can be felt by the customers that they tend to serve, [it] will trigger another bull market.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The leading cryptocurrency has been underperforming in recent months, with the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Bitcoin</u></a> now close to the $17k mark.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Poor record keeping is making the unwinding of the collapse FTX exchange difficult.</li>
<li>The new FTX management is trying to trace millions of dollars from several bank accounts.</li>
<li>So far, the new management has identified over $1 billion.</li>
</ul>
<p>FTX&rsquo;s new management, which took over from the founder Sam Bankman-Fried, on Tuesday told a procedural hearing that it has identified assets worth more than $1 billion since it <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ftx-begins-strategic-review-of-all-company-assets/">started a strategic review of its assets</a>. It also said that it had located about $720 million held by US financial institutions, which it is yet to consolidate.</p>
<p>The US financial institutions were authorized to hold funds by the US Department of Justice and about $500 million are already confirmed held in US institutions.</p>
<p>The new FTX chief financial officer (CFO), Mary Cilia speaking under oath during the bankruptcy hearings said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We are reaching out to all of those banks and changing the signatories on the accounts so that we can get access to the accounts and move the cash as much as we can to authorized depository institutions.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2>$423 million held at a single broker</h2>
<p>The CFO also mentioned that about $423 million held by US authorities are from a single broker though she never mentioned the broker by name. Cilia said, &ldquo;$485 million are already in an authorized deposit institution&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides the funds held in the US, there is about $130 million in cash that is locked up in Japan where local authorities have ring-fenced the funds for local customers.</p>
<p>Steve Coverick, a senior director at FTX&rsquo;s financial advisors Alvarez &amp; Marsal told the hearing that the new management is working to identify FTX&rsquo;s international crypto assets and transfer them to cold wallets using custodial providers like <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ftx-to-hire-bitgo-to-safeguard-its-assets-during-bankruptcy/">Bitgo, which FTX hired in November</a>.</p>
<h2>Difficulties in winding up FTX</h2>
<p>While the Chapter 11 bankruptcy hearings are supposed to wind up the FTX exchange, there have been complications due to poor record keeping and weak governance under the former CEO, SBF. The new management is being forced to look for details by reviewing customer terms and conditions stored in a variety of places including Slack and Google Drive.</p>
<p>As a result, the exchange is yet to file a statement of its financial position or of its assets as required under the US bankruptcy law. It however estimates it could do so in April next year.</p>

<p dir="ltr">OKX has listed BNB token, the native token of its rival exchange Binance, on its platform.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">OKB is up by more than 4%, outperforming the other major cryptocurrencies.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The broader cryptocurrency market has been underperforming after a positive start to the week.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>BNB is now live on the OKX exchange</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/okx-review-a-one-stop-platform-for-crypto-defi-dapps-nfts-and-gamefi/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>OKX</u></a>, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, announced a few hours ago that it had <a href="https://www.okx.com/support/hc/en-us/articles/11602083672205" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>listed BNB trading pairs</u></a> on its platform. BNB is the native token of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Binance</u></a>, one of OKX&rsquo;s major rivals.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The BNB (BNB/USDT and BNB/USDC) trading pairs are now available on the OKX spot trading platform. This <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>latest cryptocurrency news</u></a> has pushed OKB up by more than 4% in the last 24 hours, making it the best performer amongst the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;The broader cryptocurrency market has retreated after a positive start to the week. The total crypto market cap is down by less than 1% and currently stands below $810 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin is up by less than 1% but continues to struggle to move past the $17k resistance level.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Key levels to watch</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The OKB/USDT 4-hour chart has turned positive, as OKB has been performing well over the last 24 hours. The technical indicators show that OKB&rsquo;s performance could improve in the near term.</p>
<div class="fr-img-space-wrap"><span class="fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib fr-draggable fr-fil" style="width: 600px"><span class="fr-img-wrap">
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/21/1671615628058-be114cc1-86c5-4b99-a6bc-b383aa94db62.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil" width="600" height="261"><span class="fr-inner"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OKBUSDT/?exchange=OKX"><u>OKB/USDT Chart By TradingView</u></a></span></p>
<p></p></span></span>
<p class="fr-img-space-wrap2">&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">The 14-day RSI of 57 shows that OKB is neutral at the moment but could enter the overbought region if the rally continues. The MACD line just crossed into the positive line, indicating that the bulls have taken control of the OKB market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At press time, OKB is trading at $22.592. If the bullish trend continues, OKB could surge past the $24.245 resistance level before the end of the day. The positive trend could continue over the next few days and rally toward the $26.5 resistance level.&nbsp;</p>
