<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Nevada man charged for involvement in $45M CoinDeal scheme with leader Neil Chandran and conspirator Michael Glaspie.</em></li>



<li><em>DOJ announced charges separately against Chandran in June 2022 and SEC charged eight parties in January 2023.</em></li>



<li><em>CoinDeal stole $45M from 10,000 victims in total.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) charged Bryan Lee, a Nevada man, for his participation in a cryptocurrency scheme called CoinDeal. According to the DOJ, Lee conspired with Neil Chandran, the leader of CoinDeal, to defraud investors through Chandran’s companies.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DOJ-Charges-Nevada-Man-In-45M-Scheme-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="600" height="400" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DOJ-Charges-Nevada-Man-In-45M-Scheme-1.jpg" alt="DOJ Charges Nevada Man In 45M Scheme 1" class="wp-image-188818" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DOJ-Charges-Nevada-Man-In-45M-Scheme-1.jpg 600w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DOJ-Charges-Nevada-Man-In-45M-Scheme-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="DOJ Charges Nevada Man In $45M Scheme 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>One of these companies, ViMarket, claimed to be developing VR and “metaverse” technologies and an associated cryptocurrency. While Chandran promised “extremely high returns” to investors, Lee followed Chandran’s instructions and put investor funds into ViMarket’s bank accounts. The DOJ said that both individuals spent millions of dollars worth of misappropriated funds on non-business expenses, including luxury cars and property.</p>



<p>Lee may face up to 110 years in prison on various counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud, and engaging in monetary transactions on criminally derived property. However, he has not yet been found guilty and will make his first appearance in court immediately.</p>



<p>In June 2022, the DOJ additionally announced charges against Chandran, who was also arrested at that time. The agency also stated that another conspirator, Michael Glaspie, plead guilty in February 2023 and will be sentenced in June.</p>



<p>Furthermore, in January 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged eight parties in connection to the CoinDeal scheme. The scheme is reported to have stolen about $45 million from 10,000 victims in total.</p>

<li><em>Bitcoin set to claim the cryptocurrency throne by the end of 2023, according to Fedi’s CEO.<img decoding="async" src="https://news.coincu.com/70a7a108-19d6-4e82-94a2-7bc6c461c8ea" alt="&#x1f3af;" title="Why Bitcoin&#039;s &#039;Tick, Tick, Tick&#039; is a Warning Sign for Investors in 2023? 5"></em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>During the Bitcoin 2023 event that took place in Miami on May 20, Fedi&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, Nwosu, expressed his confidence that Bitcoin will reign supreme in the cryptocurrency world by the end of 2023. </strong></h5>

<p>He highlighted that Bitcoin&#8217;s superiority will be &#8220;clear&#8221; in every aspect of the ecosystem, as it offers the fastest, cheapest, easiest, most decentralized, and secure solution.</p>



<p>Nwosu believes that Bitcoin&#8217;s efficiency and security will become increasingly noticeable by year-end, regardless of whether the goal is to develop functionality, establish a decentralized social media network, or even empower local communities. While he envisions a &#8220;multi-coin future,&#8221; he emphasized that there is a &#8220;big misunderstanding&#8221; regarding Bitcoin&#8217;s &#8220;slow innovation.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Catching up with homies is the best part of conferences. <a href="https://twitter.com/obi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@obi</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/FelixWeis?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@FelixWeis</a> taking the picture!<br><br>Known these dudes for over almost a decade now!

</div></figure>



<p>He explained that there is a misconception that there is a functional or scaling limitation with Bitcoin, but the reality is that developments are happening &#8220;incredibly fast,&#8221; with a focus on creating solutions &#8220;that are correct the first time.&#8221; Prioritizing perfection may cause some delays, but it is preferable to the need for changes to be made &#8220;again, and again.&#8221;</p>



<p>In Nwosu&#8217;s view, cryptocurrency is essentially &#8220;an idea,&#8221; as it &#8220;is a combination of the philosophical aspects and the technological aspects kind of combined together.&#8221; However, due to the intangible nature of cryptocurrency, it cannot be combated with physical forces such as &#8220;guns or missiles.&#8221; Instead, it is vulnerable to attacks through &#8220;misinformation and sometimes inappropriate or extreme regulation.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nwosu pointed out that countries lacking belief in freedom of speech, or just freedom overall, are actively looking at stringent regulation towards cryptocurrency. He believes that the key to fight back against this is to &#8220;correct&#8221; misinformation and create systems that &#8220;empower the good guys.&#8221; Overall, Nwosu&#8217;s confidence in Bitcoin&#8217;s supremacy and his vision for a multi-coin future provide insight into the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency.</p>

<li><em>Vivek Ramaswamy, the second US Presidential candidate to officially accept Bitcoin donations for the 2024 elections.</em></li>



<li><em>Eligible US citizens can donate up to $6,600. Donors will receive a non-fungible token (NFT) as a reward.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Vivek Ramaswamy recently made headlines when he became the second Presidential candidate in the United States to accept Bitcoin donations for the upcoming 2024 elections. </strong></h5>

<p>In a public statement, he urged supporters to donate just $1 towards his campaign, indicating that he was accepting Bitcoin donations. Ramaswamy&#8217;s revelation came just two days after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. became the first presidential candidate in United States history to accept campaign donations in Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Ramaswamy&#8217;s decision to accept Bitcoin donations is significant, as it reflects a growing interest in cryptocurrency and a desire to make the 2024 election a referendum on fiat currency. During his announcement, Ramaswamy even flashed a QR code while on stage, which when scanned, would redirect users to a payment gateway that offers various payment options for donations, including BTC and Satoshi (sats) — the smallest denomination of Bitcoin.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just announced we’re officially accepting <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#Bitcoin</a> donations. <br>Give $1. <br>Let’s make the 2024 election a referendum on fiat currency. <a href="https://t.co/KrHJdomtCh" target="_blank">https://t.co/KrHJdomtCh</a> <a href="https://t.co/OkVmoBmTFz" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/OkVmoBmTFz</a></p>&mdash; Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) <a href="https://twitter.com/VivekGRamaswamy/status/1660016950632652801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 20, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that eligible U.S. citizens and permanent residents can donate up to $6,600 for the campaign, which is not deductible as charitable contributions for federal income tax purposes. In addition, donors will be awarded with a non-fungible token (NFT) as the donation page mentions, &#8220;After donating, come back to claim your NFT.&#8221; This is a unique way to reward supporters and create a sense of community around the campaign.</p>



<p>Interestingly, lawmakers in the Kansas House of Representatives recently introduced a bill proposing a cap of $100 when it comes to crypto political donations. If this bill were to pass, any donations under $100 would need to be immediately converted to U.S. dollars, not used for expenditures, and not held onto by the receiver.</p>



<p>Ramaswamy&#8217;s decision to accept Bitcoin donations is a bold move that reflects a changing political landscape. It will be interesting to see how other candidates respond to this move and whether it will have any impact on the outcome of the 2024 election.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Turkcorp, a major hedge fund and management company, has announced the opening of a new cryptocurrency exchange in Ankara, Turkey.</em></li>



<li><em>Turkex, the new exchange, will provide a dependable and secure platform for buying and selling a range of cryptocurrencies at the lowest feasible costs.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange is slated to be live in the coming weeks, and early adopters may signal their interest by registering early.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hedge fund Turkcorp <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/05/20/2672869/0/en/TURKCORP-launches-new-crypto-exchange-Turkex-to-give-investors-more-options-across-the-MENA-area.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it would launch a new cryptocurrency exchange Turkex in Ankara, Turkey.</strong></h5>

<p>In addition to offering crypto trading, the new exchange also supports real-time market data, charting tools, and multiple order execution methods. The crypto exchange will launch in the next few weeks, and early adopters can sign up early.</p>



<p>Turkex&#8217;s debut comes as demand for cryptocurrency trading in the area grows and conventional investment channels such as equities and real estate undergo a decline.</p>



<p>Türküm&#8217;s founder, who is thought to be worth $40 million, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Turkcorp is excited to be at the forefront of this rapidly evolving industry that can rightfully be termed as the future of finance. We have been consulting with clients for a while now and, after conducting our due diligence, have designed the exchange to meet the needs of both novice and experienced traders. We believe this will provide a much-needed platform for secure cryptocurrency trading in Turkey, Europe, and the MENA region.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Turkcorp&#8217;s expertise in finance and technology will be used to provide a trader-focused platform that helps them by providing strong liquidity, fair trade pricing, and minimal trading costs.</p>



<p>The corporation has already committed considerable amounts to the new exchange&#8217;s development and marketing. To build a world-class trading experience, they have employed elite professionals that understand UI and UX.</p>



<p>Turkey is also one of the nations that want to boost its economy using anti-inflationary methods such as cryptocurrency. According to GWI Research, Turkey saw the biggest rise in crypto ownership, with 27.1% from July-September 2021 to July-September 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>An attacker succeeded in obtaining complete control of the governance of the decentralized crypto mixer Tornado Cash with a counterfeit proposal.</em></li>



<li><em>The project development team urges the community to withdraw from the protocol and is working on possible measures to resolve the incident.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tornado Cash&#8217;s governance was compromised as a result of a fraudulent proposal. The attackers removed all TORN tokens from the protocol&#8217;s vault and sold them on the open market.</strong></h5>

<p>An attacker successfully gave 1.2 million votes to a fraudulent proposal on May 20 at 3:25 ET. Assuming that the proposition garnered over 700,000 valid votes, the attacker gained complete control over Tornado Cash.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On 2023/05/20 at 07:25:11 UTC, Tornado Cash governance effectively ceased to exist. Through a malicious proposal, an attacker granted themselves 1,200,000 votes.

</div></figure>



<p>The information was given by @samczsun of research-driven technology investment company Paradigm, who disclosed that while presenting the fraudulent proposal, the attacker claimed that it employed reasoning similar to a proposal previously approved by the community. This time, though, the suggestion had an extra purpose.</p>



<p>As @samczsun describes, this malicious recommendation is identical to prior regular ideas, except for the addition of a distinct line of code-named emergencyStop. After the proposal has been accepted by the voters, the attackers will use this emergencyStop function, which will result in a fresh logic update for the proposal that creates additional bogus votes.</p>



<p>With complete control over Tornado Cash governance, the attacker may remove all locked votes, drain all tokens in the governance contract, and brick the router. According to @samczsun, the attacker simply sold it 10,000 votes as TORN all at the time of writing.</p>



<p>The Tornado Cash attacker got 483,000 TORn from the Tornado Cash governance vault and 6,000 TORN into Bitrue before selling 379,300 TORN on the network for 375 ETH. There are 97,700 TORNs that have yet to be sold or transferred.</p>



<p>The hack serves as a caution to cryptocurrency investors to thoroughly review proposal descriptions and arguments. Tornado Cash&#8217;s active community member, Tornadosaurus-Hex or Mr. Tornadosaurus Hex, acknowledged that all money in governance is possibly compromised and asked that all members remove any funds held in Governance.</p>



<p>The team is presently looking for Solidity developers who can assist in saving the protocol from extinction. They also indicated that they need interaction with Binance, which has more tokens than the attacker.</p>



<p>Binance said that it would temporarily cease accepting TORN deposits owing to a governance assault on the Tornado Cash protocol.</p>

<p>TORN is now trading at about $4.5, down over 30% in the previous 24 hours. The price is expected to plummet more as word of the assault travels around the community.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Arbitrum and Chainlink have announced the availability of Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) on Arbitrum One.</em></li>

<p>VRF offers an easy-to-use subscription management software for gaining access to a safe source of randomness, enabling smart contract writers to create the next generation of provably fair and scalable NFT and gaming apps.</p>



<p>This will provide developers with access to a well-known random number generator (RNG). On May 22, the Arbitrum Foundation and Chainlink will offer a VRF workshop.</p>



<p>According to the official press release, Chainlink VRF has joined the Arbitrum One platform. Arbitrum and Chainlink will gain from the launch since it will provide them access to new decentralized apps (dApps) and smart contracts created by developers.</p>



<p>Chainlink VRF continues to be the most widely used RNG (random number generator) in the cryptocurrency sector. It enables smart contract developers to create scalable, fair, and secure applications like as gambling and NFT. Moreover, Arbitrum One allows developers to create dApps at a cheap cost and with great throughput.</p>



<p>Johann Eid of Chainlink Labs remarked on Arbitrum&#8217;s merits in relieving Ethereum transaction congestion while maintaining security. He thinks that by improving VRF, Arbitrum&#8217;s remarkable speed will enable many new use cases.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Ethereum Layer 2s like Arbitrum play a fundamental role in offloading transaction congestion from Ethereum without sacrificing the security needed to ensure the healthy growth of the blockchain industry. We&#8217;re excited about the use cases that can now be unlocked by optimizing Chainlink VRF to benefit from the incredible speed enabled by Arbitrum.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Arbitrum One&#8217;s Chainlink VRF is a win-win scenario for both the Arbitrum and Chainlink communities. The VRF has completed over 15.8 million request transactions and is now providing verified randomization to over 6,300 distinct smart contracts across different blockchains.</p>



<p>Chainlink and Arbitrum have joined to assist developers in creating complex DApps that trigger crucial smart contract functionality. Arbitrum One&#8217;s Chainlink Automation automates important smart contract tasks in a decentralized way.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Ben.eth&#8217;s PSYOP meme currency launch has generated a lot of publicity, but it hasn&#8217;t been without controversy.</em></li>



<li><em>Ben.eth is facing class action lawsuits for deceiving investors as well as potential wire fraud allegations.</em></li>



<li><em>Apart from the possibility of legal issues with the presale, several early investors discovered that they had lost virtually all of the ETH they intended to use to purchase PSYOP due to slippage.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ben.eth, a pseudonymous NFT collector turned famous meme currency inventor, has made over $7 million in ETH sales in the last seven days with a presale of his new memecoin, PSYOP.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1002.png"><img decoding="async" width="505" height="564" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1002.png" alt="Bitboy Crypto, PSYOP Creator Encounters Class-Action Lawsuit" class="wp-image-188769" title="Bitboy Crypto, PSYOP Creator Encounters Class-Action Lawsuit 22"></a></figure></div>


<p>Ben.eth is facing class action lawsuits for deceiving investors and for wire fraud.</p>



<p>In a tweet on May 20, Mike Kanovitz, a partner at law firm Loevy &amp; Loevy and CEO of Jurat Blockchains, alleges that he will sue ben.eth if he does not repay PSYOP presale customers. As an NFT, a letter was sent to the address ben.eth.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To <a href="https://twitter.com/eth_ben?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@eth_ben</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/psyopeth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@psyopeth</a> :<br>My law firm, Loevy &amp; Loevy, will be filing a class action against you in your IRL name if you do not refund all of the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PSYOP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$PSYOP</a> presale purchasers immediately. <br>Our settlement demand letter has served as an NFT to your ben.eth address, viewable here:… <a href="https://t.co/qaxhECDUhb" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/qaxhECDUhb</a></p>&mdash; Mike Kanovitz (@MikeKanovitz) <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeKanovitz/status/1659611715623960579?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 19, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Ben.eth might face charges of deceiving investors, racketeering, fraud, and wire fraud, according to the letter. The PSYOP presale garnered more than $7 million, and the lawyer seeks $21 million in damages if the class action case is launched. In a settlement, Kanovitz has requested that investors get ETH.</p>



<p>Ben.eth has identified media celebrity Andrew Tate as a prospective buyer for the PSYOP meme currency. Earlier, YouTuber Ben &#8220;Bitboy&#8221; Armstrong was connected to the BEN meme currency after purchasing and then selling all of his token holdings.</p>



<p>Others are claiming to be suing Ben.eth and have shown interest in joining the current class action lawsuit. Ben.eth, on the other hand, makes jokes about the lawsuit and concentrates on airdrops.</p>

<p>After the success of his initial meme currency launch, BEN, investors were anxious to join in on ben.eth&#8217;s next meme coin initiative.</p>



<p>BEN rewarded its early investors with a more than 5,000% one-day rise on May 8th, triggered by an endorsement from crypto influencer Ben Armstrong, who finally took over the project from ben.eth for an unknown sum.</p>



<p>Despite Ben.eth&#8217;s presale raising some severe red flags, the success of the unconventional PSYOP presale demonstrates increased investor zeal to get in early on what may be the next trendy meme currency.</p>



<p>On-chain investigator ZachXBT has also released evidence of deceiving investors and raising 10,000 ETH via the PSYOP presale. ZachXBT has been revealing various meme currencies as individuals are being tricked into trading throughout the memecoin season.</p>

<p>Ordinals is a system that enables users to generate records using text, photos, audio, and video on Bitcoin&#8217;s smallest unit, the satoshi. In the Bitcoin network, these data may be utilized to generate NFTs and tokens.</p>



<p>According to the OKX statement, ORDI deposits will be available on May 20, 2023 at 7:00 a.m. UTC. Spot trading for the ORDI/USDT pair will commence if the ORDI token investment satisfies the exchange&#8217;s standards. The total supply and circulating supply of ORDI are both 21 million, which corresponds to the maximum amount of Bitcoins.</p>



<p>OKX CEO Star also tweeted on the ORDI listing, stating that the OKX exchange would soon list ORDI and start deposits and withdrawals. He also said that the BRC-20 token wallet and marketplace would be available on the web3 wallet starting next week.</p>



<p>Ordinals is a meme token in the BRC-20 network, a layer-2 Bitcoin solution that allows smart contracts and decentralized apps. Many BTC advocates, however, say that they choke the BTC network and are worthless.</p>

<p>In a short amount of time, a considerable number of BRC-20 tokens have been created, many of which are meme tokens. Also, the Dogecoin network has a similar arrangement dubbed DRC-20, which has helped the DOGE network to shatter records in terms of transaction volume.</p>



<p>Yesterday, the crypto exchange Gate.io also <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188705-gateio-ordi-withdrawal-high-fees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the availability of ORDI withdrawals, but the community objected since the transaction cost was too expensive. On May 19, the exchange allowed the BRC-20 ORDI Token withdrawal, although it was widely criticized by the community since the withdrawal cost was as high as 65 ORDI, which Gate subsequently decreased to 5.58 ORDI.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Account Labs was founded by UniPass, a smart contract wallet provider, and Keystone, a renowned hardware wallet developer.</em></li>



<li><em>Their collaboration is a deliberate choice that will allow them to harness their combined experience.</em></li>



<li><em>The goal is to democratize access to Web3 products.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>UniPass, a non-custodial crypto smart contract wallet, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/account-labs-emerges-from-unipass-and-keystone-merger-forging-ahead-in-web3-account-abstraction-301829206.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> in its press release that it would combine with cryptocurrency hardware wallet Keystone to become Account Labs.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-996.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-996-1024x576.png" alt="UniPass, Keystone Merge To Democratize Expand Access To Web3 Products" class="wp-image-188756" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-996-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-996-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-996-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-996-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-996-1140x642.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-996.png 1267w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="UniPass, Keystone Merge To Democratize Expand Access To Web3 Products 30"></a></figure></div>


<p>Keystone founder Liu Lixin will be named CEO of Account Labs, while Unipass founder Zhi Xian will be named COO (COO). Account Labs will concentrate on creating and exploring account abstraction (AA) solutions in the future.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We are on the cusp of a Web3 Account Abstraction revolution. Together, we&#8217;ll drive rapid transformation, making the transition from Web2 to Web3 effortless for users. Our goal is to ensure everyone can securely and smoothly manage a decentralized account. We welcome partners to join us in advancing the Web3 account domain,&#8221; said Xian.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Account Labs combines UniPass and Keystone&#8217;s vast expertise in cryptography research, software engineering, product design, and security protection. Their collaborative efforts will center on identifying synergies in the Account abstraction industry and fostering technical innovation. </p>



<p>The mission is to provide next-generation Web3 Account Abstraction solutions that make decentralized account ownership and administration a seamless experience for consumers, ultimately boosting blockchain technology adoption.</p>



<p>The original investors in Keystone and UniPass have also expressed significant support for this combination. Amber Group, Atom Capital, BAI Capital, BODL Ventures, DWEB3 Capital, Folius Ventures, Galxe, HashGlobal, HashKey Capital, Jerry Huang, Mable Jiang, Mask Network, MixMarvel DAO Ventures, NGC Ventures, Permanent Ventures, Qiming Ventures, SNZ Holding, Xinjun Liang, and Youbi Capital are among them.</p>



<p>According to Unipass, most current crypto wallets function as an &#8216;Externally-Owned Account&#8217; (EOA), yet if a user loses a private key or seed phrase, permanent asset loss is unavoidable.</p>



<p>Account abstraction, on the other hand, may more effectively enlarge the programming space of Web3 accounts. It is the same as Ethereum if EOA is Bitcoin. As a result, account abstraction, which is novel to the blockchain industry, revolutionizes the way Web3 accounts interact. It&#8217;s a novel approach to attracting people.</p>



<p>Account abstraction, a concept initially proposed by Ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin in 2015, solves the usability and security issues associated with decentralized accounts. With this acquisition, Account Labs will be the sole industry player working at the convergence of usability and security.</p>



<p>UniPass&#8217; renowned technological techniques have received recognition and application across a wide range of applications, successfully facilitating access for Web3 users. They develop a full decentralized account ecosystem by using complex cryptographic technologies like zero-knowledge proofs and DKIM protocols.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Éric Larchevêque, co-founder of Ledger and CEO from 2014 to 2019, went on to convey his thoughts on the wallet&#8217;s new function.</em></li>



<li><em>Last week, the controversial crypto business was chastised for introducing a service that allowed them authority over seed phrase storage.</em></li>



<li><em>To him, the whole collapse is a huge public relations disaster, not a technical one.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The crypto community reacted angrily to the debut of Ledger Recover, a service that lets users of the hardware wallet back up their secret recovery phrases.</strong></h5>

<p>Ledger co-founder and former CEO Éric Larchevêque, who worked at the company<em> </em>from 2014 to 2019, saw the criticism directed at the wallet as a pure PR failure, not a technological one.</p>



<p>A company upgrade included a subscription-based function named &#8220;Recover.&#8221; In addition, the problematic feature gave the firm access to client seed phrases and required Verification credentials. This contradicts Ledger&#8217;s core reason d&#8217;être, which is privacy and security.</p>



<p>Larchevêque <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/13ldgcl/my_personal_view_on_the_pr_disaster_from_a_ledger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“I’m devastated to come on this subreddit, that I created nine years ago, to see images of Ledger devices burning, insults and lot and lot of anger. I’m honestly to the verge of tears.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>His first action as a co-founder was to apologize for how the launch was handled. He did, however, defend the technique, stating:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“To me, all this meltdown is a total PR failure, but absolutely not a technical one.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He said that the Recover update has no effect on the security concept of the hardware wallet. He went on to say:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“My mistake as a CEO during my tenure was probably not be relentless enough about explaining the security model, but at some point you just give up as people don&#8217;t care at all. Until they care again, like now.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The ex-CEO claimed that the only thing that had changed was the general user&#8217;s perception of trustlessness and that the firmware&#8217;s Recover code was not malicious:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Ledger is still safe, there is no backdoor, the Ledger Recover is not a conspiracy, no one will ever force anyone to use Recover.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to him, the FUD and controversy that erupted in the aftermath of the update did not help things. The security model is the same as it was before customers were aware of Ledger Recover. Trusting Ledger by sharding the seed phrase is analogous to trusting the wallet with transaction signing, according to Larchevêque. In response to a user&#8217;s suggestion to have two distinct firmware versions to eliminate backdoor issues, he said that it wouldn&#8217;t alter anything and would be disappointing for him personally.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not the first time <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188438-ledger-defends-its-stand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ledger</a> has been involved in a contentious public relations debacle. That is also not the first time that corporate leaders have defended their products at the cost of their consumers.</p>



<p>It was chastised in April for advertising a necklace as part of the Ledger Nano X OnChain crypto wallet. The company entirely ignored the fact that wearing a hardware wallet around your neck violates every security standard in the book.</p>
