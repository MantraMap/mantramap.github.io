										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk – the South African billionaire behind companies like Tesla and SpaceX – played a last-minute April Fools’ joke and <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-ae/news/other/cryptocurrency-dogecoin-surges-as-musk-changes-twitter-logo-to-meme-dog/ar-AA19s1qA" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">changed the Twitter logo</a> (Twitter being the most <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-fan-elon-musk-now-fully-controls-twitter/" data-wpel-link="internal">recent company he bought</a>) to that of the Dogecoin dog.</p>
<h2>Elon Musk Pulls a Twitter Twist</h2>
<p>The move aided Dogecoin and brought the coin up by more than 20 percent. The asset initially was trading at eight cents but moved up to ten cents respectively after the logo was altered.</p>
<p>The sudden change – no matter how brief it may have been – shouldn’t come as a surprise to most diehard crypto followers given how much of an advocate for Dogecoin Musk has been during the past several years. Not long ago, he referred to the currency as the “<a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/elon-musk-affirms-his-position-on-doge-its-the-peoples-crypto/" data-wpel-link="internal">people’s crypto</a>.” He also stated he’d like to literally leave a Dogecoin <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/elon-musk-wants-to-literally-leave-dogecoin-on-the-moon/" data-wpel-link="internal">unit on the moon with</a> one of his SpaceX rockets.</p>
<p>At the same time, while the maneuver may have led to short-term results (a small spike in the Dogecoin price), it may not be in Musk’s best interest right now to mess around with Dogecoin considering he’s currently involved <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/elon-musk-asks-judge-to-toss-out-dogecoin-centered-lawsuit/" data-wpel-link="internal">in a $258 billion lawsuit</a> over his promotion of the asset.</p>
<p>Last year, several investors (plaintiffs) got together and sued Musk, claiming that they invested in Dogecoin after they saw him speak positively about it again and again. They said they never would have invested in the asset if Musk hadn’t been so forthcoming about the altcoin, though they eventually gave in and clearly invested funds they didn’t have into the currency.</p>
<p>2022 was marred by a terrible bear market that saw many coins lose more than 70 percent of their value or more. This caused the crypto space to lose more than $2 trillion in overall valuation. It was a sad and ugly sight to see, and there were many traders that lost everything they had.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs named in the present case certainly lost quite a bit, and they say that Musk behaved irresponsibly in his promotion of Dogecoin. They are now suing him and hoping to obtain much of their missing money back.</p>
<p>Musk is being accused of a pump and dump, though his lawyers are asking that the case be rejected given that he did not force anyone to invest in the asset. Not everyone is impressed or convinced by this argument, however. Recently, comedian Jesse McLaren – commenting on the Twitter logo change – said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why do I get the feeling the Doge icon was added so when you search &#8216;Elon&#8217; and &#8216;Doge&#8217; the story of his racketeering lawsuit will be buried?</p></blockquote>
<h2>Manipulating the Asset?</h2>
<p>Court <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/04/twitter-changes-logo-to-dogecoin-cryptocurrency-image-in-apparent-late-april-fools-day-gag?ref=upstract.com" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">documents regarding the case</a> state the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Musk used his pedestal as [the] world’s richest man to operate and manipulate the Dogecoin pyramid scheme for profit, exposure and amusement.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hackers in North Korea have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/3cx-supply-chain-attack-north-korea-cryptocurrency-targets/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">installed new code</a> across a wide array of apps as a means of breaking into digital currency exchanges and related companies.</p>
<h2>North Korea Is Up to Its Same Old Tricks</h2>
<p>The nation has long <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/north-korea-lashes-out-at-u-s-after-its-called-a-criminal-organization-seeking-to-steal-crypto/" data-wpel-link="internal">played host to notorious</a> hacking groups such as Lazarus, which are eagerly seeking new ways to garner cryptocurrencies illicitly through malware, cyberattacks, and related means so they can have the funds necessary to continually build out the nation’s ongoing nuclear program.</p>
<p>Thus far, North Korea has attacked a wide array of regions across the world including several Asian countries, European countries, and the U.S. It’s estimated that North Korea has made off with well over a billion dollars’ <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/report-north-korea-stole-more-crypto-in-2022-than-in-any-other-year/" data-wpel-link="internal">worth of digital currency</a> to boost its nukes.</p>
<p>Researchers at Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky identified a small number of crypto-focused businesses and enterprises that fell victim to 3CX software supply-chain attacks, all of which unfolded during either early April or late March. While none of the companies have been named at the time of writing, Kaspersky has commented they’re all based in “western Asia.”</p>
<p>Georgy Kucherin – a researcher at Kaspersky – put out a statement following the attacks and his company’s research study. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>This was all just to compromise a small group of companies, maybe not just in cryptocurrency, but what we see is that one of the interests of the attackers is cryptocurrency companies. Cryptocurrency companies should be especially concerned about this attack because they are the likely targets, and they should scan their systems for further compromise.</p></blockquote>
<p>The malware North Korea is using could affect as many as 600,000 separate businesses according to the research conducted by Kaspersky. Kucherin further said the cyberthreats emerging from North Korea are getting bigger and bigger. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is becoming very common. During supply-chain attacks, the threat actor conducts reconnaissance on the victims, collecting information, then they filter out this information, selecting victims to deploy a second-stage malware.</p></blockquote>
<p>The good news, he mentioned, is that many of the attacks (or attempted attacks, at least) have been relatively easy to spot. He says North Korea likes to think it can stay hidden in the shadows, but that at the end of the day, many of its methods come off as amateur. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>They tried to be stealthy, but they failed. Their first-stage implants were discovered.</p></blockquote>
<h2>It&#8217;s not Just Crypto Companies in Danger</h2>
<p>Despite this, Tom Hegel – a security researcher with Sentinel One – commented that it would be a mistake to assume only crypto companies have been targeted thus far, and the cyberattacks still pose certain dangers in that not all of them have been uncovered yet. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The current theory at this point is that the attackers did initially target crypto firms to get into those high-value organizations.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new survey suggests that millennials and Gen Z are <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/luxury-watchmakers-woo-generation-z-144228613.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">getting into luxury items</a>. Luxury watchmakers are now taking advantage of this and looking to attract younger buyers using products like <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a> and Snapchat.</p>
<h2>Millennials Don&#8217;t Usually Wear Watches</h2>
<p>The funny thing is that many millennials and younger generations are not used to wearing watches as they usually just have the time on their phones, but watchmakers believe they can make a huge dent in their sales and retail progression in the coming years given they have more spending power than virtually any other group before them.</p>
<p>In an interview, Rolex chief executive Jean-Frederic Dufour explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is very important that once a year, we showcase that wearing a watch is trendy, and even something for the youngest generation which is not used to wearing watches.</p></blockquote>
<p>At a recent conference, representatives of Snapchat announced a new application that would allow people to try on watches virtually, either through a tablet or smartphone. It adapts to a user’s wrist size and shows off Cartier watch models. From there, users can ultimately customize things like colors. Jean-Philippe Bertschy – an analyst with Swiss investment managers Vontobel – said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The younger generation, contrary to popular belief, have more economic power than any generation that preceded them. They are earning more, saving more, and investing earlier and at a higher rate than previous generations.</p></blockquote>
<p>He mentioned that an interesting phenomenon is on its way in that millennials and Gen Z are slated to garner a massive amount of wealth over the next two decades, either through inheritance or other means. He says they’re projected to rake in as much as $80 trillion by the time we reach 2045.</p>
<p>At the same time, both generations are stifled by many rising costs including mortgage costs. Analysts with Morgan Stanley commented that nearly half of people between the ages of 18 and 29 still live with their parents, something not witnessed in roughly 80 years. They said:</p>
<blockquote><p>They simply have more disposable income to be allocated to discretionary spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not long ago, H. Moser sold a watch for roughly ten bitcoins. Chief executive Edouard Meylan said bitcoin and crypto transactions are great for attracting younger consumers to the mix given they’ve become more “digitized” over the years. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>More than 50 percent of sales in China are to Gen Z and millennials.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Trying to Attract Younger Customers</h2>
<p>Christopher Hoppe – a Frenchman now living in the nation of Australia, where he founded the Bausele watch brand after spending many years making timepieces in Switzerland – says that younger people are often looking for watches and similar products many other people simply “won’t have.” He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We had lost this generation with mobile phones but found it again with the Apple Watch.</p></blockquote>

<li>The price is now trading below the $120 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a short-term rising channel forming with support at $112.80 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to move down if it stays below the $118 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin cash price is declining below the $120 zone against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-turns-red-below-29k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. BCH/USD could extend losses if there is a close below $110.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash price struggled to gain pace for a move above the $124 and $124 resistance levels. BCH formed a high near $123.94 and started a fresh decline.</p>
<p>There was a clear move below the $122.00 and $120.00 support levels. The pair even declined below the $115 support. It tested the $110 level. A low is formed near $110.16 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is now trading near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $123.94 swing high to the $110.16 low.</p>
<p>Besides, it is trading below the $120 zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-cash-analysis-key-breakout-resistance-sits-at-120/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. Immediate resistance is near the $117.00 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>The 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $123.94 swing high to the $110.16 low is also near $117. The next key resistance is near $120. Any more gains above $117 and $120 could set the pace for a move toward the $125 level.</p>
<p>If there is a move above the $125 resistance, the price could rise toward the $132 zone. If not, the price might continue lower below $110. Immediate support on the downside is near the $108 zone. The next major support is near the $100 level, below which the bears might aim for $92.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eurexcoin.com, a leading digital currency trading platform on the European continent, just announced that it’s going to be <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/23/04/ab31621305/eurexcoin-com-announces-high-end-security-measures-and-innovative-trading-protocol-for-its-crypto" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">enhancing its security and</a> protection methods tenfold.</p>
<h2>Eurexcoin.com Seeks to Enhance Its Security</h2>
<p>The crypto space is wrought with fraud and illicit attacks carried out on crypto exchanges. Often, it’s either the exchanges themselves losing tons of reserve money, or it’s individual customers that wake up one day to see their wallets have been drained and are empty. Either situation is ugly and rough to contend with, and many companies are working hard to make sure these kinds of attacks end.</p>
<p>There are also plenty of concerns out there regarding crypto exchanges following the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">collapse of FTX</a> in November. The protection of individual customer information was practically thrown out the window when the company went under, and the funds of individual traders were utilized (allegedly) to purchase luxury Bahamian real estate and pay off loans for an entirely separate firm.</p>
<p>Up to that point, such a degree of fraud was virtually unprecedented in the crypto arena, and it wasn’t long before FTX’s reputation as a leading trading platform transformed into one of filth and criminality.</p>
<p>John Smith – the CEO of Eurexcoin.com – explained in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>We understand that security is a top concern for our customers, and we take this responsibility very seriously. We have invested heavily in our security infrastructure to ensure that our customers can trade with peace of mind. We are constantly looking for ways to improve our platform and provide a better trading experience for our users. Our new trading protocol is the result of extensive research and development, and we are confident that it will be a game-changer in the cryptocurrency industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>Among the tools the company will be utilizing to ensure its customers remain safe are multi-factor authentication, cold storage, and advanced crypto algorithms. In addition, Eurexcoin.com will also regularly engage in security audits to ensure its systems are never subjected to any loopholes or vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the enterprise is implementing a new innovative trading protocol designed to boost the speed of trades and limit opportunities for price manipulation down the line. The company explained in a separate statement that it’s consistently looking to evolve and meet the needs of all its users.</p>
<h2>Should All Exchanges Become Decentralized?</h2>
<p>While this certainly sounds positive, there’s <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/should-every-crypto-exchange-become-decentralized-analysts-weigh-in/" data-wpel-link="internal">still a prevalent argument</a> making its way through the crypto space following incidents like FTX. Many are wondering if all exchanges should enter the defi realm and thus give traders full access and control of their digital tokens. Crypto journalist Tracy Wang said:</p>
<blockquote><p>A company like FTX was supposed to hold your assets, but they ended up lending them out. This is like taking power back and being… in charge of your own money.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How does crypto regulation work around the world? It appears <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/cryptocurrency-regulations-around-the-world/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">to be different in every country</a>, and the goal is to try and find the best approaches and take the best points from each to form a solid roadmap for traders everywhere.</p>
<h2>Crypto Regulation Differs Depending on the Country</h2>
<p>There has been a huge call for crypto regulation since the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">collapse of FTX</a> last November. In the U.S., agencies like the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptrollers of the Currency (OCC) released a joint statement explaining that crypto trading is extremely risky, and thus taking part in the arena goes against “sound banking practices.” The statement reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>Issuing or holding as principal crypto-assets that are issued, stored, or transferred on an open, public and/or decentralized network or similar, is highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.</p></blockquote>
<p>Christopher Mitchell – founder and principal of Keala Advisors – says the U.S. has it all wrong when it comes to crypto regulation. He commented that the big problem is that while crypto is part of a whole new technology trend, officials want to regulate it like it’s part of the standard financial industry. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The government wants to treat cryptocurrencies as traditional securities while also working to restrict their ability to be treated and function within financial markets like traditional securities.</p></blockquote>
<p>UK prime minister Rishi Sunak, by contrast, wants his country to become a huge crypto haven in the coming years. He recently stated that he’d like to regulate stable coins so they can become valid methods of payment in the future:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s my ambition to make the U.K. a global hub for crypto asset technology, and the measures we’ve outlined today will help to ensure firms can invest, innovate, and scale up in this country.</p></blockquote>
<p>Discussing crypto regulation in Brazil, Bruno Sousa – head of U.S. and new markets at Hashdex – said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brazil has been a frontrunner in crypto policy. The Real Digital project, led by the Brazilian Central Bank, is a very interesting project in terms of regulation because it is flexible in terms of adopting the new technology but maintaining current regulation for deposits… and making the large banks the ones who issue the stablecoins instead of bypassing the banks.</p></blockquote>
<h2>We Don&#8217;t Want People Like Do Kwon in the Mix</h2>
<p>He also stated that in general terms, crypto regulation is far more needed today, and he used the current situation <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-executive-do-kwon-arrested-in-montenegro/" data-wpel-link="internal">surrounding Do Kwon</a> and his recent arrest as the reason why. He says that men like Kwon are running rampant throughout the space, and regulation will have a hand in stopping this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Strong regulations are not only important, but necessary to foster the industry’s growth. From the investor’s standpoint, having access to this new asset class through regulated entities and investment funds helps mitigate the risks.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/scam/" data-wpel-link="internal">scammers</a> have a new way of <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/once-it-s-gone-there-s-no-getting-it-back-scammers-sending-victims-to-cryptocurrency-atms/ar-AA19nsAU" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">getting money out of their</a> intended victims. They are now pretending to be members of Best Buy’s infamous Geek Squad team. You know… The alleged computer geniuses that know everything about fixing your laptop or desktop.</p>
<h2>Is That the <em>Real</em> Geek Squad Contacting You?</h2>
<p>This was recently witnessed in a recent situation involving a woman living in Woodbury. In her inbox on Valentine’s Day last year, she received an email from Geek Squad saying her account would be renewed, and that she was going to be charged $1,145. Not thinking much of the email (she had a legitimate Geek Squad account), she ignored it at first, though she took note of the later verbiage that said if she was interested in cancelling, she had roughly 48 hours to do so.</p>
<p>The woman – who remains unnamed at the time of writing – stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Years ago, we had a service contract with Geek Squad, so I didn’t think much about it. The email said if I didn’t want to renew, I had 48 hours to cancel it, but that 48-hour period had already passed.</p></blockquote>
<p>While details are scarce at this time, she called the phone number listed on what turned out to be a fake invoice and said she wanted to end her account. The man on the other side of the call said he could take care of everything for her, though the situation escalated, and on many occasions, she was required to travel to a nearby bitcoin ATM to make transfers of anywhere between $7,000 and $8,000. Overall, the 78-year-old victim was cheated out of $70,000. She said:</p>
<blockquote><p>By the end, they had me so wrapped up and so scared and intimidated that I probably would have sold my house. It’s just crazy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lynn Lawrence – a Woodbury police detective – commented on the situation, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s sad, but there’s not much we can do. The money is gone within seconds, and once it’s gone, there’s no getting it back… It’s much different if we have a victim who has transferred money from one bank account to another bank account. Sometimes we can intercept those funds with the receiving bank and stop that kind of stuff, but with bitcoin, we don’t have those abilities, so really prevention and education are our only options at this point.</p></blockquote>
<h2>No Way to Track Things</h2>
<p>Marty Fleischhacker – senior financial fraud ombudsman for the Minnesota Department of Commerce – also threw his two cents into the mix, mentioning:</p>
<blockquote><p>The thing about cryptocurrency is you really can’t trace it, so you have no real ability to find the perpetrators at any point by following the money trail, so how do you stop it? That’s the problem… The old saying used to be, ‘Trust, but verify.’ Now it’s, ‘Verify before you trust.’</p></blockquote>
