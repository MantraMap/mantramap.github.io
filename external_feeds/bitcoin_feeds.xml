The move comes as momentum surrounding the token&#x2019;s listing on EDX markets continues to grow. Dogecoin also recorded a strong start to the day.</strong></p>
<h2>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>)</h2>
<p>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>) was once again a big mover in cryptocurrency markets, as the token rallied to a multi-month high.</p>
<p>Following a low of $91.73 during Friday&#x2019;s session, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>/USD raced to an intraday high of $111.76 earlier today.</p>
<p>As a result of the rally, litecoin peaked at its strongest point since April 7 last year, when price reached a top at $116.00.</p>

<p>After breaking out of a ceiling at 61.00 on the relative strength index (RSI), <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> bulls took the index past yet another ceiling.</p>
<p>This time at the 68.00 level, with price strength peaking at 73.91 to start the weekend, which is its highest point since January.</p>
<p>Litecoin has since gone on to retreat from today&#x2019;s high, and as of writing, is trading at $110.17.</p>

<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Another notable gainer on Saturday was dogecoin (DOGE), which climbed to a three-week high to start the weekend.</p>
<p>DOGE/USD jumped to a peak of $0.07079 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after falling to $0.06264.</p>
<p>The move saw the world&#x2019;s largest meme coin jump nearly 5% higher, hitting its highest level since June 10 in the process.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, Saturday&#x2019;s surge saw dogecoin collide with a key resistance level at $0.07000, before dropping lower.</p>
<p>DOGE is now trading at $0.06835, with the RSI hovering around the 56.00 mark, which is marginally above a ceiling at 55.00.</p>
<p>A target of $0.0750 likely remains on the agenda for bulls, however they face some challenges this weekend in order to reach this point.</p>

Markets moved to rebound on Saturday, after better than expected consumer sentiment data in the United Stated spooked traders. Bitcoin also rebounded, after falling below $30,000 on Friday.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>After falling below the $30,000 level during Friday&#x2019;s session, bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) rebounded on Saturday, however sentiment was still somewhat bearish.</p>
<p>Following a high of $31,093.98 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD dropped to an intraday low at $29,600.28 as the session progressed.</p>
<p>However, the price is now trading at $30,444.75, as bulls moved to buy the dip, pushing <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> higher to start the weekend.</p>

<p>As per the chart, the rebound came as the relative strength index (RSI) found a floor at the 63.00 mark.</p>
<p>The index is now tracking at 65.64, and seems to be heading for a resistance point around the 70.00 level.</p>
<p>A collision with this target will likely result in bitcoin once again moving above $31,000.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>On the other hand, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was largely bullish to start the weekend, with price surging to a two-month high.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD has peaked at $1,945.27 so far on Saturday, which comes a day after falling to a low at $1,831.28.</p>
<p>As a result of this rally, the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency jumped to its strongest point since May 6.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for this move was a breakout, which saw the RSI move past a ceiling at the 58.00 point.</p>
<p>As of writing, it appears that this break may have been false, and the index is now at a reading of 58.17, giving up earlier gains.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> is now trading at $1,914.81.</p>

In an interview on CNBC, Clayton stated that the SEC&#8217;s strategy of bringing myriad cases to court against U.S. corporations was problematic &#8220;at a 30,000-foot level.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Jay Clayton Criticizes SEC&#8217;s Case Volume Strategy</h2>
<p>Jay Clayton, former chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), voiced his concerns with the new &#8220;ethos&#8221; of U.S. regulators, which involves bringing many cases to court, even those they think won&#8217;t succeed. In a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jv8LcYg6QA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> on CNBC, Clayton referred to this enforcement strategy as a &#8220;fundamental shift&#8221; from how Americans view the role of the government.</p>
<p>About this new strategic approach, Clayton stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to be in a place where I know the government is going to bring cases they think they are going to lose; imagine you are the person that is subject to that case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Clayton declared that when agencies have the power of the state, they are &#8220;supposed to only bring cases and only make rules you think are going to pass judicial muster.&#8221;</p>

<h2>U.S. Enforcement Strategy Is &#8216;Problematic&#8217;</h2>
<p>Clayton also noted how state agencies believe that if they are not losing in courts, it can be perceived as if they have failed to fulfill their role as regulators, and how this can present problems for companies involved in these cases.</p>
<p>He explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What you are hearing from the leaders of the regulatory organizations is if we&#8217;re not losing cases, if we&#8217;re not being pushed back on by the courts we&#8217;re not doing enough &#8230; At a 30,000-foot level, I think that&#8217;s problematic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cameron Winklevoss, a co-founder of Gemini, a U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange that is facing a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-charges-genesis-and-gemini-winklevoss-says-regulators-lawsuit-is-super-lame/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuit</a> by the SEC &#8220;for the unregistered offer and sale of securities to retail investors through the Gemini Earn crypto asset lending program,&#8221; brought Clayton&#8217;s statements to the crypto space, <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1674132255906713605?t=CKkdAS6MJNxClaXythm_EA&amp;s=35" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> Former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton describes the new and deeply un-American ethos of the </span>SEC under <span class="r-18u37iz">Gary Gensler </span>— if we&#8217;re not losing cases, we aren&#8217;t suing enough businesses. This is a total abuse of power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Previously, Clayton has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-sec-chairman-jay-clayton-on-enforcement-actions-crypto-should-be-treated-with-nuance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticized</a> how some enforcement actions are carried out by the SEC, stating these matters should be approached with more &#8220;nuance.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Africa&#8217;s Share of Global Blockchain Funding Still Under 1%</h2>
<p>According to the latest Emurgo State of Web 3.0 in Africa report, the African continent’s cryptocurrency market &#8220;grew by over 1,200% between 2020 and 2021.&#8221; In addition, four African countries, namely Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania now feature the in the world’s top 20 for crypto adoption.</p>
<p>As shown by the data shared in the <a href="https://www.emurgo.africa/reports/emurgo-web-3-0-research-report.pdf">report</a>, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa accounted for 70% of the $88.5 million in blockchain funding which the continent received in 2021. However, despite this and the fact that African blockchain venture funding growth &#8220;was 11 times more when compared to general funding growth,&#8221; the continent’s share of total global blockchain funding is only 0.5%. This figure is nevertheless expected to grow when more companies attempt to create solutions to solve problems faced by the continent’s residents.</p>
<p>However, despite the underlying technology&#8217;s promise, as well as the impact that crypto assets have had on African residents, the report reveals that as much as 20% of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have banned crypto assets. The rest have either imposed some restrictions or implicit bans. The Central African Republic is the only African country to designate bitcoin as a legal tender.</p>
<p>As noted in the report, many countries in Africa have not embraced crypto assets due to their perceived risky nature. The collapse of crypto giants like the exchange FTX and subsequent ripple effects have seemingly reinforced governments’ negative perceptions about crypto assets.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<h2>Mitigating Against Risks Arising From Regulatory Changes</h2>
<p>Therefore, in order to help the continent’s crypto industry get on the good side of authorities, the authors of the report urged industry participants to consider working closely with regulators.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the need for the regulation of Blockchain and cryptocurrencies increases, key stakeholders need to work closely with regulators. This will ensure that risks that may arise as a result of regulatory changes are adequately mitigated,&#8221; authors of the Emurgo State of Web 3.0 report said.</p>
<p>More transparent regulations, on the other hand, will ostensibly see blockchain’s use cases increase. This increase in use cases will in turn spur further investments in the industry, according to the report.</p>

A rejection would prevent the exchange from advertising and growing in the major European market and deal another blow to its efforts to do regulated business on the Old Continent.</strong></p>
<h2>Germany Rejects Binance Bid to Obtain Bafin License, Sources Claim</h2>
<p>The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority of Germany (<a href="https://www.bafin.de/EN/Homepage/homepage_node.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bafin</a>) has informed Binance it will not be licensed as a crypto custodian, the German financial news magazine Finance Forward revealed in a <a href="https://financefwd.com/de/binance-lizenz-deutschland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> quoting sources familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The digital asset exchange, the world’s largest by trading volume, can only expand its business in Germany if it receives the regulatory approval, the publication noted. Without it, it’s not allowed to advertise, for example, and German regulators have already targeted other crypto companies for that, including trading platforms like Crypto.com and Uniswap.</p>
<p>Bafin declined to clarify the situation with a spokesperson saying the authority does not comment on individual companies. “While we cannot share details of our discussions with regulators, we are continuing to work to meet Bafin requirements,” a representative of Binance was quoted as stating. The spokesperson emphasized this is an ongoing process and also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are confident that we have the right team and the appropriate measures in place to continue our discussions with the regulators in Germany.</p></blockquote>
<p> has been under increased pressure from regulatory bodies in Europe and elsewhere. Authorities in Belgium <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-ordered-to-cease-all-crypto-services-in-belgium/">ordered</a> the exchange to cease all crypto services while prosecutors in France <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/french-investigation-targets-binance-allegations-of-money-laundering-and-regulatory-violations/">launched</a> an investigation based on money laundering allegations.</p>
<p>Earlier in June, Binance <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-pulls-out-of-netherlands-seeks-to-deregister-cyprus-unit/">exited</a> the Dutch market, after failing to register as a crypto service provider, applied for deregistration in Cyprus, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-unit-in-britain-cancels-uk-regulatory-authorization/">cancelled</a> its U.K. authorization. The company also withdrew its application for license in Austria, Finance Forward noted.</p>
<p>This week, news came out that the exchange is looking for a new banking partner for euro deposits and withdrawals after payment processor Paysafe <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-to-lose-euro-transfers-as-paysafe-drops-support/">announced</a> its decision to discontinue support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEPA</a> transfers to and from the cryptocurrency exchange.</p>

The court filing, submitted on Friday, states that the IRS is seeking details pertaining to accounts that registered an annual trading activity of $20,000 or higher during the years 2016 to 2020.</strong></p>
<h2>IRS Gains Court Order for Kraken&#8217;s Customer Data in Crypto Tax Investigation</h2>
<p>Last February, the IRS submitted a <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66785511/united-states-v-payward-ventures-inc/">court petition</a> to the Northern District of California, outlining its intention to thoroughly investigate Kraken&#8217;s financial records and data in order to uncover cryptocurrency users who may have neglected their tax obligations. The petition specifically requested access to Kraken&#8217;s &#8220;books, records, papers, and other data.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The IRS is conducting an investigation to determine the identity and correct federal income tax liability of U.S. persons who conducted transactions in cryptocurrency for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020,” the petition declared.</p>
<p>According to the IRS, the tax agency sent Kraken’s parent company Payward Ventures Inc. a summons in 2021 in order to get customer info for traders who used the platform during the 2016-2020 period. The government believes that it has a valid reason for requesting the materials listed in the subpoena. The presiding judge Joseph C. Spero ruled that the IRS is authorized “to obtain items of even potential relevance to an ongoing investigation, without reference to its admissibility.”</p>
<p>Consequently, Spero granted the IRS&#8217;s request and authorized an order for Kraken to disclose comprehensive user information, including full names, pseudonyms or user IDs, dates of birth, taxpayer identification numbers, physical addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses. This requirement encompasses all Kraken users who have engaged in transactions involving cryptocurrency assets, regardless of the transaction type, with a combined value equal to or surpassing $20,000 within any of the stated years.</p>
<p>In November 2017, Coinbase <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/court-ruling-grants-the-irs-personal-data-of-14000-coinbase-users/">complied</a> with a federal court order in San Francisco that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-compelled-by-irs-to-provide-13000-customers-information/">compelled</a> the company to disclose customer data to the IRS. The ruling mandated Coinbase to provide the tax agency with identifying details of users who had engaged in transactions exceeding $20,000 between 2013 and 2015. The IRS had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-irs-may-get-approved-to-conduct-coinbase-tax-probe/">set its sights</a> on cryptocurrency tax evaders, and Coinbase became entangled in the pursuit for information. The IRS&#8217;s legal tussle with Coinbase was referenced multiple times in the court case against Kraken.</p>

He stressed that there is nothing more destructive to wealth than inflation, emphasizing that the Fed &#8220;must keep their feet to the floorboard to prevent a re-occurrence of inflationary pressures.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Peter Brandt’s Advice for the Federal Reserve</h2>
<p>Veteran trader Peter Brandt has urged the Federal Reserve to remain hawkish and increase interest rates by another 100 basis points. Brandt has been a futures and FX career trader since 1975. He is a chartist and the author of the Factor Report. He trades a variety of markets, including Dow futures, bonds, corn, crude oil, European wheat, Osaka Dow, U.S. dollar, and sugar.</p>
<p>“The U.S. Fed was negligent for not aggressively raising rates in early 2021,&#8221; he tweeted Thursday. &#8220;Traders knew this, but the Ph.D.s had their heads up their butts.&#8221; He added: &#8220;But now, I congratulate the Fed as it wants to remain hawkish. The market is concerned about unemployment and possible recession. Those are the least of our worries.”</p>
<p>Noting that &#8220;higher unemployment is the least of our worries,&#8221; Brandt opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is NOTHING more destructive to wealth than inflation. The Fed must keep their feet to the floorboard to prevent a re-occurrence of inflationary pressures. While the Fed was asleep at the switch in 2021, increasing rates another 100 basis points would do wonders to protect the nation&#8217;s wealth.</p></blockquote>
<p>In March, Brandt tweeted that people who criticized the Federal Reserve for risking a recession because of rate hikes “know not of what they speak.” He believes that a recession would be beneficial in the long term, claiming that “Only those who have lived with rampant inflation (including U.S. in 1970s) can truly understand the destructive impact on wealth of inflation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emphasizing that “The Fed should be slammed” for not raising interest rates by 300 basis points in early 2022, he stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>The damage to personal wealth because of inflation is far more dangerous than a recession.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-pauses-interest-rates-after-10-consecutive-hikes-committee-likely-to-raise-rates-somewhat-further-this-year/">paused</a> raising interest rates during its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in June after 10 consecutive rate increases. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-chair-powell-signals-more-rate-hikes-this-year-as-taming-inflation-has-long-way-to-go/">more rate hikes</a> this year but at a &#8220;moderate pace.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Fed Chairman Powell on Rate Hikes</h2>
<p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reaffirmed the Fed’s hawkish stance on Wednesday during a central banker panel hosted by the European Central Bank in Sintra, Portugal. With the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting slated for July 25-26, Powell emphasized that the Fed is not done curbing inflation and hinted at the possibility of consecutive interest rate hikes. The Federal Reserve <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-pauses-interest-rates-after-10-consecutive-hikes-committee-likely-to-raise-rates-somewhat-further-this-year/">paused</a> raising interest rates in June after 10 consecutive rate hikes.</p>
<p>“If you look at the data over the last quarter, what you see is stronger than expected growth, a tighter than expected labor market, and higher than expected inflation,” Powell detailed, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>　That tells us that although policy is restrictive, it may not be restrictive enough and it has not been restrictive for long enough.</p></blockquote>
<p>Powell noted that Fed officials have not decided on the timing and magnitude of additional interest rate hikes. Nonetheless, he shared:</p>
<blockquote><p>　I wouldn’t take moving at consecutive meetings off the table at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>During an event held by Spain&#8217;s central bank in Madrid on Thursday, the Fed chair clarified: “We expect the moderate pace of interest rate decisions to continue.”</p>
<p>Last week, Powell said: &#8220;Inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-chair-powell-signals-more-rate-hikes-this-year-as-taming-inflation-has-long-way-to-go/">has a long way to go</a>.&#8221; He further stated that a minimum of two more interest-rate hikes this year are likely necessary to steer inflation towards the Fed&#8217;s 2% target. The Fed chairman also rejected the possibility of a rate cut in the near future, <a class="sc-hWhWUk dZhDeq" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-us-dollar-decline-will-be-far-greater-than-yellen-warns-fed-chair-powell-clearly-worried-about-financial-crisis/">stating</a> that while “it will be appropriate to cut rates at a time when inflation is coming down really significantly, we’re talking about a couple of years out.”</p>

Income derived from long-term investments in digital assets will also be relieved from healthcare taxes, the parliamentarians decided.</strong></p>
<h2>Investors in Slovakia to Pay 7% Tax on Income From Crypto Held More Than a Year</h2>
<p>Members of the National Council of Slovakia, the country’s unicameral legislature, have approved an amendment that will reduce the taxation of cryptocurrencies, local media <a href="https://e.dennikn.sk/minuta/3447018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>. Income from crypto assets sold more than a year after their purchase will be taxed at 7%.</p>
<p>Thus, the tax rate for long-term crypto holdings will be lower than the regular income tax rates. Slovaks pay personal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Slovakia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">income tax</a> according to a progressive scale and the rate can be either 19% or 25%, for income exceeding a certain threshold.</p>
<p>The legislative proposal was submitted by the liberal Freedom and Solidarity party, the Democrats and the conservative Ordinary People and Independent Personalities party and backed by the We Are Family and Voice factions.</p>
<p>According to the updated law, gains from crypto investments will also be exempt from health taxes. Slovakia’s Ministry of Finance has estimated that the financial impact from the amendment will be around €30 million (almost $33 million) a year.</p>
<p>The tax exemptions come after earlier this month Slovak lawmakers sought to protect cash payments amid fears that the digital version of Europe’s common fiat currency, the euro, may eventually become the only means of payment across the eurozone.</p>
<p>The right to pay with cash for goods and services was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/right-to-pay-with-cash-enshrined-in-constitution-of-slovakia-amid-digital-euro-fears/">enshrined</a> in the country’s constitution through an amendment proposed by the right-wing and Euroskeptic We Are Family party. The latest legal changes will also exempt from taxation crypto payments for up to €2,400 ($2,600).</p>

<h2>Fednow System Launch Ignites CBDC Speculation</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The highly anticipated <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/not-related-to-a-digital-currency-us-central-bank-addresses-concerns-over-fednow-payment-network/">Fednow system</a> is set to launch on July 1. Developed by the U.S. Federal Reserve, this payment system aims to provide &#x201C;24x7x365 settlement service&#x201D; and facilitate instantaneous payments. Extensive <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/fednow_faq.htm">information</a> on this subject has been released by the Fed, with significant involvement from the U.S. Treasury. The Federal Reserve&#x2019;s board members have conducted an evaluation and determined that the central bank is &#x201C;well positioned&#x201D; to tackle the nationwide implementation of instant payment infrastructure. It is worth noting that although Fednow offers immediate settlements, it does not adopt the blockchain-based approach.&#13;<br />

The Fednow system utilizes <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/questions/does-fednow-use-blockchain">ISO 20022</a>, a worldwide standard for electronic message exchange between financial institutions established in 2004. ISO 20022 is widely employed by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/swift-is-experimenting-with-decentralized-technologies-to-allow-cbdc-interconnection/">SWIFT</a>, numerous financial organizations, and financial services. Its predecessor was ISO 15022. The ISO 20022 system adopted by the Fednow project functions as a shared financial language, enabling different banks, financial institutions, and systems to comprehend and exchange settlement information. It should be noted that the ISO 20022 system does not maintain a ledger for recording these settlements. Instead, relevant information is recorded and stored in databases or systems specific to the financial institution or organization involved.&#13;<br />

Amidst conjecture and speculation, there are discussions about the potential evolution of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) from the Fednow system. However, in its current state, the infrastructure of Fednow is essentially comparable to the conventional payment rails utilized by existing financial incumbents. Is it possible for a CBDC to supplant it? Certainly, any system, including the Fednow and its underlying infrastructure, could be replaced by a different type of system in the future. At present, the Federal Reserve&#x2019;s Boston and New York branches have set in motion two distinct prototypes for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) &#x2014; <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/atomic-settlement-new-york-fed-completes-first-phase-of-digital-dollar-experiment-called-project-cedar/">Project Cedar</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-bank-of-boston-mit-central-bank-digital-currency-research-open-source-code/">Project Hamilton</a>.&#13;<br />

Although the current implementation of the Fednow system does not utilize blockchain technology, there is speculation regarding the potential integration of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> or a stablecoin in the future. Some enthusiasts have drawn attention to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/crypto/apocalypse-fednow">remarks</a> on a central bank digital currency (CBDC) during his testimony before Congress on June 21. Powell stated, &#x201C;We would not support a central bank digital currency for individuals. If we did have a CBDC, it would be intermediated by banks.&#x201D; Supporters of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/w_thejazz/status/1674505875606896640?s=20">believe</a> that Ripple Labs or <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> itself <a href="https://twitter.com/xrpmickle/status/1674507141468549121?s=20">may be involved</a> in some capacity, while others go as far as to suggest potential long-term impacts on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>&#x2019;s value.&#13;<br />
