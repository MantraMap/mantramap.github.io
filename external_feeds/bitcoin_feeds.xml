The securities regulator explained that it is &#8220;formally investigating whether the debtors and others violated the anti-fraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>SEC Intervenes in Binance-Voyager Asset Purchase Deal</h2>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a &#8220;limited objection&#8221; to the asset purchase agreement between bankrupt crypto firm Voyager Digital and the U.S. arm of crypto exchange Binance on Wednesday. The court filing details:</p>
<blockquote><p>The SEC is formally investigating whether the debtors [Voyager Digital] and others violated the anti-fraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws.</p></blockquote>
<p>The securities regulator explained that Voyager Digital is seeking &#8220;conditional approval of the Disclosure Statement in support of their Chapter 11 plan … and approval of an asset purchase agreement (APA) with BAM Trading Services Inc. d/b/a Binance.US.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the SEC said the Disclosure Statement and the APA fail to include some &#8220;necessary information,&#8221; such as:</p>
<blockquote><p>The ability of Binance US to consummate a transaction of this magnitude, which the debtors value at $1.022 billion … [and] the nature of Binance US&#8217;s business operations after the acquisition.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Disclosure Statement and the APA also fail to include sufficient details regarding &#8220;how the debtors intend to secure customer assets&#8221; during the implementation of the plan and &#8220;the rebalancing of the debtors&#8217; cryptocurrency portfolio,&#8221; the regulator added.</p>
<p>Crypto exchange Binance <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-us-plans-to-acquire-voyager-digitals-assets-for-1-billion-in-bankruptcy-bid/">announced</a> on Dec. 18 that its U.S. entity has entered into an agreement to acquire Voyager&#8217;s assets.</p>

<p>The SEC further noted that its staff has communicated the regulator&#8217;s concerns to the debtors&#8217; counsel and has been advised that a revised Disclosure Statement will be filed.</p>
<p>Regarding the Disclosure Statement motion and the APA motion, the court filing concludes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The SEC requests that the court deny approval of the motions subject to the debtors sufficiently addressing the issues raised above and grant such other and further relief that is just and proper.</p></blockquote>

The company is selling its Candy Digital stake to an investor group associated with billionaire Mike Novogratz and his firm, Galaxy Digital.</strong></p>
<h2>Report Says Sports Retail Giant Fanatics to Sell Majority of Candy Digital Stake</h2>
<p>After a rough 2022 in the non-fungible token (NFT) industry, licensed sports merchandise firm <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/wwe-inks-long-term-deal-with-fanatics-to-push-official-merchandise-trading-cards-and-nfts/">Fanatics</a> has decided to sell 60% of its Candy Digital shares, according to a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/04/fanatics-is-divesting-its-60percent-stake-in-nft-company-candy-digital.html">CNBC report</a> published on Jan. 4, 2023. CNBC obtained an internal email citing Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Divesting our ownership stake at this time allowed us to ensure investors were able to recoup most of their investment via cash or additional shares in Fanatics – a favorable outcome for investors, especially in an imploding NFT market that has seen precipitous drops in both transaction volumes and prices for standalone NFTs,” the email allegedly written by Rubin details.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news of Fanatics dropping 60% of its stake in Candy follows the NFT company reportedly <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-nft-firm-candy-digital-cuts-over-a-third-of-the-companys-staff/">laying off</a> over a third of its staff at the end of Nov. 2022, according to multiple people familiar with the situation. The founder and executive chairman of Fanatics further detailed that the decision to sell its Candy shares was a &#8220;rather straightforward and easy decision for us to make for several reasons.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the past year, it has become clear that NFTs are unlikely to be sustainable or profitable as a standalone business,” Rubin’s email explains. “Aside from physical collectibles (trading cards) driving 99% of the business, we believe digital products will have more value and utility when connected to physical collectibles to create the best experience for collectors.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fanatics operates several e-commerce sites, including nflshop.com and fanatics.com. In Jan. 2022, the firm acquired candy and collectibles company Topps for about $500 million. Like Candy, Topps also provides a number of NFT collections and its own marketplace for digital collectibles for brands such as Major League Baseball (MLB) and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/topps-sells-out-crypto-themed-garbage-pail-kids-non-flushable-token-cards/">Garbage Pail Kids</a>.</span></p>

While serving subpoenas on Twitter is rare, it has happened on various occasions in the past, including when Wikileaks was served on Twitter in 2018.</strong></p>
<h2>Founders of Defunct Crypto Hedge Fund Contacted Electronically on Twitter Due to Difficulties Reaching Them</h2>
<p>Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, the founders of Three Arrows Capital (3AC), have allegedly been hard to contact in regard to the bankruptcy liquidation process. The now-bankrupt cryptocurrency hedge fund <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-embattled-crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-files-for-chapter-15-bankruptcy/">filed</a> for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the first week of July 2022. However, creditors and liquidators involved in the 3AC bankruptcy process have stated that contacting the founders has been difficult, and a judge has allowed liquidators to contact them electronically via email and Twitter.</p>

<p>Davies and Zhu have been using Twitter more frequently in recent times, particularly after the collapse of FTX. They have been <a href="https://twitter.com/zhusu/status/1610093549651136512?s=20&amp;t=dlTV6SKzAgBu58MoUPb5zg">vocal critics</a> of Genesis and Digital Currency Group (DCG) amid controversy surrounding Genesis&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/geminis-cameron-winklevoss-insists-digital-currency-group-needs-to-resolve-liquidity-issues-in-open-letter-to-ceo-barry-silbert/">liquidity problems</a> with Gemini. Davies has also been <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleLDavies/status/1610855510848442371?s=20&amp;t=dlTV6SKzAgBu58MoUPb5zg">discussing</a> the UST depegging and LUNA incident. The Twitter account &#8220;3ACLiquidation&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/3ACLiq/status/1611018579532742657?s=20&amp;t=__MSafzUbR8b1bsCQ8o2pg">served</a> subpoenas <a href="https://twitter.com/3ACLiq/status/1610999697983815686?s=20&amp;t=__MSafzUbR8b1bsCQ8o2pg">to the 3AC founders</a> via Twitter on Jan. 5, 2023.</p>
<p>The 3ACLiquidation Twitter account wrote, &#8220;Kyle Davies, jpg copies of the subpoena are attached to this tweet by way of service. An unredacted copy of the subpoena was served via email and can be provided upon request.&#8221; The founders were mocked on Twitter after people saw the Twitter-issued subpoena.

<p>Davies and Zhu are not the only individuals or organizations that have been served with subpoenas via Twitter. In August 2018, Wikileaks was <a href="https://twitter.com/ProcessServiceC/status/1027960972504457217?s=20&amp;t=dSYFv7Wh1caP2cgrb_t2LQ">served</a> by Cohen Milstein, a litigation firm representing the Democratic National Committee (DNC), on Twitter over allegations of collusion with Russia. In 2016, a Kuwaiti man was <a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2016/10/federal-court-authorizes-service-of-process-via-twitter.htm">served his subpoena</a> via Twitter after a federal court allowed the procedure.</p>
<p>Four weeks ago, Davies <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleLDavies/status/1598964000556953600?s=20&amp;t=yn_JRd2giy8iV18E-wnaKw">claimed</a> liquidators refused “to engage” with the duo “constructively.” 3AC liquidators have gathered tens of millions of dollars in fiat, NFTs, and digital tokens and during the first week of Dec. 2022, the bankruptcy liquidators filed a motion to confiscate a $30 million super yacht reportedly owned by the 3AC founders.</p>

The lawsuit claims that Mashinsky and Celsius defrauded &#8220;hundreds of thousands of investors, including more than 26,000 New Yorkers, out of billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Former CEO of Celsius Accused of Making False Promises, Misleading Investors</h2>
<p>The day after Core Scientific <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/core-scientific-to-shut-down-37000-bitcoin-mining-rigs-belonging-to-bankrupt-crypto-lender-celsius/">detailed</a> that it was shutting down 37,000 bitcoin miners owned by Celsius, New York&#8217;s Attorney General filed a <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/mashinsky_complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> against Alex Mashinsky, the former CEO of Celsius. The lawsuit alleges that Mashinsky &#8220;repeatedly made false and misleading statements about Celsius&#8217;s safety&#8221; and that he encouraged investors to &#8220;deposit billions of dollars in digital assets onto the platform.&#8221; According to the lawsuit, 26,000 New Yorkers are affected by the Celsius demise and James wants to ban Mashinsky from doing business in New York.</p>
<p>The lawsuit states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mashinsky promoted Celsius as a safe alternative to banks while concealing that Celsius was actually engaged in risky investment strategies.</p></blockquote>
<p>The state of New York and attorney general Letitia James have been cracking down on crypto businesses for some time. In June, James <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ny-attorney-general-warns-about-investing-in-crypto-market-says-its-extremely-unpredictable-unstable/">warned</a> about the crypto industry&#8217;s volatility. At the end of Nov. 2022, James also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ny-attorney-general-urges-congress-to-ban-crypto-in-retirement-accounts/">urged</a> Congress to ban crypto assets from U.S. retirement accounts. In addition, the New York attorney general targeted the crypto lender Nexo in a <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2022.09.26_nexo_complaint_final.pdf">lawsuit</a> announced at the end of Sept. 2022.</p>
<p>“As the former CEO of Celsius, Alex Mashinsky promised to lead investors to financial freedom but led them down a path of financial ruin,” <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-sues-former-ceo-celsius-cryptocurrency-platform-defrauding">said</a> attorney general James. “The law is clear that making false and unsubstantiated promises and misleading investors is illegal. Today, we are taking action on behalf of thousands of New Yorkers who were defrauded by Mr. Mashinsky to recoup their losses. My office will stay vigilant and ensure that bad actors trying to take advantage of New York investors are held accountable.”</p>

<p>The New York-based lawsuit against Mashinsky and his Celsius dealings follows the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-bankruptcy-court-rules-celsius-deposits-belong-to-the-firm/">bankruptcy ruling</a> this week that ruled the deposits in high-interest-earning accounts belong to Celsius. Judge Martin Glenn, of a New York-based bankruptcy court, said Celsius owns the rights to the funds rather than the customers who deposited the digital assets on the now-defunct lending platform.</p>

The transfers were discovered by Conor Grogan, a director at Coinbase, and while most of the transactions took place on Dec. 28, there was some recent activity in the first few days of the new year.</strong></p>
<h2>Onchain Discoveries Uncover Suspected Unreported Transactions Associated With SBF, FTX, and Alameda</h2>
<p>Roughly a week ago on Dec. 28, 2022, onchain investigators <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/onchain-sleuths-discover-funds-linked-to-alameda-swapped-for-eth-usdt-btc-by-a-mysterious-entity/">discovered</a> that a number of funds linked to FTX and Alameda Research wallets moved while Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of FTX, was on house arrest. Two days after the funds moved, Bankman-Fried <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1608908562851598336?s=20&t=6UXGAcU1CGUrqqQZmTA11A">tweeted</a>: &#x201C;None of these are me. I&#x2019;m not and couldn&#x2019;t be moving any of those funds; I don&#x2019;t have access to them anymore.&#x201D; He was immediately bombarded with questions when he tweeted on Dec. 30. &#x201C;How is an address that you identified as yours moving funds then?&#x201D; <a href="https://twitter.com/cobie/status/1608912791498526721">asked</a> Cobie, a crypto proponent and host of Uponly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I believe it is likely the case that various legit legs of FTX have the ability to access these funds; hopefully that&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s happening here,&#x201D; SBF <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1608937536487059458?s=20&t=6UXGAcU1CGUrqqQZmTA11A">added</a>. &#x201C;If not, hopefully one steps in soon to do so. I would be happy to help advise regulators on this if any wanted.&#x201D;</p>
<p>A week after the onchain sleuths discovered the movement of FTX and Alameda-linked addresses, Conor Grogan, a director at Coinbase who frequently tweets about onchain activity, uncovered a large number of SBF-linked tokens that were moved across various blockchains. The movements took place on blockchains such as Polygon, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arbitrum, and Avalanche. The addresses saw outbound movements for coins such as MATIC, AVAX, USDC, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>, BTCB, WBTC, SPELL, PTP, MDX, and more.</p>
<p>&#x201C;SBF (or someone with access to his wallets) most likely transferred $10s of millions in previously unreported transactions across Avalanche, BSC, Arbitrum, and Polygon blockchains,&#x201D; Grogan <a href="https://twitter.com/jconorgrogan/status/1610686338847870976?s=20&t=hYRQnORibJ3wy_4Ou3U9vg">tweeted</a>. &#x201C;There was also recent activity on 1/02 and 1/03 [and] I found a receiving wallet with $30+ million. I went through each address linked to SBF and checked other blockchains. Private keys for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> work across other EVM chains,&#x201D; Grogan added.</p>

<p>In addition to Grogan&#x2019;s tweets, the onchain researcher Ergo <a href="https://twitter.com/ErgoBTC/status/1610709904674770944?s=20&t=6UXGAcU1CGUrqqQZmTA11A">tweeted</a> about some FTX-linked bitcoin movements on Jan. 4, 2023. &#x201C;Likely bankruptcy team activity,&#x201D; Ergo said. &#x201C;<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> tx resets WBTC deposit address, different from the FTX/FTXUS sweep &#x2026; Segregating FTX and Alameda assets? Address holds 502 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> sourced from Deribit withdrawals.&#x201D; At the time of writing, after the initial 502 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, the address now has a balance of approximately 3,499 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, following Ergo&#x2019;s tweet, the researcher also shared a tweet that showed funds were <a href="https://twitter.com/LaurentMT/status/1610702815781072898?s=20&t=6UXGAcU1CGUrqqQZmTA11A">sent</a> to a Wasabi wallet. &#x201C;Bankruptcy team still not disclosing their addresses,&#x201D; Ergo <a href="https://twitter.com/ErgoBTC/status/1610711621717966853?s=20&t=6UXGAcU1CGUrqqQZmTA11A">said</a>. &#x201C;But more onchain evidence that the instant swapper addresses are not behaving the same as the &#x2018;legit legs of FTX.'&#x201D;</p>

The coin climbed for a second straight session on Thursday, which comes ahead of Friday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls numbers. Shiba inu was also in the green, after today’s gains.</strong></p>
<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) rose for a second straight session on Thursday, as the meme coin moved away from a recent spell of consolidation.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.07181 on Wednesday, DOGE/USD climbed to an intraday peak of $0.07503 earlier today.</p>
<p>The move took the token to its highest point since December 27, when price was in the midst of a prolonged sell-off.</p>

<p>Since then dogecoin bulls seemed to have returned to action, which coincides with traders finally returning from recent Christmas and New Year’s celebrations.</p>
<p>As can be seen from the chart, the rise in price also comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has marginally broken out of a key resistance zone.</p>
<p>The index is currently tracking at 42.81, which is slightly above a ceiling of 42.00</p>

<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h2>
<p>Another notable gainer on Thursday was fellow meme coin shiba inu (SHIB), which also rose for a back-to-back session.</p>
<p>SHIB/USD surged to a peak of $0.000008531 earlier today, after falling to a bottom at $0.000008171 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Thursday’s spike in price sent shiba inu to its strongest point since December 18, prior to the holiday season consolidation.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, today’s move also saw SHIB break out of a recent point of resistance at $0.00000850, with the RSI also following suit.</p>
<p>Price strength surged past its own ceiling at the 50.00 level, and is currently tracking at 51.63.</p>
<p>Despite this sign of bullish sentiment, the next visible ceiling is close, at 53.00, which could lead to earlier bulls opting to secure gains, and close positions.</p>

The hack prevents the medical institution from reporting to the country&#x2019;s health insurance fund in order to receive due funding. </strong></p>
<h2>Boto&#x15F;ani Hospital Blackmailed for Bitcoin, Romanian Media Reports</h2>
<p>The Saint Gheorghe Recovery Hospital in Boto&#x15F;ani, Northeastern Romania, has become the target of hackers who locked its medical records from December and demanded to be paid in cryptocurrency to restore access to the files.</p>
<p>After compromising the servers they encrypted the data and left a message in English, asking for a ransom of 3 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> (over $50,000 at current exchange rates), the local news outlet Monitorul de Boto&#x15F;ani <a href="https://www.monitorulbt.ro/prima-pagina/2023/01/03/spital-luat-ostatic-de-hackeri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> on Tuesday, quoted by the English-language portal Romania Insider.</p>
<p>The attack has been well-prepared, the publication noted. Neither the computer specialists from the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism nor experts working for the Romanian cybersecurity firm Bitdefender were able to decrypt the information.</p>

<p>Dr. C&#x103;t&#x103;lin Dasc&#x103;lescu, the hospital&#x2019;s managing director, told journalists that law enforcement authorities have launched an investigation. &#x201C;We hope to resume medical activity at normal capacity from Monday,&#x201D; he added, without revealing further details.</p>
<p>With its database hijacked, the hospital cannot file its reports for the services performed in the last month of 2022 and receive the respective payments.</p>
<p>However, officials at Romania&#x2019;s National Health Insurance House said they are working on a solution that will allow the medical staff to receive their salaries.</p>
<p>Investigators believe that the hackers have accessed the data remotely through the systems of a company responsible for maintaining the computing equipment.</p>
<p>This isn&#x2019;t the first hacking incident of this kind in Romania in recent years. In the summer of 2019, four other hospitals were targeted in a similar fashion. Hospitals and healthcare providers in the U.S. also became victims of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-accused-of-laundering-cryptocurrency-from-ransomware-attacks-extradited-to-us/">ransomware attacks</a> in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

In December&#x2019;s meeting, the U.S Federal Reserve agreed to maintain hiking rates, with inflation still near historic highs. Ethereum also remained close to recent highs on Thursday.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) mostly consolidated on Thursday, as price failed to break out of the key level of $17,000 yesterday.</p>
<p>Following a high of $16,964.59 on hump day, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD slipped to an intraday low of $16,789.75 earlier in the session.</p>
<p>The drop comes as markets reacted to the latest FOMC minutes, where the Fed have seemingly agreed to maintain interest rate hikes.</p>

<p>This comes as the bank expects a more aggressive rise in inflation, forecasting consumer prices to be at 3.5% in 2023, higher than the 3.1% previously expected.</p>
<p>Looking at the chart, the decline in price also comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved below a resistance zone of 51.00.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is now tracking at 49.14, and seems to be moving towards a support level of 46.00.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also consolidated in today&#x2019;s session, with momentum marginally shifting on Thursday.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD dropped to a bottom of $1,246.21 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after hitting a high of $1,264.81.</p>
<p>Despite the drop, sentiment remains somewhat bullish, as <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> continues to trade above its long-term resistance level at $1,230.</p>

<p>From the chart, the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages also remain close in proximity, maintaining chances of an upwards crossover.</p>
<p>This seems to be one of the factors in place that is keeping bullish sentiment alive. However, with the RSI now falling lower, this could begin to change.</p>
<p>Since failing to break out of a ceiling at the 57.00 level, price strength is now tracking at 55.40.</p>

<p>SSC Napoli, the current leaders in the Italian professional soccer league, Serie A, and Dunamu Inc. announced a partnership that will make the Korean fintech firm the official back-of-shirt and crypto-exchange partner of the soccer team for the current and the next season.</p>
<p>The deal, which covers all of Napoli’s Serie A, Coppa Italia and friendly matches, will place the logo of Dunamu’s crypto exchange, Upbit, below the number on the back of their jerseys. The company’s logo will also appear on billboards around Stadio Diego Armando Maradona in Naples.</p>
<p>“This will come into play for the team’s next Serie A fixture on Wednesday, Jan. 4, against Inter,” Napoli unveiled in a press release on the first day of the week. The club emphasized the importance of the agreement with Dunamu in light of Napoli’s intention to expand its fan base in South Korea.</p>

<p>At the heart of the Napoli lineup is Kim Min-jae, the Korea Joongang Daily noted in a report. The Korean center-back, who signed for Napoli in late July, made his debut in August and was named Lega Serie A Player of the Month for September.</p>
<p>Kim scored two goals in his first few weeks with Napoli, which made him the second-highest scoring Korean to ever play in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lega_Serie_A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Serie A</a>. His team currently tops the league’s table and has remained undefeated at home throughout the 2022-23 season.</p>

<p>“We’re thrilled to have reached this agreement with the South Korean company Dunamu, a leader in its sector,” said Tommaso Bianchini, chief international development officer of Napoli. “We’d like to warmly welcome Upbit to our family and we look forward to working together and enlarging our presence in South Korea,” he added.</p>
<p>“Dunamu is excited about our new partnership with SSC Napoli, one of the biggest and most prestigious football clubs in the world. We’re thankful for the warmest welcome and are thrilled to be a part of the journey together with SSC Napoli, including star defender Kim Min-jae,” Dunamu CEO Sirgoo Lee was quoted as stating.</p>
<p>Napoli is not the only leading Italian football club with a crypto sponsor. In August, 2021, soccer giant AC Milan <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/soccer-giant-ac-milan-seals-sponsorship-deal-with-crypto-exchange-bitmex/">sealed a deal</a> with Bitmex to make the crypto exchange its ‘official sleeve and crypto trading partner’ under a multi-year sponsorship agreement. In September of that year, crypto derivatives exchange Bitget <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cryptocurrency-derivatives-exchange-bitget-to-sponsor-juventus-as-its-first-ever-sleeve-partner/">announced</a> a partnership with Juventus and Inter <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/italian-soccer-champion-inter-secures-100-million-crypto-partnership-deal/">secured</a> a $100 million sponsorship with blockchain company Zytara Labs.</p>

Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, as well as the supply bottlenecks resulting from the war, are said to be among the factors that helped to drive up prices. </strong></p>
<h2>Impact of the Ukraine-Russia War</h2>
<p>In 2022, Germany&#8217;s average inflation rate topped 7.9%, its highest since the 1990 reunification, the country’s statistical office has said. As per the German press agency&#8217;s Jan. 3 report, the 2022 rate is more than double the 3.1% seen in 2021.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://news-72f9bc9.dpa-prototype.de/en/230103/urn:newsml:dpa.com:20090101:230103-99-92577/?utm_campaign=n">report</a>, rising energy and food prices were among the main drivers of inflation for several months. As expected, the German Federal Statistical Office (FSO) reportedly identified Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as the ensuing supply bottlenecks, as two key factors that led to the record inflation rate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Consumers in Germany had to pay 24.4% more for energy in December than a year earlier. Food prices rose by 20.7% within a year,&#8221; the agency’s report explained.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Germany&#8217;s Monthly Inflation Slowing Down</h2>
<p>Despite recording what has been described as the country’s worst overall inflation rate since the 7.6% seen in 1951, the FSO data suggest that the monthly rate had dropped to 8.6% in December 2022. Before that, the rate had averaged 10.4% and 10%, in October and November, respectively.</p>
<p>To minimize the impact of rising prices on the population, the German government is reportedly planning to pour out &#8220;billions in aid.&#8221; It also aims to achieve this by using &#8220;price brakes for electricity and gas.&#8221; According to the report, some economists are optimistic that such steps will help tame inflation in 2023.</p>
