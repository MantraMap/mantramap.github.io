Taking a step back will often reveal things you didn't notice before. Remember, you can also miss things by looking too closely.</p><p>On that note, as I zoomed out from the hourly charts to look at the market from the beginning of the year, I could see just how strong of a start Bitcoin is having in 2023 â€” things look even better than I was expecting.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">3 Positive Months...</h3><p>This will be Bitcoin's best quarter in 2 years if it maintains its growth through April!</p><p>Bitcoin has grown every month of 2023 so far.&nbsp; Exactly 3 months ago, BTC was trading at $16,585 - so we're up approximately $12,000... in just 90 days!</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Have We Been Here Before?</h3><p>Some analysts are saying they've seen these charts before - in the run-up to 2020's bull run that brought Bitcoin's price to over $60,000+.</p><p>Take a look at this tweet from analytics platform Barcharts:&nbsp;</p><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #666666;"><i>"Bitcoin $BTC is on the verge of having its 3rd consecutive green month.&nbsp; Last time that happened?&nbsp; October 2020 - March 2021 when the price went parabolic from 10.4k to 61.7k"</i></span></div><p></p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEik0ZCef_-IjcV4Y7NjE68y1PgTNn93iRsXD5B0MiWAw-gA4DhGXArrULH0n9qa5BCMJ2AUTUSZd1i0ubbpNPWvMzqiXsRv_MErxUlTRoPD-aAGSmLdzNbmSJvdb6wKe7NOx0a4K-jLyxTXpPyRmXXhHW9DXQtB5Thq_oO2y68b-tS6yF0R-L56yiMa9w/s588/screenshot-bitcoin-barcharttweet.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img border="0" data-original-height="543" data-original-width="588" height="395" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEik0ZCef_-IjcV4Y7NjE68y1PgTNn93iRsXD5B0MiWAw-gA4DhGXArrULH0n9qa5BCMJ2AUTUSZd1i0ubbpNPWvMzqiXsRv_MErxUlTRoPD-aAGSmLdzNbmSJvdb6wKe7NOx0a4K-jLyxTXpPyRmXXhHW9DXQtB5Thq_oO2y68b-tS6yF0R-L56yiMa9w/w426-h395/screenshot-bitcoin-barcharttweet.jpg" width="426" /></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><br /></i></td></tr></tbody></table>The banking crisis, inflation, and investors looking for alternative stores of value is considered the main driving factor behind the recent price increase - there's no end to these issues in sight, and many think things could potentially get worse before the situation improves.&nbsp;<p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Why The Next Bull Run Will Be BIGGER Than the Last...</h3><p>I'm not someone who makes predictions, I'll share interesting ones made by others if there's data to explain how they arrived at their opinion - but don't ask me when Bitcoin's next big bull run will be.&nbsp;</p><p>But when does happen - it's going to break price records.</p><p>That's not a prediction - first off, it's tradition - as every crypto-crash has been followed by setting a new high.<br /><br />However, this time something is very different than before, and there's really only one way this plays out - buyers will be in a bidding war over an INSANELY low supply of Bitcoin being sold.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">The supply of Bitcoin being held off-market is at an all-time high...</h3><p>This has been the case since early February, and we&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globalcryptopress.com/2023/02/amount-of-saved-bitcoins-btc-that-has.html">covered this</a> then. Basically, to qualify as a coin that's being held 'off market' it must have have remained in a single wallet, untouched, for 2+ years or more.</p><p>We're seeing that Bitcoin believers took advantage of the low prices and spent the bear market accumulating. Now the owners of these Bitcoins are HODLing, and won't be selling anytime soon.<br /><br />I know countless people in this group, it includes most of the people reading this, and the person writing it as well. I know that each person has a number in mind as their target selling price, and while it varies for everyone, I'm not hearing anyone say they've been holding for years just to sell for $30k, or $40k.&nbsp; I occasionally hear $50k, I occasionally even hear $1 Million, but the majority of people seem to be eyeing somewhere around $60k-$100k.<br /><br />So as the next bull run brings waves of amateur investors wanting a piece of the action, (it always does) they're going to discover very few people selling to them for anything under $50k, as this record number of people continue holding back a significant portion of the supply.<br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Once it begins, expect prices to rise at a speed we've never seen before...</h3>This low supply of Bitcoin being sold is something most people seem unaware of, or at least not paying attention to yet. But I believe this will be the defining factor of the next bull run, the thing people will mention when talking about it years later.<br /><span><br /><span style="color: #252525;">One final thing to consider - The low supply will cause the price to rise fast, but the faster it rises the more news it makes, and the more people it attracts looking to buy as quickly as possible.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #252525;">Things could get real interesting, real quick. You don't need to know exactly when it will come to make sure you're positioned to take advantage of things once it begins - position yourself wisely.</span><br /><br /><i><span style="color: #666666;">[ Trading Tip: If you don't want to risk buying now because you are concerned it could go lower before it goes higher, remember, you can place bids to catch it on the way up.&nbsp; For example, Bitcoin is at $28,430 at the time of publishing, so setting buys at around $32,000 would let you get on the rocket ship before it really takes off. ]</span></i><br /><br /></span>-----------<br /><i><b>Author:&nbsp;</b>Ross Davis<br /></i><i><span style="color: #660000;">Silicon Valley Newsroom<br /></span></i><i><b><span style="color: #3d85c6;">GCP&nbsp;<span style="color: black;">|&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.globalcryptopress.com/"><span style="color: #3d85c6;">Breaking Crypto News</span></a></span></b></i><br /><br /><p></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"><img src="//feedburner.google.com/fb/images/pub/feed-icon32x32.png" alt="" style="border:0"/></a><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">Subscribe to GCP in a reader</a></div>
