<p>Istanbul, Turkey, June 26th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Metatime, the blockchain project building a complete Web3 ecosystem that promises users full control over their finances, identity and assets, has announced its native ecosystem token Metatime Coin ($MTC) will be listed for sale on the leading cryptocurrency exchange, Bybit. Alongside the listing, Metatime is pleased to announce that its smart contract infrastructure code has been fully audited by the independent auditing firm Hacken, completing the process with full marks. </p><p>The $MTC token, which currently has exactly 415,439 registered users, will go live on Bybit on Monday, June 26 at 10.00 UTC, at which time it will be available for anyone to buy, sell or trade. Investors who bought early during the presale will now be able to sell their $MTC, while those who missed out on early access will now be able to participate in Metatime&rsquo;s growing Web3 ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year, Metatime witnessed enormous demand for its token, raising a total of $38 million via two pre-sales of the $MTC token on the world&rsquo;s biggest crypto launchpad platforms, helping to fund its goal of onboarding millions of new users to Web3. All told, Metatime sold 100 million $MTC at 5 cents, 100 million $MTC at 6 cents, 100 million $MTC at 7 cents and then 200 million $MTC at 10 cents.&nbsp;</p><p>The $MTC token is currently deployed on BNB Chain but will migrate to Metatime&rsquo;s own blockchain with the launch of the MetaChain mainnet on Nov. 11, 2023. For all $MTC investors, relevant information and technical assistance is available through Metatime&rsquo;s support team.&nbsp;</p><p>The official listing of $MTC on Bybit follows the completion of a full audit of Metatime&rsquo;s smart contract code by the respected independent auditor and testing firm Hacken. The report by Hacken highlighted the &ldquo;exceptional performance of Metatime&rsquo;s documentation, code quality, test coverage and security measures&rdquo;. Metatime achieved a perfect score of 10/10 in the documentation quality category, providing comprehensive functional requirements and detailed technical descriptions. It also achieved a perfect code quality score and, furthermore, demonstrated exceptional test coverage during thorough testing of deployment, basic user interaction and system features.&nbsp;</p><p>Metatime&rsquo;s Web3 ecosystem of products include a comprehensive blockchain network and cryptocurrency exchange, plus NFT marketplace, crypto launchpad, blockchain explorer, wallet and stablecoin. The MetaChain is powered by the Proof-of-Meta consensus mechanism which enables all users to participate in network verification and $MTC mining.
