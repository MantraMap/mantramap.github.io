Arkham said intel seeks can post bounties for wanted info and sleuths can offer up data through auctions or fixed prices. The project’s token ARKM will also have a token sale on Binance launchpad scheduled for July 18. Blockchain intelligence provider Arkham announced a new offering to allow users anonymously buy and sell data about wallet addresses. [&#8230;]
