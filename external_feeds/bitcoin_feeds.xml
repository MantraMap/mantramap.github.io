Ripple case regarding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>. &#x201C;The current mission of the SEC is not to protect small investors,&#x201D; the billionaire asserted. &#x201C;Their goal is to litigate. And litigate more. And litigate more.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>Mark Cuban Weighs in on SEC v. Ripple Case</h2>
<p>Shark Tank star and the owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, has shared his thoughts on Twitter concerning the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) v. Ripple case regarding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>.</p>
<p>Commenting on the SEC&#x2019;s filing in the lawsuit against Terraform Labs and co-founder Do Kwon, where the regulator alleged that the Ripple ruling was &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-says-xrp-ruling-in-ripple-case-wrongly-decided-signals-appeal/">wrongly decided</a>,&#x201D; Cuban criticized the securities watchdog for referring to &#x201C;every buyer as an investor in their filing.&#x201D; The billionaire argued:</p>
<blockquote><p>That&#x2019;s not the case and Ripple made that clear. Securities have one purpose, to be a security. For a defi or CEX buyer, it&#x2019;s impossible to know why a buyer buys. But it is possible to look at the Blockchain and see there are transactions based on the utility of the token.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Shark Tank star warned on July 14, one day after <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ripples-chief-legal-officer-breaks-down-ruling-in-sec-lawsuit-says-as-a-matter-of-law-xrp-is-not-a-security/">the Ripple ruling</a>, that &#x201C;The SEC can still go after exchanges for selling tokens because they feel they regulate the exchanges.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He described: &#x201C;Of course, there is a lot of grey in this ruling, but the SEC could have gone the route of Japan and set rules to protect investors. Instead, they choose to always litigate to regulate. Think about that approach from the perspective of a small investor or a small entrepreneur looking to start a crypto company. The SEC expects both to hire securities attorneys to provide guidance. (I know. We called them to ask them what to do for a company I&#x2019;m involved with).&#x201D;</p>

<p>Cuban opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>The only reasonable conclusion, is that the current mission of the SEC is not to protect small investors. It never has been. (See the billions of shares trading in bankrupt companies &#x2026; and in crazy pink sheet and OTC companies). Their goal is to litigate. And litigate more. And litigate more.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;All this could go away if Congress or the SEC set brightline rules,&#x201D; the Dallas Mavericks owner concluded.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Cuban said the SEC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mark-cuban-says-sec-makes-mistakes-in-crypto-regulation-calls-regulator-arrogant/">chose the wrong path</a> to regulate crypto, stating that the regulator was &#x201C;arrogant in thinking that its framework covered every possible situation.&#x201D; In June, he offered <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/billionaire-mark-cuban-offers-suggestions-on-how-sec-should-regulate-crypto/">suggestions</a> on how the SEC could regulate the crypto industry.</p>
<p>Following the Ripple ruling, several U.S. lawmakers called on Congress to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmakers-call-on-sec-to-stop-regulatory-assault-on-crypto-following-xrp-ruling/">pass legislation</a> to regulate crypto. The SEC has indicated that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-says-xrp-ruling-in-ripple-case-wrongly-decided-signals-appeal/">it will appeal</a> the Ripple ruling. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said last week that the securities regulator is &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-disappointed-with-xrp-ruling-on-retail-investors-chair-gensler-hints-at-more-crypto-industry-enforcement/">disappointed</a>&#x201D; in the court ruling on retail investors but will continue to bring crypto firms into compliance. The SEC has also asked Congress for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-asks-for-increased-funding-to-tackle-crypto-market-risks-and-wrongdoing/">more funding</a> in order to tackle crypto risks and wrongdoing.</p>

<h2>Lawyer Discusses SEC Appeal of Ripple Ruling</h2>
<p>Following the recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ripples-chief-legal-officer-breaks-down-ruling-in-sec-lawsuit-says-as-a-matter-of-law-xrp-is-not-a-security/">ruling</a> in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) v. Ripple case concerning <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, speculations arise that the securities regulator might appeal the decision made by District Judge Analisa Torres.</p>
<p>John E. Deaton, a well-known lawyer in the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> community, has provided his analysis and insights regarding the potential outcomes of the SEC&#x2019;s appeal. An &#x201C;appeal is not even close to be a setback&#x201D; for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, he tweeted on Saturday, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>It will be two years from now before a decision is issued by the 2nd Circuit, if it&#x2019;s appealed. The Torres Decision is the law until then.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;Even if the 2nd Circuit said Torres was wrong regarding her application of the 3rd Howey factor (which I predict they won&#x2019;t), that doesn&#x2019;t meant the SEC wins on <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-judge-rules-xrp-not-necessarily-a-security-on-its-face-sending-xrp-supporters-into-celebration/">programmatic sales</a> (sales on exchanges),&#x201D; Deaton emphasized.</p>
<p>&#x201C;All that happens is that Torres then applies the other two factors and could likely still rule the same exact way, concluding the SEC didn&#x2019;t satisfy the common enterprise factor &#x2013; which is a more difficult factor to meet IMO than the third factor,&#x201D; he stressed.</p>
<p>In a follow-up tweet, the lawyer clarified: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not suggesting that Judge Torres decision is binding within the SDNY [Southern District of New York]. A fellow district judge could disagree with her. But I think a fellow judge in the 2nd Circuit is going to be hard pressed to disagree with Judge Torres, especially considering she cited Judge Castel from Telegram.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Deaton previously explained: &#x201C;There isn&#x2019;t an immediate right to an appeal. Either side can ask Judge Torres to allow it and then ask the 2nd Circuit to accept.&#x201D; He added:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#x2019;t see Judge Torres approving it because the SEC sought summary judgment pursuant to Howey and the judge did a strict application of the Howey factors to each type of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> sale alleged by the SEC to satisfy Howey.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;The court agreed that the Howey test was controlling and applied it accordingly,&#x201D; he continued. &#x201C;In essence, the judge applied a non-controversial 76-year-old well-settled supreme court test to the facts of the case. It&#x2019;s a straightforward application of that well-settled test, despite any challenges related to her reasoning or any policy considerations.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The SEC has indicated that it is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-says-xrp-ruling-in-ripple-case-wrongly-decided-signals-appeal/">considering filing an appeal</a> in response to the Ripple ruling. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said last week that the securities regulator is &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-disappointed-with-xrp-ruling-on-retail-investors-chair-gensler-hints-at-more-crypto-industry-enforcement/">disappointed</a>&#x201D; in the ruling regarding retail investors. The agency recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-asks-for-increased-funding-to-tackle-crypto-market-risks-and-wrongdoing/">asked Congress for more funding</a> to address crypto market risks. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve seen the Wild West of the crypto markets, rife with noncompliance, where investors have put hard-earned assets at risk in a highly speculative asset class,&#x201D; Gensler told lawmakers.</p>

<h2>Former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke and Polled Economists Echo Anticipation of Final Federal Rate Hike</h2>
<p>This Wednesday, all eyes are on the U.S. central bank as it stands on the threshold of a potential 25bps boost to the pivotal bank rate, pushing it to hover within the 5.25%-5.50% spectrum. The market has preemptively accepted the likelihood of this quarter-point advancement.</p>
<p>To illustrate, data from CME Group’s Fedwatch tool as of Saturday, July 22, 2023, signals a near-certain 99.2% probability of this 25bps escalation. On the other end of the spectrum, the same Fedwatch tool from CME conveys a relatively minuscule 0.8% chance for the rate to remain static.</p>
<p>Moreover, a survey published by Reuters on July 19, a majority of 106 economists suggest it will be the last federal funds rate increase for the tightening cycle. The poll’s participants surveyed between July 13-18 show that the perception that rates will remain high for a longer period of time has increased.</p>
<p>Jan Nevruzi, the U.S. rates strategist at Natwest Markets said that “despite the soft CPI print, we still anticipate a hike in July &#8230; (and) while we hope the softness in inflation persists, it is unwise from a policymaking standpoint to bank on that.” The Natwest strategist added:</p>
<blockquote><p>We do not want to rush ahead and say the fight against inflation has been won, as we have seen head-fakes in the past.</p></blockquote>
<p>Former Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke shares a similar view with the economists polled by Reuters. At a webinar event held by Fidelity Investments, Bernanke suggested that the 25bps rise in July could very well be the final hike. “It looks very clear that the Fed will raise another 25 basis points at its next meeting,” Bernanke said on Thursday. “It’s possible this increase in July might be the last one.”</p>

<p>The former central bank chair believes inflation will continue to drop and told investors he expects the inflation rate to range between 3% to 3.5%. While Bernanke acknowledged that the United States could see a slowdown in economic growth, he doesn&#8217;t envision a massive recession in the future.</p>
<p>“What we’ll see is a very modest increase in unemployment and a slowing of the economy,” Bernanke explained during the webinar. “But I’d be very surprised to see a deep recession in the next year.” While the Fed’s “dot-plot” shows the federal funds rate could reach 5.50%-5.75%, Reuters&#8217; poll shows that only 19 economists out of the 106 surveyed suspect it will get that high.</p>

<h2>Meme Cryptocurrencies Gain $759M in a Month, Led by Dogecoin</h2>
<p>As of Sunday, July 23, 2023, the meme coin economy is valued at $16.29 billion, up from $15.54 billion a month earlier on June 22. This indicates a gain of more than $759 million, or 4.82%, against the U.S. dollar in the top meme coin economy.</p>
<p>Over the past 30 days, dogecoin has increased by more than 10% and has risen 1.3% against the U.S. dollar this past week. With a market valuation of $10.12 billion, Dogecoin represents 62.12% of the total value of the meme coin economy.</p>

<p>SHIB has increased 1% against the U.S. dollar over the past month, though seven-day statistics show a loss of 2.7% this past week. With a market valuation of $4.61 billion, SHIB accounts for 28.29% of the net value of the meme coin economy. Combined with Dogecoin, these two coins dominate 90.41% of the meme coin economy.</p>

<p>Pepe (PEPE), the third largest meme coin asset, rose 1.6% over the past month. However, in the past week, PEPE&#8217;s value has decreased by 7.6%. With a market valuation of $628 million, PEPE represents 3.85% of the net value of the meme coin economy.</p>
<p>In the past 24 hours, the meme coin economy has seen $528 million in global trade volume. The top three performers on Sunday were kabosu inu (KABOSU), 3d3d (3D3D), and pepemon pepeballs (PPBLZ), which gained between 9.9% and 210% respectively.</p>
<p>The three largest decliners against the U.S. dollar in the meme coin assets were shibaken finance (SHIBAKEN), cheems inu (CINU), and dingocoin (DINGO), losing between 7% and 22% over the past day. Regarding 24-hour volume, DOGE leads, followed by SHIB and PEPE, while FLOKI takes the fourth position this weekend.</p>

Statistics indicate that miners have accrued roughly 1,847.66 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> in fees, worth about $55.29 million, confirming the millions of Ordinal inscriptions.</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin&#x2019;s Ordinal Inscriptions Near 19 Million</h2>
<p dir="ltr">As of July 22, 2023, at block height 799,830, approximately <a href="https://ordinals.com/inscription/0a5f730e98a480664803a1c1ea8ed4ee6f1510e854e6554794961f25e471eabfi0">18,599,837</a> Ordinal inscriptions have been issued on the bitcoin blockchain. The trend has continued to rise since the first inscription 218 days ago. <a href="https://archive.ph/YBS8w">Archived statistics</a> from Dune Analytics indicate that 78.5% of all the inscriptions minted on Bitcoin are in plain text form or character sets, while another 13.5% is plain text, bringing the total of plain text and character set inscriptions to 92%. The remainder of the inscriptions consist of images, GIF files, animations, applications, and more.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The largest number of daily <a href="https://dune.com/queries/2008613/3324931">Ordinal inscriptions</a> occurred on May 7, 2023, with 400,091 inscriptions. July 9 saw 385,920, July 16 recorded 385,604 and July 18 saw 323,964 inscriptions. In addition to daily ordinal inscriptions, the number of <a href="https://dune.com/queries/2145510/3518071">inscriptions per block</a> has significantly increased in July. A few blocks, including block height 797,976 and block height 798,795, confirmed more than 5,000 inscriptions. While <a href="https://dune.com/queries/2123547/3489157">fees from Ordinals</a> experienced their largest increase on May 7 and 8, they have stagnated since then.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Data indicates that people are paying less to confirm approximately the same number of inscriptions as they did in May, despite the continuing drive to inscribe. The higher fees, however, are absent. At block height 799,832 on July 22, there are more than <a href="https://archive.ph/gGHe9">300,000 unconfirmed transactions</a> on the bitcoin blockchain. While a low-priority transaction will cost 71 cents, a high-priority transaction will cost the sender around $1.88 or 0.000063 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. Both financial transactions and Ordinal inscriptions together contribute to the backlog of transactions.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/">Metrics</a> recorded by cryptoslam.io show that in the past 30 days, $98.85 million in nonfungible token (NFT) sales were recorded. Over the past month, the bitcoin blockchain has the second highest number of sales among 22 different blockchain networks, but sales are more than 13% lower than the previous month. Only two bitcoin-based NFT collections are among the top 10 in terms of 30-day sales. The bitcoin collection, known as <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/uncategorized-ordinals">Uncategorized Ordinals</a>, was the second largest in terms of the past month&#x2019;s sales, with $41 million.</p>

<h2>Long-dormant Bitcoin Address Springs to Life, Moving $30 Million Hoard</h2>
<p>July has seen eight so-called &#x2018;sleeping&#x2019; bitcoin wallets, untouched since 2012, break their over 11-year hibernation, initiating transactions for the first time. A total of approximately 1,216.92 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, which had remained in a state of inertia for the past decade, were shifted this month. The prior seven instances of bitcoin activity from 2012, involving dormant wallets, totaled 179.50 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> before the <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1MchKSZg4ETtfxJdhNXrDxg3hp9UAiNZ96">slumbering whale address</a> moved a colossal 1,037.42 bitcoins on Saturday.</p>
<p>The recipient address of the 1,037.42 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> first acquired the coins on <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/a11a3c20c548123e26aca05beb42d7171442d3351d64859b2e88b87c8d2f4411">April 11, 2012</a>, with the digital currency remaining untouched ever since. On this acquisition date, a single <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> traded at a mere $4.84, valuing the entire hoard at a modest $5,021. The trove of 1,037 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was dispatched at block height 799,701 on July 22, destined for this <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1qtl80rmdpe2v662v4552x55wh7wwmss8w8lfx0y">specific address</a>. After this transaction, the owner injected a minuscule 0.00000546 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> into the wallet, then subsequently transferred the balance, a slightly reduced 1,037.4189247 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>.</p>
<p>The initial transaction was <a href="https://btcparser.com/?a=1MchKSZg4ETtfxJdhNXrDxg3hp9UAiNZ96">flagged</a> by btcparser.com and was executed with minimal concealment. Blockchair.com&#x2019;s privacy tool assigned a dismal score of <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/privacy-o-meter/6a5467b7e5926756ba558402eadb0d97357e47db22f93dd213bbefece02f2c1d">zero out of 100</a> to the transaction. Such a low privacy rating is classified as &#x201C;critical,&#x201D; indicating the transfer was plagued by three significant privacy flaws. These shortcomings include the identification of &#x201C;matched addresses.&#x201D; The &#x201C;critical&#x201D; score implies that the &#x201C;identified issues are significantly endangering the privacy of the parties involved.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Alongside the 1,216.92 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> dispatched from dormant bitcoin addresses dating back to 2012 this month, there were also three transactions (<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1LKsQSQQsGT4Fhp5PbvmCugWd9heipypKz">1</a>,<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/13gfPHStgixjzu1vMfhwuitp3Kk65RVGbP">2</a>,<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/18FK98EcD5Fb72LLzHfDEoyjSCf4q1XD3K">3</a>) from 2011. Two of these 2011 transfers occurred on July 20, with the third executed on July 21. Yet, the three transfers combined only accounted for a modest 25 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> ($745K). While we haven&#x2019;t reached the end of July, there have yet to be any reports of bitcoin activity from addresses dormant since 2010. Conversely, June witnessed the awakening of three sleeping bitcoin addresses (<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/13CFnFFn932HdxjP2sJYdijmcDPVvDVT2i">1</a>,<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1MSij5Qi9EbxGFLB9RmfHEFvfK51a9B3hx">2</a>,<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1PJs7kzDby9887tGMjFQ7fPhUzSFtm7mTS">3</a>) from 2010, totaling 150 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> ($4.4M).</p>

The burden of government debt for every American is 10 times heavier than that for a Chinese citizen, according to the study.</strong></p>
<h2>U.S. Ranks Second in the World by Debt per Citizen, China in Top 50</h2>
<p>People in Singapore owed more than any other nation in 2022 as far as sovereign debt per capita is concerned, according to an analysis of data compiled by the United Nations. The share of each citizen of the city-state amounted to $117,400, according to the research conducted by the Russian RIA Novosti news agency.</p>
<p>The U.S. is second with $93,000 for each American. In June, the country’s debt surpassed the $32-trillion mark for the first time. That happened after President Joe Biden’s administration and House Republicans <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biden-republicans-strike-tentative-deal-to-raise-us-debt-ceiling/">struck a deal</a> to raise the debt ceiling at the end of May.</p>
<p>The United States is followed by Japan with $88,400. Canada comes in fourth place with $58,900 and Belgium ranks fifth with $52,600. Iceland ($51,200), Italy ($49,200), France ($47,100), Ireland ($47,100), and the U.K. ($46,600) are also in the top 10.</p>
<p>A number of other developed nations are in the top 30, including Norway (with $42,100), Australia ($36,500), and Switzerland ($36,200) as well as the European Union’s economic power house, Germany, with $32,600.</p>

<p>The U.N. numbers ranked Russia 94th last year, with $2,980 of state debt per capita. At the same time, according to the Russian Ministry of Finance (Minfin) and the Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat), Russia’s debt per capita was around $2,200, the report notes.</p>
<p>Among the members of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/historic-brics-summit-to-be-held-without-putin-in-person/">BRICS</a> bloc of developing economies (Brazil, Russia, China, India, and South Africa), the People’s Republic of China had the highest public debt per capita — $9,900, ranking 47th in the world. Brazil takes 57th place with $7,700. South Africa, where the public debt per capita was $4,700, was 75th, and India was 112th in 2022, with $2,000.</p>
<p>Members of the Eurasian Economic Union (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Economic_Union" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EAEU</a>) fared relatively well by the studied indicator. Armenia, where each citizen accounted for $3,200 of public debt last year, was 90th, Belarus took 91st place with $3,100, Kazakhstan ranked 99th with $2,700, and Kyrgyzstan was 139th with a per capita sovereign debt of $871.</p>

While copy trading is gaining popularity globally, traders and prospective users from Africa appear more interested in the strategy than those from other regions.</strong></p>
<h2>Africa-Based Users More Interested in Copy Trading</h2>
<p>According to Gracy Chen, the managing director of the crypto derivatives and copy trading platform Bitget, copying trading is a trading strategy which has not only &#8220;disrupted the crypto industry&#8221; but has become increasingly more popular with novice traders. She added that for some cases, copy trading has proven to be an effective strategy during the so-called &#8220;crypto winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>To support such assertions about this portfolio management strategy, Chen made reference to a <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/africas-copy-trading-boom-true-adoption-or-a-passing-fase/">report</a> highlighting the &#8220;300% growth in copy trading adoption in the last 24 months.&#8221; As the report (which relied on Google search data) noted, while copy trading is popular globally, traders and prospective users from Africa appear to be more interested in the strategy.</p>
<p>Described as a method that enables traders to copy specific strategies, this trading tactic is said to link &#8220;a portion of the copying trader&#8217;s funds to the account of the copied investor.&#8221; This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_trading">trading strategy</a> is thought to be popular with more risk-averse investors and traders.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<h2>Copy Trading Favored by Risk-Averse Traders</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, in remarks to Bitcoin.com News, Chen also highlighted the impact copy trading has had on Bitget. For instance, Chen pointed to the over 400,000 traders on Bitget who have used this trading strategy since its launch in May 2020. The Bitget managing director also explained how the continuing bear market is likely to convince the more risk-averse traders to pivot to copy trading.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the bear market continuing, people will want to leverage professional traders’ knowledge,&#8221; Chen said.</p>
<p>Chen revealed that Bitget’s internal user data already indicates that as many as 28% of traders have resorted to copy trading at least once in 2023. She also added that as many as 109,000 followers of the platform&#8217;s professional traders have made a profit.</p>
<p>While copy trading is the main reason why Bitget’s share of the market has grown over the past few years, Chen told Bitcoin.com News that the platform’s partnership with the football star Lionel Messi has also proven to be a shrewd business decision. In addition, the setting of a protection fund as well as the regular publishing of Bitget’s proof-of-reserves have also helped reassure users.</p>
<p>On why Bitget chose to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bitget-targets-middle-east-as-next-region-for-business-expansion-301881737.html">set up</a> an office in the Middle East, the managing director pointed to the region’s perceived crypto-friendly policies. She also added that the presence of influencers and Bitget’s partners in the region also justify the decision to set up offices there.</p>
