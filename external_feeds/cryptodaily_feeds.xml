			  <description><![CDATA[<p>December has historically been a good month for crypto, but given the macroeconomic conditions and the recent collapse of FTX, the market is extremely volatile.&nbsp; Dogecoin (DOGE) and Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) are among the few coins that have shown positive price action, whilst most other cryptos are currently trading sideways or downwards. Notably, Orbeon Protocol is now in its third phase of presale, and has already seen a 655% price increase in a matter of weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Why is Dogecoin outperforming the market?</p>
<p>Like most cryptocurrencies, DOGE got hit in the summer and was trading at around $0.06 that is until the now somewhat infamous sale of Twitter to Elon Musk went through. Speculation that Musk will integrate Dogecoin with Twitter caused the price to skyrocket to $0.14 on the 2nd November. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The subsequent collapse of FTX erased some of the gains but as of writing Dogecoin is trading at $0.09, which is still a very healthy increase from its summer lows. Another factor is that whilst famous tech leaker Jane Wong tweeted that Twitter was working on a crypto wallet, just prior to Musk&rsquo;s acquisition, a few days later Casey Newton reported that plans at Twitter for a crypto wallet integration have been put on hold.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Musk has added fuel to the fire that Dogecoin may be integrated with Twitter with various leaks and tweets, and by saying &ldquo;It is kind of a no-brainer for Twitter to have payments, both fiat and crypto.&rdquo; on a recent Twitter spaces session.&nbsp; Since you can buy merch using Dogecoin from Tesla and Space,. Twitter has been alive with DOGE fans buying dog whistles for 1000 Doge, with some noting that the payment system is not as well built as it could be, but eventually it works.</p>
<p>As Dogecoin is a fork of litecoin, it does not have the capability to interact with smart contracts so it may well be that Musk creates a &lsquo;Twitter Coin&rsquo; as well, to increase functionality. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps trying to capitalise on the news, a team of developers have now created an EVM compatible blockchain for DOGE, however, due to the above technical limitations, this chain actually uses a wrapped form of DOGE and will require bridging. The team plans to airdrop wrapped Dogecoin to Dogecoin holders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Investors can&rsquo;t get enough of Orbeon Protocol</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol allows anyone to easily invest in vetted startups at their early stages. Aiming to democratize the previously exclusive VC industry, Orbeon Protocol functions as a decentralized investment platform that allows startups to raise money more efficiently and quickly, while everyday investors get the chance to support them.</p>
<p>The platform uses equity-based NFTs as a form of investment. These fractionalized NFTs are available from as low as $1, and their value changes in real time to reflect the success of the startup that issued them.</p>
<p>ORBN, the project&rsquo;s native token, has seen immense demand during presale as the transactional token of this successful project. With benefits like staking bonuses and transaction fee discounts for holders, ORBN is set to launch at the end of January and experts are predicting as high as a 6000% price increase, as the price has already risen from $0.004 to $0.030.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Many famous cryptocurrencies suffered huge declines in 2021 and 2022, making investors nervous about choosing their crypto investments. This demonstrates the need to consider a cryptocurrency's practical applications and underlying infrastructure before committing capital to it.</p>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) and Fantom (FTM) are promising cryptocurrencies with solid foundations. Analysts, however, recommend Flasko as a viable alternative investment option with skyrocketing returns.</p>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) Had A Good Run</p>
<p>The Shiba Inu is the mascot for the cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE), inspired by the viral internet joke "doge." Many other tokens have followed Dogecoin (DOGE)'s lead since its meteoric rise in value and popularity a few years ago.</p>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE)'s proof-of-work mechanism, based on Scrypt technology, is one of the numerous ways it varies from Bitcoin's. Dogecoin (DOGE) rose to fame only because famous personalities started tweeting about it, and it became a sensation on Reddit. Unfortunately for Dogecoin (DOGE) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors, that fame was short-lived when Dogecoin (DOGE) finally plummeted. It is now trading at $0.10 per coin.</p>
<p>Consistent Drop in Fantom (FTM)&nbsp;</p>
<p>After announcing many partnerships, Fantom (FTM) saw record-breaking sales and earnings last month. As time has passed, prices have dropped to the $0.2 range. There was a 14% drop in Fantom (FTM) from the previous month. The coin is presently valued at $0.24.</p>
<p>As Fantom (FTM) is consistently declining daily, there has been a significant sell-off. It might be more beneficial to shift your focus to something with more development potential. However, Fantom (FTM) investors are selling their Fantom (FTM) coins for Flasko presale coins.</p>
<p>Flasko (FLSK) Will Become The Fastest-Growing Crypto In 2023</p>
<p>NFTs backed by lucrative real-life assets are the future of the crypto trading industry, which is why Flasko has recently gained a lot of popularity. Flasko is an upcoming platform allowing investors to purchase fractionalized NFTs of wine, whiskey, and champagne bottles.</p>
<p>The Flasko team is working daily to reassure investors that their funds are safe on the NFT platform. This includes completing the audit with Solid Proof with flying colors and locking liquidity for 33 years, assuring there will be no rug pull to risk investments.</p>
<p>By January 2023, experts think Flasko will be worth $4.50 per coin. At its current price of only $0.125, it would be an opportunity missed not to purchase Flasko presale tokens right now.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The year 2022 has been a major source of stress for cryptocurrency investors, notably holders of Hex Coin (HEX) and Solana (SOL). The recent downward price movements of Hex Coin (HEX) and Solana (SOL)&nbsp; have unnerved investors who purchased these currencies. Both currencies had a good start, but things don't seem good for the future. Flasko, a new rival currency, is emerging as a cryptocurrency with great potential in the coming days.</p>
<p>Flasko (FLSK) Presale Draws Attention From Hex Coin (HEX)</p>
<p>Hex Coin (HEX) is a game-changing digital asset that promotes itself as a premier blockchain CD. Hex Coin (HEX) was first launched on the Ethereum network, and its price has climbed dramatically since its creation, with an annual percentage return of almost 40%.</p>
<p>The Hex Coin (HEX) cryptocurrency uses a hybrid consensus process based on the Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW) algorithms. Despite a market valuation of $7.56 billion, the average daily trading volume is around $5.46 million. This indicates a dramatic decline in the number of investors. Hex Coin (HEX) is trading at only $0.03, which isn't appealing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solana (SOL) Investors Are Worried</p>
<p>Solana is another cryptocurrency that is having trouble right now (SOL). Solana (SOL) intended to develop a smart contract operating at the layer one level. It was also looking forward to establishing a scalable and quicker blockchain, which might give a superior throughput compared to the present Bitcoin (BTC) network.</p>
<p>Despite the merits of the Solana (SOL) concept, it was trapped in a market downturn. As a result, the cost of one Solana (SOL) token keeps falling. At the time of writing, one Solana (SOL) token is worth $13.69. In 2021, that same token was worth about $260.</p>
<p>Flasko (FLSK) Will See Incredible Growth In 2023</p>
<p>Flasko, an upcoming NFT platform, will allow users to invest in luxury beverages, including champagne, wine, and whiskey bottles backed by fractionalized NFTs secured by the underlying physical assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flasko will not only be convenient for people who are unable to afford luxury wines and spirits but will also play a pivotal role in helping up-and-coming brands to launch their products on their platform and get exposure through the Flasko platform.</p>
<p>Regarding figures, Flasko is currently in its second stage of the presale and costs only $0.125 per presale token, with predictions of hitting $5 by February 2023 by crypto experts. Flasko is set to become the fastest-growing cryptocurrency of 2023 as whales flooded to purchase Flasko tokens as the presale began.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With the year ending, investors are keen to boost their portfolios with cryptocurrencies that would provide immense gains. Due to the market decline, Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Elrond (EGLD) investors must look for alternatives since these tokens are currently struggling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, market analysts predict Sparklo to provide gains for investors in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bitcoin SV (BSV): Analysts Unsure Of Gains In The Long Term</p>
<p>The Bitcoin SV (BSV) token was introduced to the open market in November 2018. After it entered the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin SV (BSV) token hit an all-time high of over $200 before dropping to an all-time low of $36.87 on November 23. By 2019, the price fluctuated and traded between $20 to $80. Going further, by January 2020, the price of the Bitcoin SV (BSV) token rose to above $400 before it dipped. But it spent the rest of the year trading around $150 and $200.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2021, Bitcoin SV (BSV) token, like most cryptocurrencies, achieved a meteoric price rise. This saw the Bitcoin SV (BSV) token reach an all-time high of $489.75 on April 16, 2021. The Bitcoin SV (BSV) token declined in price after it achieved its all-time high. 2022 hasn't been all sunshine for Bitcoin SV (BSV) token, as the Bitcoin SV (BSV) token struggled to regain its former glory. Currently, this token trades at $39.94, which is a 91.8% price decrease over the past year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bitcoin SV (BSV) token currently has a total supply of 21,000,00 and a circulating supply of 19.2 million. Its market cap stands at over $768 million and ranks as the #53 cryptocurrency. Analysts aren't sure if Bitcoin SV (BSV) tokens can provide gains for investors in the short term. They suggest investors look to alternatives like Sparklo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elrond (EGLD) Might Not Provide Profits Anytime Soon</p>
<p>Elrond (EGLD) token had an all-time high of $545.64 on November 23, 2021. Like most cryptocurrencies during the period, the Elrond (EGLD) token amassed enormous gains for investors.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the year ending, investors are keen to boost their portfolios with cryptocurrencies that would provide immense gains. Due to the market decline, Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Elrond (EGLD) investors must look for alternatives since these tokens are currently struggling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, market analysts predict Sparklo to provide gains for investors in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bitcoin SV (BSV): Analysts Unsure Of Gains In The Long Term</p>
<p>The Bitcoin SV (BSV) token was introduced to the open market in November 2018. After it entered the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin SV (BSV) token hit an all-time high of over $200 before dropping to an all-time low of $36.87 on November 23. By 2019, the price fluctuated and traded between $20 to $80. Going further, by January 2020, the price of the Bitcoin SV (BSV) token rose to above $400 before it dipped. But it spent the rest of the year trading around $150 and $200.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2021, Bitcoin SV (BSV) token, like most cryptocurrencies, achieved a meteoric price rise. This saw the Bitcoin SV (BSV) token reach an all-time high of $489.75 on April 16, 2021. The Bitcoin SV (BSV) token declined in price after it achieved its all-time high. 2022 hasn't been all sunshine for Bitcoin SV (BSV) token, as the Bitcoin SV (BSV) token struggled to regain its former glory. Currently, this token trades at $39.94, which is a 91.8% price decrease over the past year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bitcoin SV (BSV) token currently has a total supply of 21,000,00 and a circulating supply of 19.2 million. Its market cap stands at over $768 million and ranks as the #53 cryptocurrency. Analysts aren't sure if Bitcoin SV (BSV) tokens can provide gains for investors in the short term. They suggest investors look to alternatives like Sparklo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elrond (EGLD) Might Not Provide Profits Anytime Soon</p>
<p>Elrond (EGLD) token had an all-time high of $545.64 on November 23, 2021. Like most cryptocurrencies during the period, the Elrond (EGLD) token amassed enormous gains for investors. But, this gain couldn't continue as the price dropped shortly after. CoinMarketCap data shows that Elrond (EGLD) token lost 26% of its value over the last 30 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, in the past 14 days, Elrond (EGLD) token tried to make some gains by increasing 1.5% and 0.5% over the past seven days. Elrond (EGLD) token costs $42.65 after a 3.2% price increase over the last 24 hours, but analysts don't think this growth can be sustainable in the long term.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical data shows that investors in Elrond (EGLD) tokens can only make gains in a short rally. This leads investors to look for alternative investments that can provide short-term and long-term gains, like Spaklo.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Orbits 16529:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 19 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained on the defensive early in the Asian session as the pair remained vulnerable around the 17000 figure after trading as low as the 16529.53 level, an area that represented a test of the 61.8% retracement of the appreciating range from 15460 to 18385.36. &nbsp;Technical demand emerged around the 16650.14 level during the pullback, a test of the 50% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 16529.53 to 16775.52.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stops were recently elected below the 16849.58 area during the ongoing depreciation, a downside price objective related to selling pressure that intensified below the 17525 area.&nbsp; Strong selling pressure around the 18385 and 17525 areas could result in tests of additional downside price objectives around the 16375, 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD is able to reclaim some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 17260.77 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 17009.83.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bearishly below MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Even amidst the current chaos and collapses that are permeating the cryptocurrency industry, Jay Clayton, former chair of the SEC, says that crypto can still contribute to improvements in traditional finance.</p>
Negative press
<p>Crypto has found an unlikely ally in the former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Jay Clayton. While crypto is being scorned and maligned to the heavens over the sequence of large exchange collapses, Clayton recently remarked in an interview that &ldquo;the promise of distributed ledger technology is remarkable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clayton is receiving some quite negative press over his remarks, and a pro-blockchain op-ed of his that was published in the Wall Street Journal was also deplored by several commentators.</p>
Clayton tenure not kind to crypto
<p>However, despite this, history tells us that the ex SEC chair has not been kind to crypto in the past. Just like the current SEC chair Gary Gensler, Clayton refused to approve any exchange traded funds (ETFs), and it was during his tenure that the SEC originally took Ripple Labs to court over violation of securities laws.</p>
Supportive of SEC Gensler
<p>According to an article in Business Insider, Jay Clayton is also on the record as being supportive of Gensler in that he believes that all crypto intermediaries can be regulated, drawn from rules that are already in place.</p>
<p>In addition, he is of the opinion that the SEC should &ldquo;vigorously crack down&rdquo; on crypto platforms that are seen as trading securities, and should continue to do so.</p>
<p>Stablecoin compliance is one other area where Clayton is of the view that there is much risk of counterparty and credit risk. He feels that bank regulators could lead in this area.</p>
Clayton now a crypto insider?
<p>So why is Jay Clayton talking up crypto right now?</p>
<p>Since leaving office in 2020, Clayton has held a number of roles in the crypto industry. Therefore he could now be seen as having quite a lot more knowledge on the industry.</p>
<p>He is currently a senior policy advisor for Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, a law firm that has a lot of business with crypto firms. He is on the board of crypto infrastructure provider Fireblocks, and he has advisory roles at One River Digital Asset Management, and also Apollo Global Management, which is an investor in blockchain.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com has received a Payment Institution License (EMI) from the Brazilian central bank. </p>
<p>Crypto exchange Crypto.com (CRO) has obtained an EMI license from the Central Bank of Brazil according to an announcement made by the company.

<p>Latin America is a major driver in crypto adoption and regulators have also been playing a key role to foster this. This is an exciting step in our journey in Brazil and LATAM, with much more to come.</p>

<p>Crypto.com&rsquo;s announcement also details how far the exchange has come in terms of global regulatory approval recently:</p>

<p>In recent months, Crypto.com has received in-principle approval of its Major Payment Institution (MPI) license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), regulatory approval as a Digital Asset Service Provider by the Autorit&eacute; des march&eacute;s financiers (AMF) in France, registration approval as a cryptoasset business from the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), provisional approval of its Virtual Asset License from the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), Electronic Financial Transaction Act and Virtual Asset Service Provider registration in South Korea, a pre-registration undertaking with the Ontario Securities Administration in Canada, among others.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>United States Senator Pat Toomey this week spoke at the Senate Banking Committee hearing on the collapse of FTX in which he explained that the illegal actions by FTX must be separated &ldquo;from perfectly lawful and innovative cryptocurrencies.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) emphasized that &ldquo;The collapse of FTX is not an indictment of crypto,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;cryptocurrency cannot be stopped&rdquo; and &ldquo;the technology would simply migrate offshore&rdquo; if Congress tried to do something untoward against the industry. Toomey described the events:</p>

<p>There was unauthorized lending of customer assets to an affiliated entity, and there were fraudulent promises to investors and customers about FTX&rsquo;s operations. These are outrageous and completely unacceptable.</p>

<p>He further emphasized:</p>

<p>I want to underscore a bigger issue here: The wrongful behaviour that occurred here is not specific to the underlying asset. What appears to have happened here is a complete breakdown in the handling of those assets.</p>

<p>Senator Toomey made a crucial statement that Congress and regulators need to keep in mind:</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are actually software. What we should all understand here is one simple thing: The code committed no crime. FTX and cryptocurrencies are not the same thing. FTX was opaque, centralized, and dishonest. Cryptocurrencies are open-source, decentralized, and transparent.</p>

The fallout from FTX Does Not Justify and Ban on Crypto
<p>Toomey also addressed suggestions that have been put forward which sat crypto should be banned:</p>

<p>To those who think that this episode justifies banning crypto, I&rsquo;d ask you to think about several examples. The 2008 financial crisis involved the misuse of products related to mortgages. Did we decide to ban mortgages? Of course not. A commodity brokerage firm run by former New Jersey Senator John Corzine collapsed after customer funds &mdash; including U.S. dollars &mdash; were misappropriated to fill a shortfall from the firm&rsquo;s trading losses. Nobody suggested that the problem was the U.S. dollar and that we should ban it. With FTX, the problem is not the instruments that were used. The problem was the misuse of customer funds, gross mismanagement, and likely illegal behaviour.</p>

<p>To his colleagues who have suggested that crypto should be paused before addressing it, he had the following to say:</p>

<p>Some of my colleagues have suggested pausing cryptocurrencies before we can address it. This is profoundly misguided, not to mention impossible. Short of enacting draconian, authoritarian policies, cryptocurrency cannot be stopped. If we tried, the technology would simply migrate offshore.</p>

<p>He further opined:</p>

<p>Are we going to decide to pause our Constitution to stop crypto? This is exactly the kind of mindset that has driven this activity to the dark and less regulated parts of the world.</p>

Would it Be Wise for Congress Not to Regulate the industry?
<p>Toomey further said in his statements:</p>

<p>Others have suggested we refrain from addressing cryptocurrency at all, so as to not legitimize its use. This is not only misguided, it&rsquo;s irresponsible.</p>

<p>He stressed:</p>

<p>Individuals can also be tremendously empowered when they use cryptocurrencies. They can protect against inflation when governments irresponsibly manage their own currencies. They can provide useful services without the need for a company or middleman. And they can let individuals preserve the freedom to transact privately.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>United States Senator Pat Toomey this week spoke at the Senate Banking Committee hearing on the collapse of FTX in which he explained that the illegal actions by FTX must be separated &ldquo;from perfectly lawful and innovative cryptocurrencies.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) emphasized that &ldquo;The collapse of FTX is not an indictment of crypto,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;cryptocurrency cannot be stopped&rdquo; and &ldquo;the technology would simply migrate offshore&rdquo; if Congress tried to do something untoward against the industry. Toomey described the events:</p>

<p>There was unauthorized lending of customer assets to an affiliated entity, and there were fraudulent promises to investors and customers about FTX&rsquo;s operations. These are outrageous and completely unacceptable.</p>

<p>He further emphasized:</p>

<p>I want to underscore a bigger issue here: The wrongful behaviour that occurred here is not specific to the underlying asset. What appears to have happened here is a complete breakdown in the handling of those assets.</p>

<p>Senator Toomey made a crucial statement that Congress and regulators need to keep in mind:</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are actually software. What we should all understand here is one simple thing: The code committed no crime. FTX and cryptocurrencies are not the same thing. FTX was opaque, centralized, and dishonest. Cryptocurrencies are open-source, decentralized, and transparent.</p>

The fallout from FTX Does Not Justify and Ban on Crypto
<p>Toomey also addressed suggestions that have been put forward which sat crypto should be banned:</p>

<p>To those who think that this episode justifies banning crypto, I&rsquo;d ask you to think about several examples. The 2008 financial crisis involved the misuse of products related to mortgages. Did we decide to ban mortgages? Of course not. A commodity brokerage firm run by former New Jersey Senator John Corzine collapsed after customer funds &mdash; including U.S. dollars &mdash; were misappropriated to fill a shortfall from the firm&rsquo;s trading losses. Nobody suggested that the problem was the U.S. dollar and that we should ban it. With FTX, the problem is not the instruments that were used. The problem was the misuse of customer funds, gross mismanagement, and likely illegal behaviour.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Democratic Party is set to return over $1 million of its funding to victims of the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX, according to a report.</p>
<p>The report, which was first published by The Verge, states that three of the top Democratic campaign organisations will be setting aside funds sent to them in contributions from Sam Bankman-Fried, ex-CEO of the collapsed FTX cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
<p>Given that SBF has now been arrested following the alleged fraudulent activities that led to FTX losing around $8 billion in investor funds, the pressure has been on the Democratic party to give back some of the funds that it received in contributions.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given the allegations around potential campaign finance violations by Bankman-Fried, we are setting aside funds in order to return the $815,000 in contributions since 2020,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>They added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will return as soon as we receive proper direction in the legal proceedings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over the last two year SBF has donated large sums of money to US political parties. Around $815,000 in contributions have been paid to the Democratic Party since 2020, but what is generally known is that according to SBF, he also donated a similar amount to the Republican party.</p>
<p>He is reported to have told crypto blogger and youtuber Tiffany Fong shortly after the FTX bankruptcy that he contributed to the Republican party but said that he did it covertly because &ldquo;Reporters freak the **** out if you donate to a republican.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Solana&rsquo;s woes continue as the Raydium protocol, an automated market maker (AMM) on the Solana (SOL) network was hacked on December 16. </p>
<p>Raydium, a Solana DeFi protocol was hacked for over $2 million early on Friday. According to reports, the hacker extracted funds from multiple Raydium liquidity pools without owning or burning any liquidity provider (LP) tokens. It appears that the hacker used the protocol&rsquo;s own private keys to drain liquidity pools, but it remains unclear how they got them. The attacker managed to overtake the organization&rsquo;s &ldquo;owner authority&rdquo; and used that access to begin draining Raydium&rsquo;s liquidity pools. According to reports by Decrypt, DeFi tools allow users to borrow, lend and trade crypto assets with each other without the need for third-party intermediaries. AMMs such as Raydium achieve this by letting users contribute assets to a pool often in exchange for token rewards.</p>
Over $2 Million was Drained
<p>Raydium confirmed the hack via Twitter and added that investigations remain ongoing. The protocol added a link to the attacker&rsquo;s account which appears to hold $1.45 million worth of Solana-based tokens.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">An exploit on Raydium is being investigated that affected liquidity pools.

</p>
<p>In a matter of hours, the attacker stole over $2.2 million worth of digital assets from a Raydium pool, including $1.6 million worth of SOL, per reports by blockchain analytics firm Nansen.</p>

</p>
<p>Raydium is one of the cornerstones of the Solana DeFi ecosystem and one of its largest DeFi protocols. A vulnerability such as this encouraged members of the Raydium community to withdraw from the protocol.</p>
&lsquo;Tis Not the Season for Solana
<p>The recent collapse of FTX has sent shockwaves through the entire crypto space and has had far-reaching consequences, particularly for Solana. Not long after the implosion of the exchange, it was revealed that the private keys to Solana decentralised exchange and liquidity provider Serum, coincidently co-founded by Sam Bankman-Fried himself, were housed on FTX. As Serum was integrated with practically every major Solana DeFi project, including Raydium, fear and panic spread across the entire network. A number of protocols, including Raydium, frantically severed ties with Serum which initiated a fork of the project removed from and untainted by the vast fallout from the FTX fiasco.</p>
<p>While there has been no evidence to suggest that the attack on Raydium was linked to Serum or FTX, it does indicate that difficulties still lie ahead for Solana.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Bears Are Growling:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 18 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to experience downward pressure early in the Asian session as the pair continue to cede most of its recent gains and traded as low as the 16529.53 area, representing a test of the 61.8% retracement of the appreciating range from 15460 to 18385.36.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stops were elected below the 16849.58 area during the ongoing depreciation, a downside price objective related to selling pressure that intensified below the 17525 area.&nbsp; Strong selling pressure around the 18385 and 17525 areas could result in tests of additional downside price objectives around the 16375, 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD is able to reclaim some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16818.88 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 17121.93.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A new policy by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) will permit banks to hold 2% of their reserves in cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>The BIS recently issued its Prudential Treatment of Cryptoasset Exposure report for December 2022 in which it introduced a policy that now allows banks to hold 2% of their reserves in cryptocurrencies. The policy, the second consultation of one published earlier in the year, covers several aspects of how crypto assets are to be defined, processed, and is set to take effect on January 1, 2025. In the first iteration of this report, published in June, the BIS announced that banks would be limited to holding no more than 1% of their reserves in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The policy groups crypto assets into two cohorts. Group 1 is defined as tokenized traditional assets and crypto assets that have an &ldquo;effective stabilization mechanism.&rdquo; Group 2 are referred to as digital assets that &ldquo;fail to meet any of the classification conditions of Group 1 assets.&rdquo; Group 2 assets are where the BIS is applying its new rules. Per the BIS, Group 2 assets, which include Bitcoin, pose a greater risk to financial systems as they do not have an identifiable counterparty. The paper specifies that a bank&rsquo;s exposure to Group 2 crypto assets should not exceed 2% of the bank&rsquo;s Tier 1 capital, within their reserves. Group 2 financial instruments have not yet been accommodated under rules set out by the BIS and therefore necessitate new policy, the paper clarified:</p>

<p>Certain cryptoassets have exhibited a high degree of volatility, and could present risks for banks as exposures increase, including liquidity risk; credit risk; market risk; operational risk (including fraud and cyber risks); money laundering/terrorist financing risk; and legal and reputation risks.</p>

<p>The BIS report further adds that as the digital asset industry expands, inherent risks increase in tandem. Hence, a need to regulate the market despite its small size relative to the global market is required.</p>
<p>In its detailing of the risks and supervision of Group 2 assets, the report states:</p>

<p>The required process has been modified to remove the supervisory pre-approval element; instead, in the final standard banks are required to notify supervisors of classification decisions and supervisors will have the power to override these decisions if they disagree with a bank&rsquo;s assessment.</p>

Is This Bullish for Crypto?
<p>Regulators have largely maintained a rather cautious approach to regulating the sector so far and the rule proposed by the BIS remains in line with this. While this policy is somewhat conservative, it is bullish for the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto asset industry. The introduction of this new policy means that banks are afforded some clarity on gaining crypto exposure when the rule takes effect in all BIS jurisdictions in 2025.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Central Bank of Russia has introduced a course of action aimed at protecting companies dealing with digital assets against the pressure of sanctions. </p>
CBR Offers Relief to Crypto Companies, Albeit Temporary
<p>The Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) has introduced a set of measures to protect entities working with digital assets against pressures from sanctions. These measures allow the issuers of digital financial assets (DFAs) not to disclose sensitive information considering sanctions risks as reported by Bitcoin.com. Per these new measures, businesses will be exempted from certain reporting requirements, and they aim to provide some regulatory relief in an effort to minimize the burden on financial organizations. The exemption, which is valid until July 1, 2023, mainly concerns data revealing the beneficial owners of entities dealing with digital assets. &nbsp;</p>
Crippling Sanctions Have Forced the CBR&rsquo;s Hand
<p>The CBR issued a press release in which it explained that the temporary reporting exemption makes up part of a set of measures meant to provide assistance to organizations and persons operating within the Russian financial market infrastructure. Russia is yet to regulate cryptos such as Bitcoin, but the existing law &ldquo;On Digital Financial Assets&rdquo; allows firms to issue coins and tokens in controlled environments. As it stands, three &ldquo;operators of information systems in which DFAs can be issued&rdquo; have been licensed by the Central Bank &ndash; Russia&rsquo;s largest bank, Sber, the tokenization service Atomyze, and Lighthouse. Sber recently announced that it is integrating support for MetaMask and Ethereum on its proprietary blockchain.</p>
<p>The CBR&rsquo;s press release mainly focused on explaining the regulatory and supervisory relief it is offering to financial market participants and DFA issuers since earlier in the year is aimed at minimizing the burden on these entities given the current economic and geopolitical situation Russia finds itself in. The Russian government and many businesses have been suffering from harsh sanctions from the West over Moscow&rsquo;s decision to invade neighboring Ukraine in February. The sanctions have been crippling and have severely restricted Russia&rsquo;s access to global markets and finances.</p>
Russia to Legalise Crypto Cross-Border Payments
<p>Despite the Federation&rsquo;s mostly anti-crypto stance, a proposal to legalise the use of cryptocurrencies for cross-border payments and international settlements in order to reduce the pressure of sanctions has been backed and advocated for by many Russian institutions, including the CBR &ndash; the institutional which has traditionally maintained a hardline stance on crypto regulations.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Both Monero (XMR) and Theta Network (THETA) have been around for a while now, and their respective communities are starting to ask when development will start picking up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a new project filled with potential, and it looks like it could overtake both XMR and THETA during phase 3 of its public presale. Orbeon Protocol has already seen its price increase 655% during phase 1 and 2 of its public presale, looks like the sky's the limit.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN)</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a pioneering platform that is transforming the way startups raise money and connect with investors. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology and equity-based NFTs, Orbeon Protocol is creating a more accessible and efficient crowdfunding ecosystem.</p>
<p>The use of NFTs enables the fractionalization of equity, which means that investors can own a much smaller portion of a company than they would with traditional investment vehicles. This makes it easier for more people to invest in startups, and it allows investors to diversify their portfolios more effectively.</p>
<p>By automating many of the processes involved in raising money and managing investments, Orbeon Protocol's smart contract helps to create a more transparent and secure crowdfunding ecosystem. For example, if a project doesn't reach its goal, there is a failsafe that refunds investors.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol&rsquo;s native ORBN token serves as the primary means of exchange on Orbeon Protocol&rsquo;s platform, and it grants a range of benefits to users who hold it in their wallets.</p>
<p>One of the main advantages of holding ORBN is the ability to access the best investment opportunities on the platform before non-holders. This gives ORBN holders the first-mover advantage and allows them to potentially earn higher returns on their investments.</p>
<p>Although it has yet to launch, Orbeon Protocol is quickly making a name for itself in the crowdfunding industry due to its pioneering use of blockchain and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Phase 3 of the public presale has just started, with more than 10 million tokens sold in the first few days, some industry experts have predicted Orbeon Protocols price will be in the region of $0.24 by the end of the year, 60x the phase 1 price.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Monero (XMR)</p>
<p>Monero (XMR) is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that has been around for nearly a decade. Monero (XMR) offers users an enhanced level of privacy, as transactions can't be tracked and linked to a specific user as they can with Bitcoin (BTC).</p>
<p>Monero&rsquo;s (XMR) network uses ring signatures, stealth addresses, and other security features to keep transactions private. As such, there is a clear demand for the coin and Monero&rsquo;s (XMR) network, especially by those who believe real money shouldn't be traced.</p>
<p>However, crypto prices tend to correlate with activity and excitement, which can sometimes mean that older coins, like Monero (XMR), can be forgotten about. This was certainly the case during the 2021 bull run, where Monero (XMR) saw its price increase, but not to the same extent as other coins.</p>
<p>More recently we have seen an anti privacy approach adopted by governments and exchanges, this recent attack on privacy saw Monero (XMR) delisted from some top exchanges.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Theta Network (THETA)</p>
<p>Theta Network (THETA) is a blockchain-powered video streaming platform that rewards users for their contributions to the network. Now, anyone using Theta Network can enjoy content and share data across a peer-to-peer network.</p>
<p>Theta Network promises to alleviate the financial burdens of content creators who are currently at the mercy of large, centralized corporations like YouTube and Twitch. Theta Network Users can earn further rewards by providing essential network resources, like bandwidth and storage, to other streamers.</p>
<p>Theta Network has heavy hitters in the streaming and media industry as advisors, including Steven Chen, the co-founder of YouTube. However, recent developments have not lived up to expectations, with Theta Network&rsquo;s price down a huge 94.63% at the current time of writing. Theta Network is currently trading at $0.83.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Mazars the auditing firm that worked with Binance and various other crypto exchanges including KuCoin and Crypto.com has paused all its business with their crypto clients according to an emailed statement by Binance. </p>
<p>Mazars recently performed a proof-of-reserves assessment of Binance finding its Bitcoin reserves to be overcollateralized. Mazars has since removed the link to the report from its website. A spokesperson from Binance said:</p>

<p>Mazars has indicated that they will temporarily pause their work with all of their crypto clients globally, which include&nbsp;Crypto.com, KuCoin, and Binance. Unfortunately, this means that we will not be able to work with Mazars for the moment.</p>

<p>According to reports from Bloomberg, Mazar&rsquo;s website shows that they fully discontinued Mazars Veritas &ndash; a section dedicated to crypto exchange audits. Mazars Veritas was developed by the firm to bring &ldquo;trust and transparency to the digital asset sector,&rdquo; and made use of the Silver Sixpence Merkle Tree Generating tool to complement proof-of-reserve reports. Bloomberg further reported that other auditing firms such as FTX&rsquo;s auditor Armanino also halted their work with crypto exchanges such as OKX and Gate.io.</p>
<p>The auditor also found that KuCoin&rsquo;s BTC, USDT, ETH, and USDC reserves were all overcollateralized, but has also removed this report since. The auditing firm did however find that Crypto.com&rsquo;s reserves were fully backed at a ratio of 1:1.</p>
<p>Binance&rsquo;s CEO Changpeng &ldquo;CZ&rdquo; Zhao quickly took to Twitter to react to the news by retweeting a random commenter's statement. He also went on Twitter to hint that blockchains are transparent by default stating:</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Blockchains are public, permanent records. It's the most auditable ledger.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Gives Back Recent Gains:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 17 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) extended its ongoing depreciation early in the Asian session as the pair traded below the psychologically-important 17000 figure, reaching the 16924.99 area following increasing risk aversion. &nbsp;&nbsp;Selling pressure intensified around the 17525 area, just above the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 18385.36 to 17222.09.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were elected below the 17267.87 area as the downturn intensified, a level that represents the 38.2% retracement of the appreciating range from 15460 to 18385.36.&nbsp; &nbsp;Strong selling pressure around the 18385 and 17525 areas could result in tests of downside price objectives around the 16849, 16375, 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD is able to reclaim some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 17110.39 and the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 17286.61.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bearishly below MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bearishly below MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>After suffering a huge amount of negative press over its recent proof-of-reserves audit, blockchain analytics provider CryptoQuant has verified that all Binance&rsquo;s reserves are accounted for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency market has been roiled over the past few days by FUD suggesting that this and that crypto platform is about to go down. Binance, being the biggest trading platform in the sector, has become the number one target for most of the FUD.</p>
<p>The Binance proof-of-reserves report put together by Mazars did confirm that Binance&rsquo;s bitcoin reserves were overcollateralised. However, after the report was criticised by certain industry experts, Mazars started to distance itself from the report and now the link to it is dead and not available.</p>
<p>The problem appears to have been that the report was not a proper audit given that it was an &ldquo;agreed-upon procedure&rdquo; rather than a full audit that used a process imposed by the auditor themselves.</p>
<p>However, CryptoQuant carried out its own analysis of Binance and it found that the exchange was now the biggest in the sector with 30% of its reserves in BTC. Coinbase took second place with 26% of reserves in BTC.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Source: CryptoQuant</p>
<p>One of the key messages in the CryptoQuant report was that the Binance-reported liabilities were very similar to CryptoQuant&rsquo;s own estimation:</p>

<p>"In order to assess the data in Binance&rsquo;s Proof-of-Reserves report, we compared Binance liabilities expressed in the report to CryptoQuant&rsquo;s on-chain metric Binance BTC Reserve data (our estimate of Binance&rsquo;s customers&rsquo; deposits). We found out that the liabilities reported by Binance are very close to our estimation (99%)."</p>

<p>The report concluded that Binance&rsquo;s ETH and stablecoin reserves were &ldquo;not showing FTX-like behaviour&rdquo;, and it stated that the BNB exchange coin was not a large percentage of reserves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Binance has an acceptable "Clean Reserve,&rdquo; which means its own token, BNB, is still a low proportion of its total assets.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto bank Silvergate has been hit with a class action lawsuit, alleging that it aided and abetted fraud carried out by FTX and its subsidiary Alameda Research.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed by Joewy Gonzalez &ldquo;on behalf of all others similarly situated&rdquo;, in which it is claimed that Silvergate &ldquo;aided and abetted&rdquo; FTX in fraud and breaches of fiduciary duty.</p>
<p>The complaint claims that Silvergate processed billions in transfers between the FTX client account on its platform and Alameda accounts. It also accuses Silvergate of accepting deposits from FTX investors which were fraudulently sent to Alameda to be misused.</p>
<p>In a direct quote in the complaint it was alleged that Sam Bankman-Fried, the then CEO of FTX, told a reporter that he had forgotten about the &ldquo;improper transfers&rdquo; until the collapse of his company. He was quoted as saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;it looks like people wired $8b to Alameda and &lsquo;oh god we basically forgot about the stub account that corresponded to that so it was never delivered to FTX.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the lawsuit the plaintiff accuses FTX of pursuing an &ldquo;aggressive, celebrity-fueled marketing campaign&rdquo;, and listing the following sporting partnerships:</p>

<p>&ldquo;sports and entertainment figures such as Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen, Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal, Steph Curry, and others. FTX also obtained the naming rights to the Miami Heat&rsquo;s venue, and formalized a partnership with the Golden State Warriors.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lawsuit alleges that Silvergate is liable for its part in the FTX investment fraud, and for its breaches of fiduciary duty. The claim asks that Silvergate be &ldquo;obligated under common law to make Plaintiff and the other investors whole.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The introduction of blockchain technology led to one of the most interesting types of investments with cryptocurrency. Blockchain also paved the way for another trendy investment in 2021: Non-fungible tokens or NFTs. The smart contracts allocated to NFTs made them more popular among both artists and investors since there was no middle party to take a share of trades. Therefore, both artists and investors could enjoy earning more financial interest.</p>
<p>Since then, the NFT market faced great hype and lots of NFT collections were uploaded to NFT marketplaces. Some brand collections got so expensive that a normal investor was not able to afford a single NFT from the collection. Though, the NFT market has shown to be totally flexible to bring up creative solutions in order to keep the hype up and even attract more investors.</p>
<p>Along with these all, the NFT world is expanding every day and mixes more areas of art and the virtual world. The unlimited number of NFT projects available as well as the latest creative NFT collections added to the market day after day seem to cause confusion for most investors. Some find it a high risk to invest in NFTs and some others find themselves hopeless to decide among the choices they have.</p>
<p>Although there are lots of articles and guides about investment in The NFT market, to the knowledge of the writer, no article has fully provided a comprehensive guide to the issues investors must know to make a safe investment in the world of NFT. Therefore, in this article, we aim to discuss all the sources that investors need to check before trading NFTs.</p>
<p>What should NFT investors know to make a successful investment?</p>
<p>the NFT world is expanding every day and lots of features have been added to the market since the start. Therefore, for NFT investors to take the highest benefits from the market, it is necessary to gain basic as well as professional information and tutorials provided for the NFT market. Here is a list of necessary points that investors need to keep in mind to improve their knowledge in the field of NFT.</p>
<p>Nature of NFTs</p>
<p>It is essential to learn not only about the nature of non-fungible tokens but also blockchain technology used with NFTs. The more you know about NFTs and about the technologies used with them, the better you can learn about the important factors to consider with NFT collections to choose from.</p>
<p>The developer team of an NFT collection</p>
<p>NFT investors always should learn about the development team of NFT collections. The future success of an NFT collection is directly related to its development team. Nobody wants to invest in a collection that its developers disappear after a while. Projects such as Ape Bored Yacht Club or Axi Infinity are strongly supported by developer teams that launch new collections from time to time and, as the result, add to the value of the tokens they released earlier.</p>
<p>Know the market flow</p>
<p>The next important item to consider for a safe and profitable investment in the NFT market is to know the flows in the market. You may find it almost impossible since it is a really huge market and nobody may get the time to check all NFT projects launched every week. Sure it is difficult, but not impossible! The NFT market provides a solution to almost all problems. The NFT market provides special tools to allow investors acquire the information they need to make an investment. Some practical tools include NFT Calendar that offers a time table to remind NFT events to investors, Rarity tools to calculate the rarity of NFT items, joining Discord servers to get the upcoming news and information about an NFT collection or its developer team, etc.</p>
<p>What should NFT investors follow to make a successful investment?</p>
<p>There are also other sources of information available for investors to keep update with the news in the NFT world. Along with joining Discords, investors also can follow the developer team&rsquo;s Twitter accounts and. Though, it is still much time-consuming to check for all details and news, especially if they keep a list of NFT collections to choose from. So, there should be a shorter way to get most of the news about NFT collections and events related to them.</p>
<p>As we already mentioned, there is always a solution to satisfy the investors in the NFT world. Here are the professional online NFT sites. Such sites are dedicated to all related to the NFT world, including NFT tutorials, NFT news and more importantly sections on NFT events and NFT drops. These professional NFT sites have gathered a team of professional experts in the field of NFTs and the Metaverse to provide the latest news on the NFT market not only weekly but also daily. See, things are getting easier when there are professional experts to analyze the NFT market, look for the most reliable NFT projects and write the latest news about them. These teams also watch the NFT brand movements and let the investors know about future events and possible drops that can be interesting to NFT investors.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s learn about the three major parts of NFT sites that definitely help investors to make the best decisions for their investments in the NFT world.</p>
<p>NFT NEWS</p>
<p>Well, it goes without saying that successful investors always need to follow the news to take the best advantage of their digital assets. Every movement of an NFT developer team or a celebrity in the world of NFTs may cause a wave in the market and change the flow of the market as well as the points of view of NFT investors. So, investors should always look for the most reliable NFT news sources.</p>
<p>NFT EVENTS</p>
<p>A successful investor always knows about the events in the NFT world ahead of many others. Knowing about the future steps of an NFT project or knowing its release time always helps investors get ready for their next step in the NFT market. As you may already know, most of the profitable NFT collections sell out in a very short time and those who are not aware of the sale date and time lose the chance to get a precious NFT at the right time for a sale price. Besides, NFT owners may also miss an event set by an NFT developer team to get side advantages provided by their tokens. Follow the sites that provide the most comprehensive list of NFT events.</p>
<p>NFT Drops</p>
<p>An NFT drop refers to the release of a non-fungible token project with the exact date, time, and generally the minting price of the NFT. Since most NFT drops have purchase limits, investors can learn about the different aspects of the NFT drop earlier and make the best decisions for their purchase. As you may notice, purchasing at drop time is a great way to save money and no investor may want to lose this great chance. Therefore, get online with the most reliable NFT sites and get the latest news on NFT drops.</p>
<p>We hope that this article could be beneficial for all NFT investors out there. We suggest investors regularly check all sources introduced in this text to keep up to date with the NFT world and make the most profit.</p>

<p>NFT NEWS</p>
<p>Well, it goes without saying that successful investors always need to follow the news to take the best advantage of their digital assets. Every movement of an NFT developer team or a celebrity in the world of NFTs may cause a wave in the market and change the flow of the market as well as the points of view of NFT investors. So, investors should always look for the most reliable NFT news sources.</p>
<p>NFT EVENTS</p>
<p>A successful investor always knows about the events in the NFT world ahead of many others. Knowing about the future steps of an NFT project or knowing its release time always helps investors get ready for their next step in the NFT market. As you may already know, most of the profitable NFT collections sell out in a very short time and those who are not aware of the sale date and time lose the chance to get a precious NFT at the right time for a sale price. Besides, NFT owners may also miss an event set by an NFT developer team to get side advantages provided by their tokens. Follow the sites that provide the most comprehensive list of NFT events.</p>
<p>NFT Drops</p>
<p>An NFT drop refers to the release of a non-fungible token project with the exact date, time, and generally the minting price of the NFT. Since most NFT drops have purchase limits, investors can learn about the different aspects of the NFT drop earlier and make the best decisions for their purchase. As you may notice, purchasing at drop time is a great way to save money and no investor may want to lose this great chance. Therefore, get online with the most reliable NFT sites and get the latest news on NFT drops.</p>
