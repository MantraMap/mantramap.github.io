Ethereum (ETH) Price Rises After Visa Announcement 
<p>The global payment company Visa has been developing an experimental method that enables on-chain Ethereum (ETH) gas prices to be paid using credit cards. The fintech startup claims that the testing for this solution is now complete, allowing customers to use credit or debit cards to pay the gas cost with fiat on Ethereum directly. </p>
<p>The ease of use and convenience offered by this approach has the potential to make Ethereum transactions more accessible to a broader audience. As a result, the Ethereum price soared by 1.2% over the past seven days.</p>
<p>This bullish trend has continued as the Ethereum value now sits at $1,849.67 with a market cap of $222B, a rise of 0.18% overnight. Furthermore, the technical analysis of Ethereum paints a bullish picture. In other words, its moving averages and technical indicators show buy signals. Therefore, experts forecast a jump to $2,335.71 by December 2023.</p>
Pomerdoge (POMD): Stellar Presale Performance
<p>While traditional financial players are making strides in crypto adoption with Ethereum, innovative blockchain projects are also making waves. Pomerdoge (POMD), an exciting play-to-earn gaming project, has captured mass appeal with its presale, providing early birds with a 14% ROI.</p>
Exploring The Pomerdoge (POMD) Success
<p>At the heart of Pomerdoge is the opportunity to build and nurture your Pomer character. As you progress through the game, your Pomer character evolves and grows to elite levels, reflecting your skill and dedication. To clarify, this unique feature adds an element of personalization and ownership that resonates with the core principles of blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Pomerdoge 7,777 NFT collection is another rare and exciting component. Each NFT within this limited edition collection holds the promise of something extraordinary, but the full extent of its benefits remains tantalizingly undisclosed until closer to the launch. What we do know is that only POMD holders will gain access to it, and each NFT will be worth 0.2 ETH.</p>
The Allure of POMD Tokens
<p>POMD tokens fuel the play-to-earn mechanics, allowing players to engage with the game and reap the rewards. Currently, the POMD token is valued at just $0.008 as it is in Phase One of its presale. However, millions of tokens have been sold already, so demand is high. In fact, some experts even foresee a 20x surge for it before its presale concludes.</p>
<p>Considering its low market cap of $14M and ties to an online game industry with 3B players, Pomerdoge could see the same growth as Ethereum did. If you wish to purchase this token and participate in weekly giveaways totaling $150,000 - sign up below. </p>
