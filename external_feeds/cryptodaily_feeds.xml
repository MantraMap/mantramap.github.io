			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Meme coins have experienced an unprecedented rise in interest and value. With exuberant community support, meme coins are largely associated with meme images, cartoon characters, and animals. Dogecoin, SHIBA INU, and the recent Pepecoin ($PEPE) are a few of the top-selling meme coins in the crypto space. These coins have gained thousands in price surges in the shortest period. Offering investors ample opportunities to make significant profits based on a small investment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trending meme coin, $PEPE, barely a month after its release, reached a whopping $1.5 billion in market cap. And a Spot Trading volume exceeding $2.7 billion. This value, according to various reports, rivaled Bitcoin&rsquo;s Spot Trading on the top crypto exchanges within the same timeframe. A testament to these coins&rsquo; ability to generate gargantuan returns for investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>$PEPE&rsquo;s initial price at the time of launch was a mere $0.000000001 and with a total token supply of over 420 trillion. Since listing on top exchanges, the meme coin experienced a price surge of over 3000%. While it has suffered countless sell-offs from early investors looking to make huge profits, Pepecoin is still ranked as one of the top 100 coins (number 78) based on market cap, per CoinMarketCap. Again, substantial proof of its unprompted leap in price in the shortest time possible.&nbsp;</p>
The Role of Exchanges and How Early Listing Impact Investors&rsquo; Returns&nbsp;
<p>Crypto exchanges enable the seamless purchase of Bitcoin, altcoins, and meme coins alike. They are committed to providing customers with the hottest coins on the market, allowing them to become early investors. Now, why crypto exchanges are core components of the industry, obviously, their effect on the market continues to grow daily, partly a work of meme coins. How?&nbsp;</p>
<p>These crypto exchanges understand the influence meme coins have on the market and investors. Hence why they are constantly on the lookout for the next hot project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better understand the impact of early listing and how these exchanges actively influence investors&rsquo; returns, we&rsquo;ll use $PEPE and LBank, and other exchanges as examples.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Via LBank&rsquo;s Articles Section, the global crypto exchange announced its decision to list the newly launched meme coin, $PEPE on its platform. Per the source above, the listing was scheduled for April 18, 2023, at 8 AM (UTC). LBank claimed the meme coin was a feasible, high-quality coin for its users. 12 days later, OKX Exchange announced its decision to list $PEPE. The result? An 850% surge in price. LBank users enjoyed a whopping 850% increase in their investment. Bitget Exchange also listed $PEPE the same day as LBank and since then (until the time of writing) has raked in returns exceeding a 5346% increase in price for investors. Substantial proof of early listing&rsquo;s impact on investments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides $PEPE, the listing of emerging meme coins like $PSYOP, $GEN, $SPONGE, $AIDOGE, $BEN, and $RFD further shows the role exchanges play in price surges. According to available market data, LBank, MEXC, and HUOBI are at the forefront of early token listings. For the previously mentioned emerging meme coins, LBank was the first to list 5 out of the 6 tokens&mdash;$BEN, $PSYOP, $RFD, $GEN, and $SPONGE. With MEXC Exchange listing $AIDOGE first and HUOBI following behind. In line with this data, LBank also recorded the highest gains for these meme coins, except for $AIDOGE and $BEN where MEXC recorded the highest gains.&nbsp;</p>
LBank Exchange:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>$PEPE; 6387%&nbsp;</li>
<li>$AIDOGE; 19364%&nbsp;</li>
<li>$BEN; 313%&nbsp;</li>
<li>$PSYOP; 433%&nbsp;</li>
<li>$RFD; 216%&nbsp;</li>
<li>$SPONGE; 296%&nbsp;</li>
<li>$GEN; 716%&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
MEXC Exchange&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>$PEPE; 2259%&nbsp;</li>
<li>$AIDOGE; 70429%&nbsp;</li>
<li>$BEN; 353%&nbsp;</li>
<li>$PSYOP; 0%&nbsp;</li>
<li>$RFD; 138%&nbsp;</li>
<li>$SPONGE; 0%&nbsp;</li>
<li>$GEN; None&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>HUOBI and Gate.io recorded impressive gains&mdash;2710% and 2324%, respectively&mdash;for $PEPE. However, listing a day after LBank and Bitget cost their users over 2300% value increases on their investments.</p>
How Meme Coins are Driving Unconventional Innovation&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>As these crypto exchanges compete against themselves by constantly searching for potentially hot coins, one thing stands out&mdash;their willingness to openly embrace unconventional projects. By actively seeking out new projects to list, crypto exchanges show their commitment to supporting peculiar projects. Although meme coins are loosely based on famous memes, animals, or characters, they have become an avenue for experimentation in the web3 space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meme coins are continually pushing the boundaries of conventional investments and attracting a diverse audience. Comprising a community of exuberant individuals committed to contributing to the growth of a project. By fervently seeking the next big meme coin, exchanges are encouraging developers to keep experimenting and launching unique projects. Additionally, the rise of these meme coins is proof of the impact of the internet and meme culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Memes have become a huge part of the internet and social media experience. And by listing meme-based coins, exchanges are tapping into a potentially replete environment with millions of global supporters waiting to be onboarded. Speaking about these meme coins and how they're opening doors for mass adoption, Johnasson Chen, co-founder of LBank reiterates that the pursuit of meme coins contributes to the resilience and diversity of the emerging web3 ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Staying on top of the market for memes is crucial to delivering top-notch investments to our users as early as possible. The pursuit of meme coins also contributes to the overall diversity and resilience of the Web3 ecosystem. The inclusion of such coins alongside more established cryptocurrencies fosters a healthy balance between established projects and innovative newcomers, allowing for a continuous cycle of disruption and growth,&rdquo; the co-founder said.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Terra founder Do Kwon has been released on bail after a Montenegrin court handling his passport forgery case accepted his 400,000-euro request. </p>
<p>According to an announcement, a Montenegro High Court granted Do Kwon bail after accepting his 400,000-euro request. The decision comes after a previous approval was overturned on May 25. &nbsp;</p>
<p>An official release from the Basic Court in Podgorica stated that an appeal against an earlier bail agreement by the State Prosecutor&rsquo;s Office was set aside. The decision means that Kwon and his fellow accused, Han Chang-Joon, can await further legal proceedings under house arrest in Montenegro.</p>
<p>The value of their property has complicated the decisions regarding the defendant&rsquo;s bail request. During the initial bail hearing on May 11, Kwon and Chang-Joon told the court that they had &ldquo;property worth millions.&rdquo; A High Court, however, disputed the value, and their bail was revoked. The High Court argued that the lower court could not accept the property&rsquo;s value &ldquo;based on their statements, but only concrete evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The value of the property has been verified after evaluation using a sales contract, bank account statements, and invoices.</p>
<p>The Court said:</p>

<p>The court appreciated the fact that they are persons who are not Montenegrin citizens, which is why it accepted their statements about the value of the property they own, which were supported by concrete evidence.</p>

<p>It concluded by saying:</p>

<p>The possibility of losing the security deposit in the amount of EUR 400,000.00 each had a sufficiently discouraging effect on the defendants to dissuade them from any desire to escape.</p>

Kwon and Chang-Joon Arrested in Montenegro
<p>The pair were arrested at an airport in the capital of Podgorica on March 23 as they tried to board a flight to Dubai using falsified travel documents. Kwon and Chang-Joon were charged with forging official documents.</p>
<p>Shortly after their arrest, the United States and South Korean authorities announced that they were seeking the extradition of Kwon. US federal prosecutors indicted Kwon with two counts each of securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud, and conspiracy.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Fresh on the heels of the latest SEC enforcement actions on Binance and Coinbase the crypto market is seeing a healthy bounce.</p>
The grand plan
<p>This must have been thought out a while ago. First sue Binance, and before the dust even settles, sue Coinbase. It hasn&rsquo;t happened yet, but it really wouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise if the SEC served Tether with a Wells Notice in the near future.</p>
<p>All planned to sow fear and distrust among retail investors and scare them out of the crypto market. Of course, cutting off the banks that do business with crypto, getting the main market makers to back off from the sector, and embroiling the big exchanges in expensive litigation are also part of the Operation Choke Point plan.</p>
Crypto market rebounds
<p>With all of this as a backdrop, the crypto market has the audacity to start rebounding after yesterday&rsquo;s Binance news and today&rsquo;s similar news for Coinbase.</p>
<p>Of course, when the Binance news dropped yesterday it came out of the blue and the crypto market did take a hammering. Bitcoin fell fairly precipitously 6.4% on the day, going as low as just under $25,400, from $27,100 at the previous day&rsquo;s close.</p>
<p>However, even amid today&rsquo;s fresh news of the SEC going after Coinbase, bitcoin has staged a recovery and is up 3.6% so far at time of going to press. Part of the reason for this is that technically, the charts were pointing to a new upsurge for Bitcoin, and the bad news has just caused a blip.</p>
<p>All the short term time frame Stochastic RSIs have reset at the bottom, and even the daily and the weekly RSIs are on their way down as well. When these all cross up from the bottom the momentum is going to be difficult to stop.</p>
Strong fundamental cryptos are surging
<p>The same story is also being played out for many of the more fundamentally sound crypto projects. Ethereum has rebounded 4.4% since yesterday&rsquo;s low point, making back two thirds of the losses so far.</p>
<p>Hot crypto projects such as decentralised exchange Injective Protocol ($INJ), and decentralised GPU-based rendering solution Render ($RNDR) are both coming back fast, making 4.8% and 5.7% respectively so far today.</p>
Joke coin has its day
<p>Even meme coin Pepe ($PEPE) has made a move like Lazarus from the dead, increasing 26% from yesterday&rsquo;s low.</p>
Let battle commence
<p>The crypto market is rebounding because it was in the charts. Be that as it may, stand by for more anti-crypto action from the US government and its financial enforcement agencies. The war has only just begun.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>According to reports from Elliptic, funds drained from the Atomic Wallet hack have been sent to Sinbad, a crypto mixer used by the Lazarus Group. </p>
<p>According to reports by crypto tracing firm Elliptic Enterprises, the funds drained from the hack on the Atomic Wallet on June 3 have been sent to a crypto mixer used by the Lazarus Group, a notorious North Korean hacking operation.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The $35 million stolen from @AtomicWallet users is being laundered through Sinbad - the mixer fka(?) Blender and used heavily by NK's Lazarus Grouphttps://t.co/UHCwfZiw8e</p>
&mdash; Elliptic Investigations (@Elliptic_Inv) June 5, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>Elliptic reported that its Investigation Team traced funds from the $35 million hack to Sinbad.io, a cryptocurrency mixer used by the hacking group.</p>

<p>Elliptic&rsquo;s Investigations Team is also following the transaction trail, and has determined that the stolen funds are being swapped for bitcoin, before being laundered through Sinbad.io - a mixer. Previous Elliptic&nbsp;research&nbsp;revealed that Sinbad has been used intensively to launder over $100 million in proceeds of hacks perpetrated by North Korea&rsquo;s Lazarus Group.</p>
<p>This includes assets from the $540 million Axie Infinity hack and $100 million Horizon Bridge attack.</p>

Atomic Wallet Users Drained of Over $35 Million
<p>On June 3, the self-custodial, decentralised Atomic Wallet received reports that several wallets had been drained of their funds. The project confirmed the compromise on June 4 and said it would investigate the matter. &nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We have received reports of wallets being compromised. We are doing all we can to investigate and analyse the situation. As we have more information, we will share it accordingly.For any questions and concerns, contact support@atomicwallet.io</p>
&mdash; Atomic - Crypto Wallet (@AtomicWallet) June 3, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>Atomic said on June 5 that less than 1% of its monthly active users were compromised in the attack, adding that it continues to investigate.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">At the moment less than 1% of our monthly active users have been affected/reported. Last drained transaction was confirmed over 40h ago.Security investigation is ongoing. We report victim addresses to major exchanges &amp; blockchain analytics to trace and block the stolen funds.</p>

</p>
Blender.io Relaunches As Sinbad.io
<p>Earlier reports indicated North Korean hackers had been using a new mixing service to launder stolen cryptocurrencies. Elliptic found that the crypto mixing service used by the Lazarus Group, Blender, is likely to have been re-launched as Sinbad.</p>
<p>Following a series of high-profile hacks, the United States Treasury&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions against Blender and Tornado Cash for helping Lazarus launder close to $500 million in illicitly obtained cryptocurrencies. After the US imposed sanctions against the mixing services, Tornado Cash continued to operate while Blender ceased its operations and disappeared after reportedly taking $22 million in Bitcoin from the mixer.</p>
<p>According to Elliptic, Blender likely started operating the new service called Sinbad, which Lazarus used to launder illicit funds in October 2022.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Optimism, the Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution, is preparing to roll out its "Bedrock" upgrade today, June 6th.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The step is considered to be a significant leap towards becoming a utility-oriented "Superchain" featuring reduced gas fees and significantly faster transaction finality and block rendering. The Ethereum-based protocol's vision of its technological progress towards becoming a Superchain, which is to say an interconnected network of interoperable and highly composable blockchains, is getting nearer through these planned enhancements.</p>
Optimism Bedrock Update
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Bedrock update is expected to go live by 16:00 UTC today via Optimism's mainnet.&ldquo;Bedrock was named Bedrock for a reason. It is the foundation for the Superchain," shares Karl Floersch.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Floersch currently serves as CEO and and is co-founder at OP Labs, the development organization behind Optimism and its suite of blockchain products.The move is considered an instrumental point towards the transformation of Optimism.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">With the upgrade, all associated and integrated chains either constructed within or designed in alignment with the OP tech stack (developer tooling, APIs, and SDKs) will be linked over, enabling smooth communication over a unified ecosystem. Floersche emphasizes further that the "Superchain" status isn't a mere moniker, it is, in essence, a long-term vision towards producing an industry standard with the OP Stack as a baseline. Among the key features outlined in anticipation of the upgrade is a 40% reduction in gas fees through an optimized data compression strategy. This means that Bedrock is set to introduce internal mechanisms that will curtail the reliance towards block reorganization, which costs a significant amount of resources on the side of a Layer 2 chain such as Optimism. Block-based reorganizations (reorgs) are instances in which a blockchain simultaneously produces two blocks, hence generating a duplicate blockchain. The code changes set out in Bedrock will effectively cut down confirmation intervals for deposits to approximately 60 seconds, down from the average interval of 600 seconds for the same typical transaction.</p>
Key Enhancements To Expect On Optimism Bedrock Update
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Another well-intentioned upgrade that comes with the Bedrock update is slew of enhancements to proof of modularity in the OP Stack. This open-source toolkit provides developers with functionalities for providing customizable environments on the Optimism blockchain, opening constructs and experiences for users who wish to leverage validity proofs and fault proofs within the OP Stack. Alongside the transaction upgrades, this feature set wil provide a performance boost for node-related functions across the Optimism ecosystem. Another significant advancement Bedrock brings to the table is facilitating Optimism's transition to a multi-client ecosystem. Floersch claims that Optimism will be the first layer 2 protocol to boast multiple clients, thereby enhancing system resilience by eliminating potential single points of failure. Client software is utilized to operate the blockchain, with layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum relying on several clients to ensure network security.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The upgrade process is expected to last between two to four hours. During this period, deposits and withdrawals will be temporarily suspended, and the chain will be momentarily paused.</p>
What is Optimism?
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Optimism functions as a scaling solution for Ethereum, allowing users to carry out transactions on the blockchain at a lower cost while retaining the underlying security of Ethereum. It utilizes a technology called an &ldquo;optimistic rollup,&rdquo; which consolidates multiple transactions into a single transaction, consequently accelerating transaction speed and reducing gas fees.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The layer 2 landscape atop Ethereum has witnessed stiff competition in recent months. L2Beat statistics indicate that Optimism's closest rival, Arbitrum, leads the pack with a total value locked (TVL) of $5.69 billion, with Optimism trailing with a TVL of $1.68 billion. The Bedrock upgrade, however, is expected to boost Optimism's competitiveness.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Alternative solutions to optimistic rollups, like ZK Rollups, have also been gaining traction. Polygon and Matter Labs recently introduced their zkEVMs, a type of ZK Rollup compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, providing users with more choices for faster, cheaper transactions on Ethereum.</p>

L2Beat statistics indicate that Optimism's closest rival, Arbitrum, leads the pack with a total value locked (TVL) of $5.69 billion, with Optimism trailing with a TVL of $1.68 billion. The Bedrock upgrade, however, is expected to boost Optimism's competitiveness.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Alternative solutions to optimistic rollups, like ZK Rollups, have also been gaining traction. Polygon and Matter Labs recently introduced their zkEVMs, a type of ZK Rollup compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, providing users with more choices for faster, cheaper transactions on Ethereum.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In a shocking development, the SEC filed suit against crypto exchange Coinbase on Tuesday, alleging it acted as an unregistered broker and exchange. </p>
<p>On Tuesday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in its relentless pursuit of the crypto industry, sued crypto exchange Coinbase in a New York federal court. The agency alleges the exchange acted as an unregistered broker and exchange and is demanding that the firm be &ldquo;permanently restrained and enjoined&rdquo; from further doing so.</p>
<p>The complaint comes less than a day after the agency sued Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao.</p>
SEC: Coinbase Is an Unregistered Exchange, Broker, and Clearing Agency
<p>In a press release, the securities regulator said Coinbase acted as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency and charged it for &ldquo;the unregistered offer and sale of securities in connection with its staking-as-a-service program.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC details:</p>

<p>Since 2019, Coinbase has been engaging in an unregistered securities offering through its staking-as-a-service program, which allows customers to earn profits from the &ldquo;proof of stake&rdquo; mechanisms of certain blockchains and Coinbase&rsquo;s efforts.</p>

<p>Through its unregistered services, the agency said Coinbase allegedly:</p>

<p>Provides a marketplace and brings together the orders for securities of multiple buyers and sellers using established, non-discretionary methods under which such orders interact.</p>

<p>Further, it states that Coinbase:</p>

<p>Engages in the business of effecting securities transactions for the accounts of Coinbase customers.</p>

<p>Finally, the SEC alleges that Coinbase:</p>

<p>Provides facilities for comparison of data respecting the terms of settlement of crypto asset securities transactions, serves as an intermediary in settling transactions in crypto asset securities by Coinbase customers, and acts as a securities depository.</p>

<p>The regulator further deems at least 13 crypto assets available to Coinbase users as &ldquo;crypto asset securities&rdquo;.</p>
Gensler and Grewal Comment
<p>Chairman of the SEC, Gary Gensler, took to Twitter to share the news.</p>
<p>Gensler commented:</p>

<p>Coinbase&rsquo;s alleged failures deprive investors of critical protections, including rulebooks that prevent fraud and manipulation, proper disclosure, safeguards against conflicts of interest, and routine inspection by the SEC.</p>

<p>Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement, Gurbir S. Grewal, had this to say:</p>

<p>You simply can&rsquo;t ignore the rules because you don&rsquo;t like them or because you&rsquo;d prefer different ones: the consequences for the investing public are far too great.</p>
<p>As alleged in our complaint, Coinbase was fully aware of the applicability of the federal securities laws to its business activities, but deliberately refused to follow them. While Coinbase&rsquo;s calculated decisions may have allowed it to earn billions, it&rsquo;s done so at the expense of investors by depriving them of the protections to which they are entitled.&nbsp;Today&rsquo;s action seeks to hold Coinbase accountable for its choices.</p>

The SEC Appears to be Out for Blood
<p>The crypto market has been in free fall since news broke that the agency filed suit against crypto exchange Binance and its founder and CEO, Changpeng Zhao. The agency accused Binance of mishandling funds and lying to investors and regulators about its operations.</p>
<p>Binance responded by denying the claims.</p>
<p>Coinbase has been under the radar amid the SEC&rsquo;s broader crackdown on unregistered securities.</p>
<p>After the SEC and crypto exchange Kraken reached a settlement earlier in the year where the company agreed to shutter its staking program, Coinbase said they would defend the agency&rsquo;s classification of staking as a security. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Coinbase executives claim that staking cannot be classified as a security under the US Securities Act or the Howey Test.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Unigrid, a pioneering force in the development of a decentralized and anonymous Internet, is excited to announce a significant milestone, a new strategic partnership, and an ambitious market positioning. Unigrid has recently secured a $25 million investment commitment from GEM Digital Limited. Additionally, Unigrid has partnered with WeSendit, the world's first file transfer service specializing in anonymous data transfer and decentralized storage solutions.</p>
<p>Unigrid is poised to become a formidable European alternative to dominant providers such as Amazon AWS and Google Cloud. Unigrid's CTO, Adam Waldenberg, emphasizes the transformative power of blockchain technology in guaranteeing the permanence of information, thereby fundamentally reshaping the cloud industry. Businesses will be able to leverage Unigrid to deliver and store data at significantly lower costs compared to traditional cloud providers like Amazon AWS, resulting in substantial savings.</p>
<p>Unigrid's innovation stems from the underutilized storage capacities found in numerous European data centers. By harnessing their blockchain node technology, Unigrid taps into this vast reservoir, which was previously seen as almost inexhaustible. Their intelligent blockchain application ensures secure data encryption and organization. Unigrid's groundbreaking "plug-and-switch" approach allows businesses to effortlessly monetize their available storage capacity, particularly during non-peak hours. This approach not only optimizes the use of idle server capacity but also provides an additional revenue stream for businesses. Customers benefit from cost-effective cloud services, and Unigrid envisions significant growth opportunities ahead. Even with a modest 0.1% market share in the global cloud business, CEO Evan Green envisions a turnover potential in the hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>The substantial commitment from GEM Digital Limited is a testament to Unigrid's potential and the unwavering dedication of its team. It also signifies a strong vote of confidence from a group with a profound understanding of the digital asset space and a global reach.</p>
<p>Unigrid's partnership with WeSendit marks a significant stride in its mission to revolutionize the Internet. WeSendit has been offering its file transfer service since 2014 and has since convinced more than 3 million customers, including global brands such as Nike, Facebook, Dreamworks, and Red Bull. The new platform WeSendit 3.0 and its central component, the $WSI token, mark the company&rsquo;s transition from Web2 to Web3. WeSendit&rsquo;s interdisciplinary team is developing a new generation of decentralized data processing tools that will encourage users to explore the benefits of the decentralized Internet. WeSendit's decision to leverage Unigrid's decentralized storage offering for its Web3 storage solution underscores the transformative power of Unigrid's technology.</p>
<p>This commitment ensures a broad market launch for Unigrid this year, propelling its growth and market development. Unigrid remains open to additional seed commitments and private sales, with strategic guidance and expertise provided by Valuex AG, renowned specialists in strategy and blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Unigrid is at the forefront of the next Internet revolution, providing a truly decentralized global network that is free from geographical limitations and centralized control. Unigrid's innovative solution is a game-changer in the cloud infrastructure landscape, offering a network that is completely anonymous and resistant to attacks.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Prominent stablecoin issuer Circle announced that they would launch USDC natively on top of Arbitrum starting on June 8, 2023, and they will be replacing the abridged version of the stablecoin. A competing project, Tradecurve, will allow users the ability to create AI-powered trading bots with the ability to optimize the performance of their portfolios, leading to better efficiency.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Circle to launch USDC Stablecoin on top of Arbitrum</p>
<p>"USDC issued by Circle will be native to Arbitrum and will be considered the official version of USDC for the Arbitrum ecosystem. Over time, native USDC liquidity will grow and replace the currently circulating 'bridged USDC' liquidity that comes from Ethereum." announced Circle in their statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arbitrum will be renaming the Ethereum-bridged version of USDC on block explorers, and it will now be known as USDC.e. The firm also announced that there would be an outreach to ecosystem applications that will make the same change within their in-application user interfaces and other documentation.</p>
<p>Moreover, Circle noted numerous benefits of the native USDC launch on Arbitrum, such as the upcoming support by the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), which will eliminate bridge withdrawal delays. There will be an upgradable smart contract for any future improvements by the company and the possibility for institutional on and off-ramps, with other perks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Anyone Can Access AI Trading Bots to Optimize Their Portfolio with Tradecurve</p>
<p>Circle isn't the only firm that is innovating with the launch of USDC on top of Arbitrum, and competing projects like Tradecurve are also implementing new ideas and innovations that can change DeFi for traders and investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Tradecurve ecosystem is powered by the TCRV utility token and offers users access to features like automated trading and artificial intelligence. Users can access hundreds of algorithmic and AI trading systems through which they can enhance and optimize the performance of their portfolio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Alongside that, traders are able to build their own communities, and members can automatically copy their trades through a subscription model. Tradecurve's team will implement Proof of Reserves (PoR) to bolster transparency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's also high leverage starting at 500:1, a VIP account service, a dedicated Trading Academy, and negative balance protection. Users are not required to complete KYC, making it a truly borderless platform accessible from anywhere.</p>
<p>TCRV is now at Stage 3 of its presale, where one token is worth $0.015. A total of 23,637,981 TCRV tokens have already been sold, and its next price increase will be by 20% at $0.018 at Stage 4. Analysts predict that the price of TCRV can climb by 100x at launch, especially as it will get listed on Tier-1 exchanges and on Uniswap&rsquo;s DEX.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Russia&rsquo;s Rosbank, one of the most important banks in the country, has announced the launch of a crypto payments solution to facilitate cross-border settlements.</p>
<p>Rosbank has been conducting a pilot for transactions using cryptocurrencies despite being sanctioned by the United States Treasury Department.</p>
Rosbank Makes Its Foray Into Crypto
<p>According to a representative from Rosbank, the financial institution is now conducting pilot transactions with private and corporate clients. According to Rosbank, the service is the first of its kind in the sector and is compliant with all Russian legislation and the requirements of the Central Bank of Russia (CBR). While the Central Bank of Russia has steadfastly opposed the free circulation of cryptocurrencies within the country, it is far more welcoming to allowing their use in cross-border transactions. However, the central bank has stated that they must be carried out outside of the Russian financial infrastructure.</p>
<p>The move comes after Rosbank&rsquo;s owner, Vladimir Olegovich Potanin, stated that tokenized assets and a central bank digital currency (CBDC) could play a critical role in driving the country&rsquo;s digital economy.</p>
Russia&rsquo;s Stance On Crypto
<p>Russia&rsquo;s law on digital financial assets prohibits residents in Russia from accepting digital currencies as payments for goods and services. However, lawmakers in the State Duma are weighing their options and considering specific amendments. These amendments would allow the expansion of the legal framework and include cryptocurrencies, legalizing crypto transactions under an &ldquo;experimental legal regime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, with Russia under severe pressure thanks to unprecedented Western sanctions following the invasion of Ukraine, the government and businesses in the country have been looking at ways to circumvent the sanctions. One of the options includes increasing the use of cryptocurrencies and national currencies. Officials in Moscow have admitted to several companies using crypto to complete cross-border payments despite a lack of regulation. President Vladimir Putin has also suggested that Russia could become a Bitcoin mining hub. The Russian government also curtailed plans to create a state-run cryptocurrency exchange, opting instead for the regulation of private operators.</p>
Partnership With B-Crypto
<p>Rosbank has entered into a partnership with B-crypto to support the new service. B-crypto specializes in processing cross-border transactions and settlements using digital currencies. Whenever a company initiates a cross-border transaction using cryptocurrency, the payment made in crypto to the foreign counterpart must be reflected in the contract. Furthermore, the invoice issued by the supplier must also indicate a wallet address and the amount of crypto that has been sent. Under the partnership, Rosbank will accept fiat deposits, while B-crypto will be responsible for processing the payment and crypto conversion.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia&rsquo;s Rosbank, one of the most important banks in the country, has announced the launch of a crypto payments solution to facilitate cross-border settlements.</p>
<p>Rosbank has been conducting a pilot for transactions using cryptocurrencies despite being sanctioned by the United States Treasury Department.</p>
Rosbank Makes Its Foray Into Crypto
<p>According to a representative from Rosbank, the financial institution is now conducting pilot transactions with private and corporate clients. According to Rosbank, the service is the first of its kind in the sector and is compliant with all Russian legislation and the requirements of the Central Bank of Russia (CBR). While the Central Bank of Russia has steadfastly opposed the free circulation of cryptocurrencies within the country, it is far more welcoming to allowing their use in cross-border transactions. However, the central bank has stated that they must be carried out outside of the Russian financial infrastructure.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto spot and derivatives exchange Bybit has reinforced its Middle Eastern credentials by inking a memorandum of understanding with the American University of Sharjah (AUS). The agreement with the United Arab Emirates seat of learning will support a scholarship in which Bybit is to contribute AED 1 million (US$272,000).</p>
<p>The AUS collaboration with Bybit is the first of its kind and a further demonstration to the world that the United Arab Emirates is open for crypto business. The scholarship fund provided by Bybit will support the education of 20 students at the university as they carve out careers in fintech and blockchain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bybit Digs Deep to Further Crypto Education</p>
<p>The agreement enacted between Bybit and the AUS will enable blockchain students to rapidly get up and running; there are plans for the first scholarship grants to be disbursed this fall when the academic year starts. Computer science and computer engineering students who apply and are deemed eligible will have their tuition fees paid by the Bybit Scholarship.</p>
<p>In addition to the AED 1 million scholarship fund, Bybit has pledged an additional AED 100,000 to sponsor a hackathon at the American University of Sharjah. This will be open to the local blockchain community, providing a testbed for innovative ideas to flourish and giving developers a chance to demonstrate not only their coding skills, but all their out-the-box thinking.</p>
<p>Hackathons have proven a successful means of incubating crypto startups and giving developers a leg up on their blockchain journey. Over the years, numerous successful DeFi projects have been spun out of hackathons, where the best ideas can sometimes receive additional funding to turn a proof of concept into a working prototype. The maiden AUS-Bybit Inter-College Hackathon will take place at the AUS College of Engineering during the 2023-2024 academic year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Younger generations hold the key in driving the blockchain revolution forward,&rdquo; said Bybit CEO Ben Zhou. &ldquo;We are pleased to create the Bybit Scholarship at AUS to help their talented students future-proof their knowledge and skills. We thank AUS for the opportunities to raise crypto awareness and share first-hand knowledge of the industry with students from one of the most prestigious universities in the region. I look forward to being inspired by the future engineers, blockchain scientists, and Web3 startup founders.&rdquo;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Crypto&rsquo;s Big Hitters Eye the Middle East&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bybit&rsquo;s decision to support the initiative in the UAE arrives at a time when investment is pouring into the Middle East from a number of crypto exchanges intent on establishing a regional presence. While some have been attracted by the massive demand for digital assets across the region, others have been swayed by the hostile regulatory landscape elsewhere, particularly in the US.</p>
<p>In April, Bybit opened its new headquarters in Dubai, the Middle Eastern stronghold for an increasing number of crypto companies. The city&rsquo;s business-friendly credentials, world-class amenities, and excellent travel links have made it a favorite with crypto firms seeking a stable base of operations. The new Bybit HQ occupies an entire floor of One Central in the prestigious Dubai World Trade Center.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With no thought for the industry or for retail investors Gary Gensler has bombed the crypto market with the suing of Binance.</p>
Gensler&rsquo;s plan
<p>If there was ever the slightest doubt over SEC Chairman Gensler&rsquo;s strategy towards the cryptocurrency sector, there can now be none. The SEC, with its main mandate to protect retail investors, has dropped another bomb on crypto and sent the market into a tailspin.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear, if Binance has done anything that warrants sanctions and penalties, then there would be a due process for the SEC to make its case. However, it appears that the SEC is tarring the entire crypto industry with the same brush and would bring it to its knees in order to apply the letter of the securities law, or at least the securities law as Gensler sees it.</p>
<p>It would appear that Gensler&rsquo;s ultimate goal is to force all retail investors out of crypto and back to the embrace of the banking system. He would do this by choking off all on/off ramps to the exchanges, and by entangling all the exchanges in costly litigation.</p>
<p>The SEC has gone for the jugular by choosing to first attack some of the exchanges working towards full compliance in Coinbase, Kraken, Paxos, and now Binance. Is it the fault of any crypto project that they cannot approach the SEC in order to register, given that even SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce says that this process is almost impossible?</p>
Why the SEC is attacking crypto
<p>It needs to be absolutely clear that what is happening today with the US government, and its enforcement agencies, is that they are systematically attempting to put the entire crypto industry out of business.</p>
<p>Why would this be the case?</p>
<p>An industry that is for the people, in that it wants to provide innovation and wealth-making means that will enable everyone to be able to be their own bank and make financial decisions that are outside of the system, is seen as a threat to the system itself.</p>
<p>Banks have become monstrous entities that seem to have more power than governments now. They have become obsolete and no longer serve the people. Governments are printing more and more fiat currency which is borne by the people in the form of inflation, and reduced purchasing power.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A system such as this can do without a competitor right now. Banks are failing and the Federal Reserve just backs them with currency printed out of thin air. Interest rates are high, unemployment is rising, and prices are going through the roof.</p>
<p>Bitcoin and various strands of the cryptocurrency sector are building another system that each individual can be part of. When the monetary system as we know it comes tumbling down, things are going to be bad beyond imagining. However, with Bitcoin and crypto a new and fairer world can exist.&nbsp;</p>
An all-important stand
<p>It is up to the few to make a stand and resist the likes of Gensler. He talks of everything being a security and has stated that he would like to see a middle man between every crypto project and their customers. He has even resorted to applying enforcement actions against developers of DeFi projects because he can&rsquo;t get at the project itself.</p>
<p>The fight today between the government, the banks, global financial agencies, and the enforcement agencies on the one side, and the crypto industry on the other, will deeply affect the lives of our children tomorrow. Let us hope that the few will prevail for the benefit of the many.</p>

Together, they have developed a cutting-edge fee-boosting model that enhances Annual Percentage Rates (APRs), allowing liquidity providers (LPs) to maximize their earnings within the ThunderCore ecosystem. This breakthrough mechanism ensures a sustainable circulation of liquidity, benefitting both ThunderCore and SushiSwap ecosystems.</p>
<p class="s6">Meanwhile, ThunderCore is proud to pioneer the launch of V3 farming in SushiSwap, cementing its position as one of the first chains to implement this groundbreaking feature. Leveraging ThunderCore's low gas fees, the platform is set to attract a diverse range of users eager to participate in liquidity provision. This strategic collaboration between ThunderCore and SushiSwap signifies a paradigm shift in the DeFi landscape, ushering in a new era of collaboration, scalability, and user-centric approaches.</p>
<p class="s6">This partnership will bring a suite of innovative Sushi products to ThunderCore, including:</p>
â Sushi v3 AMM: Sushi&rsquo;s framework for spinning up and interacting with pools of different types with varying fee tiers as well.
&nbsp;
â SushiXSwap: Sushi's cross-chain swap tool for quick, trustless swaps between supported chains.
&nbsp;
â Onsen: Onsen farms are Sushi&rsquo;s &ldquo;double reward&rdquo; farms that are for either new projects seeking liquidity or for established projects that Sushi is working with closely; these pools payout in two assets instead of one.
&nbsp;
â Furo: Sushi&rsquo;s token-streaming platform built upon BentoBox, which allows for token streaming of any compatible asset to any wallet over any timeframe, along with options to create token vestings and cliffs as well.
&nbsp;
<p class="s11">The Partnership aims to a sustainable DeFi ecosystem</p>
<p>ThunderCore and SushiSwap share the belief that a novel business model is essential for promoting sustainable growth and driving ongoing innovation in the blockchain and DeFi ecosystem.</p>
<p>Consequently, alongside the deployment of the aforementioned products, it can be predicted that both ThunderCore and SushiSwap are actively working on the development of an innovative revenue-sharing mechanism that aims to disrupt the DeFi space.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of how our forthcoming revenue-sharing mechanism will operate:</p>
â ThunderCore and Sushi will use a percentage of fees generated by activity conducted on ThunderCore via SushiSwap.
&nbsp;
â Both parties will allocate and distribute these $TT and $SUSHI as rewards to LPs, thereby boosting APRs for everyone.
&nbsp;
â ThunderCore will also buy back $TT and incentivize the community for a sustainable ecosystem.
<p>Roger Hsu, CEO of ThunderCore, acknowledges the stifling deadlock in the DeFi market and expresses the intention to create inspiration and break free from this state. The partnership with SushiSwap plays a vital role in achieving this goal, as they work towards establishing a sustainable DeFi ecosystem with improved reward mechanics.</p>

<p class="s6">&ldquo;We are excited to launch on the ThunderCore chain and join the ThunderCore ecosystem to help ThunderCore further cement its ranking as a top 5 blockchain in terms of DAUs.&rdquo; said Head Chef Jared Grey.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has approved an amended order of registration, allowing Cboe Clear Digital to clear additional products as a derivatives clearing organization.&nbsp;</p>
Green Signal For Cboe&nbsp;
<p>The announcement means that traders on Cboe Global Markets&rsquo; digital-asset exchange would be able to enter into margined Ether and Bitcoin contracts. The amended order will allow Cboe Clear Digital to offer clearing services for digital asset futures on a margined basis for futures commission merchants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today approved an amended order of registration for Cboe Clear Digital, LLC (Cboe Clear) to clear additional products, subject to the terms and conditions specified in the order, as a derivatives clearing organization (DCO) under the Commodity Exchange Act.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This will be in addition to the fully collateralized futures and fully collateralized swaps that were previously approved.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The amended order permits Cboe Clear to provide clearing services for digital asset futures on a margined basis for futures commission merchants, in addition to the fully collateralized futures and fully collateralized swaps previously authorized.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Previously, Cboe only offered fully collateralized trading of cryptocurrency futures, which required clients to furnish the entire amount of a particular contract before trading. With margined trading, traders can put up less capital when opening a position. Furthermore, the physical settlement of digital assets will enable traditional financial firms to access Bitcoin and Ether futures without handing over custody to intermediaries. Cboe Digital president John Palmer added,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the concept of us also having a spot market has advantages. We didn&rsquo;t want to have to force participants to custody or touch the physical asset.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Prudent Risk-Mitigation Measures&nbsp;
<p>Cboe Clear&rsquo;s parent company, Cboe Digital Exchange, is registered with the Commodities Futures Trading Commission as a designated contract market. This gives Cboe the authority to expand its clearing of futures contracts for crypto assets while ensuring that it does so within the traditional US futures intermediated market structure. Christy Goldsmith Romero, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission president, in a separate statement, added,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Order is accompanied by prudent risk-mitigation measures implemented by Cboe. I have been vocal about the benefits of bringing appropriate crypto activities into the regulated space in order to protect customers, but in a way that supports oversight, accountability, transparency, and risk management.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Romero added that Cboe&rsquo;s application was in stark contrast with another from the now-collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX for a &ldquo;bespoke disintermediated direct-to-customer market structure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too often in recent years, crypto firms have sought to take a business model or market structure that exists in an unregulated environment and port it over to the regulated environment. &ldquo;Cboe has not done that, instead operating within the parameters of the traditional futures market structure and regulatory framework. It has constructively engaged with the staff and my office to address concerns related to risk and implement risk-mitigating measures.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Whether it's crypto, stocks, or forex, the cold hard truth is that most traders lose.</p>
<p>An analysis of eToro trades revealed that nearly 80% of the platform's active users were unprofitable over the course of a year, with a 36.3% median loss. Another study found that 97% of futures traders in Brazil lost money over 300 days. Only 5% of Taiwanese day traders were profitable between 1992 and 2006.</p>
<p>When the stakes are high, human error becomes costly. This is the case with trading, where trader decisions are often tainted with split-second decisions, panic-based actions, and a sunk cost fallacy mentality. This is likely why the stock market is increasingly run by machines and algorithms.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence has proved capable of tackling this challenge, and one company called Walbi has already designed an AI solution to assist crypto traders.</p>
Tapping Into the Power of AI
<p>Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have created tremendous hype around artificial intelligence tools.</p>
<p>The technology has proven effective in tasks thought to be impossible for an algorithm, like content creation and art generation. Now, AI technology is increasingly prolific in the financial industry. While robo-advisor AUM is expected to reach $2.02 trillion by 2027, startups are leveraging AI to enhance crypto trader performance.</p>
<p>AI offers the advantage of processing data much faster than a human. Where a human has to spend hours or days understanding trends and making decisions based on them, an AI can recognize patterns in seconds and offer advice to the trader. It can analyze the market in real-time and catch sudden shifts, fraud, and malicious activity, and even make low-level trading decisions. This allows traders with AI assistance to make quick and confident trading decisions, which in the trading world is incredibly important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Walbi is currently building a crypto trading platform that offers all these benefits, and the project is expected to achieve a significant milestone with the launch of its minimum viable product (MVP) in June 2023.</p>
Walbi's AI-Driven Crypto Trading Solution
<p>Walbi is a next-gen hybrid decentralized finance (DeFi) platform consisting of a crypto exchange, non-custodial Web3 wallet, and AI tool suite to supercharge trader decision-making. The project has multiple flagship solutions that aim to fulfill Walbi&rsquo;s mission to make the blockchain industry simpler and more intuitive for everyone.</p>
<p>The first one is the Walbi Exchange, a crypto exchange offering up to 500 times more leverage for futures traders without a mandatory KYC. Besides managing liquidity, Walbi's AI tools optimize the order book by predicting demand for digital assets and automatically detecting wash trading, spoofing, and other malicious activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides Walbi Exchange, the project will offer:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Walbi Lighthouse: An AI-based trading assistant that does research on behalf of traders and assists them with real-time financial data analysis and personalized trading advice. Lighthouse helps traders make more confident and well-informed decisions while minimizing the risks of human error</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Walbi Earn: Allows users to stake their crypto assets on Walbi to earn interest without any locking periods and with weekly payouts</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Walbi Cloud Miner: A cloud mining solution enabling users to mine BTC without purchasing or operating expensive equipment</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Walbi Wallet: A decentralized, non-custodial Web3 wallet offering users full control over their funds</li>
</ul>
Walbi's Upcoming MVP Launch
<p>Walbi is currently in closed alpha but will soon launch its MVP. This release will expand the project's ecosystem with several features and functions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">WalletConnect integration</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">digital asset deposits and withdrawals</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">margin trading</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">AI-driven trading insights via Walbi Lighthouse</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">the Walbi Waves invite system</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the features listed above, Walbi's roadmap includes numerous future feature releases. During Q3-Q4 2023, the platform plans to launch WalletConnect integration and margin trading, NFTs, Walbi Lighthouse, and token swaps. Walbi Waves and Cloud Mining, Walbi Exchange, Walbi Earn and portfolio tools, and Walbi Wallet will become accessible to platform users throughout 2024.</p>

Crypto Trading, Supercharged
<p>Artificial intelligence models are poised to be an unprecedented improvement to trader performance which has long struggled with unprofitable strategies and approaches.</p>
<p>Walbi is arriving soon and will be one of the first to leverage the power of AI to make trading faster, easier, and safer. With the assistance of AI tools, the project enables crypto traders to make data-driven decisions, potentially increasing their long-term profitability.</p>

This is the case with trading, where trader decisions are often tainted with split-second decisions, panic-based actions, and a sunk cost fallacy mentality. This is likely why the stock market is increasingly run by machines and algorithms.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence has proved capable of tackling this challenge, and one company called Walbi has already designed an AI solution to assist crypto traders.</p>
Tapping Into the Power of AI
<p>Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have created tremendous hype around artificial intelligence tools.</p>
<p>The technology has proven effective in tasks thought to be impossible for an algorithm, like content creation and art generation. Now, AI technology is increasingly prolific in the financial industry. While robo-advisor AUM is expected to reach $2.02 trillion by 2027, startups are leveraging AI to enhance crypto trader performance.</p>
<p>AI offers the advantage of processing data much faster than a human. Where a human has to spend hours or days understanding trends and making decisions based on them, an AI can recognize patterns in seconds and offer advice to the trader. It can analyze the market in real-time and catch sudden shifts, fraud, and malicious activity, and even make low-level trading decisions. This allows traders with AI assistance to make quick and confident trading decisions, which in the trading world is incredibly important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Walbi is currently building a crypto trading platform that offers all these benefits, and the project is expected to achieve a significant milestone with the launch of its minimum viable product (MVP) in June 2023.</p>
Walbi's AI-Driven Crypto Trading Solution
<p>Walbi is a next-gen hybrid decentralized finance (DeFi) platform consisting of a crypto exchange, non-custodial Web3 wallet, and AI tool suite to supercharge trader decision-making. The project has multiple flagship solutions that aim to fulfill Walbi&rsquo;s mission to make the blockchain industry simpler and more intuitive for everyone.</p>
<p>The first one is the Walbi Exchange, a crypto exchange offering up to 500 times more leverage for futures traders without a mandatory KYC. Besides managing liquidity, Walbi's AI tools optimize the order book by predicting demand for digital assets and automatically detecting wash trading, spoofing, and other malicious activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides Walbi Exchange, the project will offer:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Walbi Lighthouse: An AI-based trading assistant that does research on behalf of traders and assists them with real-time financial data analysis and personalized trading advice. Lighthouse helps traders make more confident and well-informed decisions while minimizing the risks of human error</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Walbi Earn: Allows users to stake their crypto assets on Walbi to earn interest without any locking periods and with weekly payouts</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Walbi Cloud Miner: A cloud mining solution enabling users to mine BTC without purchasing or operating expensive equipment</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Walbi Wallet: A decentralized, non-custodial Web3 wallet offering users full control over their funds</li>
</ul>
Walbi's Upcoming MVP Launch
<p>Walbi is currently in closed alpha but will soon launch its MVP. This release will expand the project's ecosystem with several features and functions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">WalletConnect integration</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">digital asset deposits and withdrawals</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">margin trading</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">AI-driven trading insights via Walbi Lighthouse</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">the Walbi Waves invite system</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the features listed above, Walbi's roadmap includes numerous future feature releases. During Q3-Q4 2023, the platform plans to launch WalletConnect integration and margin trading, NFTs, Walbi Lighthouse, and token swaps. Walbi Waves and Cloud Mining, Walbi Exchange, Walbi Earn and portfolio tools, and Walbi Wallet will become accessible to platform users throughout 2024.</p>

Crypto Trading, Supercharged
<p>Artificial intelligence models are poised to be an unprecedented improvement to trader performance which has long struggled with unprofitable strategies and approaches.</p>
<p>Walbi is arriving soon and will be one of the first to leverage the power of AI to make trading faster, easier, and safer. With the assistance of AI tools, the project enables crypto traders to make data-driven decisions, potentially increasing their long-term profitability.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has alleged that popular cryptocurrencies such as Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL) are unregistered securities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The regulator made the allegation in a lawsuit against Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao.&nbsp;</p>
Prominent Cryptocurrencies Classified As Securities&nbsp;
<p>The lawsuit names an extensive list of cryptocurrencies apart from Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL). The three rank among the largest and most prominent cryptocurrencies in the market. The other cryptocurrencies mentioned include Cosmos Hub (ATOM), Filecoin (FIL), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), The Sandbox (SAND), Coti ( COTI), and Axie Infinity (AXS). The lawsuit has also identified the BUSD and BNB stablecoins as securities, further compounding the seriousness of the situation. Furthermore, the SEC lawsuit also alleges that Binance has listed crypto assets that have previously been the subject of enforcement action by the SEC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These include several assets, such as TRX, UST, AMP, and REP. This, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission, indicates a reckless disregard for securities regulations by Binance and its executives. However, the lawsuit does not mention Litecoin (LTC) or Ethereum (ETH). Additionally, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has clarified that the SEC views Bitcoin as a commodity. However, he has suggested that a vast majority of other tokens in the market are securities.&nbsp;</p>
Token Value Tanks&nbsp;
<p>Several tokens saw a considerable drop in price following the news of the SEC lawsuit. Among the hardest hit was Solana, which saw a 6% drop, sliding to $20 in just an hour. Algorand, another asset mentioned as a security in the lawsuit, saw its value drop by 9.9% following the news. SEC Chair Gensler has previously spoken quite positively about the asset. Polygon saw a drop of 7%, while Polkadot dropped by 6.9%, according to data from CoinGecko.&nbsp;</p>
The Lawsuit Against Binance And Zhao&nbsp;
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission unveiled its lawsuit against Binance on Monday. The commission had sued the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchange and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, for alleged violation of several US securities laws. According to the SEC, Binance has been offering its users unregistered securities trading platforms and offering unregistered crypto asset securities sales.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Binance Holdings Ltd. (&ldquo;Binance&rdquo;), which operates the largest crypto asset trading platform in the world, Binance.com; U.S.-based affiliate, BAM Trading Services Inc. (&ldquo;BAM Trading&rdquo;), which, together with Binance, operates the crypto asset trading platform, Binance.US; and their founder, Changpeng Zhao, with a variety of securities law violations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the key charges against Binance involves the company&rsquo;s US operations. According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Binance and BAM Trading, the Binance.US operator, operated as exchanges in the United States of America without registering with the SEC, in addition to being clearing agencies and broker-dealers. According to the SEC, certain cryptocurrencies were offered as securities on Binance&rsquo;s primary international exchange and Binance.US.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Binance and BAM Trading have unlawfully engaged in unregistered offers and sales of crypto asset securities,&rdquo; the lawsuit states. &ldquo;In so doing, they have deprived investors of material information, including the risks and trends that affect the enterprise and an investment in these securities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission also alleged that Binance secretly controlled its US operations, allowing high-value US customers to evade restrictions and divert billions of dollars worth of customer funds. Binance has refuted all allegations made by the SEC.&nbsp;</p>
