<h2>Fed Chair Jerome Powell&#8217;s Debt Default Warning</h2>
<p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has warned of the potential consequences of a U.S. debt default. “We’d be in uncharted territory and the consequences on the U.S. economy could be highly uncertain and adverse,” he <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-03/fed-can-t-protect-us-economy-from-debt-default-powell-says#xj4y7vzkg">said</a> this week, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>No one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the potential short and long-term effects of a failure to pay our bills on time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Powell&#8217;s warning came after the Federal Reserve <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-raises-interest-rate-by-25bps-insists-us-banking-system-is-sound-and-resilient/">increased</a> its key interest rates by 25 basis points this week — its 10th hike in 14 months. The increase takes the Fed Funds Rate to a target range of 5%-5.25%, the highest since August 2007.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve chairman noted that Fed officials discussed the potential risk of the U.S. debt limit during their latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, but the topic did not have an impact on their rate hike decision.</p>
<p>Many people have warned of the dire consequences of a U.S. debt default. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, for example, cautioned that it “would produce an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-warns-us-could-default-on-its-debt-by-june-1/">economic and financial catastrophe</a>.” The president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Christine Lagarde, said it would be a “<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ecb-president-lagarde-warns-of-major-disaster-if-us-defaults-on-debt-obligations/">major disaster</a>” if the U.S. were to default on its debt obligations.</p>

<p>As Democrats and Republicans remain deadlocked over raising the debt ceiling, Yellen revealed this week that the Treasury Department will not be able to pay all of the government’s debt obligations “<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-warns-us-could-default-on-its-debt-by-june-1/">as early as June 1</a>, if Congress does not raise or suspend the debt limit before that time.”</p>
<p>Powell stressed that the Federal Reserve does not get involved in negotiations on this topic, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>We don’t give advice to either aside … We just would just point out that it’s very important that this be done.</p></blockquote>

The news comes amid growing regulatory pressure that is limiting the industry’s access to low-cost energy while increasing its tax burden.</strong></p>
<h2>Miners Face Higher Expenses, More Challenges Under New Legislation</h2>
<p>Kazakhstan’s coffers have received 3.07 billion tenge (almost $6.9 million) in tax payments from entities involved in the minting of digital currencies in 2022, the State Revenue Committee of the Ministry of Finance announced, <a href="https://halyq-uni.kz/ekonomika/19431-2022-zhyly-mainerler-biudzhetke-3-mlrd-tenge-salyk-toledi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quoted</a> by local media and the crypto news outlet Forklog.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency miners in the Central Asian nation are required to pay <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-miners-in-kazakhstan-start-paying-higher-electricity-fees/">taxes and fees</a> since Jan. 1, last year. In 2023, they have already transferred 240 million tenge (almost $540,000) to the budget, by April 27. All due payments for the first quarter must be made by May 25, the finance ministry reminded.</p>
<p>On Feb. 6, this year, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev signed the new <a href="https://online.zakon.kz/Document/?doc_id=33689356&amp;pos=138;-48#pos=138;-48" target="_blank" rel="noopener">law</a> “On Digital Assets in the Republic of Kazakhstan,” some provisions of which are yet to come into force. It regulates crypto-related activities, such as mining, and is accompanied by amendments to the tax code. Most notably, the legislation <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kazakhstan-law-limiting-crypto-miners-consumption-of-electricity-enters-into-force/">restricts</a> miners’ access to cheap electricity after they were blamed for power shortages.</p>
<p>According to Sergey Putra, Senior Coordinator for Governmental Relations at the National Association of Blockchain and Data Centers Industry in Kazakhstan, the adoption of the law demonstrates Kazakhstan’s interest in the development of the crypto industry in general. At the same time, a number of problems, related to other laws or regulations, remain relevant, he noted, commenting for Bitcoin.com News on the effects of the legislative changes for the sector.</p>

<h2>Kazakhstan Crypto Miners Cut Off From Subsidized Electricity</h2>
<p>“Miners in Kazakhstan have been disconnected from local sources of electricity for more than a year, even amid surplus from energy producing companies,” Putra elaborated. “An additional tax for the consumed electricity excludes the possibility for miners to look for sources of electricity at low rates. The fee is differentiated and increases the cost per kilowatt-hour,” explained the representative of the industry organization.</p>
<p>Sergey Putra also pointed out that the law’s implementation through by-laws is “extremely difficult and not in the direction of supporting miners and the crypto industry as a whole.” He expressed hope that these are temporary issues and that their solution would bring a new period of development for bitcoin mining in the country.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan became a crypto mining hotspot when China cracked down on the sector in the spring of 2021. Attracting miners with subsidized electricity, it ranked third in terms of average global monthly hashrate in January of 2022, as per data provided by the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance. However, according to the Norway-based industry analyst Jaran Mellerud, Kazakhstan’s share has since shrank from a peak of 18% in October 2021 to just 4%, as of May 2023.</p>

<h2>‘Credit Tightening’ Mentions on Company Calls Highlight Concerns Over the Stability of the U.S. Banking Industry</h2>
<p>The U.S. economy is struggling with a trifecta of challenges: soaring inflation, steep interest rates, and a banking industry in disarray. Since Silvergate Bank&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/silvergate-bank-announces-voluntary-liquidation-as-crypto-industry-woes-persist/">announcement</a> on March 8, 2023, that it would cease operations and liquidate its assets, the country has witnessed a string of significant bank failures. Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank have all followed suit, marking the second, third, and fourth <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_bank_failures_in_the_United_States">largest bank failures</a> in U.S. history.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/credit-tightening-mentions-earnings-calls-execs-soars-past-2008-levels">report</a> published on May 4, 2023, sheds light on the banking sector&#8217;s ongoing issues. According to the research, executives are increasingly using the term &#8220;credit tightening&#8221; during their earning calls. The report cites Bloomberg data, which reveals that the frequency of &#8220;credit tightening&#8221; mentions on company calls has surpassed the levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis. This trend is alarming for the banking industry, as it suggests that executives are struggling to manage credit risk and maintain profitability.</p>

<p>The banking industry is showing signs of caution, as evidenced by the increasing mentions of &#8220;credit tightening&#8221; on company calls. This trend is concerning, as it often leads to a negative impact on the economy. When banks become more cautious about lending money, it becomes harder for market participants to obtain credit, which can slow down economic growth. In addition to this, the report also notes that news stories alluding to &#8220;credit tightening&#8221; have reached record highs.</p>
<h2>Google Trends Shows an Uptick of Searches Related to ‘Bank Failure,’ ‘Bank Crisis,’ and ‘Credit Tightening’</h2>
<p>On March 19, 2023, Bitcoin.com <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/google-trends-data-reveals-searches-for-banking-crisis-bank-runs-skyrocket/">reported</a> that Google Trends data revealed a trend in search queries related to the banking industry. Searches for terms like &#8220;banking crisis&#8221; and &#8220;bank runs&#8221; had skyrocketed at the time. Current 30-day statistics show that the search query &#8220;<a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%201-m&amp;geo=US&amp;q=bank%20crisis&amp;hl=en">bank crisis</a>&#8221; reached a score of 89 out of 100 on April 6, and a perfect score of 100 on April 18.</p>

<p>By the end of April, the score had dropped to 68 out of 100. Similarly, the search query &#8220;<a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%201-m&amp;geo=US&amp;q=bank%20failure&amp;hl=en">bank failure</a>&#8221; hit a score of 78 on April 26, and a perfect score of 100 on April 28. The topic of the banking crisis has gained significant traction in several states, including Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Nebraska, and Arizona. Meanwhile, the issue of bank failures has piqued the interest of people in Alaska, West Virginia, Delaware, Maine, and Montana.</p>

<p>According to Google Trends, related topics and associated queries include the U.S. government and First Republic Bank. Similar to the report on May 4, another trending search query is &#8220;<a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%201-m&amp;geo=US&amp;q=credit%20tightening&amp;hl=en">credit tightening</a>,&#8221; which reached a perfect score of 100 on April 6, and a score of 62 on April 21. This topic is particularly popular in California, Florida, and New York.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think the surge in &#8220;credit tightening&#8221; mentions on company calls and the increase in search queries related to bank failures and crises mean for the future of the banking industry and the U.S. economy as a whole?

<h2>SEC Not Constrained by Any Doctrine</h2>
<p>John Reed Stark, a former chief of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Office of Internet Enforcement, has said the arguments that Coinbase’s business activities were endorsed by the commission when it approved its initial public offering (IPO) are &#8220;a surefire loser.&#8221; Stark also said the assertion that Coinbase has &#8220;some sort of regulatory safe harbor&#8221; and that the SEC is constrained by some sort of doctrine &#8220;has no basis in law or in fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>The remarks by Stark came just days after Coinbase chose to publicly disclose its response to the Wells notice it received from the SEC back in March. As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-shares-wells-response-challenges-secs-change-in-attitude-towards-its-core-businesses/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, Coinbase made clear its opposition to the SEC’s enforcement actions. Coinbase also implied in its response that the SEC had in fact greenlighted its core business when it allowed the IPO to proceed. The company went public in April, 2021.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some argue that when the SEC approved Coinbase’s IPO, the SEC also approved Coinbase’s business. What a crock and possibly a criminal offense. Yes, you read that correctly &#8212; a criminal offense. Having served as Chief of the SEC Office of Internet Enforcement for 11 years, IMHO,… <a href="https://t.co/aIQXgCRVNb">pic.twitter.com/aIQXgCRVNb</a></p>
<p>&mdash; John Reed Stark (@JohnReedStark) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1653029822606589952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, in his May 1 Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1653029822606589952?s=20">thread</a>, Stark, who worked for eleven years as an SEC chief, assailed the assertion that the commission’s approval of Coinbase’s registration statement amounted to an endorsement of the crypto exchange’s activities. According to Stark, the SEC’s approval of Coinbase’s registration statement was done to ensure the latter had made &#8220;proper disclosures in their application.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>&#8216;No Approval Clause&#8217;</h2>
<p>To further support this argument, Stark pointed to regulations which compel companies seeking to raise funds from the public to insert a &#8220;No Approval Clause&#8221; in their respective prospectuses. The intention of this clause is to inform prospective investors that regulators that include the SEC have neither approved nor disapproved securities being offered.</p>
<p>The former SEC enforcement chief also shared more<a href="https://t.co/yHliU4QuoA"> links</a> which seemingly support the argument that the Commission is not being constrained by some &#8220;sort of regulatory estoppel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Stark also suggested in his tweet that Coinbase’s own Form S1 Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933 proved that the crypto exchange was aware that its business activities had the potential to cause problems. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Finally, Coinbase&#8217;s Form S1 Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933, the form that Coinbase filled out to become a public company and the form that the SEC reviewed, disclosed that there is regulatory uncertainty regarding the status of their activities and that Coinbase could be subject to a litany of civil, criminal, and administrative fines, penalties, orders and actions (which is exactly what is happening right now).</p></blockquote>
<p>Stark ended the long tweet by reiterating that the &#8220;no approval clause&#8221; was a sufficient warning to Coinbase executives who may face potential jail time should the crypto exchange lose its fight against the SEC.</p>

<h2>Cryptoys to Drop Star Wars Digital Collectibles at the End of May</h2>
<p>On May 4, 2023, <a href="https://go.cryptoys.com">Cryptoys</a>, the digital collectible platform crafted by the Miami startup <a href="https://www.onchainstudios.com">Onchain Studios</a>, announced a new line of Star Wars collectible digital toys. The company recently partnered with Disney to bring the latest collection featuring classic Star Wars characters like Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, and Princess Leia. The announcement notes that the digital action figures will be &#8220;paired with powerful weapons&#8221; and come in different rarity levels.</p>

<p>Disney has been exploring the non-fungible token (NFT) industry for some time. In 2021, the entertainment giant <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/disney-to-drop-golden-moments-nft-collectible-series-via-digital-collectibles-app-veve/">collaborated</a> with the digital collectibles firm Veve on several Disney and Marvel-themed collections. In July 2022, the blockchain firm Polygon was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blockchain-company-polygon-chosen-to-participate-in-disneys-2022-accelerator-program/">selected</a> to participate in Disney&#8217;s 2022 Accelerator Program. In January 2022, the company moved toward the Metaverse industry when it was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/disney-moves-toward-metaverse-with-approved-us-patent-to-create-a-virtual-world-simulator/">approved</a> by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for a patent to create a “virtual-world simulator.”</p>
<p>As for the platform Cryptoys, it is backed by well-known investors such as Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Mattel, Sound Ventures, Dapper Labs, Animoca Brands, and Acrew Capital. Cryptoys recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/toy-manufacturer-mattel-and-cryptoys-announce-masters-of-the-universe-nft-collection/">worked</a> with Mattel to release a Masters of the Universe NFT collection. The platform uses the blockchain network Flow, a protocol crafted by Dapper Labs that issues popular NFT compilations like NFL All Day and NBA Top Shot.</p>
<p>“The moment fans unwrap their blister packs, they will see these characters animate before their eyes, transforming into spectacular 3D toys with big personalities,” Cryptoys said in an email sent to Bitcoin.com News. The new Star Wars digital collectibles will be priced at $39.99 each, and the team claims that “the unboxing experience is unlike any other in the digital toy space.”</p>

<p>Over the last 90 days, NFTs have seen a resurgence in interest, with the term &#8220;NFT&#8221; <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&amp;q=NFT&amp;hl=en">scoring</a> the highest possible score of 100 on April 30, 2023, in terms of search interest on Google Trends. Data from Google Trends <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&amp;q=digital%20collectible&amp;hl=en">indicates</a> that the search query &#8220;digital collectible&#8221; received significantly less engagement but still received a score of 21 out of 100 on April 29, 2023. According to <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/nftglobal">metrics</a> from cryptoslam.io, NFT sales totaled $672,161,665 in April, down from the $793,745,613 recorded the previous month.</p>

In just seven days, the crypto asset has skyrocketed by 896% against the U.S. dollar, making it the third-largest meme token in terms of market valuation. Amid the price spike, PEPE&#8217;s market cap now exceeds the $1 billion mark. </strong></p>
<h2>Green Frog Crypto Asset PEPE Makes Waves in Meme Economy Dominated by Dogs</h2>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) have a new challenger in the meme token arena, as Pepe the Frog meme coin, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pepe">pepe (PEPE)</a>, has emerged as a formidable competitor. With an impressive surge of 896% over the past week, PEPE has now become the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/meme-token">third-largest meme token</a>, trailing only DOGE and SHIB. In the last 24 hours alone, the token has seen a remarkable increase of over 79%. Bitcoin.com News had previously <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/meme-coin-pepe-surges-by-152-this-week-now-the-fifth-largest-meme-token-by-market-cap/">reported</a> on PEPE&#8217;s initial rise when it was launched on April 14, 2023.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-586492 size-full" title="Meme Coin PEPE's Market Cap Surpasses $1B with 896% Surge Over the Past Week" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dddc.jpg" alt="Meme Coin PEPE's Market Cap Surpasses $1B with 896% Surge Over the Past Week" width="1280" height="450" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dddc-300x105.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dddc-1024x360.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dddc-768x270.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dddc.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>PEPE has come a long way since its all-time low of $0.00000005514 per unit on April 18, recording a spike of 5,102%. Currently, the meme token is being traded at prices ranging from $0.00000152 to $0.00000302 over the last 24 hours. With a circulating supply of 420 trillion PEPE, the token has amassed a global 24-hour trade volume of $818 million. On Friday, PEPE ranked sixth in terms of trade volume, trailing only tether, bitcoin, ethereum, usd coin, and binance usd.</p>

<p>PEPE has been making waves on various exchanges, including Binance and Okx, but it is Uniswap v2 that has emerged as the most active PEPE exchange today. The token&#8217;s global trade volume has also surged by 205.80% since the day prior. With almost 100K holders, PEPE has garnered a lot more holders, as the number of addresses holding the token on Friday was 90,683. However, the top ten addresses control a significant portion of PEPE&#8217;s supply, accounting for 20.31%. In fact, the <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/pepe/richlist/">top 100 richest PEPE addresses</a> hold close to half of the token&#8217;s supply, which amounts to 42.62%.</p>

<p>PEPE recently surpassed FLOKI, which was once the third-largest meme coin by market cap. Although FLOKI is still up by 57% over the last day and 44% over the past week, it has been overshadowed by PEPE&#8217;s impressive surge. Interestingly, several other crypto tokens that bear the name Pepe are also experiencing significant gains on Friday. In a meme economy that is largely dominated by dogs, the green frog crypto asset has certainly made its mark in meme-coin land.</p>

On the same day the network launched, SUI peaked at $2.16 per unit, but has since dropped by 37% from its record high.</strong></p>
<h2>Mysten Labs Launches Sui Mainnet, Draws Attention with Delegated PoS Blockchain and Move Programming Language</h2>
<p>As established cryptocurrencies continue to compete for dominance, a fresh wave of digital assets has emerged in the crypto sphere. Among them is <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sui">SUI</a>, a new digital currency whose network went live on Wednesday. The founders of SUI hail from <a href="https://mystenlabs.com/">Mysten Labs</a>, and like Aptos, its founders stem from Facebook&#8217;s crypto project.</p>
<p>SUI operates on a delegated proof-of-stake (dPoS) blockchain, utilizing the Move programming language. At present, there are 528,273,718 SUI in circulation, with a maximum supply of 10,000,000,000 slated for the future. Presently, the network has 2,122 nodes and 100 total validators. Validation is provided via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault">Byzantine Consistent Broadcast</a>.</p>
<p>“Sui is a distributed ledger that stores a collection of programmable objects, each with a globally unique ID,” explains the Sui network <a href="https://sui.io">documentation</a>. “Every object is owned by a single address, and each address can own an arbitrary number of objects. The ledger is updated via a transaction sent by a particular address. A transaction can create, destroy, and write objects, as well as transfer them to other addresses.”</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/srthellcat14/status/1649299258942844928?s=20">Before</a> and after the mainnet launch, the project <a href="https://twitter.com/Vikky149/status/1653784574466351104?s=20">encountered backlash</a> when a few early adopters were <a href="https://twitter.com/AbdulShakoor105/status/1653739143283736579?s=20">left out</a> of the early adopter token allocation. Arthur0x, the founder of Defiance Capital, <a href="https://twitter.com/Arthur_0x/status/1653733232687616002?s=20">commented</a> on the situation, saying, “People ask why [venture capitalists] keep funding new pre-mainnet Layer 1 protocols at billion dollar valuation but as long as hyped L1 can keep getting away by launching at $10b+ FDV even amidst a challenging market this trend will continue.” Arthur0x went on by <a href="https://twitter.com/Arthur_0x/status/1653734257800663040?s=20">stating</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Almost all founders of hyped L1 in past cycles are billionaires now despite little real traction achieved in their blockchain.</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon its market debut, SUI surged to an all-time high of $2.16 per coin, but has since dropped by 37%, currently trading between $1.27 and $1.36 per unit. However, at its current price of $1.36 per unit, the crypto asset is up 16% from its all-time low.</p>
<p>As of Friday, May 5, 2023, SUI&#8217;s market valuation stands at $709 million, with $511 million in 24-hour global trade volume. Over the past 24 hours, the network has processed 2,373,134 transactions, with 239,888 unique addresses holding SUI. Out of the vast array of listed crypto assets, SUI currently ranks as the 70th largest market capitalization.</p>

<h2>Stronghold Digital&#x2019;s Hosting Agreement With Canaan Subsidiary Aims to Increase Bitcoin Mining Capabilities</h2>
<p>On May 4, 2023, <a href="https://strongholddigitalmining.com/">Stronghold Digital Mining, Inc.</a> (Nasdaq: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-SDIG/">SDIG</a>) announced a two-year hosting deal with <a href="https://www.cantaloupe.com">Cantaloupe Digital</a>, a subsidiary of Canaan, the manufacturer of Avalon-made ASICs.

<p>According to the announcement, the company plans to install 2,000 Avalon A1346 miners in June. Each A1346 miner is expected to have a hashpower of 110 TH/s. Once all the miners are installed, Stronghold anticipates that its delivered hashrate capacity will increase to 3.6 exahash per second (EH/s) by June. This move puts Stronghold in line with other mining companies that are also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cleanspark-purchases-45000-bitcoin-mining-devices-adding-6-3-eh-s-to-current-fleet/">expanding their fleets</a> in 2023 with additional ASIC rigs.</p>
<p>&#x201C;While we have emphasized our necessary deleveraging efforts over the last ten months, we think that the most meaningful measure of our work is the capital efficiency of our mining fleet today,&#x201D; Greg Beard, chairman and chief executive officer of Stronghold said in a statement sent to Bitcoin.com News.</p>
<p>According to Stronghold, the latest move will allow the company to fully utilize the capacity of its Panther Creek data center. As part of the agreement, Stronghold will receive 50% of the bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) mined by the Canaan Miners. Additionally, Canaan will make payments to Stronghold equal to 55% of the net cost of power at the Panther Creek plant, calculated on a monthly basis in dollar-per-megawatt-hour terms.</p>

<p>The Stronghold news coincides with Blocksbridge Consulting <a href="https://blocksbridge.substack.com/p/decline-cogs-bitcoin-asic?utm_source=substack&publication_id=1244563&post_id=118014565&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&triggerShare=true&isFreemail=true">publishing research</a> on April 29, 2023, indicating that the cost of producing Avalon miners has decreased. According to an <a href="https://t.me/TheMinerMag/991">analysis</a> of <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001780652/000110465923047189/can-20221231x20f.htm">Canaan&#x2019;s annual report</a>, the cost of goods sold (COGS) for each generation of Avalon bitcoin ASICs, from the A7 to A13 series, has dropped from $50 per terahash per second (TH/s) to $12 per TH/s.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, bitcoin miners have had a more successful year in 2023 compared to 2022. The price of bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) has been higher this year, and despite five consecutive difficulty increases, miners experienced a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-miners-breathe-a-sigh-of-relief-as-difficulty-drops-1-45-after-five-consecutive-increases/">1.45% decrease</a> on Thursday.</p>

Lucky Uwakwe, the founder of the technology service delivery company Sabi Group, said the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is unlikely to reverse its stance on privately issued digital currency.</strong></p>
<h2>Blockchain Policy a Product of Widespread Consultations</h2>
<p>The Nigerian Federal government recently approved what Isa Pantami, the country’s minister of communications and digital economy, has described as the country’s &#8220;national blockchain policy.&#8221; According to Pantami, the new policy is a product of widespread consultations with some 56 Nigerian institutions and personalities. Remarking on what this feat means for Nigeria&#8217;s blockchain industry, Pantami, who spoke after a Federal Executive Council meeting chaired by outgoing president Muhammadu Buhari, <a href="https://punchng.com/breaking-fg-approves-national-blockchain-policy%E2%81%A3/">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>With the approval of the national blockchain policy for Nigeria today, we can safely say that blockchain technology with all its components and types have been institutionalized in the country.</p></blockquote>
<p>The minister added that the country’s security council and the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) have been asked to jointly develop and formulate regulatory instruments for all sectors.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>CBN Crypto Directive</h2>
<p>Following the announcement, some players in Nigeria have speculated that the new policy signals a shift in the outgoing’s government disposition towards technology that underpins cryptocurrencies. In particular, the new policy gives hope to Nigerian crypto traders and enthusiasts still reeling from the effects of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)’s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nigeria-crypto-ban-stakeholder-body-politicians-assail-central-banks-directive-to-financial-institutions/">crypto directive</a>.</p>
<p>Lucky Uwakwe, the founder of the technology service delivery company Sabi Group, said the new policy means the various players in the blockchain industry now have the official backing of the government. According to Uwakwe, the new policy also suggests that the technology is &#8220;here to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the Sabi Group founder told Bitcoin.com News that while the announcement is set to excite the blockchain industry participants, players in the crypto space fear that the new policy alone will not force the CBN to reverse its position on privately issued digital currency. This, according to Uwakwe, is because the central bank operates independently.</p>
<p>&#8220;The central bank is empowered by the law to act independently. If the CBN decides to see that even with this executive policy that has passed by the Federal executive council, if the central bank still sees it as a threat to financial stability, they still have the power to continue to maintaining that law [CBN crypto restriction],&#8221; Uwakwe said. According to Uwakwe, the only way the CBN’s crypto directive can be removed is when the central bank itself &#8220;deletes&#8221; the Feb. 5, 2021 directive.</p>
