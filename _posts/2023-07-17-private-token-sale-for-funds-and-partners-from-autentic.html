<p>In total, Autentic plans to issue 100 million AUt, which will be used as an internal settlement for accessing platform services, paying fees, and serving as an investment instrument. The company will launch a Savings feature in the fall, providing the opportunity to earn up to 25% APY. Other benefits the company provides to its investors: predictable investment returns, 24/7 trading, low fees, and full decentralization without regulatory pressure.</p>
