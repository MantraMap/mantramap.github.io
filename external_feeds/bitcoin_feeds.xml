According to France&#8217;s Autorité des Marchés Financiers, the license allows Forge to offer services which include crypto custody, trading, and sales.</strong></p>
<h2>License Said to Enable Forge to Meet Institutional Demand for Digital Assets</h2>
<p>Forge, the crypto division of France’s banking giant Societe Generale, recently received what is being described as the first crypto services license issued under the country’s crypto assets laws, a report has said. French market regulator Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) stated on its <a href="https://www.amf-france.org/en/professionals/fintech/my-relations-amf/obtain-dasp-authorisation#List_of_DASPs_licensed_by_the_AMF">website</a> that the license allows Forge to offer services which include crypto custody, trading, and sales.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/societe-generale-obtains-frances-first-crypto-licence-2023-07-19/">report</a>, the license given to Forge does not subject the Societe Generale’s subsidiary to the same onerous rules faced by other crypto entities, particularly in the areas of corporate governance, information technology, and compliance.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>Jean-Marc Stenger, the CEO of Forge, said the license enables his company to meet demand from institutional clients for digital assets.</p>
<p>&#8220;This step will allow us to continue supporting our institutional clients wishing to benefit from services on digital assets that meet the highest standards of compliance and banking security,&#8221; Stenger <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/societe-generale-unit-gets-france-s-first-crypto-license#xj4y7vzkg">said</a>.</p>

Citing the crypto&#x2019;s performance during the regional bank crisis earlier this year, she stressed, &#x201C;That was the flight to safety,&#x201D; emphasizing that bitcoin is the insurance her team believes &#x201C;everyone will want at the end of the day.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>Ark Invest&#x2019;s Bitcoin Price Predictions</h2>
<p>Ark Investment Management (Ark Invest) is now more confident in bitcoin&#x2019;s price reaching $1.5 million per coin. The firm&#x2019;s CEO, Cathie Wood, <a href="https://twitter.com/Pledditor/status/1681044467904655362">said</a> in an interview with Bloomberg Monday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our confidence has increased toward the bull case.</p></blockquote>
<p>The bull case Wood referred to was one of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ark-invest-expects-bitcoin-to-become-a-multitrillion-dollar-market-predicts-btc-price-could-reach-1-48-million/">three scenarios</a> Ark Invest outlined in its annual Big Ideas 2023 that was published in February. In the firm&#x2019;s base case scenario, the price of bitcoin is projected to reach $682,800 by the end of December 2030, while the bull case scenario envisions <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> soaring to $1.48 million in the same time period.</p>

<p>Wood attributed the increased bullishness in bitcoin to the regional bank crisis in March, when several major banks failed, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-regulators-close-silicon-valley-bank-in-one-of-the-largest-bank-failures-since-washington-mutual/">Silicon Valley Bank</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ny-regulators-seize-control-of-signature-bank-depositors-assured-by-federal-bailout/">Signature Bank</a>. &#x201C;As regional banks are going bankrupt, and stocks are imploding across the board &#x2026; bitcoin rallied from $19,000 to $30,000,&#x201D; the Ark Invest CEO noted, emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>That was the flight to safety. That is the insurance policy &#x2026; that we believe everyone will want at the end of the day.</p></blockquote>

<p>Multiple people have warned that more banks are about to fail, including Rich Dad Poor Dad author <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-more-banks-are-about-to-fail/">Robert Kiyosaki</a>. Economist Peter Schiff, however, believes that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-all-banks-will-fail-people-will-suffer-massive-losses-as-banking-crisis-unfolds/">all banks will fail</a> and people will suffer massive losses as the banking crisis unfolds.</p>
<p>Wood highlighted that bitcoin is an &#x201C;insurance policy against two things.&#x201D; Firstly, she emphasized its role in protecting against wealth confiscation, whether through direct means or inflation. Secondly, in a deflationary environment, bitcoin serves as a hedge against counterparty risk. Emphasizing the decentralized and transparent nature of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, the Ark Invest executive believes that a repeat of the financial crisis of 2008-2009 will not happen. &#x201C;We won&#x2019;t have an &#x2018;08-&#x2018;09 with bitcoin. Everything is decentralized and transparent &#x2014; no obfuscation,&#x201D; she stressed.</p>

Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.) has unveiled two new reforms for bitcoin if he is elected president. He plans to back the U.S. dollar with the cryptocurrency and eliminate capital gains taxes on the conversion of bitcoin to USD.</strong> <strong>RFK Jr. stressed that his administration&#x2019;s mission is to make America &#x201C;the global hub of cryptocurrency, particularly bitcoin.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>Kennedy Administration Plans to Back US Dollar With Bitcoin</h2>
<p>U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unveiled several bullish plans for bitcoin if he is elected president during his speech at a Heal-the-Divide event on Tuesday. Kennedy is a son of former U.S. Attorney General and Senator Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy.</p>
<p>The presidential hopeful began by outlining the reforms he previously promised regarding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, stating that his administration&#x2019;s mission is to make America &#x201C;the global hub of cryptocurrency, particularly bitcoin, as a means of incentivizing greater investment in green and renewable energy production, attracting engineering, investment, and innovation to our country.&#x201D; He also promised to &#x201C;put an end to the current policies of the Biden administration that are invited by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-03-30/crypto-claims-chokepoint-2-0-as-wall-street-banks-close-ranks">Chokepoint 2.0</a> to punish banks for dealing in bitcoin, and also to make strong barriers against the issuance of central bank digital currencies [CBDCs].&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I want to talk today about two additional reforms that we&#x2019;ve given a lot of thought to, and are going to be part of our package,&#x201D; Kennedy said Tuesday. One of the reforms is to back the U.S. dollar with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. He detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Kennedy administration will be backing the U.S. dollar with real, finite assets, such as gold, silver, platinum, and bitcoin, which is the world&#x2019;s hardest liquid asset, to strengthen the U.S. dollar and guarantee its continued success as the world&#x2019;s reserve currency.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;This will include U.S. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds. My plan would be to start very, very small &#x2014; perhaps 1% of issued T-bills would be backed by hard currency, by gold, silver, platinum, or bitcoin. And then, depending on the outcome, we would increase that annually,&#x201D; he described. &#x201C;What this will do is &#x2026; ironically, we will be able to use bitcoin to help save the U.S. dollar.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="p1"></p>
<h2>Capital Gains Tax Exemption</h2>
<p>Another bitcoin reform Kennedy revealed on Tuesday concerns capital gains taxes from converting the cryptocurrency to U.S. dollars. The pro-bitcoin presidential candidate, who recently revealed that he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/democratic-presidential-candidate-robert-kennedy-jr-holds-up-to-250000-in-bitcoin-records-show/">holds up to $250K</a> in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like Singapore, Germany, Switzerland, Puerto Rico and Portugal, the Kennedy administration will exempt the conversion of bitcoin to U.S. dollars from capital gains taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kennedy explained that the benefits of this policy include &#x201C;facilitating innovation and investment, ensuring citizen privacy, [and] incentivizing businesses to grow their business and tech jobs in the United States rather than in Singapore, Switzerland, Germany, and Portugal.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Moreover, he explained that one of the factors in this decision is that &#x201C;non-taxable events are unreportable,&#x201D; emphasizing that &#x201C;it will be more difficult for governments to weaponize currency against free speech, which, as many of you know is one of my principle objectives, and other civil liberties.&#x201D;</p>

Trump also made several other promises, including getting Russia&#8217;s President Vladimir Putin to make a deal with Ukraine&#8217;s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy &#8220;very quickly.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Donald Trump&#8217;s Warnings</h2>
<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump made several promises and predictions during an interview with Fox News Sunday. He was asked about his plan to get the U.S. economy growing again and whether he thinks the U.S. is going into a recession. “If people think Trump is going to be elected, you&#8217;ll never have a recession … because people will start investing,” the former president claimed, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>If people think I&#8217;m not, you&#8217;ll have more than a recession. You&#8217;re going to have a depression.</p></blockquote>
<p>“But, what I would do is very simple. I&#8217;ve got to get interest rates down. We have to get rid of inflation because inflation is a country killer,” he stressed, noting that the Biden administration is “putting the interest rates at a point nobody can borrow.”</p>

<p>Trump also made a number of other promises. For example, he said: “We&#8217;ll close up the border. We&#8217;ll become energy independent, then we&#8217;re going to be energy dominant. We&#8217;ll be taking care of Europe. Energy prices are going to come down. I will get [Russian President] Putin to make a deal with [Ukrainian President] Zelenskyy very quickly. We&#8217;re going to have a great world again.” Moreover, Trump opined: “If we don&#8217;t win in &#8217;24, this country is finished. I really believe that.”</p>
<p>In April, the former president warned that the U.S. dollar is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-president-donald-trump-says-us-dollar-is-crashing-warns-were-very-close-to-world-war-iii/">crashing</a> and soon will &#8220;no longer be the world standard.&#8221; In addition, he cautioned that &#8220;we are very close&#8221; to a third world war.</p>

The move, which opens the door to an official review process, follows last week’s acknowledgment of Blackrock’s bitcoin ETF application. </strong></p>
<h2>U.S. SEC to Review Valkyrie’s Bitcoin ETF Application, Expects Public Feedback</h2>
<p>The United States’ securities regulator has given the nod to an official review of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application submitted by financial services company Valkyrie. The application was <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nasdaq.htm#SR-NASDAQ-2023-019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> to the government agency’s docket on Monday, July 17.</p>
<p>The listing on the SEC’s calendar comes after this past Thursday the Commission <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-accepts-blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-application/">acknowledged</a> a similar application by Blackrock, the world’s largest asset management firm. Public comments on the proposal will be accepted for 21 days after publication in the Federal Register.</p>
<p>Industry players are competing to launch a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., including Bitwise, Wisdom Tree, Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, Vaneck, Invesco, and Fidelity, but the SEC has so far rejected a number of applications. Among them, that for Valkyrie’s “Bitcoin Strategy ETF.”</p>

<p>Tennessee-based Valkyrie, which already offers a bitcoin futures ETF, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/valkyrie-funds-joins-race-for-sec-approval-as-it-files-application-for-spot-bitcoin-etf/">submitted</a> its new application for an ETF named “Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund,” ticker symbol “BRRR,” on June 21. That happened days after the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">filing</a> for financial giant Blackrock’s “Ishares Bitcoin Trust” gave cause for optimism that the SEC may finally greenlight a spot bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>Then, in early July, Valkyrie amended its filing to add a surveillance-sharing agreement with leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, again following in the footsteps of Blackrock which did the same earlier. Both applicants chose Coinbase as a partner despite the trading platform being one of the companies targeted in the SEC’s ongoing clampdown on the crypto sector.</p>
<p>During the 21-day comment period, the SEC will gather public feedback and suggestions on Valkyrie’s proposal before it decides on the application. The Securities and Exchange Commission is yet to approve a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S., a step that regulators in neighboring Canada have already taken, while Europe is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/europe-expects-its-first-bitcoin-etf-this-month-report/">preparing</a> for the launch of its first bitcoin ETF later this month.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you expect the SEC to officially accept other spot bitcoin ETF applications? Tell us in the comments section below. </strong></em></p>

<h2>Peter Schiff&#x2019;s Son, Spencer, Appears to Have Made Complete Turnaround</h2>
<p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gold-bug-vs-bitcoin-bug-a-look-at-the-curious-relationship-between-peter-and-spencer-schiff/">Spencer Schiff</a>, son of renowned economist and gold advocate <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/peter-schiff-the-fed-has-lost-inflation-fight-markets-just-havent-figured-that-out-yet/">Peter Schiff</a>, used to engage in debates about bitcoin&#x2019;s value with his father in 2021. Back then, Spencer was a strong supporter of bitcoin, contradicting his father&#x2019;s prediction that the cryptocurrency would plummet to zero. In March 2021, Peter publicly <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/100-in-bitcoin-gold-bug-peter-schiffs-son-spencer-all-in-on-btc/">announced</a> that Spencer had gone &#x201C;all in on bitcoin on the last drop below $50K.&#x201D; Spencer also <a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerKSchiff/status/1388860200849969156?s=20">advised</a> his father to accumulate Satoshis during discussions about inflation.</p>
<p>On July 18, 2023, Spencer responded to a Tuesday <a href="https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1681305390305378304?s=20">morning tweet</a> from Zerohedge discussing potential causes of a &#x201C;coming Great Depression.&#x201D; At 10:29 a.m. Eastern Time, Spencer <a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerKSchiff/status/1681310274295599107?s=20">retorted</a>, &#x201C;This is pure fearmongering.&#x201D; He further noted that &#x201C;We&#x2019;re about to have an unfathomably enormous economic boom, not a depression. The average American&#x2019;s standard of living will skyrocket over the next 5-10 years (and it will be 100% sustainable). There&#x2019;s nothing to worry about regarding the economy,&#x201D; he added.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-598472 size-full" title="Unlike Father, Spencer Schiff Calls Depression Warning 'Fearmongering,' Predicts Hyperdeflationary Boom, Bitcoin Crash; Banks on AI Future" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/no.jpg" alt="Unlike Father, Spencer Schiff Calls Depression Warning 'Fearmongering,' Predicts Hyperdeflationary Boom, Bitcoin Crash; Banks on AI Future" width="1280" height="425" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/no-300x100.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/no-1024x340.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/no-768x255.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/no.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>Post Spencer&#x2019;s declaration, a respondent suggested that the junior Schiff placed his faith in AI automation and bitcoin to be the panacea, culminating in &#x201C;deflation.&#x201D; Spencer clarified to this individual that his viewpoint was not influenced by bitcoin. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not about bitcoin at all. I don&#x2019;t think bitcoin will have a major impact on the world, and its price will probably fall to near zero over the next few years. My thesis is an AI thesis,&#x201D; he <a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerKSchiff/status/1681322456030560256?s=20">said</a>. Spencer got a great deal of replies to his statement about bitcoin.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Very weird change of views regarding bitcoin &#x2026; his dad probably told him he will not get any inheritance if he didn&#x2019;t get in line. This kid will get humbled like his dad,&#x201D; a Twitter account called Hornet Hodl <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinHornet/status/1681333477440978944?s=20">tweeted</a>. &#x201C;&#x2018;Get in line?&#x2019; I&#x2019;ve moved even further away from his views,&#x201D; Spencer <a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerKSchiff/status/1681335112879812610?s=20">replied</a>. &#x201C;I used to agree with him about the economy and I thought hyperinflation was coming.&#x201D; Spencer added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now I think a permanent hyperdeflationary economic boom is coming, and the USD will soar in value as productivity, economic output, and our living standards all skyrocket. Also, I don&#x2019;t care about inheritance because it&#x2019;s highly unlikely for there to ever be a situation where I&#x2019;m alive while my dad is not alive.</p></blockquote>
<p>When someone asked Spencer what changed his mind about bitcoin, he <a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerKSchiff/status/1681349197528809482?s=20">replied</a> &#x201C;AI.&#x201D; Another person asked Spencer, &#x201C;Weren&#x2019;t you shilling bitcoin like 2 years ago?&#x201D; and Spencer replied to that comment as well, saying it&#x2019;s good to change perspectives. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m 20, my views should be expected to have big shifts,&#x201D; Spencer <a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerKSchiff/status/1681340267691929601?s=20">said</a>. &#x201C;Also, I don&#x2019;t own any financial assets. Not a single penny&#x2019;s worth. But if I did have extra money, I would either keep it in USD (because hyperdeflation is coming) or I&#x2019;d invest in AI companies, or a mix of both.&#x201D;</p>

<p>A glance at Spencer&#x2019;s <a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerKSchiff">Twitter timeline</a> reveals his palpable enthusiasm for AI and software like Chatgpt, as evidenced by the numerous AI news and announcements he retweets. In a subsequent tweet on Tuesday, he reiterated his stance on hyperdeflation.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Permanent hyperdeflation will start soon because annual economic output is about to skyrocket, potentially as much as 10x, 100x, or 1,000x over the next decade,&#x201D; he <a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerKSchiff/status/1681347376533893121?s=20">insisted</a>. &#x201C;The U.S. government can print $35 trillion to pay off the national debt and consumer prices will still plummet.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Spencer&#x2019;s tweet about bitcoin garnered <a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerKSchiff/status/1681322456030560256/retweets/with_comments">significant attention and drew criticism</a> from supporters of the cryptocurrency. While some humorously remarked that the apple doesn&#x2019;t fall too far from the tree, others raised concerns about a possible hack of his account.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Peter himself <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/peter-schiff-twitter-apparently-hacked-shills-gold-crypto-son-spencer-warns/">fell victim</a> to a Twitter account breach, prompting Spencer to issue a public warning about the incident. A suggestion arose that Spencer might be <a href="https://twitter.com/boredape3433/status/1681429900643926017?s=20">playfully trolling</a> the crypto community on Twitter, including ardent bitcoin maxis, while secretly maintaining his bullish stance on the digital currency.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Spencer&#x2019;s statements on Tuesday, the following day his father spoke about the turnaround. &#x201C;My son [Spencer K Schiff] is no longer bullish on bitcoin,&#x201D; Peter </span><a href="https://twitter.com/peterschiff/status/1681664026592309250?s=46&t=QE8T9AX8awnighdZd6DQUw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#x201C;As young people typically do, he&#x2019;s lost interest in a passing fad and moved on to something new. In this case, it&#x2019;s AI that&#x2019;s captivated his attention. As bitcoin&#x2019;s young fan base matures many more will grow out of bitcoin.&#x201D;</span></p>

The funds have reportedly been sent to the crypto exchange, Kraken. This occurrence marks the fourth instance of activated <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> ICO tokens this year, with a substantial amount of nearly 80,000 dormant ether awakening and becoming active in 2023.</strong></p>
<h2>Ethereum ICO Whale Moves $116 Million in Ether After 8 Years of Slumber</h2>
<p>Whale Alert, a blockchain parser, <a href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1681439947876622336?s=20">alerted</a> the community on July 18, 2023, about the awakening of 61,216 ether following an eight-year period of inactivity. Lookonchain, onchain market observers, also <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1681476159253680128?s=20">tweeted</a> regarding the transaction, highlighting that the user paid approximately $0.31 per ether. The Ethereum initial coin offering (ICO) occurred from late July 2014 to the first week of September in the same year.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#x1F4A4; &#x1F4A4; &#x1F4A4; &#x1F4A4; &#x1F4A4; &#x1F4A4; &#x1F4A4; &#x1F4A4; &#x1F4A4; &#x1F4A4;  A dormant pre-mine address containing 61,216 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ETH?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ETH</a> (116,396,127 USD) has just been activated after 8.0 years!<a href="https://t.co/f79T0fYa7b">https://t.co/f79T0fYa7b</a></p>
<p>&#x2014; Whale Alert (@whale_alert) <a href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1681439947876622336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Although the user paid under $20,000 for the ether stash, the funds&#x2019; present value amounts to $116.5 million at current exchange rates. Apparently, the funds were sent to an ethereum address identified as a wallet owned by Kraken. As per Whale Alert metrics, before the substantial transfer of 61,216 ether, 8,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> had been <a href="https://whale-alert.io/transaction/ethereum/0x777afd69de66609ef7ca5fd5fb96065e4559f1620db17db7bc8fbe31308b5469">moved</a> from an ICO wallet on May 27 of this year.</p>

<p>On April 23, 2023, an additional 2,365 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> from the 2014 ICO became <a href="https://whale-alert.io/transaction/ethereum/0x8d3d8244799e570c0ff45c7343b44b0f9861a295c41ffb33eab80555c4c112c6">active</a>, following a <a href="https://whale-alert.io/transaction/ethereum/0x16584d3b87b21d6c0e282ce5c143bca6ad1d417c9f445aebba30097f780c0d73">transfer</a> of 7,900 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> from an ICO participant on April 14. Before these four ICO participants moved a total of 79,481 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> valued at $151.26 million, an individual transferred 2,075 ether on November 23, 2022. Notably, there were three instances of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> ICO activations in November 2022, and an additional awakening took place on October 25, 2022, involving the transfer of 200 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>.</p>

<h2>U.S. &#x2018;Regulatory Environment&#x2019; Forces Nasdaq to Postpone Crypto Custody Launch</h2>
<p>In late March, Nasdaq <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nasdaq-aims-to-launch-crypto-custody-services-in-second-quarter/">unveiled</a> its plans to introduce a crypto asset custody service. The company applied for a limited-purpose trust company charter from the New York Department of Financial Services.</p>
<p>Initially, it was reported that Nasdaq would provide custody for bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) and ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>), with plans to expand to additional cryptocurrencies. However, during a <a href="https://ir.nasdaq.com/events/event-details/nasdaq-second-quarter-2023-results">Q2 earnings call</a>, CEO Adena Friedman stated that the project had been paused.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This quarter, considering the shifting business and regulatory environment in the United States, we have made the decision to halt our launch of the U.S. digital assets custodian business and our related efforts to pursue relevant license,&#x201D; said the Nasdaq executive. Friedman elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We continue to build and deliver technology capabilities that position Nasdaq as a leading digital assets software solutions provider to the broader global industry. This includes advancing our custody solution as a technology platform to serve the broader, global digital assets marketplace.</p></blockquote>

<p>Since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took action against multiple crypto companies for alleged securities law violations, regulatory pressure has intensified in the U.S. The U.S. regulator has categorized 66 digital assets worth over <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/secs-classification-of-so-called-crypto-securities-amounts-to-98-billion-in-combined-value/">$98 billion</a> as securities.</p>
<p>This prompted several businesses such as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bakkt-takes-proactive-measures-delists-polygon-solana-and-cardano-amid-regulatory-crackdowns/">Bakkt</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/etoro-to-delist-algo-mana-dash-and-matic-for-us-customers-amid-evolving-regulatory-landscape/">Etoro</a>, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robinhood-to-delist-cardano-solana-and-polygon-amidst-sec-regulatory-pressure/">Robinhood</a> to delist some cryptocurrencies. However, after Ripple Labs and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> secured a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-judge-rules-xrp-not-necessarily-a-security-on-its-face-sending-xrp-supporters-into-celebration/">partial victory</a> regarding programmatic sales, numerous exchanges <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-other-crypto-exchanges-relist-xrp-following-ruling-in-sec-v-ripple-case/">opted to re-list XRP</a>.</p>
