			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Solana&rsquo;s Cardinal protocol just announced its decision to wind down operations and shut down, citing economic conditions.&nbsp;</p>
Cardinal Starts 2-Months &ldquo;Notice Period&rdquo;
<p>Nearly a year after raising $4.4 million, Solana&rsquo;s NFT utility provider, Cardinal Labs, has decided to pack it in. The protocol was launched in early 2022 as an infrastructure provider to improve NFT utility on the Solana network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, on Wednesday, the Cardinal team took to Twitter to announce that they would be winding down operations and eventually shut shop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They wrote,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today is the first day of our 2 month &ldquo;notice period&rdquo; (6/28-8/26) during which we recommend any and all depositors of assets into our systems manually withdraw them. All of our website product UIs will remain live during the period so that no one should have any issue doing so.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;Product Market Fit Difficult&rdquo;
<p>The team tweeted that the macroeconomic conditions have been very challenging for the protocol. They claimed that product market fit has been difficult, and although there has been some usage of the protocol&rsquo;s staking, rentals, and identity products, the market has not scaled up as they had hoped it would. Until blockchain tech adoption happens on a larger scale, the protocol&rsquo;s offerings are &ldquo;stuck in the context of the crypto maximalist community.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team also noted that the code behind the protocol will always be open source and accessible by all, even after the deployments are no longer live. They also reassured users that their assets were safe and would be returned to owners by the end of the process.&nbsp;</p>
Wind Down Schedule&nbsp;
<p>August 26 would mark the end of the two-month notice period, so users will need to complete all withdrawals by that date. The team has also dropped the closing schedule, which revealed that activities like creating staking pools, token management, NFT rentals and rental extensions, management of social media handles, and new deposits would be suspended on July 19.</p>
<p>The team tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we move towards closing up shop, our focus now shifts to carrying out a wind down as smoothly as possible so that the Solana ecosystem doesn&rsquo;t skip a beat&hellip;We realize that many people and teams rely on our protocols, and we want to minimize the impact of this transition on the ecosystem as much as possible, so we&rsquo;ve worked deliberately to find a path that does just that.&rdquo;</p>

Another Solana Project Shuts Down
<p>Twitter user and crypto expert JagoeCapital pointed out that Solana-related protocols are not faring well in the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cardinal announced a $4.4 Million raise just 11 months ago led by Solana Ventures and ProtagonistXYZ with headline participation from Alameda Research, Animoca Brands and Delphi Digital. Today they announced they will be shutting down. It&rsquo;s becoming a common theme with Solana projects.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Blockchain Association, a prominent lobbyist group for the cryptocurrency industry in the United States, has called on SEC Chair Gary Gensler to recuse himself from enforcing rules on the crypto space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission under Gensler has taken a hostile approach to crypto, filing lawsuits against several prominent crypto firms.&nbsp;</p>
Blockchain Association Pens Open Letter&nbsp;
<p>The call for the Securities and Exchange Commission Chair to remove himself from crypto-related matters was issued in the form of a statement released by the Blockchain Association. It comes after cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase filed a notice of intent on Wednesday, requesting a court to dismiss the regulator&rsquo;s lawsuit against the exchange. In the letter, the Blockchain Association contends that Gensler has repeatedly asserted that everything other than Bitcoin is a security and that his statement gives the appearance that he cannot approach the issue with an open mind. The letter alleged that repeatedly expressing the same view meant that the SEC chair had prejudiced the central issue regarding digital asset-related enforcement proceedings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, the letter alleged that Gensler&rsquo;s vote on whether or not to proceed with filing an action was biased. The Blockchain Association also stated that any SEC enforcement action must follow the &ldquo;Wells Process,&rdquo; which would give the target of the enforcement action enough time to present evidence and arguments for their case. However, thanks to Gensler&rsquo;s unbiased perspective, core questions related to the crypto industry would not receive a fair assessment from the SEC. Chief Policy Officer at the Blockchain Association, Jake Chervinksy, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear that the digital assets industry cannot expect a fair assessment from Chair Gensler. His steadfast view that all digital assets except bitcoin are securities means that he cannot approach enforcement decisions with a fair and impartial mind, as required by the SEC&rsquo;s Wells process and federal law. The time has come for Chair Gensler to recuse himself from all decisions related to digital asset-related enforcement matters. If he refuses, then I expect enforcement targets will begin raising the matter of his recusal in SEC proceedings and in federal district courts.&rdquo;</p>

Coinbase And The SEC&nbsp;
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission had sued Coinbase, alleging that the platform offered users at least 13 crypto assets that are securities and should have been registered with the SEC. It had also sued Binance on similar charges just a day prior. In its reply, Coinbase stated that the Securities and Exchange Commission was well aware of the crypto exchange&rsquo;s digital asset operations thanks to its public offering registration, which was done in April 2021. It further added that out of the cryptocurrencies that the SEC called securities, 6 were already trading on Coinbase when the agency reviewed the exchange&rsquo;s public offering registration. Coinbase stated in its filing,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only change is in the SEC&rsquo;s position regarding its powers. That position is untenable as a matter of law, and its assertion through this enforcement action offends due process and the constitutional separation of powers.&rdquo;</p>

SEC Action On Crypto&nbsp;
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has undertaken considerable legal action against crypto exchanges during the ongoing year. Kraken was fined $30 million for offering crypto staking programs, with the SEC stating that the exchange was offering users unregistered securities. The agency also issued a warning to the Paxos Trust Company, an issuer of the Binance stablecoin, that it faces possible legal action. This led to Paxos freezing the minting of the stablecoin, which the SEC stated was an unregistered security. Coinbase criticized the SEC&rsquo;s actions in its filing, saying that the SEC&rsquo;s action in the current scenario was unlawful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather than test its new view through notice-and-comment rulemaking, the SEC has chosen to roll out its ever-aggressive agenda through punitive retroactive enforcement actions. Agency enforcement authority is important but not boundless. The SEC&rsquo;s action here is beyond those bounds and unlawful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Blockchain Association was also critical of the SEC, stating that the federal agency&rsquo;s actions under Gensler had further muddied regulatory waters and forced lawful crypto companies operating in the country to reconsider their operations and move to friendlier jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>
The Political Divide&nbsp;
<p>Gensler&rsquo;s hostile approach to crypto has found support with many Democrats, who have lauded his efforts. However, lawmakers on the other side of the aisle have roundly criticized the SEC and Gensler&rsquo;s approach. Republican Congressman Warren Davidson also introduced a bill called the SEC Stabilization Act on the 13th of June. The bill sought to restructure the federal agency and remove Gensler as chair.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance&rsquo;s crypto custody licence application has reportedly been rejected by the German BaFin regulator.</p>
Another setback
<p>Still the largest crypto exchange in the world by trading volume, Binance is continuing to labour into strong headwinds, suffering regulatory pushback in some European countries, and of course currently being sued by the US regulator.</p>
<p>The latest setback for Binance was reported by the German-based Finance Fwd website. The article stated that the BaFin regulator had either officially denied a crypto custody licence application, or had verbally notified Binance that its licence had been rejected.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Binance was quoted as saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if we cannot share details of our discussions with the regulators, we will continue to work to meet Bafin's requirements. It is an ongoing process&rdquo;</p>

<p>They added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are confident that we have the right team and the appropriate measures to continue our discussions with the regulatory authorities in Germany.&ldquo;</p>

<p>The rejection in Germany will be a difficult pill to swallow for Binance&rsquo;s CEO Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ. The ongoing defence of his company and him personally in the US is a weight around the neck of the crypto exchange.</p>
Battlegrounds need to be won
<p>With such a globally important regulator as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accusing CZ of embezzlement of customer funds among other allegations, obtaining regulatory licences in other countries is going to be difficult, at least until it is known how the accusations are likely to pan out.</p>
<p>Given that Binance is such an important exchange in the crypto ecosystem many may be hoping that it is able to resist the SEC. Both Binance and Coinbase are very important battlegrounds that need to be fought and won if the crypto industry is to reinject some momentum into the beleaguered asset class.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Slovakian Parliament this week voted in favour of a bill that would lower taxes on income derived from cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>Members of the Slovak Republic&rsquo;s National Council, or parliament, voted to approve an amendment that would lower cryptocurrency taxes, along with other measures that would affect crypto holders.</p>
Crypto Income Tax Reduced to 7%
<p>Bloomberg Law reports that Slovakia&rsquo;s National Council voted in favour of reducing personal income tax on profits derived from the sale of crypto held by a user for at least one year. As it stands, cryptocurrency profits are taxed on a sliding scale of either 19% or 25%.</p>
<p>The approved amendment will see taxes lowered significantly to 7%.</p>
<p>The amendment further declares payments received in cryptocurrencies up to 2,400 euros, or $2,600, will not be taxed. Additionally, the bill excludes cryptocurrency income from a health insurance contribution of 14%.</p>
Slovakia Will Lose 30 Million Euro Through Tax Cuts
<p>The newly amended tax policy comes only weeks after parliament passed a constitutional amendment that codifies citizens&rsquo; right to use cash as payment. The amendment was made due to talk about a digital euro.</p>
<p>According to a local Slovakian media outlet, the Ministry of Finance estimates it will lose around 30 million euros annually due to the tax cut. &nbsp;</p>
US Lags as Europe Makes Regulatory Strides
<p>Slovakia, as one of the 27 member states of the European Union (EU), has been promoting cryptocurrency regulations across the region. The EU voted in favour of its landmark MiCA bill, which will make Europe a hub for digital assets. The bill will take effect in 2024.</p>
<p>The UK also made a significant step toward its crypto goal. The House of Lords voted to enact the Financial Services and Markets Bill, which will see cryptocurrencies become a &ldquo;regulated activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Europe, Hong Kong, Singapore and even Dubai compete for their share in the booming crypto market, the situation is less than ideal in the US. With full backing from the Biden administration, the SEC drives the industry away from its shores and ultimately into the arms of those who embrace it.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Melania Trump, the former first lady of the United States, has launched a new NFT collection to celebrate the country&rsquo;s Independence Day, inspired by the nation&rsquo;s iconic landmarks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collection, called &ldquo;The 1776 Collection,&rdquo; consists of a six-piece range of NFTs consisting of images sourced from across the United States of America.&nbsp;</p>
Trump Family NFTs Make A Comeback&nbsp;
<p>The Trump family is back in the NFT space with the launch of Melania Trump&rsquo;s new NFT collection inspired by the upcoming Independence Day holiday. The launch of the new collection comes only a couple of months after former president Donald Trump released the second set of his NFT trading cards. The new set of collectibles launched by the former first lady is part of &ldquo;The 1776 Collection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The NFTs are based on the Solana blockchain and feature several iconic images, including prominent landmarks such as Mount Rushmore and the Statue of Liberty, affixed to animated placards. Each NFT is priced at $50, with the collection comprising seven different designs, making up a total of 3500 NFTs. The NFTs can be purchased through a website called USA Collectibles, with Melania Trump retweeting the company&rsquo;s original tweet about the NFT collection going on sale. The USA Collectibles website also offers POTUS TRUMP NFTs, which feature photos of former President Trump and the former first lady. Melania Trump stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The 1776 Collection of artwork draws inspiration from several iconic landmarks of our nation, which I had the privilege of visiting during the time I served as first lady. Each piece provides a view into our nation&rsquo;s history, culture, and patriotism. I am proud to celebrate our great nation and remain inspired by the words contained within the Declaration of Independence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The collection went live on the 29th of July.&nbsp;</p>
Portion Of Proceeds To Benefit Foster Kids&nbsp;
<p>According to reports, a portion of all proceeds from the collection will go towards Fostering The Future, an initiative by BeBest. The initiative helps children in the foster care community secure educational opportunities and scholarships. Primarily, the Fostering the Future initiative aims to grant computer science scholarships to children coming out of the foster care system, helping them achieve the academic foundation needed to secure technology-based jobs. The former first lady also added that her commitment towards the foster community has grown stronger since leaving Washington DC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Melania Trump also added that she supports former President Trump&rsquo;s reelection campaign and looks forward to working with him once again and restoring hope for the future and leading America. She stated that if she could serve as the first lady again, she would continue to prioritize initiatives that focus on the well-being and development of children, ensuring that they reach their full potential.&nbsp;</p>
The Trumps And NFTs&nbsp;
<p>The Trumps have considerable history in the NFT ecosystem going back at least a couple of years. It was Melania Trump who first jumped into the NFT space with the release of her first NFT in December 2021. The NFT was also based on the Solana blockchain. However, Solana Labs, the entity behind the Solana blockchain, clarified that it was not a Solana-led initiative. The former first lady released more NFTs in 2022 before former president Donald Trump released his popular digital trading cards collection, consisting of around 45,000 NFTs. The collection was launched on Polygon, an Ethereum scaling solution, and each NFT was priced at $99. Furthermore, each NFT in the collection was tied to special perks, such as a potential dinner with the ex-president.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the collection was widely ridiculed, it sold out within 24 hours and became the talk of the NFT space, causing their resale value to surge. At the peak of their popularity, the cards were starting at a price of over $1000 on secondary marketplaces. The former president then released a second collection, consisting of 47,000 NFTs, causing the original NFTs&rsquo; price to fall considerably. At present, the original Trump NFTs start at around $185, while NFTs from the second collection start at approximately $54.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Prominent crypto wallet service provider, Ledger, has announced its latest venture into the world of institutional trading technology.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Dubbed "Tradelink," this new trading and settlement network technology is set to revolutionize the landscape for asset managers, custodians, and exchanges/OTC. Aiming to streamline operations and boost efficiency, Tradelink will allow trading on multiple exchanges without the need for on-chain liquidity re-balancing.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This will ensure that users maintain custodial ownership of assets while engaging in off-exchange trading. Additionally, Tradelink seeks to mitigate trading collateral risks across various third-party platforms, offer easy integration with preferred counter-parties, and significantly reduce transaction fees.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The company&rsquo;s official announcement stated:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Today, we are proud to announce that Ledger is entering the institutional trading technology market with the first open network to enable custodial trading via exchange and custodial partners. This solution will provide unparalleled control, security, flexibility, and transparent governance over an enterprise&rsquo;s digital asset trading."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Ledger's VP of Enterprise Revenue, Sebastien Badault, emphasizes how Tradelink will empower users, asserting:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;By unlocking better trading options for enterprises, we are empowering asset managers, custodians, and exchanges to navigate the changing landscape with confidence while making the whole ecosystem a safer and more transparent place.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">At launch, Tradelink will be accessible to all Ledger Enterprise clients at no additional cost. Initial partners will include well-known asset managers such as Laser Digital and Hodl Group, digital asset trading and orchestration platforms like Wyden, and platform partners including Crypto.com, Bitstamp, Huobi, and more.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch of Tradelink comes after Ledger's recent controversial update, which raised security concerns among its users. However, the company remains undeterred and has just closed a $109 Million Series C extension fundraising round, pushing its valuation to $1.4 billion.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Badault further elaborates on the company's vision for Tradelink:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;We are creating a future-proof solution that will give Ledger Enterprise customers flexibility and security allowing institutions to de-risk their businesses. For almost a decade, Ledger has been building security and governance solutions for the crypto ecosystem. It is this core security foundation that can now be used to reduce counterparty risk and enable custodial trading for institutional investors.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Ledger&rsquo;s innovative Trading Operation technology, coupled with its commitment to transparency and regulatory compliance, positions the company at the forefront of an increasingly evolving market, navigating the ever-changing regulatory and overall market landscape with confidence.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;By unlocking better trading options for enterprises, we are empowering asset managers, custodians, and exchanges to navigate the changing landscape with confidence while making the whole ecosystem a safer and more transparent place.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">At launch, Tradelink will be accessible to all Ledger Enterprise clients at no additional cost. Initial partners will include well-known asset managers such as Laser Digital and Hodl Group, digital asset trading and orchestration platforms like Wyden, and platform partners including Crypto.com, Bitstamp, Huobi, and more.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch of Tradelink comes after Ledger's recent controversial update, which raised security concerns among its users. However, the company remains undeterred and has just closed a $109 Million Series C extension fundraising round, pushing its valuation to $1.4 billion.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Badault further elaborates on the company's vision for Tradelink:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;We are creating a future-proof solution that will give Ledger Enterprise customers flexibility and security allowing institutions to de-risk their businesses. For almost a decade, Ledger has been building security and governance solutions for the crypto ecosystem. It is this core security foundation that can now be used to reduce counterparty risk and enable custodial trading for institutional investors.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Ledger&rsquo;s innovative Trading Operation technology, coupled with its commitment to transparency and regulatory compliance, positions the company at the forefront of an increasingly evolving market, navigating the ever-changing regulatory and overall market landscape with confidence.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Mastercard, a leading provider of credit card services, is expanding its footprint into the burgeoning digital asset space.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In an ambitious move, the payments giant plans to launch a blockchain-based marketplace for financial applications, propelling the evolution of payment solutions beyond traditional parameters.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Diving Deeper into Blockchain Technology</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In the quest to foster innovation in the financial technology space, Mastercard is poised to launch the beta version of its Mastercard Multi Token Network (MTN) in the UK in the coming months. The venture is being touted as an "app store powered by blockchain technologies for building regulated financial applications."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard's Executive Vice President and Head of Crypto and Blockchain, emphasized the value of the underlying technology that powers crypto, stating that it is "actually quite useful." </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Developers leveraging MTN will gain access to a myriad of tools that the company has been developing, one of which includes a private Ethereum-based blockchain, specifically crafted for the creation of novel applications. Mastercard's deep-seated commitment to the digital asset sector is further affirmed by products such as 'Crypto Secure,' 'Crypto Source,' and 'Crypto Credential.' These are geared towards enhancing transparency and trust in the digital asset space.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Developers working on the beta version will also be able to experiment with tokenized commercial bank deposits and blockchain data that provides real-time insights into a person's bank account balance.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Mastercard's Vision for the Future of Payments</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Mastercard's vision for the MTN is to "provide a set of foundational capabilities designed to make transactions within the digital asset and blockchain ecosystems secure, scalable and interoperable &mdash; ultimately enabling more efficient payment and commerce applications." </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The company's official announcement highlighted the importance of trust in the new digital ecosystem, stating, </p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"To realize the potential of blockchain and digital assets as critical infrastructure for storing and moving value, we&rsquo;re launching the Mastercard Multi-Token Network."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Mastercard equates the current trajectory of digital asset and blockchain technologies to the internet's growth arc, predicting a similar transformational impact on the global economy.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"We believe that digital asset and blockchain technologies today are on a similar trajectory, one day becoming critical infrastructure for storing and moving value."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Mastercard's venture into the blockchain app store space represents a major shift towards the adoption of crypto technology in the financial industry, showcasing the company's steadfast commitment to promoting a wider range of secure, accessible, and always-on payment solutions.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch of the MTN, which the company describes as one of their most ambitious projects to date, is a crucial step towards fulfilling their vision for the future of payments. Mastercard anticipates making the MTN available to more markets around the world in due course, fostering an environment where the wider digital asset industry can thrive.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Worldcoin, a cryptocurrency project led by Sam Altman, co-founder of the AI bot ChatGPT, has announced a partnership with digital identity provider Auth0 to effectively manage World ID logins.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Altman's innovative venture aims to offer a global, financial identity to citizens around the globe. Worldcoin's open-source protocol, backed by a network of developers, economists, and engineers, is designed to foster collective ownership worldwide, enabling equal access regardless of class or economic status. Utilizing an iris scanning device, the World ID, Worldcoin aims to ensure secure access to several Web2 platforms while combating the issue of bots impersonating genuine users. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, the Worldcoin ecosystem also comprises the WorldApp payments network, promoting financial inclusion by facilitating cryptocurrency transactions. As part of its dedication to the significant challenges of the web3 world, Worldcoin supports the Optimism Collective, an initiative aiming to enhance Ethereum's scalability by reducing transaction costs.</p>
Worldcoin Collaborates with Auth0 for ID Verification 
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The crypto project has announced the launch of the "Sign in with Worldcoin" feature in Berlin, which uses the World ID biometric scanning system. This function is also set to be integrated with the Auth0 marketplace, the world's largest provider of digital identity solutions.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The &ldquo;Sign in with Worldcoin&rdquo; feature, based on zero-knowledge cryptographic proofs, will help users verify their digital identities while maintaining their privacy. This approach eliminates the risk of user data being shared with third-party services without consent, ensuring that all World ID-registered users are real people. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Auth0's services offer an alternative way for Worldcoin developers to create financial solutions tailored to a broad spectrum of individuals. Worldcoin's innovations introduce an effective measure against the spread of bots within virtual environments, a problem estimated to cause digital advertising fraud amounting to $100 billion worldwide by 2023.</p>
Mysterious Safe Deployments Linked to Worldcoin
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In other news, Worldcoin recently confirmed its role behind a series of Safe deployments to the Optimism network. A Safe, previously known as &ldquo;Gnosis Safe&rdquo;, is a multisignature smart contract wallet, widely used by development teams for added security in transactions.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A social media post from Tiago Sada, head of product for Worldcoin developer Tools for Humanity, revealed Worldcoin was behind the Safe deployments. Initially, these transactions led to speculation, including concerns about a possible Sybil attack or address-farming technique to profit from misdirected coins.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Worldcoin, which extensively uses Safes to offer gas-free transactions to verified humans, recently announced it was migrating its app from Polygon to Optimism. This migration seemed to be the cause behind the deployment of numerous Safes, reassuring the community that the network was not under any form of attack. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The ongoing evolution of Worldcoin signifies a promising direction towards secure digital identities, advancing privacy, and combatting fraudulent activity in the realm of social and web3 applications.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As the Ethereum (ETH) network continues to evolve, changes in its validator limit can significantly impact its performance, transaction fees, and adoption. By analyzing the latest market trends, the article will provide insights into Ethereum's (ETH) future price trajectory.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a presale token, Uwerx, is taking the crypto market by surprise with its astounding presale success. The project has made significant progress and updates to spice up its platform before launch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stay tuned to navigate Uwerx&rsquo;s success and Ethereum's (ETH) potential price prediction in light of the validator limit change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;BUY WERX TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
Predicting Ethereum's (ETH) Price Post Validator Limit Change
<p>As Ethereum (ETH) continues to make waves in the crypto market, one key factor closely watched by investors and analysts is the impact of the Validator Limit Change on its future price projection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Validator Limit Change refers to a crucial adjustment in the Ethereum (ETH) network to address scalability challenges and improve transaction throughput.</p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) has snowballed in recent weeks to hit new highs that strengthen its stance on the market. Ethereum (ETH) trades for $1,881.11 with a trading volume of $12 billion. As the second-largest crypto, Ethereum (ETH) has a market cap of $226 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Validator Limit Change is expected to further enhance Ethereum's (ETH) scalability, enabling the network to process more transactions efficiently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This upgrade has generated a positive sentiment among market participants, as it addresses long-standing concerns about network congestion and high transaction fees.</p>
<p>Analysts predict that the update could affect Ethereum (ETH) positively. Some experts anticipate Ethereum (ETH) surpassing $1,966 as the network's improvements take effect.</p>
<p>Regardless of the positive Ethereum (ETH) outlook, Uwerx promises to improve as investors expect a price surge in the coming months.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;BUY WERX TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
Uwerx (WERX) Price Prediction: Presale Sell-Out Nears
<p>The Uwerx revolution is in full swing, propelling the future of work toward unprecedented heights. With the presale nearing its end, Uwerx is gearing up to express its gratitude to early supporters through a Test Airdrop, acknowledging their unwavering trust and commitment to the project.</p>
<p>Uwerx's unwavering dedication to stability and long-term growth is evident in its decision to lock liquidity for an astonishing 25 years. This commitment ensures a reliable platform for users, fostering a sense of trust and confidence in the ecosystem. The team's tokens are locked for 9 months, demonstrating their deep-rooted belief in Uwerx's potential.</p>
<p>Breaking free from the traditional fee structures, Uwerx charges an industry-leading transaction fee of just 1%. This remarkable difference, compared to platforms like Upwork and Fiverr, with significantly higher costs, empowers users to retain a more significant portion of their hard-earned income, fostering financial independence.</p>
<p>Introducing the game-changing Uwerx Vault allows users to securely store their WERX tokens while earning rewards based on platform variables. This innovative feature ensures the safety of assets and encourages active participation and engagement, fueling a vibrant and dynamic ecosystem.</p>
<p>Ensuring the highest level of security, Uwerx subjected its platform to rigorous audits by reputable firms like SolidProof and InterFi Network. These comprehensive assessments provide users with peace of mind, knowing that their transactions and assets are protected within a robust and reliable infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Uwerx community thrives, with over 7,000 sign-ups, an active Twitter presence, and a vibrant Telegram group. This engaged and supportive community forms the backbone of Uwerx's success, fostering collaboration and collective growth.</p>
<p>Uwerx's presale has been nothing short of extraordinary, surpassing expectations and capturing the crypto community's attention. In Stage 5 of the presale, Uwerx offers tokens at an enticing price of $0.041 each. This presents a unique opportunity for investors to join the Uwerx ecosystem at an accessible rate. And with a generous 15% bonus accompanying each purchase, the value proposition becomes even more compelling.</p>
<p>Consider joining the presale now to take advantage of the anticipated price increase from $0.0415 to $0.047725. To benefit from the potential yield, ensure that you place your orders before Wednesday, 28th at 18:00. Any orders placed after this time will be completed at the corresponding price.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Most crypto enthusiasts are familiar with older crypto giants that have made a lot of money for investors since their introduction to the crypto market. While these crypto giants have created a lot of profit for investors, it has become necessary for investors to seek out new DeFi projects to earn money from. Thankfully, new crypto projects with viable utilities are constantly added to the market, giving investors more options.</p>
<p>InQubeta (QUBE) is one of the latest crypto projects whose presale has already made money for investors after its Beta stage. InQubeta's presale indicates it could be more profitable than an older crypto giant like Cardano (ADA). More investors are putting their money into InQubeta to increase their profit margins in the coming months.</p>
<p>InQubeta's (QUBE) Presale Forges Ahead in the Crypto Market</p>
<p>InQubeta has successfully launched a presale that crypto enthusiasts are eager to participate in. With an ecosystem designed to offer an easy pathway to the AI market, InQubeta is slowly gaining the trust of reputable crypto investors. InQubeta's presale has recorded unprecedented success in the crypto market, increasing investors' chances of becoming wealthy through this project.</p>
<p>The QUBE token presale is divided into 10 stages, and each stage has an allocated number of tokens to be sold at a different price. The price of QUBE increases at the beginning of a new presale stage, ensuring the token's value grows as the presale progresses. The first presale stage, the Beta stage, was recently completed, pushing QUBE into its second presale phase, Stage 1.</p>
<p>The DeFi coin price of QUBE in its current stage is $0.00875, and there are 100,000,000 QUBE tokens to be sold. InQubeta's presale has raised over $600,000, and it will only raise more before the presale stages are complete. In the next stage, QUBE will be sold for $0.0098, drawing closer to its launch price of $0.0308. InQubeta is one of the most profitable new DeFi projects, as its presale also features bonuses for investors.</p>
<p>Once the presale ends, InQubeta's ability to link AI startups and investors will make it even more popular among investors. With an NFT marketplace that allows AI startups to connect with potential investors, InQubeta is set to become one of the best DeFi projects the crypto market has ever seen. InQubeta's NFT marketplace is built on the Ethereum blockchain, increasing its credibility and efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All transactions within InQubeta are paid for using the QUBE token. This increases the token's value, solidifying InQubeta's position as an excellent project to add to your portfolio in 2023. As more investors notice InQubeta's value, its DeFi coin price is only likely to increase, making it an excellent investment option for the future. Some believe it could 10x by the end of the year, and it definitely has all the key components of a crypto that could explode in value.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cardano (ADA) Maintains its Position as a Crypto Giant</p>
<p>Cardano was created using a research-based approach to crypto development. The crypto giant is one of the most popular blockchains for developers to build decentralized applications (dApps). It also offers a highly sustainable network with increased transaction processing speeds.</p>
<p>Cardano seeks to build a network that is not limited by bandwidth, promising a wider reach for blockchain developers in the crypto market. Cardano has remained one of the most profitable cryptocurrencies since it was launched. Its native token, ADA, runs operations on the platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Cardano is one of the best DeFi projects in the crypto market; however, investors are looking for new cryptos to diversify their portfolios. InQubeta's presale has created a more profitable opportunity for investors to earn more money. This is why InQubeta's presale is selling out fast and gaining momentum among investors.</p>
<p>The QUBE token may be the most profitable crypto token of 2023. Its ecosystem promises to give investors better investment opportunities that will increase the value of their holdings. Investing in its presale now is a great way to ensure you are not left out when InQubeta's price rises.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most crypto enthusiasts are familiar with older crypto giants that have made a lot of money for investors since their introduction to the crypto market. While these crypto giants have created a lot of profit for investors, it has become necessary for investors to seek out new DeFi projects to earn money from. Thankfully, new crypto projects with viable utilities are constantly added to the market, giving investors more options.</p>
<p>InQubeta (QUBE) is one of the latest crypto projects whose presale has already made money for investors after its Beta stage. InQubeta's presale indicates it could be more profitable than an older crypto giant like Cardano (ADA).

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Chainlink (LINK) is currently one of the best cryptocurrencies. However, things in the crypto industry change rapidly, so you can never rely on only one coin.</p>
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) recently entered the cryptocurrency world, and although still in presale, it already faces an 80% price increase. Therefore, experts estimate that once Tradecurve (TCRV) tokens reach reputable exchanges, they can surge by 100x.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Chainlink (LINK) Price Predictions
<p>After establishing a partnership with Stella in order to secure its DeFi strategies, Chainlink (LINK) rebounded on a bullish run. But that didn&rsquo;t last for too long.</p>
<p>In the last 24 hours, Chainlink (LINK) decreased by 0.79%, currently standing at $6.09. The main reason for its price decline is Golteum&rsquo;s joining the Chainlink (LINK) BUILD program, which significantly pressures the Chainlink (LINK) coin. However, this should leverage the Chainlink (LINK) industry-leading technology and provide investors with secure, efficient, and transparent trading options.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, experts believe that Chainlink (LINK) will have a positive price movement in the upcoming period if this collaboration proves to work. Additionally, ChatGPT has bright expectations about the coin as well. It forecasts that Chainlink (LINK) will reach $12 if the tokens&rsquo; supply remains constant.</p>
<p>&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The past few weeks have been amazing for the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tradecurve?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Tradecurve&lt;/a&gt; project and community. 💎&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have over 12,000 users who have signed up for the presale, 4,400 holders, and have raised over $2.7 million. 🔥&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a LIMITED time only, the team is offering a 50% deposit bonus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;👉🧵👇 &lt;a href="https://t.co/CCwI4aICZr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CCwI4aICZr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Tradecurve (@Tradecurveapp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp/status/1673464018651205632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 26, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>
<p></p>
Tradecurve (TCRV) Brings Waves to the Crypto Industry
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) is a new project representing a decentralized platform that offers numerous trading options from a single account. More precisely, you can trade cryptocurrencies, CFDs, forex, options, commodities, EFTs, indices, and bonds. Due to combining all of these options in one platform, Tradecurve (TCRV) is the first project to offer something like this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Tradecurve (TCRV), you can enjoy total anonymity because the platform doesn&rsquo;t implement the lengthy KYC verification method. Also, Tradecurve has some pretty amazing benefits for investors. For instance, you can utilize copy trading that helps you implement successful traders&rsquo; techniques, high leverage starting at 500:1, and AI algorithmic or automatic trading. All you need to do is put crypto as a deposit and enjoy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Tradecurve (TCRV) doesn&rsquo;t stop here. The platform is considering developing a metaverse trading academy that will help less experienced traders connect with industry experts and learn their strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the main reason why Tradecurve (TCRV) draws so much attention is its native TCRV tokens that have faced an 80% price increase while still in presale. You can purchase the TCRV tokens for $0.018. In addition, Tradecurve has already raised $2.8 million from its goal of $20 million, which puts it in a great position to compete with the industry&rsquo;s giants &ndash; Binance and Kraken.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crypto analysts forecast that TCRV tokens will experience a 50x surge while in presale and an additional 100x once they get listed on a tier 1 CEX. So why don&rsquo;t you hurry up and take advantage of the Tradecurve (TCRV) 50% deposit bonus that is available until the 3rd of July?&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The House of Lords passed the Financial Services and Markets Bill today, which aims to regulate bitcoin and crypto in the UK.</p>
Rocket boost for the economy
<p>The upper house of the British government, the House of Lords, has voted to pass into law the Financial Services and Markets Bill that will see the UK embark on a path of acceptance of cryptocurrencies as &ldquo;regulated activity&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Such a bold move from the UK really puts it on the map as regards its announcement last year which stated that it wished to be a global hub for crypto, and flies completely contrary to the anti-crypto environment that permeates the Biden administration in the US.</p>
<p>Hailed as a &ldquo;Rocket Boost for [the] UK economy&rdquo; on the UK Gov website, the bill aims to make a &ldquo;technologically advanced financial services sector&rdquo; that is &ldquo;open&rdquo;, and which will &ldquo;grow the economy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As well as moving away from the US rejection of the crypto industry, the UK will repeal all the old laws that were passed in Brussels when it was a member of the EU. The UK Gov statement on its website affirmed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;By repealing old EU laws set in Brussels it will unlock billions in investment &ndash; cash that can unlock innovation and grow the economy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The statement also read that today&rsquo;s act will regulate crypto assets so that they can be safely adopted in the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as first suggested by Hester Peirce, US SEC commissioner and staunch defender of the innovations brought by the crypto sector, the UK will &ldquo;establish Sandboxes&rdquo; where crypto financial technologies can be tested before being released to the market.</p>
Crypto gold rush begins as US looks on
<p>As the UK government and regulators start to rewrite the financial rule book in order to grease the rails of innovation with full transparency and oversight of its regulators, this move has the potential to set a crypto gold rush in motion.</p>
<p>The European Union has its MiCA regulations coming into force in 2024, Hong Kong, with Chinese backing, is opening itself up as a potential go-to crypto hub in Asia, and other jurisdictions such as Singapore and Dubai are also competing for a share of the crypto industry.</p>
<p>Back over the pond in the US things are starting to look more and more gloomy as the SEC with full backing from the government drives the most innovative industry since the Internet away from its shores and into the welcome embrace of the aforementioned countries. The crypto industry will go where it is most welcome - and this certainly is not in the United States of today.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Several crypto traders crave attention, openly sharing their trades and promoting themselves for others to see and replicate. However, it's critical to be cautious of these traders who only showcase their winning trades. When you examine their profiles, you'll notice a complete absence of losing trades.</p>
<p>Instead of blindly following these "flawless" traders, platforms like Bybit and eToro offer copy trading functionality. This feature lets you discover traders whose strategies and performance you admire and subscribe to their updates.</p>
<p>Once you subscribe to your preferred traders, you can allocate some of your trading funds to them. By activating the autopilot feature on the platform, you can mirror their trades in real-time. It's as simple as finding a trader you resonate with, clicking the "COPY" button, and letting the platform take care of the rest.</p>
<p>In this article, we review the pros and cons of Bybit and eToro to determine which copy trading product is superior for crypto enthusiasts. But first, what does copy trading mean?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
What is Copy Trading?
<p>Copy trading is a form of investing or trading where individuals replicate the trades or investment strategies of other experienced traders. It allows inexperienced or busy traders to automatically copy the trades executed by professionals in real time, typically through a dedicated platform provided by a brokerage or social trading network.</p>
<p>Copy trading usually involves selecting a trader or multiple traders whose performance and strategies align with one's investment goals. Once a trader is chosen, their trades are automatically copied into the investor's trading account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The copied trades are executed proportionally to the investor's available capital, mirroring the actions of the selected trader. This way, investors can benefit from the knowledge and expertise of successful traders without having to actively trade or conduct in-depth market analysis themselves.</p>
<p>Copy trading has gained significant popularity in the retail market due to several reasons:</p>
Accessibility
<p>Copy trading allows retail investors to access the expertise and strategies of professional traders who might otherwise be out of reach. It allows individuals with limited knowledge or time to engage in the crypto market and potentially generate returns.</p>
Learning
<p>Copy trading can serve as a learning tool for inexperienced traders. By observing and replicating the trades of successful traders, individuals can gain insights into various trading strategies, risk management techniques, and market dynamics.</p>
Time-saving
<p>Many retail investors have limited time to dedicate to active trading or market research. Copy trading enables them to participate passively in the market while benefiting from the trades of experienced professionals. This eliminates the need for extensive research, analysis, and trade execution.</p>
Diversification
<p>Copy trading allows investors to diversify their portfolios by following multiple traders with different trading styles and asset preferences. This diversification can help spread risk and potentially enhance returns.</p>
<p>Due to its rising popularity and the demand from retail investors, copy trading has become a staple offering for Bybit, eToro, and many online trading platforms and exchanges. These platforms provide the necessary infrastructure and tools to facilitate copy trading, allowing investors to browse and select from a wide range of traders to copy. Some platforms also provide additional features such as performance statistics, risk metrics, and social interaction capabilities to facilitate the decision-making process for investors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Which is Better? Bybit Or eToro
<p>To determine which platform has the better copy trading platform, let&rsquo;s explore the pros and cons of copy trading on both platforms.</p>
Pros of Bybit Copy Trading
Improved Integration with Derivatives Trading Terminal
<p>Bybit has enhanced its platform with direct trading in a Master Trader Subaccount! Copy Trades are integrated with the main Derivatives Trading terminal, allowing investors to effortlessly copy trades from preferred traders on a single tan instead of a separate Copy Trading tab.</p>
Full Suite of Derivatives Trading Functions
<p>With the integration above, Master Traders can now take advantage of a comprehensive range of trading functions. Previously unavailable in the Copy Trading tab, features like Conditional Orders and Trailing Stops are now accessible to enhance trading capabilities. This integration empowers Master Traders with more tools and flexibility to execute their strategies effectively.&nbsp;</p>
Copy Trading via API

Cons of Bybit Copy Trading
Unavailability in the USA
<p>Bybit Copy Trading is not currently available for users residing in the United States. This limitation restricts access to the Copy Trading feature for traders based in the USA, limiting their ability to take advantage of Bybit's functionalities.</p>
Geographical Restrictions
<p>In addition to the unavailability in the USA, Bybit Copy Trading may have other geographical restrictions that limit access to the feature in certain regions. These restrictions can vary depending on local regulations and compliance requirements, which may prevent traders from specific countries or jurisdictions from participating in Copy Trading on the Bybit platform.</p>
Pros of eToro Copy Trading
Chat With A Wide Selection of Traders
<p>eToro Copy Trading provides users with a diverse range of traders. Users can explore and select traders based on their performance, trading style, and risk profile. Furthermore, the platform enables users to communicate with the chosen traders, allowing for potential knowledge-sharing and insights.</p>
Range of Tradable Assets
<p>Depending on the user's location, eToro offers a variety of tradable assets, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, forex, and commodities. This gives users diverse options for diversifying their investment portfolios and taking advantage of different market opportunities.</p>
Social Trading Community
<p>eToro functions as a social trading platform, allowing users to interact with other members of the eToro community. This social aspect enhances the trading experience by enabling users to share ideas, strategies, and insights with fellow traders. The community aspect fosters collaboration and learning among traders.</p>
Cons of eToro Copy Trading
Execution Delay
<p>One potential drawback of eToro Copy Trading is the possibility of execution delays. Since Copy Trading involves replicating the trades of other traders, there might be a slight delay between the original trade execution and its replication in your account. This delay can result in slight differences in trade prices and potentially impact the overall performance of your copied trades.</p>
Inactivity Fees
<p>eToro imposes inactivity fees on dormant accounts that have been inactive for a certain period of time. If you're not actively participating in Copy Trading or any other trading activities on the platform, and your account remains inactive for an extended period, eToro may charge inactivity fees. These fees can reduce the profitability of your overall investment and should be considered when using the eToro Copy Trading feature.</p>
Verdict
<p>Thanks to its recently improved and updated features, Bybit edges out eToro as the exchange with the best copy trading product. Furthermore, eToro offers multiple investment options but provides access to only 80 cryptocurrencies. Bybit, on the other hand, offers over 350 cryptocurrencies, spot trading, futures, margin trading, perpetual swaps, options, and leveraged tokens. It also offers financial services like lending and borrowing.</p>
<p>Regarding fees, eToro charges a 1% fee for buying and selling cryptocurrencies, while Bybit offers more competitive fees starting at 0.1%.</p>
<p>However, it's important to note that copy trading also carries risks. Past performance does not indicate future results, and blindly copying trades without understanding the underlying strategies and risks can lead to losses. It's crucial for individuals engaging in copy trading to conduct thorough research, diversify their copied trades, and manage their risk effectively.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several crypto traders crave attention, openly sharing their trades and promoting themselves for others to see and replicate. However, it's critical to be cautious of these traders who only showcase their winning trades. When you examine their profiles, you'll notice a complete absence of losing trades.</p>
<p>Instead of blindly following these "flawless" traders, platforms like Bybit and eToro offer copy trading functionality. This feature lets you discover traders whose strategies and performance you admire and subscribe to their updates.</p>
<p>Once you subscribe to your preferred traders, you can allocate some of your trading funds to them. By activating the autopilot feature on the platform, you can mirror their trades in real-time. It's as simple as finding a trader you resonate with, clicking the "COPY" button, and letting the platform take care of the rest.</p>
<p>In this article, we review the pros and cons of Bybit and eToro to determine which copy trading product is superior for crypto enthusiasts. But first, what does copy trading mean?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
What is Copy Trading?
<p>Copy trading is a form of investing or trading where individuals replicate the trades or investment strategies of other experienced traders. It allows inexperienced or busy traders to automatically copy the trades executed by professionals in real time, typically through a dedicated platform provided by a brokerage or social trading network.</p>
<p>Copy trading usually involves selecting a trader or multiple traders whose performance and strategies align with one's investment goals. Once a trader is chosen, their trades are automatically copied into the investor's trading account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The copied trades are executed proportionally to the investor's available capital, mirroring the actions of the selected trader. This way, investors can benefit from the knowledge and expertise of successful traders without having to actively trade or conduct in-depth market analysis themselves.</p>
<p>Copy trading has gained significant popularity in the retail market due to several reasons:</p>
Accessibility
<p>Copy trading allows retail investors to access the expertise and strategies of professional traders who might otherwise be out of reach. It allows individuals with limited knowledge or time to engage in the crypto market and potentially generate returns.</p>
Learning
<p>Copy trading can serve as a learning tool for inexperienced traders. By observing and replicating the trades of successful traders, individuals can gain insights into various trading strategies, risk management techniques, and market dynamics.</p>
Time-saving
<p>Many retail investors have limited time to dedicate to active trading or market research. Copy trading enables them to participate passively in the market while benefiting from the trades of experienced professionals. This eliminates the need for extensive research, analysis, and trade execution.</p>
Diversification
<p>Copy trading allows investors to diversify their portfolios by following multiple traders with different trading styles and asset preferences. This diversification can help spread risk and potentially enhance returns.</p>
<p>Due to its rising popularity and the demand from retail investors, copy trading has become a staple offering for Bybit, eToro, and many online trading platforms and exchanges. These platforms provide the necessary infrastructure and tools to facilitate copy trading, allowing investors to browse and select from a wide range of traders to copy. Some platforms also provide additional features such as performance statistics, risk metrics, and social interaction capabilities to facilitate the decision-making process for investors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Which is Better? Bybit Or eToro
<p>To determine which platform has the better copy trading platform, let&rsquo;s explore the pros and cons of copy trading on both platforms.</p>
Pros of Bybit Copy Trading

<p>Bybit has enhanced its platform with direct trading in a Master Trader Subaccount! Copy Trades are integrated with the main Derivatives Trading terminal, allowing investors to effortlessly copy trades from preferred traders on a single tan instead of a separate Copy Trading tab.</p>
Full Suite of Derivatives Trading Functions
<p>With the integration above, Master Traders can now take advantage of a comprehensive range of trading functions. Previously unavailable in the Copy Trading tab, features like Conditional Orders and Trailing Stops are now accessible to enhance trading capabilities. This integration empowers Master Traders with more tools and flexibility to execute their strategies effectively.&nbsp;</p>
Copy Trading via API
<p>Master Traders can now execute automated strategies with the support of V3/V5 USDT Perpetual OpenAPI. This integration enables the seamless execution of trading strategies, allowing Master Traders to automate their trading activities and optimize their trading performance.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) sought to extend recent gains early in the Asian session as the pair rallied from the 29885.53 area and reached the 30753.74 area following steady upside activity that intensified around the 30127.80 area, an upside price objective related to buying activity that emerged around the 15460 and 19568.52 areas.&nbsp; The 50-bar, 4-hourly simple moving average has provided technical support for BTC/USD for a couple trading sessions.&nbsp; &nbsp;The pair&rsquo;s recent print around the 31443.67 area was a twelve-month high and test of an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; &nbsp;Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The crypto firm has filed a motion to dismiss the legal case brought against it by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), citing a lack of jurisdiction and violation of due process.&nbsp;</p>
Coinbase&rsquo;s Rebuttal To SEC
<p>The industry is closely following the legal battle between US-based crypto exchange Coinbase and the SEC. In the latest development in the matter, the crypto firm has claimed that the regulatory body has no jurisdiction over Coinbase&rsquo;s offerings. The company has even filed a motion with the US court to dismiss the SEC&rsquo;s complaints on the grounds that the digital assets listed in the Coinbase platform are not considered securities and therefore are not under the SEC&rsquo;s purview. This motion is in direct opposition to the SEC&rsquo;s claim that several cryptocurrencies offered on the exchange&rsquo;s wallets or trading platforms are unregistered securities.&nbsp;</p>
&ldquo;Cryptos Are Not Investment Contracts&rdquo;
<p>The SEC had taken its allegations against Coinbase to legal court in early June by filing a lawsuit against the crypto exchange. On June 29, the latter countered back via a 277-page response that declared that these cryptocurrencies do not qualify as investment contracts. This means that these cryptos are not an asset tied to a contract that a promoter could sell for a profit, and the token issuers are not obligated to the investors. Since the profit or loss generated from these crypto transactions depended entirely on the assets themselves and not the company that issued them, Coinbase claimed that they cannot be considered securities. The company mentioned the Supreme Court ruling of the Howey case to support its position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Coinbase filing states,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of the assets the SEC has now identified are, in fact, securities, and for that and other reasons, secondary transactions in those assets are also not securities. [&hellip;] None of these satisfy Howey&rsquo;s definition of an &ldquo;investment contract.&rdquo; In arguing otherwise, the SEC has advanced a novel construction of the operative term that is divorced from [&hellip;] statutory context the Supreme Court and the Commission itself long ago agreed must inform the term&rsquo;s meaning.&rdquo;</p>

Coinbase Claims Abuse Of Process
<p>Notably, the company&rsquo;s rebuttal has also pointed fingers at SEC Chair Gary Gensler and his fluctuating stance on the regulating body&rsquo;s jurisdiction. Coinbase also pointed out its repeated requests for clarity on regulation and its voluntary compliance with the rules of various overlapping regulators, including the SEC, its senior staff members, and the courts regarding the application of securities laws to the crypto industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, the motion claims that the case must be dismissed solely on the grounds of violation of Coinbase&rsquo;s rights to due process and alleged abuse of process.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>FTX is reportedly looking to revive its crypto exchange, according to Wall Street Journal report. </p>
<p>The once-leading crypto exchange FTX which suffered a spectacular collapse and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2022, is reportedly exploring the possibility of reviving the FTX.com exchange.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reports that FTX&rsquo;s newly appointed CEO, John Ray, said the company has begun &ldquo;the process of soliciting interested parties to the reboot of the FTX.com exchange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FTX experienced a severe liquidity crisis in November, prompting customers to withdraw an estimated $6 billion over fear that their assets were unsafe on the exchange. The Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) led crypto empire collapsed after news broke that FTX and its sister trading firm Alameda Research had been sharing assets to boost the company&rsquo;s balance sheet.</p>
<p>FTX&rsquo;s improper trading of customer funds via Alameda saw SBF step down as CEO of the exchange. The disgraced CEO was charged with various federal crimes, including money laundering, fraud, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.</p>
SBF&rsquo;s Request To Dismiss Charges Is Rejected
<p>On Tuesday, &nbsp;New York federal Judge Lewis Kaplan denied the FTX founder&rsquo;s request to dismiss most of the criminal charges against him over the collapse of the exchange.</p>
<p>The disgraced founder has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is now accused of misleading investors and lenders.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried will stand trial in October.</p>
FTX Halts Sale of Its Stake in Anthropic
<p>Bloomberg reported earlier in the week that FTX was set to sell its shares in the AI platform Anthropic but has decided to put the brakes on the sale.</p>
<p>FTX currently holds over $500 million worth of shares in Anthropic, and the exchange has provided no specific reason for the halt of the sale.</p>
FTX Management Recover $7B in Liquid Assets
<p>FTX&rsquo;s newly appointed management team announced this week that it made &ldquo;substantial progress&rdquo; in asset recovery. It revealed that it has thus far recovered $7 billion of liquid assets.</p>
