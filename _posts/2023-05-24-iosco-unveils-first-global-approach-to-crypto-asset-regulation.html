</p>
<p>In a consultation report, the Commission suggests 18 recommendations covering six areas, including cross-border risk and regulatory cooperation, conflicts of interest stemming from the vertical integration of functions and activities, insider trading, fraud, as well as market manipulation, Decrypt reports.</p>
<p>The Commission specifically advised regulators to prohibit crypto firms &ldquo;from combining certain functions in a single legal entity or group of affiliated entities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>IOSCO&rsquo;s report, which outlines policy recommendations for a global approach to crypto and digital asset regulation, comes amid concerns over consumer protection after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission, a policy forum comprising global regulators such as the US SEC, the UK&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority, and Japan&rsquo;s Financial Services Agency, oversees 95% of global securities markets across 130 jurisdictions.</p>
<p>IOSCO chair Jean-Paul Servais said in a press release that the recommendations represent a &ldquo;turning point&rdquo; in addressing the risks associated with crypto assets such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). Servais added:</p>

<p>Crypto business has been allowed to grow on a flawed basis, and it has to be corrected.</p>

<p>LIM Tuang Lee, Chairperson of the IOSCO Board-Level Fintech Task Force (FTF) - set up last year to develop its crypto policy recommendations, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Recommendations in IOSCO&rsquo;s Consultation Report set expectations and guardrails to regulate and supervise crypto-asset markets, which are inherently cross-border in nature.</p>
<p>Crypto-asset service providers need to address unacceptable conflicts of interest and take far more seriously the right of clients to have their monies and assets carefully minded and accounted for.</p>
<p>It is time for Regulators to work together across borders and various jurisdictions to ensure that investor protection and market integrity are upheld in crypto-asset markets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The watchdog said members of the public have until July 31 to send comments and feedback and aims to finalize standards by the end of the year.</p>
Members of the Crypto Industry React Well to IOSCO&rsquo;s Recommendations
<p>Members of the community have responded well to IOSCO&rsquo;s proposed policy framework. In a comment shared with Crypto Daily, Chris Perkins, President, and Managing Partner at CoinFund, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In April, CoinFund released a whitepaper where we put forth ten policy principles for the digital financial system.&nbsp; As such, we remain fully supportive of principles-based regulation and commend IOSCO for their desire for a globally synchronized approach that seeks to protect client assets, offers reasonable and transparent disclosures, and roots out abusive behaviors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We further commend IOSCO for not commingling DeFi in today&rsquo;s policy paper covering crypto asset service providers (CASPs).&nbsp; Finally, we are hopeful that subject matter experts, including trade associations, respond to the numerous queries in the proposal in order to help inform the best policy outcomes.&nbsp; Clearly, as global policies for digital assets are crystalized, details will matter.&rdquo;</p>
