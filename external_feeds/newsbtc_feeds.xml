Adding to the excitement, SOL&#8217;s price witnessed a significant uptick in the last 24 hours, further fueling investor interest and cementing its position as one of the most promising cryptocurrencies in the market.

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price has gone through the roof in recent days. Within the last ten days, the Bitcoin fork has risen by a staggering 168%, temporarily BCH was already up over 200% today. While Bitcoin Cash was still trading at $104 on June 20 and was stuck in a deep bull market that looked bad even compared to other altcoins, a miracle occurred 10 days ago. The price exploded out of nowhere. Why Is Bitcoin Cash Experiencing A Revival? As NewsBTC reported, the reasons for the phenomenal rise in BCH&#8217;s price have already been discussed hotly over the past few days. It was often heard that the listing on the new crypto exchange EDX Markets, which is backed by industry giants Citadel Securities, Charles Schwab Corp. and Fidelity Digital Assets, favored BCH. Furthermore, it has been argued that the price increase is also due to Bitcoin Cash&#8217;s recent &#8220;game-changing&#8221; upgrade. In mid-May, Bitcoin Cash underwent a hard fork that not only improved the network&#8217;s security and privacy measures, but also introduced plans for CashTokens. However, the real reasons for the current Bitcoin Cash pump seem to lie elsewhere: namely in South Korea. Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu reports today that South Korea could be the reason for the BCH pump, looking at where much of the trading volume originates. Related Reading: Kaching! Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Explodes Over 100% – What’s Powering It? In the last 24 hours, the largest exchange in South Korea, Upbit, recorded over $350 million in trading volume for BCH/KRW, accounting for 23.58% of the total trading volume for BCH. Moreover, it is also three times the trading volume of BTC/KRW on Upbit &#8211; an anomaly that has extreme rarity. Renowned crypto whale and trader Andrew Kang agrees, stating that the current BCH rally reminds him of the multi-week Aptos (APT) battle between Korean retailers and &#8220;professional traders.&#8221; Never Skip A Korea Pump? &#8220;Koreans didn&#8217;t need a reason to bid, all that mattered is that it kept going up and early bears got slaughtered,&#8221; Kang said. The trader is alluding to APT&#8217;s 500% rally earlier this year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash Surges 20% In One Day As Market Rebounds, What’s Next? South Koreans pumped Aptos because of a joke about housing affordability. APT&#8217;s trading volume on the South Korean crypto exchange UpBit was often higher than the total trading volume on Binance at the time. It was also beneficial that the Aptos Foundation marketed the altcoin to Koreans from day one. According to Alex Shin, co-founder of crypto venture capital firm Hashed, South Korean crypto investors took Aptos&#8217; three-letter ticker &#8220;APT&#8221; and turned it into a meme alluding to how absurdly expensive it is to buy an &#8220;apartment&#8221; in South Korea. Asia expert Wu said at the time that &#8220;pumping altcoins is a tradition in the Korean community.&#8221; Kang concluded: &#8220;People are shorting more BCH than there is liquid supply of it. It’s highly illiquid since most of the supply is dead. Imagine fading the original cartel&#8221; and added &#8220;disbelief pump.&#8221; At press time, BCH changed hands for $300 per coin.

					<description><![CDATA[Litecoin price is gaining pace above $90 against the US Dollar. LTC could rally further above $100 and rise toward the $110 resistance. Litecoin is steadily moving higher toward $100 against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $90 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $86.20 on the 4-hour chart of the LTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The price could rally further toward the $100 and $110 levels. Litecoin Price Regains Strength After forming a base above the $80 level, Litecoin’s price started a fresh increase against the US Dollar. LTC price broke the $85 resistance to start the current rally. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $86.20 on the 4-hour chart of the LTC/USD pair. The pair rallied over 10% and outperformed both Bitcoin and Ethereum. It even climbed above the $92 level. A high is formed near $95.85 and the price is now consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $81.70 swing low to the $95.85 high. Litecoin is now trading above $90 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $96 zone. The next major resistance is near the $100 level. If there is a clear break above the $100 resistance, the price could start another strong increase. Source: LTCUSD on TradingView.com In the stated case, the price is likely to continue higher toward the $108 and $110 levels. Any more gains might send LTC’s price toward the $120 resistance zone. Are Dips Limited in LTC? If Litecoin price fails to clear the $100 resistance level, there could be a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $92 level. The next major support is forming near the $88.50 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $81.70 swing low to the $95.85 high, below which there is a risk of a move toward the $85.00 support. Any further losses may perhaps send the price toward the $82 support.

<h2>Litecoin Price Regains Strength</h2>
<p>After forming a base above the $80 level, Litecoin’s price started a fresh increase against the US Dollar. LTC price broke the $85 resistance to start the current rally.</p>
<p>There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $86.20 on the 4-hour chart of the LTC/USD pair. The pair rallied over 10% and outperformed both <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-rally-to-32k/?swcfpc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-holds-strong-1800/?swcfpc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">Ethereum</a>. It even climbed above the $92 level. A high is formed near $95.85 and the price is now consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $81.70 swing low to the $95.85 high.</p>
<p>Litecoin is now trading above $90 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $96 zone. The next major resistance is near the $100 level. If there is a clear break above the $100 resistance, the price could start another strong increase.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LTCUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LTCUSD on TradingView.com</a></p>
<p>In the stated case, the price is likely to continue higher toward the $108 and $110 levels. Any more gains might send LTC’s price toward the $120 resistance zone.</p>
<h2>Are Dips Limited in LTC?</h2>
<p>If Litecoin price fails to clear the $100 resistance level, there could be a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $92 level.</p>
<p>The next major support is forming near the $88.50 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $81.70 swing low to the $95.85 high, below which there is a risk of a move toward the $85.00 support. Any further losses may perhaps send the price toward the $82 support.</p>
<p>Technical indicators:</p>
<p>4-hour MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone.</p>
<p>4-hour RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for LTC/USD is above the 50 level.</p>
<p>Major Support Levels – $92.50 followed by $88.50.</p>
<p>Major Resistance Levels – $96.00 and $100.00.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Ethereum and Bitcoin, slowed down on their rally. Following a surge above critical resistance, the cryptocurrencies could retrace and return to critical support levels. Related Reading: Cardano Shows Signs of Recovery: When Will it Reach $0.30? As of this writing, Ethereum (ETH) trades at $1,840 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, ETH has recorded a 2% loss except for Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL), the crypto top 10 by market cap trades in the red. Trouble Ahead For Ethereum? Earlier today, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) announced the launch of a new product. The platform will roll out an Ethereum (ETH/USD) to Bitcoin (BTC/USD) ratio futures contract. The financial product will follow the price of these cryptocurrencies and their correlation. In that way, traders can gain exposure to both cryptocurrencies by holding a single futures contract. According to an official announcement, The product aims to create more opportunities for traders in the nascent industry. However, in the short term, the CME launch hints at a potential downside for the two largest assets in the crypto market. CME Product Could Trigger This Effect In the past, whenever the CME rolled out a Bitcoin or Ethereum-based contract, the price of either asset trended to the downside. A pseudonym analyst forecasted issues for ETH and BTC, probably driven by a “buy the rumor, sell the news” effect. Via Twitter, the analyst stated, reacting to the news: If this has an effect similar to the $BTC &#38; $ETH futures back in the day then the release of this instrument could form a pivot for the ETH/BTC pair. Maybe more down into the release and then a reversal around the end of July? Let&#8217;s see. In response to the forecast, another analyst stated that a “buy the rumor, sell the news effect” will cause ETH’s price to rally into the event.

					<description><![CDATA[Litecoin (LTC) has been one of the most bullish coins for the year 2023 with anticipation around its forthcoming halving event. This has propelled the digital asset toward price increases higher than the market average. And now, once again, the bull case for the digital asset is even stronger as its hashrate has risen rapidly to a new peak. Litecoin Hashrate Touches New All-Time High As the halving event draws closer, more attention is being paid to the Litecoin network. This has led to an increase in the hashrate of the network as more miners are joining the network. Most of the month of June has seen large spikes in hashrate following the rise in the mining difficulty. Related Reading: The Blessing Of July: Can Bitcoin Climb To $36,000 In The Coming Month? The rise in mining difficulty means that it is harder to find a block and as such, miners have to bring more machines online to increase their chances, leading to a spike in the hashrate. And as more miners are brought online, the Litecoin hashrate has touched its highest level yet. According to data from CoinWarz, the Litecoin hashrate reached 958.36 terahashes per second (TH/s), on Wednesday, June 28, 2023. This is a new all-time high for the network whose previous all-time high had data just above 800 TH/s. Litecoin hashrate reaches new all-time high &#124; Source: CoinWarz The hashrate has seen a decline and is now sitting at 735.71 TH/s for the global hashrate. However, the spike points toward a more positive development for its network and its native token LTC. LTC Could Surge Upon Halving Event The Litecoin halving which will cut block rewards down from 12.5 LTC per mined block to 6.25 LTC per mined block is now less than two months away. As halving events have been known to impose a level of scarcity on a digital asset, a surge in the price of LTC is expected as the event draws closer. LTC price sitting above $85 support &#124; Source: LTCUSD on TradingView.com This scarcity would see supply reduce and if demand continues to rise, then LTC is poised to break $100 by the time the halving is done. If this happens, it could also trigger a reasonable rally in the crypto market as positive sentiment and profits from LTC spills over into the rest of the crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Suggests BTC Rally Is Far From Over Litecoin’s rise in hashrate already shows that miners are preparing for the halving, indicating renewed fate in the digital asset. As the next few weeks leading up to the event roll by, investors can expect LTC to trade in the green despite market bearishness. At the time of writing, LTC is trading at a price of $85.40 per coin, down 3.08% in the past week. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Still recording some green on small timeframes, the price of Bitcoin has remained above $30,400. Despite the recent selling pressure across the sector, the support around this level held, providing bulls a chance to fight back. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Battle Against Miners’ $128 Million Move: Is The Bull Run In Danger? As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $30,458 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. The previous week, the number one crypto by market cap recorded similar price action while other cryptocurrencies experienced losses. Bitcoin About To Explode? Data from crypto options platform Deribit, shared by analyst Tom Dunleavy, shows that over $7 billion in these contracts will expire today, Friday 29th. In other words, today, option holders can exercise their right or obligation to buy/sell BTC and other assets at a specific price, depending on their contract. Over $5 billion of the options contracts are based on Bitcoin, while the rest are based on Ethereum, as seen in the chart below. However, option holders could choose to “roll over” their contracts to a later date. As a result, according to Dunleavy, spot prices could see a spike in buying pressure as major option players hedge their positions. This increased buying pressure could see BTC soaring above the $31,000 mark. Via Twitter, the analyst stated: Big options expiration date for both ETH and BTC tomorrow ETH: ~$2B notional BTC: ~$5B notional If these are rolled into more calls we should see spot buying from dealers to hedge their books; puts opposite story. Either way expect some vol (volatility). As Dunleavy claims, the crypto market is poised for volatility, whichever direction. The chart above shows the Max Pain price for BTC options, which is $26,500. Max Pain is the price Bitcoin must trade to deny most options traders from booking profits. In that sense, the BTC price will likely turn to the downside with a spike in volatility. Beyond $31,000, What’s Next For BTC? Analysis and crypto education firm Blofin recently posted a report on BTC&#8217;s short- and long-term risks and scenarios. The firm claims the recent rally was driven by a “hunger for positive news” and a “rebalancing” of internal liquidity. In other words, crypto investors got bullish and took money from altcoins into BTC. However, there is still a liquidity issue within the sector that could limit any rally, but there is a silver lining in this scenario. Related Reading: Cardano Shows Signs of Recovery: When Will it Reach $0.30? Blofin stated: The decline in the price of BTC will be more limited, with a relatively small probability of falling below $28k, while the upward space is relatively large, and there is even hope for a rebound to $35k and above.

					<description><![CDATA[Cardano (ADA) has shown signs of recovery in recent trading sessions, although its price continues to linger near a significant resistance level. In the past 24 hours, ADA witnessed a modest 2% increase, but weekly gains have been erased, resulting in a 7% depreciation on the weekly chart. Related Reading: Slovakian Lawmakers Pass Amendment Lowering Cryptocurrency Taxation The technical outlook has yet to present bullish signals, with both demand and accumulation remaining relatively low. Bitcoin dominance increased while trading within the $30,000 price range. Major altcoins also experienced minor gains in the past few days. Although Bitcoin displayed a bullish trend, its price fluctuated, and other altcoins followed similar patterns. For the Cardano price to experience upward movement, Bitcoin must exhibit another surge from its current price level. If ADA manages to sustain above the current support line with the support of BTC, the altcoin may soon attempt to break through immediate price resistance. The decrease in ADA&#8217;s market capitalization indicates the continued influence of bearish sentiment in the market. Cardano Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, ADA was observed to be trading at $0.27, a significant resistance point for the altcoin. Previous price action has indicated that the bulls have faced rejection at this level in the past. Additionally, consolidation has been observed around this price mark. If ADA continues its upward movement, it may attempt to trade near or even surpass the $0.30 level. However, in the case of extended consolidation, ADA could experience a dip towards its support line at $0.26. Notably, the $0.26 level has acted as a bullish order block for the coin, indicating a price reversal and subsequent upward movement after reaching this level. This observation suggests the possibility of incoming bullishness for ADA. Technical Analysis Despite an increase in buying strength, the overall demand for ADA has remained low. This is evident from the Relative Strength Index (RSI) failing to move above the half-line, indicating that sellers have maintained a strong presence in the market. However, there is an expectation for a potential resurgence in demand if the price manages to surpass the $0.27 zone. Similarly, the price falling below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line indicates that sellers have been driving the price momentum in the market. ADA has exhibited buy signals that suggest a potential price reversal in the near future. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has formed green histograms, which are tied to buy signals for the coin. This indicates positive momentum for ADA and suggests a potential upward movement in price. Related Reading: Dogecoin Faces Downward Pressure – Will DOGE Bulls Avert A Further Slide? Additionally, the Bollinger Bands, which provide insights into price volatility and fluctuation, have constricted. This tightening of the bands indicates that the trading range has become tight. Therefore, there is a possibility of a price breakout. Featured image from UnSplash, charts from TradingView.com]]></description>

<p>ADA has exhibited buy signals that suggest a potential price reversal in the near future. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has formed green histograms, which are tied to buy signals for the coin. This indicates positive momentum for ADA and suggests a potential upward movement in price.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Bollinger Bands, which provide insights into price volatility and fluctuation, have constricted. This tightening of the bands indicates that the trading range has become tight. Therefore, there is a possibility of a price breakout.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Lawmakers in Slovakia have approved new legislation, with a resounding 112-2 vote in favor, aimed at reducing taxes associated with the sale of crypto or digital assets. In addition to the aforementioned tax-cutting law, members of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, the country&#8217;s parliament, have further endorsed additional measures that impact cryptocurrency holders. The National Council of the Slovak Republic passed the amendment that will result in a reduction of personal income tax on profits derived from the sale of cryptocurrencies. This tax reduction specifically applies to individuals who have held the cryptocurrencies for a minimum period of one year. The recent vote marked the third reading of the bill in the National Council. According to reports, the Ministry of Finance in Slovakia has projected that the amendment, once implemented, will have a financial impact of approximately 30 million euros per year.
