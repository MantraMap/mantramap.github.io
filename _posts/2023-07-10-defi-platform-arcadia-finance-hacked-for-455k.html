<p>Another day, another DeFi hack. Arcadia Finance has reportedly been the victim of an exploit which allowed hackers to drain roughly $455,000. </p>
<p>Decentralised finance (DeFi) platform Arcadia Finance has reportedly become the latest victim of a hack. Blockchain investigating firm PeckShields reported the exploit and said it was due to &ldquo;the lack of untrusted input validation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>PeckShields alerted about a code vulnerability that allowed a hacker to drain funds worth about $455,000 from Ethereum (darcWETH) and Optimism (darcUSDC) vaults. According to the firm, the code vulnerability lacked a validation mechanism to cross-check unverified inputs. It added, &ldquo;There is a lack of reentrancy protection, which allows for the instant liquidation to bypass the internal vault health check.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PeckShields also reported the exploiter transferred roughly 179 ETH by bridging 148 ETH and swapping 59,000 USDC to crypto mixer Tornado Cash.</p>
Arcadia TVL Drops 76%
<p>Following the hack, DeFiLlama reported that Arcadia&rsquo;s Total Value Locked (TVL) dropped by a staggering 76%, from $605,000 to $145,000.</p>
<p>The exploit on Arcadia Finance comes only days after a $130 million hack on Multichain&rsquo;s MPC bridge platform.</p>
<p>Observers noted $102 million worth of crypto was withdrawn from the Multichain Fantom bridge on the Ethereum side. $666,000 worth of Dogecoin (DOGE) and $5 million from Moonriver were also removed. An additional 7214 Wrapped Ether tokens, 1024 Wrapped Bitcoin, and $58 million worth of USDC tokens were drained from the Fantom bridge&rsquo;s Ethereum smart contract.</p>
Arcadia Acknowledges Exploit
<p>Arcadia Finance acknowledged the exploit on their protocol but has yet to provide further information.</p>
<p>The platform informed its users this morning that it had contacted the hacker.</p>
