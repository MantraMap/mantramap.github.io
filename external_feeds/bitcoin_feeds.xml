The move follows the acceptance by the SEC of Valkyrie&#x2019;s application for a spot bitcoin ETF last month.</strong></p>
<h2>Asset Manager Valkyrie Seeks Regulatory Nod for Ether Futures ETF</h2>
<p>Tennessee-headquartered asset management firm Valkyrie is applying for authorization for an &#x201C;Ethereum Strategy ETF&#x201D; that will invest in ether futures and other collateral assets, Reuters reported quoting documents filed with the U.S. securities regulator.</p>
<p>The submission comes amid increased <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-us-etfs-signal-renewed-bitcoin-interest-btcs-limited-hot-supply-eyes-bull-market/">interest</a> from well-established players in the sector in launching crypto-based ETFs, which has become a cause for optimism in the crypto space after a difficult year for the whole digital assets industry.</p>
<p>U.S. regulators allowed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETFs</a> tracking the price of bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) futures in 2021 and the first bitcoin futures-based exchange-traded fund began trading in October of that year. Expectations that the product could increase investments in crypto assets boosted market prices at the time.</p>

<p>However, authorities in the United States are yet to approve a spot bitcoin ETF, something that Canada, for example, has already done. The SEC has in the past rejected a number of applications for such ETFs but in mid-July of this year <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-accepts-blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-application/">agreed</a> to review one filed by financial powerhouse Blackrock.</p>
<p>Soon after that, the Commission formally <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-securities-regulator-accepts-valkyries-spot-bitcoin-etf-application/">accepted</a> Valkyrie&#x2019;s spot bitcoin ETF application as well. The company, which was already offering a bitcoin futures ETF, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/valkyrie-funds-joins-race-for-sec-approval-as-it-files-application-for-spot-bitcoin-etf/">submitted</a> its application for its &#x201C;Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund&#x201D; on June 21, days after the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">filing</a> for Blackrock&#x2019;s &#x201C;Ishares Bitcoin Trust.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Last week, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-could-approve-spot-bitcoin-etf-within-6-months-says-mike-novogratz/">revealed</a> that the U.S. SEC could approve a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund within six months. Meanwhile, London-headquartered company Jacobi Asset Management introduced Europe&#x2019;s first spot bitcoin ETF on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange.</p>

Judge Torres&#x2019; approval came one day after Ripple Labs filed its objection to the SEC&#x2019;s request.</strong></p>
<h2>Judge Approves SEC&#x2019;s Request in Ripple-<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> Case</h2>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#x2019;s request seeking to file an interlocutory appeal in the Ripple case over <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> has been granted by District Judge Analisa Torres despite Ripple&#x2019;s objection to the regulator&#x2019;s request.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/FilanLaw/status/1692247167388275118/photo/1">court order</a> filed on Aug. 17, Judge Torres stated that the court had reviewed the SEC&#x2019;s and the defendants&#x2019; letters, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>The SEC&#x2019;s request to file a motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal is granted.</p></blockquote>
<p>The judge further ordered the SEC to file its motion by Aug. 18 and the defendants (Ripple Labs, CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and co-founder Chris Larsen) to file their opposition papers by Sept. 1. The SEC must then file its reply, if any, by Sept. 8.</p>
<p>The securities watchdog <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-seeks-to-appeal-ripple-xrp-ruling-requests-stay-of-proceedings/">filed a request</a> on Aug. 9 seeking permission from Judge Torres to file an interlocutory appeal to some parts of her ruling in the Ripple case over <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>. The SEC also seeks to stay the district court proceedings.</p>
<p>On Aug. 16, Ripple Labs, Garlinghouse, and Larsen filed their opposition to the SEC&#x2019;s request. Ripple&#x2019;s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, <a href="https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1691917112019960288">tweeted</a> Wednesday: &#x201C;We oppose the SEC&#x2019;s request for an interlocutory appeal. There is no extraordinary circumstance here that would justify departing from the rule requiring all issues as to all parties to be resolved before an appeal.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Lawyer James K. Filan <a href="https://twitter.com/FilanLaw/status/1692247167388275118">clarified</a> on Twitter what Judge Torres has approved. &#x201C;The court has set a briefing schedule for the SEC&#x2019;s request to file a motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal. This does not mean an interlocutory appeal has been authorized. It just means the SEC is allowed to request it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The SEC is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-isnt-appealing-whether-xrp-is-a-security-lawyer-clarifies/">not seeking to dispute</a> whether <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> is a security; it is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-seeks-to-appeal-ripple-xrp-ruling-requests-stay-of-proceedings/">seeking to appeal</a> the court&#x2019;s decision on programmatic offers and sales of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> on crypto exchanges as well as Ripple&#x2019;s &#x201C;other distributions.&#x201D; Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reminder &#x2014; the request for appeal (even if granted) doesn&#x2019;t change the fact that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> is not a security. That&#x2019;s not up for debate / trial.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Do you think the SEC will successfully appeal the Ripple ruling over <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>? Let us know in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

<h2>Bitcoin Wavers and $1B in Crypto Derivatives Trades Liquidated</h2>
<p>As we approach the weekend, the crypto sector grapples with a pronounced slide, depreciating 8% against the dollar in the last 24 hours. As of 7:22 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, the global trade volume over the preceding day sits at roughly $69.60 billion.</p>
<p>Notably, $37.62 billion of this sum represents stablecoin trading, signaling a considerable shift of traders either pivoting to stablecoin pairs or gravitating towards the dollar-anchored token ecosystem. Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), the crypto vanguard, has diminished 8.6% daily and 10.3% weekly.</p>

<p>About $23.22 billion of the day&#x2019;s global trade volume is attributed to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> transactions. Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) lost 9.3% against the dollar today and stands 11.3% lower this week. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>, notably, felt a sharp decline on Thursday, plummeting 14.7% daily and 20.7% weekly.</p>
<p>Excluding stablecoins, every top-ten cryptocurrency suffered notable declines amidst this turbulence. Although <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> exchanged hands at $26,400 per coin at 7:22 p.m., it had briefly dipped to $25,600 a coin just an hour earlier. Data from coinglass.com reveals that crypto enthusiasts faced over $1 billion in liquidations in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>Bitcoin derivatives traders holding long positions bore a hefty loss of $477 million throughout the day. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> derivatives traders with long stakes saw $307 million vanish, while <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>&#x2019;s long positions encountered approximately $24.39 million in liquidations.</p>

<p>Breaking down the $1.03 billion liquidated in the past day: $189.67 million were shorts, and a massive $826.60 million were longs. While <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> bore the brunt of the day&#x2019;s losses, SHIB experienced a 13.8% dip following <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/turbulence-in-shibariums-debut-1-7m-eth-stuck-and-a-crypto-whale-shifts-the-tide/">complications</a> with the Shibarium launch.</p>

<h2>Canaan&#x2019;s Big Reveal: Setting the Stage for a New Era in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> Mining?</h2>
<p>Canaan, the publicly-traded bitcoin mining rig producer, is gearing up to celebrate its decade-long journey. This Thursday, they <a href="https://www.canaan.io/1555.html">disclosed plans</a> for an event in Singapore on September 12, 2023, aptly named &#x201C;Avalon Bitcoin & Crypto Day.&#x201D; The event promises to be a hotspot for bitcoin mining bigwigs, with Canaan emphasizing a rich tapestry of &#x201C;insight exchange, collaborative learning, and networking avenues.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Canaan remains tight-lipped about the specifics of its upcoming innovation, leaving people guessing whether it&#x2019;s a fresh Avalon model. However, their teaser does promise the audience will &#x201C;witness the debut of a groundbreaking, industry-redefining product that will shape the future of bitcoin mining.&#x201D; Moreover, Canaan&#x2019;s online store is showcasing massive discounts on older Avalon models, slashing prices by 77% to 89%.</p>
<p>To put things in perspective, the <a href="https://shop.canaan.io/products/avalon-miner-a1326-115t-3300w?VariantsId=10202">Avalon Miner A1326</a>, boasting a power of 115 terahash per second (TH/s), which once carried a hefty $8,800 price tag, can now be snagged for just $1,495. This move by Canaan comes on the heels of an announcement from its rival, Bitmain, who also plans a product reveal this September. Bitmain has played its cards, unveiling the name of its upcoming rig as the Antminer S21, touting it as a pioneer with an efficiency below 20 joules per terahash (J/T).</p>
<p>With the mining industry race always moving at a relentless pace, both Canaan and Bitmain seem to be vying to outdo Microbt&#x2019;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/microbt-unveils-new-whatsminer-bitcoin-mining-rig-with-320-th-s-setting-new-standard-for-hashpower/">recent addition</a> to the Whatsminer series. The Whatsminer M53S++ boasts an impressive 320 terahash per second (TH/s) and an efficiency of 22 J/T. Notably, Luxor got a <a href="https://hashrateindex.com/blog/a-look-inside-an-immersion-and-hydro-bitcoin-mine/">sneak peek</a> of the M53S++ in late July, witnessing its capacity overclocked to an astounding 360 TH/s.</p>

<p>In the financial realm, <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-CAN/">Canaan&#x2019;s shares</a> have seen better days, with a 13% dip against the U.S. dollar in the past week and a slightly steeper 15% decline over the last month. Since the announcement, however, pre-market values show Canaan&#x2019;s shares could see a 2% rise during the trading day on August 17, 2023. On a brighter note, Canaan&#x2019;s year-to-date performance showcases a 17% uptick against the greenback.</p>

Amid Bybit&#8217;s announcement, Paypal&#8217;s PYUSD token has seen little movement as most of the supply is held by the contract and the Paxos Treasury.</strong></p>
<h2>Dubai-Based Bybit Prepares to List Paypal&#8217;s New Stablecoin, PYUSD</h2>
<p>On Thursday, August 17, 2023, the Dubai-based digital currency exchange Bybit said it will list Paypal&#8217;s new stablecoin, PYUSD. Bybit, a cryptocurrency exchange co-founded in March 2018 by Ben Zhou, is one of the largest exchanges to announce it will list the PYUSD token to date.</p>
<p>“We’ll List PYUSD imminently,” Zhou explained in a statement sent to Bitcoin.com News. “We are truly impressed by Paypal&#8217;s introduction of the USD stablecoin (PYUSD) and its vision for the future of payments.”</p>
<p>Zhou added:</p>
<blockquote><p>This launch is another step on the path toward reforming our antiquated global payments system. Indeed, the underlying blockchain technology is characterized by cost-efficiency, rapid settlement times, and global reach, which presents an opportunity to not only enhance the user experience but also make marked efficiency gains in the transfer of capital potentially saving billions of dollars per year.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ten days ago, payments giant Paypal <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/payments-giant-paypal-launches-dollar-backed-stablecoin-pyusd/">announced</a> the PYUSD launch, but the token had been relatively inactive. However, since Bybit&#8217;s announcement, Bybit&#8217;s hot wallet shows <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0d5a9650b803e48b0fb142805131cefac54fe88d3b3eee13b8ff122d7246ead8">interaction</a> with the <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8">PYUSD contract</a>. Currently, the contract and the Paxos Treasury hold about 99% of the total supply, with the remainder used in test transactions. As of 9:40 a.m. Eastern Time on Aug. 17, 2023, there are 32 holders and a total of 216 PYUSD transfers.</p>
<p>“At Bybit, we recognize the strategic importance of this initiative and wholeheartedly support Paypal&#8217;s efforts to bridge the gap between traditional and digital currencies and will list PYUSD for spot trading imminently,” Zhou stated on Thursday. The Bybit co-founder further noted that Paypal&#8217;s partnership with Paxos Trust Company “underscores the rigorous regulatory approach and commitment to compliance, which are paramount in this evolving landscape.”</p>

In an interview with Larry Kudlow, Trump stated while the U.S. retains significant power, its position is “waning” concerning its currency.</strong></p>
<h2>The Diminishing Dollar? Trump Points to a Shift in Global Currency Dynamics</h2>
<p>Always candid, Trump <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-warns-dollar-losing-dominance-country-going-hell#">engaged in a conversation</a> with Fox Business&#8217; Larry Kudlow to examine the nation&#8217;s international standing. As he seeks re-election in 2024, Trump may become the Republican challenger to incumbent Democrat <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-jim-rickards-biden-is-now-a-world-historic-figure-he-has-destroyed-the-dollar/">Joe Biden</a>. Asserting that America has suffered under Biden&#8217;s leadership, Trump accuses the current administration of lacking &#8220;common sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>“They don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing and they&#8217;re destroying our country,” Trump declared about the Biden administration. He expressed confidence that if re-elected, his administration would promptly rectify matters. &#8220;[If] you look at our airports, you look at our terminals, you look at our filthy roads and broken roads and everything else, we&#8217;re like a Third World country,&#8221; Trump informed the broadcast host.</p>

<p>Subject to numerous ongoing investigations and indictments following his tenure, the former president emphasized his conviction that America will continue to decline and could lose its preeminent status. &#8220;Our country is going to hell and we&#8217;re not going to be the big boy,&#8221; Trump professed. “We have power, but it&#8217;s waning. In fact, it&#8217;s waning in terms of our currency.”</p>
<p>Trump further commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not just talking about the value of our currency, I&#8217;m talking about our currency being used throughout the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Trump expounded upon nations <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-expansion-to-make-west-recognize-new-world-order-de-dollarization-uae-professor/">opting against</a> utilizing the U.S. dollar, contending that China aims to supplant it with the yuan &#8211; an idea previously deemed &#8220;unthinkable.&#8221; However, Trump asserts it is now under <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-expects-us-rating-downgrade-to-accelerate-de-dollarization-process/">consideration</a>. Ultimately, he believes inflated energy costs are responsible for these issues.</p>

<p>&#8220;Inflation was caused, in my opinion, by energy, because it&#8217;s so big,&#8221; Trump explained to Kudlow. &#8220;It&#8217;s like all encompassing, everything. You make donuts in the ovens and the trucks that deliver them, and no matter what you do, it&#8217;s so much about energy.&#8221; Trump&#8217;s exclusive Fox Business interview with Kudlow succeeded his <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-us-president-donald-trump-warns-of-economic-depression-if-hes-not-elected/">recent warning</a> that America would face recession if he isn&#8217;t re-elected. He also pledged to facilitate a swift peace treaty between Russia and Ukraine, among other promises.</p>

Since hitting a four-month high last Saturday, SHIB has struggled to find a firm floor. On the other hand, Solana ended a recent losing streak.</strong></p>
<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h2>
<p>Shiba inu (SHIB) was a notable gainer on Thursday, as the meme coin moved lower for a fifth consecutive day.</p>
<p>SHIB/USD dropped to a bottom at $0.000008543 earlier in today’s session, following a peak of $0.000009854 the day prior.</p>
<p>This decline pushed SHIB to its lowest point since August 4, when price traded at a low of $0.00000827.</p>

<p>The latest drop comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell below a support point of 50.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 44.31, with a floor of 39.00 the next possible target.</p>
<p>In the event it reaches this target, SHIB will likely be trading below $0.000008000.</p>

<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>On the other hand, solana (SOL) returned to the green during today’s session, snapping a two-day losing streak in the process.</p>
<p>Following a low of $22.49 on Wednesday, SOL/USD climbed to an intraday high of $23.58 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The move comes as bullish pressure resurfaced, following a marginal breakout below a support point at $22.50.</p>

<p>This rebound comes following a recent upward crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving average.</p>
<p>Despite this, there is still a high level of market uncertainty, as price strength hovers close to a key floor at 44.00.</p>
<p>Should it break out of this point, SOL could move below $22.00.</p>

This platform is designed to bolster decentralized app growth while tackling Ethereum&#x2019;s scalability and transaction fee challenges. Yet, even amidst the celebrations, SHIB, the project&#x2019;s native cryptocurrency, slid over 8% against the U.S. dollar, mirroring the larger crypto market&#x2019;s decline. Adding to the concerns, complications arose with the Shibarium bridge, leaving roughly $1.7 million in ether seemingly in a state of suspension.</strong></p>
<h2>Shibarium&#x2019;s Rocky Start: Stuck Funds and a Whale&#x2019;s Strategic Play</h2>
<p>The Shiba Inu development team has finally introduced the Shibarium L2 blockchain, tailor-made for the SHIB, BONE, LEASH, and TREAT crypto family. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/shibs-shibarium-public-beta-is-planned-for-deployment-in-q3/">Unveiled last year</a>, this network incorporates a new proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus method dubbed &#x201C;proof-of-participation&#x201D; (PoP).</p>
<p>At its core, validators commit coins as collateral to authenticate transactions and produce new blocks. As of now, Shibarium extends two capabilities: bridging the gap between the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> blockchain and its platform, and allowing token delegation to secure Bone rewards.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, although the option is yet to roll out, enthusiasts will have the chance to enlist as validators and fortify the network. Additionally, Shibarium&#x2019;s beta phase witnessed the creation of 21 million distinct wallets before its official launch.</p>

<p>However, by Wednesday night, close to 10 p.m. Eastern Time, murmurs of Shibarium facing hiccups began to surface. <a href="https://twitter.com/BeosinAlert/status/1692003409602445743?s=20">Reports</a> suggest that all <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> and BONE deposits directed to the Shibarium bridge are at a standstill. This includes a staggering <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1691962308522582195?s=20">600,000 BONE ($762K)</a> and 954 ether ($1.7M). What&#x2019;s more, the Shibarium network hit a snag in block processing, with <a href="https://www.shibariumscan.io/">no block confirmations</a> for over five hours since the troubles commenced.</p>
<p>Some people <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoLeadDev/status/1692107789739466796?s=20">suspect</a> that the devs will be able to fix the situation accordingly, while others who <a href="https://twitter.com/BabyShibarium/status/1692111833979670839?s=20">deposited</a> <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> into the bridge are &#x201C;quite anxious.&#x201D; While Shibarium grappled with its challenges, onchain analysts from Lookonchain <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1692070149535490277?s=20">revealed</a> that a cryptocurrency &#x2018;whale&#x2019; liquidated its entire holdings of BONE and SHIB to scoop up <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/pepe-token-continues-downward-spiral-registers-60-drop-from-all-time-high/">PEPE</a>.</p>
<p>According to Lookonchain&#x2019;s data, in the span of the last three days, this whale offloaded &#x201C;979,469 BONE in exchange for 787 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> ($1.44M) at a rate of $1.47.&#x201D; Following the Shibarium&#x2019;s block production hiccup, this same whale funneled a staggering 143 billion SHIB, valued at $1.32 million, into the Binance exchange.</p>

Bearish sentiment increased following the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes, where the Federal Reserve hinted at further rate hikes. Ethereum fell below $1,800 today.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) neared a two-month low during today&#x2019;s session, as traders continued to react to the latest FOMC minutes report.</p>
<p>Following a high of $29,192.26 on hump-day, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD dropped to an intraday low of $28,376.50 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>This was the weakest point that bitcoin had fallen to since June 21, when it was at a low of $28,271.</p>

<p>The drop comes as a recent upwards crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages has reversed course.</p>
<p>Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) has plunged deeper into oversold territory, and is now tracking at 35.05.</p>
<p>This is its lowest level since March, and should momentum continue to fall, price could end up at a floor of $27,600.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Bearish sentiment was also high in ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>), which fell to a multi-month low of its own on Thursday.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD bottomed out at $1,783.05 on Thursday, less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $1,826.82.</p>
<p>As a result of this sell-off, ethereum slipped to its lowest point since June 20, when it almost moved under the $1,700 mark.</p>

<p>Ethereum&#x2019;s RSI is also currently hovering in bear territory, with a reading at 33.67, and appears to be angling to reach a floor at 30.00.</p>
<p>Should it reach this point, ethereum will likely be trading around a long-term support point of $1,750.</p>

The submission contains information about the balance of an ethereum wallet, which collects proceeds from the sales of Trump-branded non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the income it produced.</strong></p>
<h2>Donald Trump Declares Crypto Wallet With at Least $1 Million in Ethereum</h2>
<p>The frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination who hopes to win a second non-consecutive term in the White House, Donald Trump, has filed a new disclosure as a candidate which reveals various sources of income that can help him fund his campaign.</p>
<p>Among the major ones are businesses and properties like a company in Miami that owns golf courses and a resort valued at more than $50 million which has generated $145.8 million in income in 2022 and through the end of April of this year, Bloomberg noted in a report.</p>
<p>Federal candidates in the U.S. are required to disclose the value of certain assets and some types of income in broad ranges. These include dividends, capital gains, interest, rent, and royalties, for example. Income from some other sources, such as salaries and speaking fees, must be disclosed in exact amounts.</p>

<p>Trump&#x2019;s filing shows that a company which made $9.7 million by licensing his image on non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/non-fungible-tokens-nft-5115211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a>), CIC Digital LLC, held a cryptocurrency wallet with at least $1 million in ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>), which produced income of $2.8 million.</p>
<p>In a previous disclosure in July, Donald Trump <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/trump-reveals-nft-income-crypto-holdings-in-new-disclosure/">declared</a> that CIC Digital&#x2019;s wallet had no more than $500,000 and generated no income. At the time, the firm also had a fiat bank account with less than $1,000 in the balance.</p>
<p>The NFTs called <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/trump-digital-trading-cards/analytics">Trump Digital Trading Cards</a>, which depict America&#x2019;s 45th president as numerous characters, including Superman, were launched in December, last year, when the first badge was sold in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>Unlike other hopefuls to become the Republican Party&#x2019;s presidential nominee, like Florida Governor <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ron-desantis-vows-to-end-bidens-war-on-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-as-us-president/">Ron DeSantis</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cbdc-is-grave-threat-to-liberty-presidential-hopeful-vivek-ramaswamy-warns/">Vivek Ramaswamy</a> who have been more positive towards cryptocurrencies, Donald Trump has not been keen to embrace bitcoin and the like. During his presidency, he once stated that their value is based on thin air.</p>
