The representatives believe Apple&#8217;s policies might &#8220;limit innovation and American technology leadership&#8221; in these areas.</strong></p>
<h2>Bilirakis and Schakowsky Inquire About Apple&#8217;s Blockchain Policies</h2>
<p>Representatives Gus Bilirakis and Jan Schakowsky have sent a letter to Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, requiring information about the rules on the iOS App Store regarding emergent technologies such as blockchain, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other distributed ledger technologies.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://bilirakis.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/bilirakis.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/23.07.28-apple-app-store-blockchain-letter_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter</a>, they express their concern about Apple&#8217;s walled garden policies&#8217; effect on the development of apps using these tools, which might hurt innovation from American companies in this area. Furthermore, they also state Apple appears to have used &#8220;its App Store guidelines to increase its own profits and reduce the utility of apps in blockchains, NFTs, and other blockchain-related technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, Bilirakis and Schakowsky remember Apple&#8217;s position while enforcing its policies against Coinbase Wallet in December. At the time, Apple disabled NFT transactions in the Ios version of the app, requiring blockchain fee payments to go through their in-app purchase system to collect 30% of each transaction.</p>
<p>Coinbase Wallet rejected this rule due to feasibility problems. At the time, it <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinbaseWallet/status/1598354821983125506?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For anyone who understands how NFTs and blockchains work, this is clearly not possible. Apple’s proprietary in-app purchase system does not support crypto so we couldn’t comply even if we tried.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This 30% cut was part of the legal battle between Apple and Epic Games when the latter tried to sidestep the payment of this fee by offering direct purchases of Fortnite&#8217;s V-bucks, the game&#8217;s official token, through means different from Apple&#8217;s system. The anti-payment steering rules issue is still being <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/antitrust/epic-asks-supreme-court-to-halt-apples-app-anti-steering-rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">litigated</a>.</p>
<p>The representatives also touched on the case of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/axie-infinity-origins-breaks-through-apples-app-store-barrier-now-accessible-to-select-ios-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axie Infinity</a>, a popular play-to-earn game that had to launch a limited version of its app on Ios. This &#8220;lite&#8221; version excluded core NFT functionality and is still unavailable for U.S.-based users.</p>
<p>Finally, Bilirakis and Schakowsky stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is essential that Congress fully understand the App Store guidelines and the extent to which these guidelines limit innovation and impact American technological leadership. We want to create a level playing field within the industry so that American ingenuity can continue to thrive.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Apple&#8217;s Tight Crypto Rules</h2>
<p>Apple announced this set of tight blockchain rules in October, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/apple-unveils-stricter-app-store-rules-for-crypto-and-nfts-critic-says-firm-wants-to-keep-money-in-its-ecosystem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailing</a> that apps &#8220;may not use their own mechanisms to unlock content or functionality,&#8221; including crypto and NFTs. Also, all of the NFT sales offered by these apps might go through Apple&#8217;s in-app purchase system, so long as these don&#8217;t present &#8220;buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Kenya&#x2019;s Data Protection Laws</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The Kenyan data regulator, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC), has called for &#x201C;increased vigilance&#x201D; by residents seeking to get their hands on Worldcoin&#x2019;s &#x201C;free&#x201D; tokens. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/ODPC_KE/status/1684869953378283520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Eembeddedtimeline%7Ctwterm%5Escreen-name%3AODPC_KE%7Ctwcon%5Es1">statement</a> issued via Twitter on July 28, ODPC stated that Worldcoin&#x2019;s activities in the East African nation are governed by the country&#x2019;s 2019 Data Protection Act.&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">STATEMENT: <a href="https://twitter.com/ODPC_KE?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ODPC_KE</a> Calls for Vigilance from the Public as It Engages WorldCoin on Compliance with Data Protection Act, 2019. <a href="https://t.co/xoY7uOqcNG">pic.twitter.com/xoY7uOqcNG</a></p>
<p>&#x2014; OFFICE OF THE DATA PROTECTION COMMISSIONER (@ODPC_KE) <a href="https://twitter.com/ODPC_KE/status/1684869953378283520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 28, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
According to the data regulator, the Kenyan protection data law gives the ODPC the authority to conduct assessments or request information which helps it ascertain if Worldcoin is adhering to the law. The ODPC added:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>As the ODPC conducts its assessment of Worldcoin&#x2019;s practices to ensure compliance with the law, Kenyans are urged to ensure they receive proper information before disclosing any personal or sensitive data. Individuals are advised to thoroughly inquire about how their data will be used.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
In the same statement, Kenya&#x2019;s Data Commissioner, Immaculate Kassait is quoted warning of the consequences for the token recipients and issuers should the ODPC fail to ensure Worldcoin and others&#x2019; compliance with the law.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Worldcoin Free Money</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The warning by the Kenyan data regulator follows reports that hundreds of residents had rushed to get their eyeballs scanned by Worldcoin orbs located at the supermarket chain Quickmart&#x2019;s 13 outlets in Nairobi. According to a <a href="https://nation.africa/kenya/news/kenyans-scanning-their-eyeballs-worldcoin-cryptocurrency-tokens-4319600">report</a> in The Nation, residents who signed up and had their eyes scanned by the Worldcoin orb received 25 WLD tokens. Some of the token recipients reportedly converted their WLD tokens to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> before eventually converting the stablecoins to Kenyan shillings.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Some of the young Kenyans who rushed to get their eyeballs scanned only did so after learning of the opportunity to get easy money via the WLD tokens.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;I was here by 5 am because there has been a lot of talk on Tik Tok and Instagram about the free money Worldcoin is giving all those who download their app and subscribe, we are for the iris scanner so that we can be sorted,&#x201D; Brian Mwangi, one of the WLD token recipients, said.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The Kenyan data regulator&#x2019;s investigation comes after the French National Commission for Informatics and Liberty (CNIL) launched <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-french-privacy-regulator-probes-worldcoins-biometric-data-practices/">a similar inquiry</a> into Worldcoin&#x2019;s practices.&#13;<br />

<h2>Plea for Justice: Senator&#8217;s Push for Ulbricht&#8217;s Clemency During Biden&#8217;s Maine Tour</h2>
<p>When Joe Biden, the 46th and sitting president of the United States, made his way to Auburn, Maine, he marked the first presidential visit to the town in an entire 110-year span. Speaking at the Auburn Manufacturing site, Biden proudly proclaimed his conviction that &#8216;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bidenomics-agenda-struggles-to-gain-support-as-joe-bidens-approval-ratings-plummet/">Bidenomics</a>&#8216; is yielding success. “We now have more jobs than we had before the pandemic,” Biden <a href="https://www.wmtw.com/article/maine-auburn-president-biden-visit-remarks/44662930">explained</a> during his visit. “People are coming off the sidelines — unemployment is down and so is inflation.”</p>
<p>As Biden paid a visit to Auburn, the Republican senator <a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorBrakey">Eric Brakey</a> took the opportunity to personally welcome the president and subsequently chronicled the event on the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). &#8220;Today, I met @POTUS, welcomed him to Auburn, and gave him this note,&#8221; Brakey <a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorBrakey/status/1685007671840100352?s=20">shared</a>. The note itself contained the following plea:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. president, welcome to Auburn ME! Please consider clemency for Ross Ulbricht. Life in prison for building a website is cruel and unusual punishment. Sincerely, Eric Brakey.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ross Ulbricht is the founder of Silk Road, a now-defunct online darknet marketplace. In 2015, he was sentenced to a double life imprisonment without parole for various charges related to the website. Many supporters argue that his sentence is unjust due to flaws in the investigation, trial, and sentencing. They highlight concerns about <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-silk-road-investigation-a-pattern-of-bad-behavior-and-double-agents/">misconduct by law enforcement</a>, the disproportionate punishment compared to other similar cases, and the belief that non-violent offenders deserve a chance at rehabilitation.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.change.org/p/clemency-for-ross-ulbricht-condemned-to-die-in-prison-for-an-e-commerce-website?hp">petition</a> beseeching the U.S. president to bestow clemency upon Ulbricht has gathered momentum since its inception, with 563,708 signatures at the time of this writing. “There is a strong, bipartisan consensus that Ross’s sentence is unjust and that he deserves a second chance,” declares Ulbricht&#8217;s mother, Lyn Ulbricht, in the petition letter. “Over 250 organizations, eminent individuals, and leaders have voiced their <a href="https://freeross.org/support/">support</a> for Ross&#8217;s clemency.”</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/RepThomasMassie">Thomas Massie</a>, the Republican representative from Kentucky, echoes Brakey&#8217;s sentiments on the issue in a statement featured on freeross.org. “This is the greatest violation of the 8th Amendment that I am aware of in the United States today,” Massie stated in his endorsement for a second chance for Ulbricht. “What Ross Ulbricht did from a computer screen does not deserve 2 life sentences + 40 years without the chance of parole … This is cruel and unusual punishment … This guy should not rot in jail and die there. He deserves a second chance.”</p>
<p>In October 2022, Ulbricht penned a heartfelt letter to president Biden, imploring him for a second chance at life. “I know I could be—and yearn to be—a positive influence in the free world,” Ulbricht conveyed in his plea to the president. “Please give me a second chance so I can prove that I can be an asset to my community and country. If you see fit to commute my sentence, I will owe you my life, and I will never let you down.” Besides Ulbricht&#8217;s personal appeal last year, the senator from Maine is also urging Biden to contemplate granting him clemency.</p>

But despite this achievement, Bitcoin-based non-fungible token (NFT) or Ordinal marketplace sales have witnessed a downturn since mid-July. Once consistently taking the second spot week after week in the NFT sales ranking, Bitcoin-based NFT sales have now stumbled, finishing seventh in the last seven-day stretch.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Amid 20 Million Ordinal Inscriptions, Bitcoin&#x2019;s NFT Sales Nosedive</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
On July 28, 2023, the tally of Ordinal inscriptions achieved a significant milestone, <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis">exceeding 20 million</a>. These Bitcoin Ordinals, digital asset inscriptions within the Bitcoin blockchain, enable users to affix information to individual satoshis, the smallest fraction of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. Pioneered by Casey Rodarmor and facilitated by Bitcoin&#x2019;s Taproot upgrade, this technology catapulted the blockchain into prominence. As the numbers swelled into the millions, Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions contributed to making the blockchain the second-largest in weekly NFT sales, time and time again.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The week from July 22 to July 29, 2023, however, painted a different picture. Bitcoin-centric NFT sales slumped by 35.22%, as per the <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/">statistics</a> on cryptoslam.io. Data revealed that Bitcoin-based NFT sales amounted to $4.54 million during the past seven days, relegating the blockchain to a seventh-place position, below Polygon. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL), with $6.61 million in NFT sales, clinched this past week&#x2019;s second-place spot. Among the top 20 priciest sales, a mere two Ordinals secured positions in this week&#x2019;s rankings.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />

&#13;<br />
<a href="https://dune.com/domo/ordinals-marketplaces">Data</a> from Dune Analytics further illustrates a decline in volumes since mid-July concerning marketplaces engaged in Ordinal trades, including Okx, Unisat, Magic Eden, Gamma, Open Ordex, Ordinals Wallet, Ordswap, and Ordinals Market. Following a pronounced drop since May, there was a fleeting surge on June 29. However, the situation worsened after July 14, as volumes by Ordinal marketplaces slumped to even lower levels. Both transactions by marketplace and unique daily users within those marketplaces have experienced a decline.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
While Bitcoin NFT sales have witnessed a downtrend, other blockchains have experienced a rise, and this week&#x2019;s seven-day sales figures as a whole have jumped 8.43% higher than the week prior. This contrast in performance is a striking illustration of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of NFT markets. No one knows for sure if Bitcoin&#x2019;s falling NFT sales will continue or turn around in the next few weeks.&#13;<br />

Currently, these decentralized finance (defi) staking platforms hold an estimated 10.65 million ether locked within their systems.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Ethereum Liquid Staking Landscape Continues to Swell</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Liquid staking platforms based on ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>) have continued to attract sizable deposits, as evidenced by an influx of 270,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>, equivalent to slightly above $505 million at present <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> exchange rates.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Back on July 14, 2023, about <a href="https://archive.li/PMd2T#selection-2845.0-2845.6">10.38 million</a> <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> was secured in these platforms, a figure that experienced a surge to <a href="https://defillama.com/lsd">10.65 million</a> by July 29. Lido Finance continues its reign over these 23 liquid staking applications, claiming 74.31% of the market share.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Two weeks ago, Lido held 7.71 million ether within its infrastructure, a figure which has since climbed to 7.91 million. Coinbase, with its grip on 10.99% of the liquid-staked <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> market share, saw its ether reserves expand from 1.14 million to the present 1.17 million.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In parallel, Rocket Pool has experienced an uptick in the past two weeks, with its ether holdings growing from 830,039 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> to a current total of 857,967 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>. At present, Rocket Pool&#x2019;s hold on the 10.65 million market share amounts to 8.06%.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Frax Ether likewise witnessed an upward trajectory, rising from an initial 238,197 Ether to 243,819. Stakewise recorded modest growth in its <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> holdings, escalating from 92,326 to 93,225. Additionally, Binance Pool&#x2019;s ether cache grew from 91,834 to its present standing at 92,824 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Despite not having breached the 100,000 threshold, both Binance Pool and Stakewise are teetering on the brink of that figure. Over the past month, Binance Pool emerged as the forerunner with 29.20% growth. In the past week, among the leading five liquid staking platforms, Lido claimed the top position in terms of weekly gains, escalating 1.75%.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Beyond the leading five, Swell experienced a 6.08% uptick over the past week, while Stader witnessed a 40.54% surge. Conversely, Ankr declined by 10.52%, and the liquid staking platform Stafi experienced a 5.93% reduction.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Lido&#x2019;s staking derivative generates the token staked ether (STETH), and as of Saturday, this token is held by 233,229 distinct <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> addresses. Of these wallets, the top ten STETH addresses possess 53.30% of the entire supply. The top 100 STETH wallets, as of this writing, control a commanding 69% of the total STETH supply.&#13;<br />

<h2 class="sc-dTOqkH iPIQdR">Decoding Ripple&#x2019;s Ruling: A Potential Tsunami for the SEC</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
In a groundbreaking decision earlier this month, the Southern District Court of New York determined that institutional sales of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> conducted directly by Ripple constitute securities sales. However, intriguingly, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> sales on secondary markets, specifically crypto exchanges, do not. A verdict that has sparked a ripple, pun intended, in the crypto space, potentially creating waves of disarray for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).&#13;<br />

The regulatory nod comes after a review of its business operations and compliance with the Dutch anti-money laundering legislation, the company pointed out. </strong></p>
<h2>Trading Platform Crypto․com Adds Another Regulatory Approval in Europe</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Crypto․com has secured an approval for registration with the Dutch central bank as a provider of crypto services in the Netherlands. The confirmation follows a comprehensive review of its compliance with the country’s Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Prevention) Act, the company noted in a press release.</p>
<p>Crypto․com’s CEO Kris Marszalek described the registration approval from De Nederlandsche Bank (<a href="https://www.dnb.nl/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DNB</a>) as a significant milestone for the company’s business and a testament to its commitment to compliance. He was also quoted as stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Collaborating with regulators to responsibly advance the crypto and blockchain industry is of paramount importance to Crypto.com.</p></blockquote>
<p>Marszalek further emphasized that the exchange looks forward to continuing to work with the DNB and other regulators around the world. With the Dutch registration, the trading platform adds another approval from authorities in Europe amid increased regulatory uncertainty and scrutiny for the industry in many jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The Singapore-based crypto exchange has already obtained its license as a Major Payment Institution (MPI) for digital token payments, e-money issuance, account issuance, and cross-border and domestic money transfer services from the city-state’s monetary authority. It has registrations and authorizations in the U.S., Australia, Dubai, and South Korea.</p>
<p>On the Old Continent, Crypto․com has received registration as a Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) from the Financial Markets Authority (AMF) of France and registration approval as a crypto asset business from the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The crypto firm is registered as a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) in Spain as well and has registrations in Italy, Greece and Cyprus.</p>
<p>Crypto․com’s approval in the Netherlands comes after the decision of  to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-pulls-out-of-netherlands-seeks-to-deregister-cyprus-unit/">pull out</a> of the Dutch market after failing to obtain registration as a crypto service provider. Sayings it wants to focus on fewer regulated entities in Europe, the world’s largest exchange for digital assets also applied for deregistration in Cyprus, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-unit-in-britain-cancels-uk-regulatory-authorization/">canceled</a> its U.K. authorization, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-withdraws-its-crypto-license-application-in-germany/">withdrew</a> its license applications in Germany and Austria. In the past months, Binance has been under increased pressure from regulators around the world.</p>
<p>The EU is yet to implement its package of comprehensive regulations for the sector, the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) law. A provisional agreement on the legislation was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-makes-deal-on-mica-legislation-to-regulate-crypto-markets/">reached</a> in June 2022, EU lawmakers <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-parliament-greenlights-markets-in-crypto-assets-law-tracing-rules/">voted</a> to approve it in April of this year and the EU Council <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-council-adopts-new-rules-for-europes-crypto-markets/">adopted</a> the new rules in May. However, their Union-wide implementation is expected to take another 18 months.</p>

The Kansas banking regulator closed the bank and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as the receiver on Friday.</strong></p>
<h2>Regulator Shuts Down Heartland Tri-State Bank</h2>
<p>A regional bank in the U.S., Heartland Tri-State Bank, was closed by the Kansas Office of the State Bank Commissioner on Friday. The regulator subsequently named the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as the receiver. The FDIC announced:</p>
<blockquote><p>To protect depositors, the FDIC entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with Dream First Bank, National Association, of Syracuse, Kansas, to assume all of the deposits of Heartland Tri-State Bank.</p></blockquote>
<p>The FDIC explained that Heartland Tri-State Bank had approximately $139 million in total assets and $130 million in total deposits as of March 31. In addition to assuming all of the failed bank deposits, Dream First Bank, National Association, &#8220;agreed to purchase essentially all of the failed bank’s assets,&#8221; the FDIC detailed.</p>
<p>The regulator added that the four branches of Heartland Tri-State Bank will reopen as branches of Dream First Bank, National Association, on Monday, under normal business hours.</p>
<p>Several banks have failed in the U.S. this year. On March 10, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/first-citizens-bank-acquires-silicon-valley-bank-costing-fdic-deposit-insurance-fund-an-estimated-20b/">Silicon Valley Bank</a> was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection &amp; Innovation. On March 12, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/signature-bank-closure-has-nothing-to-do-with-crypto-says-regulator/">Signature Bank</a> was closed by the New York State Department of Financial Services. On May 1, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-chase-assumes-control-of-first-republic-bank-following-seizure-by-california-regulators/">First Republic Bank</a> was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. Moreover, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/silvergate-bank-announces-voluntary-liquidation-as-crypto-industry-woes-persist/">Silvergate Bank</a> announced voluntary liquidation.</p>
<p>Multiple people have foreseen an increase in regional bank failures as the Federal Reserve persists with its interest rate hikes. This week, the Fed raised interest rates by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-raises-federal-funds-rate-by-25bps-amidst-moderate-economic-growth/">25 basis points</a>. Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki warned in April that regional banks are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-regional-banks-are-being-wiped-out-calls-fed-criminal/">being wiped out</a> because of Fed policies. Economist Peter Schiff stated earlier this month that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-all-banks-will-fail-people-will-suffer-massive-losses-as-banking-crisis-unfolds/">all banks will fail</a> and people will suffer massive losses as the banking crisis unfolds.</p>
