<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>A proposal presents Aave with the opportunity to onboard ENS and 1INCH to the Ethereum Aave V3 Market is under review.</em></li>



<li><em>Also, on Arbitrum, the Aave community is holding a temperature check vote on the proposal to bring ARB to the V3 market.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Aave community is conducting ARFC voting on the two proposals of adding <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x637d661f1c720aded816291dd01fb093ae8b1b38c322795fae5ceede876a8015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1INCH</a> and <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xd33381a83222b33afa8277f86fae5ee46d4e3455ba09dfc091f626e59ecc29ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ENS</a> to the V3 market on Ethereum. If a consensus is reached and the proposals are refined, ARFC will be submitted for snapshot voting for final approval. Both ballots will close on May 20.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-959.png"><img decoding="async" width="1788" height="1000" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-959.png" alt="Aave Is Proposing ENS And 1INCH Support On Aave V3 Ethereum" class="wp-image-188663" title="Aave Is Proposing ENS And 1INCH Support On Aave V3 Ethereum 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>In addition, the Aave community is conducting a <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x058f8e69b69a27495ee9796fc6952326d94eb24fe0071050db166d5d5e1da242" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">temperature check</a> vote on the proposal of adding ARB to the V3 market on Arbitrum. If the vote is passed, it will enter the ARFC stage. Voting on the proposal will close on May 23.</p>



<p>Since the ENS and 1INCH in the migration plan have a low market cap and trading volume, Chaos Labs, the team driving the effort, has set borrow limitations to account for no more than 1% of the average daily trading activity.</p>



<p>The supply cap was calculated using the supply cap approach and V2 data. They have also updated the IR Slope1 to reflect changes in interest rates over the last few months, as well as the liquidation bonus levels to match current liquidity levels in DEXs.</p>



<p>Support for ARB in Arbitrum v3 pools increases TVL and user experience in the increasingly popular v3 Arbitrum market, as well as income prospects for Aave.</p>



<p>By allowing borrowing, it enables users and institutions to take a distinct stance on this Governance token as the network evolves and a decentralized community emerges. According to the proposal, it also more closely connects the Aave community with Arbitrum and, by extension, Ethereum.</p>



<p>At present, Aave has enabled anonymous voting in the Snapshot voting stage, and it is temporarily unable to check the voting support and opposition rates.</p>



<p>Aave already <a href="https://news.coincu.com/185878-aave-to-launch-its-v3-on-metis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> its v3 on the Ethereum layer 2 ecosystem Metis Network after an overwhelming affirmative community vote over the weekend.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-958.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-958-1024x576.png" alt="Hashkey Group To Raise Funds At A Valuation Above $1 Billion" class="wp-image-188656" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-958-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-958-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-958-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-958-1536x864.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-958-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-958-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-958.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Hashkey Group To Raise Funds At A Valuation Above $1 Billion 5"></a></figure></div>


<p>Hashkey, which runs one of the city&#8217;s only two legal digital currency exchanges, is in early-stage negotiations to fund $100 million to $200 million. The company is one of numerous locally-based businesses trying to increase their consumer base in an environment that is increasingly liberalizing.</p>



<p>The sale is moving forward, but details such as size and value might change since they haven&#8217;t been completed, according to the sources, who asked not to be named because they were discussing private discussions.</p>



<p>The Hong Kong government is encouraging the growth of the digital asset industry as part of a larger drive to reestablish the city&#8217;s reputation as a cutting-edge financial hub.</p>



<p>On June 1, Hong Kong will implement a new licensing scheme for virtual-asset service providers and will allow individual investors to trade key tokens such as Bitcoin and Ether. It contrasts with how regulators across the world are wrestling with how to regulate the business in the aftermath of last year&#8217;s market fall and a series of blowups, including the stunning bankruptcy of the FTX exchange.</p>



<p>To stimulate the local economy, the city will enable retail trading of major currencies on regulated exchanges like Hashkey.</p>



<p>Hashkey and BC Technology Group Co.&#8217;s OSL bourse are now the only two having licenses. OKX and Bitget have announced their intention to seek for a license under Hong Kong&#8217;s new regulatory environment.</p>



<p>This year, Chinese state-run banks have courted crypto firms, one of the numerous indications that Beijing supports the city&#8217;s overarching ambition. This is due in part to the government&#8217;s perception of the financial hub as a test bed for longer-term policy, notwithstanding the mainland&#8217;s prohibition on most types of cryptocurrency activity.</p>



<p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188361-hong-kong-monetary-authority-cbdc-pilot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the start of the e-HKD Pilot Project, which might pave the way for a retail central bank digital currency to be implemented (CBDC). The initiative will work closely with many stakeholders to study e-HKD use cases as well as implementation and design concerns.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188084-greenland-to-expand-crypto-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, a subsidiary of Greenland Holdings intends to apply for a virtual asset license in Hong Kong. Greenland is the first state-owned corporation to express an interest in joining Hong Kong&#8217;s digital trading market, showing that the Hong Kong government&#8217;s efforts to promote the city as a virtual asset trading hub have been successful.</p>

</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a <em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-lightning-service-ibex-mercado-announces-partnership-with-grupo-salinas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin Magazine</a></em> report, a large internet service provider in Mexico has integrated Bitcoin Lightning payments, which is a significant accomplishment for crypto industry players.</strong></h5>

<p>IBEX Mercado, a supplier of Bitcoin Lightning payment services, has announced a new relationship with Grupo Salinas, one of Mexico&#8217;s leading multinational giants.</p>



<p>The new development in Mexico is yet another step toward the top cryptocurrency&#8217;s total institutional acceptance. On top of the underlying blockchain, the Bitcoin Lightning network provides a layer 2 solution. The Lightning network leverages native Bitcoin via micropayment channels to complete transactions more effectively and at a reduced cost.</p>



<p>On stage, IBEX CEO José Lemus introduced the partnership:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“With this partnership, we’re opening the doors to every bitcoin and Lightning company and financial tech company that wants to leverage Lightning technology … [we will be] rolling out new technology with Grupo Salinas that will enable mexicans to pay their groceries with bitcoin, electronics and to receive remittances.” Lemus explained his excitement about the announcement, saying that this is the “tip of the iceberg of what will go on in Mexico.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The news comes only days after Microstrategy creator Michael Saylor disclosed ambitions to use the Bitcoin Lightning Network in the business sphere. The IT business, which is the biggest institutional Bitcoin holder, revealed plans to introduce a product suite for corporate account holders that includes a Bitcoin wallet and a Lightning address.</p>

<p>Total Play, one of the leading internet service providers in North America, incorporated Bitcoin Lightning payments on Thursday. The internet service provider offered a simple payments dashboard that prompts the customer to choose between on-chain Bitcoin payment and BTC Lightning payment.</p>



<p>This might be a big development in the United States neighboring country since widespread Bitcoin adoption could educate people about crypto use cases. Total Play Telecommunications is ranked eighth among the top twenty corporations in Mexico with the most IP allocations, according to the <a href="https://db-ip.com/country/MX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DB-IP</a>.</p>



<p>When on-chain transactions are halted due to technical challenges, the Lightning Network solution may be employed as a stopgap fix. The incorporation of Bitcoin Lightning into Grupo Salinas&#8217; goods and services through IBEX might propel Mexico to the forefront of the digital revolution, offering residents a safe, contemporary, and efficient payment alternative.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Deepcoin Exchange Fees</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-953.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="538" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-953-1024x538.png" alt="Deepcoin Reviews: Cryptocurrency Derivative Trading Platform?" class="wp-image-188644" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-953-1024x538.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-953-300x158.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-953-768x403.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-953-750x394.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-953-1140x599.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-953.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Deepcoin Reviews: Cryptocurrency Derivative Trading Platform? 15"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>When investing in Deepcoin, investors should be aware that the platform charges fees for every trade they place. While this may seem like an inconvenience, it&#8217;s important to understand how the fees are calculated and what they are used for.</p>



<p>First, investors should note that the actual cost of their crypto orders will be reserved as taker fees for the transactions they place. This means that the fee is based on the value of the order itself, and is not a separate charge on top of the trade.</p>



<p>Additionally, investors will need to pay a transaction fee after the execution of the order. This fee is calculated based on the actual specific price of the transactions, using the formula:</p>



<p>Trading Fee = Contract Face Value * Trading Fee Rate/ Order Price</p>



<p>Order Value = Contract Face Value * Contract Size / Order Price</p>



<p>By understanding this formula, investors can get a better idea of how much they will be charged for each transaction, and can make more informed decisions about their investments.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that the taker fee for Deepcoin is currently set at 0.06 percent, while the maker fee is 0.04 percent. While these fees may seem small, they can add up over time, so investors should be sure to factor them into their investment strategy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Deepcoin Payment Methods</h2>



<p>The site provides multiple options for investors to deposit and withdraw funds. Users can choose between using wallets or fiat gateway to deposit funds. If an investor opts to use a fiat gateway, the platform currently supports Visa and Mastercard payment methods for both deposits and withdrawals. On the other hand, if the investor already holds digital currencies, they can deposit or withdraw crypto coins using the wallet and the site. It&#8217;s important to note that these transactions will only take place through the bitcoin mobile app for the fiat gateway.</p>



<p>For users who prefer to deposit cryptos using the crypto app and the website, they can create a Deepcoin wallet account. By doing so, they gain access to the platform&#8217;s cryptocurrency wallets, which can be explored through the official convenient mobile support app functionality. Users can easily follow the guides provided to make secure and protected investments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Deepcoin Mobile Support</h2>



<p>The cryptocurrency market has seen a surge in mobile trading activity recently. With the convenience of smartphones, many traders have found it easier to perform trading activities on-the-go. This trend has been noticed by many investors, who are now using their smartphones for a variety of tasks, such as merging leverage, adjusting leverage, monitoring split position margins, depositing regular cash, splitting leverages, and marking entry points.</p>

The popularity of these apps has spread across the globe, with investors across different parts of the world, such as Singapore, the USA, and the UK, taking advantage of the ease and accessibility of mobile trading.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>CBDC systems that operate on several networks may be utilized for cross-border and cross-currency payments.</em></li>



<li><em>The paper by the New York Federal Reserve and the MAS focuses on the technical challenges of CBDCs.</em></li>



<li><em>For all test situations, settlement took less than thirty seconds.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Project Cedar Phase II and Project Ubin+ (Cedar x Ubin+), according to a <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/nyfed-and-mas-publish-results-of-joint-wholesale-cross-border-payments-research-study" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the New York Federal Reserve, have achieved headway in cross-border real-time settlements using central bank digital currencies (CBDC).</strong></h5>

<p>According to the report, the various teams were able to perform cross-border transactions with near real-time settlement finality across distinctly distributed ledger (DLT) and hashed timelock contract (HTLC) technology stacks.</p>



<p>The New York Federal Reserve&#8217;s New York Innovation Centre&#8217;s Project Cedar and the MAS&#8217;s Project Ubin+ stated on May 19 that they investigated a cross-border multi-currency use case in which vehicle (or bridge) currencies are used as a bridge to exchange currency pairings that are not frequently traded.</p>



<p>According to a footnote in the paper, the research focused on technical difficulties and did not represent any choice to install CBDCs or the underlying tech stacks anyplace in particular.</p>



<p>The experiment&#8217;s efficiency allowed cross-border payments to be completed simultaneously (atomic settlement) and in near-real time, as well as interoperability and autonomy across distinct central bank currency ledgers.</p>



<p>Cedar x Ubin+ investigated the capacity of distributed ledger technology (DLT) to link at least three simulated currency ledgers, minimize settlement risk, and shorten settlement time. The teams made use of replicated CBDCs and fictitious payments.</p>

<p>According to Michelle Neal, Chief of the Markets Group at the New York Fed:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Cross-border payments are a major railway for facilitating the functioning of the global economy. Our research collaboration with the MAS reveals key opportunities for central bank innovation to play an important role in easing wholesale payment flows globally and improving settlement outcomes.”</p>

<p>According to the study, the researchers constructed eight distinct scenarios to test their interoperability hypothesis. All deals resolved almost 6.5 payments per second on average, with a high of 47 payments per second, according to the atomic settlement testing.</p>



<p>Settlement occurred in less than thirty seconds for all test cases (normally, settlement takes roughly two days), including payment chains needing multiple cross-ledger currency swaps.</p>



<p>The paper proved that interoperability may be achieved across ledgers with varying technological architectures. Atomic settlement (simultaneous settlement) was achieved by making the ability of each member of the payment chain to claim their respective funds conditional on the ability of all participants to claim their respective funds, significantly reducing the counterparty risk associated with a given transaction.</p>

<p>Coin Cafe was charging its users extremely high fees, which the company failed to adequately inform them about. The company advertised its wallet service as free, but charged tens of thousands of dollars in fees to its New York residents. The agency found that certain user account balances were completely depleted as a result of these fees.</p>



<p>Coin Cafe changed its fee structure four times, and in October 2022, it introduced an exorbitant fee increase. The company began to charge users the greater of 7.99% or $99 per month if they did not transact crypto over a 30-day period. As a result of its actions, Coin Cafe surrendered $4.3 million to the agency.</p>



<p>While Coin Cafe successfully obtained the state&#8217;s BitLicense in 2023, it continued to charge its users high fees even after obtaining the license. In addition, the company failed to register with the New York Attorney General&#8217;s office, which it should have done to comply with regulations.</p>



<p>Coin Cafe will now pay restitution to investors, including $508,000 to 340 individuals in the state of New York. The company will continue to operate but must limit its monthly fees to 0.002% and must adequately inform its users of all fees.</p>



<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James called out Coin Cafe&#8217;s practices and stated that this case is &#8220;another example of why the cryptocurrency industry needs to be better regulated.&#8221; This announcement also mentioned recently proposed crypto-specific regulation from James that could lead to further enforcement.</p>

<p>Kumar emphasized that cryptocurrencies still allow illicit financial transactions to occur around the world, and that this poses a major challenge to global financial security.</p>



<p>As the G7 prepares to discuss various agenda items for the year, including the regulation of cryptocurrencies and the overall industry, Kumar has called for &#8220;concerted global action&#8221; to ensure that no &#8220;safe haven&#8221; can exist in the financial system of the world for such transactions. The FATF is currently working on &#8220;multiple fronts&#8221; to help countries combat &#8220;digital financial flows&#8221; that are &#8220;fueling crime and terrorism.&#8221;</p>



<p>The FATF has updated its Recommendations, the global standards on combatting money laundering, terrorism financing, and proliferation financing, to include crypto-assets and related financial activity. However, Kumar has expressed concern over the relatively poor progress made by countries in implementing these new standards as part of the Recommendations. As of 2019, only 27% of countries were compliant with the updated standards that include crypto, while the remaining majority of 73% are completely or partially non-compliant and have yet to begin work on supervising the crypto industry.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">

<p>To address this issue, Kumar recommends that countries focus on two areas to ensure cryptocurrencies cannot be used for illicit financial transactions. The first area is ensuring transparency of beneficial ownership, which is &#8220;crucial in fighting money laundering, corruption, tax evasion, and sanctions evasion.&#8221; The second area is recovering the proceeds of crimes. Kumar wrote that asset recovery helps strengthen trust in law enforcement as it helps victims directly and is an &#8220;effective&#8221; method of stopping economic crimes. However, countries have barely done any work on asset recovery and only a small fraction of the global illicit financial flows are ever recovered.</p>



<p>Moreover, Kumar believes that many countries do not have the experience to tackle illicit financial flows when they become digital. To address this challenge, the FATF intends to roll out a new program which will include the so-called &#8220;travel rule&#8221; to help them adapt. The travel rule will mandate virtual asset service providers like exchanges to pass along information to one another and supervisory bodies for crypto transactions that cross a certain threshold. This will help ensure that countries have the necessary tools to combat illicit financial flows in the digital age.</p>



<p>Kumar&#8217;s letter highlights the need for a concerted global effort to regulate the crypto industry and prevent illicit financial flows. While progress has been made in updating the FATF&#8217;s Recommendations to include crypto, more work needs to be done to ensure that these standards are implemented by countries. By focusing on transparency of beneficial ownership and asset recovery, countries can help prevent illicit financial flows and strengthen trust in law enforcement. The FATF&#8217;s new program, which includes the travel rule, will also help countries adapt to the new digital landscape and combat financial crime effectively.</p>

<p>The lobbying group issued a warning that failure to act could enable &#8220;adversarial nations&#8221; to further their activities in the space that could &#8220;endanger U.S. leadership and dollar primacy.&#8221; It cited China as an example of such adversarial action, pointing out that China has developed an internationally focused Blockchain-based Services Network (BSN) to &#8220;incorporate global development and trade and fill the U.S.-created vacuum.&#8221;</p>



<p>It also mentioned that a growing number of countries, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, France, Brazil, and India, are considering or choosing to trade with China directly in yuan, which could lead to a decrease in the use of the U.S. dollar.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the organization brought up the potential BRICS digital currency and other developments regarding gold-backed digital currencies by Russia and Iran.</p>



<p>The lobbying group concluded that regulatory and legal opacity in the U.S. is &#8220;hampering the nation&#8217;s ability to lead and take advantage of this innovation revolution,&#8221; and that &#8220;this abdication is severely hampering domestic development and ceding advantages to other nations at the expense of the U.S. innovator and investor.&#8221;</p>



<p>In light of this urgent need for a regulatory framework, the Chamber of Digital Commerce has proposed the creation of a &#8220;Digital Asset and Blockchain Technology Solarium Commission.&#8221; The proposed commission&#8217;s name references Project Solarium, created in the wake of World War II and the dawning of the Cold War by President Eisenhower to counter the threat of Soviet expansion.</p>



<p>The Cyberspace Solarium Commission, created in 2019, was established to develop a strategic approach to defend against cyber attacks. The crypto advocacy group is calling for a similar strategy on digital assets and blockchain technology, which &#8220;desperately needs consensus in the wake of other nations&#8217; advances.&#8221;</p>

<p>Founded in 2014, the Chamber of Digital Commerce is an American advocacy group that promotes emerging technologies in the blockchain sector. On May 19, the group backed Senator Tom Emmer&#8217;s introduction of the Securities Clarity Act, which aims to provide much-needed regulatory clarity for the crypto asset and blockchain industry in the U.S.</p>



<p>Securities and Exchange Commission remains adamant that the existing rules that were formed decades ago still apply to this new form of digital finance and its underlying technology. The call for a regulatory framework for digital assets in the U.S. is becoming increasingly urgent, as other countries continue to make strides in the space and threaten to leave the U.S. behind in this innovative and rapidly developing field.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Users who make an stETH withdrawal request on Lido Finance receive an NFT as a Web3 receipt.</em></li>



<li><em>The special thing is that these NFTs can be traded on the secondary market and are transferable.</em></li>



<li><em>The number of requests for withdrawal processing of the protocol is recording at a peak of 686 requests</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Nansen, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/187894-lido-witnessing-huge-steth-withdrawal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lido Finance</a> will send users an NFT as a Web3 receipt when the recipient submits a request to withdraw their staked ETH.</strong></h5>

<p>Nansen, a blockchain analytics company, has released a document stating that after Lido Finance submits a request to withdraw stETH, users will receive NFTs. Once the withdrawal request is accepted, the NFT image will be updated, and the withdrawal will be notified. Subscribers, and users can use this NFT as a Web3 withdrawal receipt.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>According to information revealed by Twitter @lido_intern, the ETH withdrawal NFT offered by Lido Finance is transferable, meaning users can send it to any ETH wallet they wish to receive without being stolen.</p>



<p>Besides, these NFTs can be traded on the secondary market, as the next NFTs in the queue will be traded at a higher rate as some investors will pay more for faster withdrawals.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">THEORETICALLY SPEAKING, these NFTs could be traded on a secondary marketplace, as the NFTs further up in the queue should expect to trade at a premium since some stakers will pay more to withdraw faster.</p>&mdash; Lido Intern (@lido_intern) <a href="https://twitter.com/lido_intern/status/1659145906711658497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 18, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>At the end of May 15, Lido Finance successfully upgraded to version V2 – a significant change that allows users to withdraw staking Ethereum from the platform. Previously, the protocol opened voting on the implementation of V2 on May 12.</p>



<p>The V2 upgrade is considered the most important update on this protocol after the Shapella hard fork last month to unlock large amounts of ETH for investors. Since then, Lido V2 has been continuously tested and undergone 9 rigorous evaluations.</p>



<p>With V2, will be 270,000 ETH available in the Withdrawals vault, so investors can make withdrawal requests without waiting too long. After this amount of ETH is drained, the vault will continue to be pumped more. In other words, investors have a better chance of returning their ETH in the first three days of unlocking, Lido said. The maximum time to exit the queue is 5 days and 14 hours, Rated network explorer estimates.</p>



<p>Therefore, since the upgrade, there have been 686 withdrawal requests totaling over 451k stETH. This amount is expected to increase still, especially after the large institutions that invested in Lido start processing withdrawals.</p>

<p>The IMF<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/05/16/Nigerias-eNaira-One-Year-After-533487" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/05/16/Nigerias-eNaira-One-Year-After-533487" rel="noreferrer noopener"> researchers</a> have commended the eNaira&#8217;s debut year, stating that it has been &#8220;laudable&#8221;. However, the paper also has a few suggestions on how to further improve its performance.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that the eNaira was the world&#8217;s second CBDC, having launched in October 2021 after the Bahamian Sand Dollar. According to the paper, the eNaira&#8217;s retail side was intermediated, but it has yet to make its breakthrough beyond its initial adopters. The Central Bank of Nigeria introduced a phased introduction, which unfortunately has put off two of the CBDC&#8217;s biggest goals &#8211; extending financial inclusion to the unbanked and facilitating remittances &#8211; according to IMF officials.</p>



<p>The current usage of the eNaira is relatively low, with only about 1.5% of wallets being active on any given week. Additionally, there were only a total of 802,000 transactions during the timespan examined, which represents less than one per wallet. Furthermore, less than 1% of bank accounts in Nigeria have wallets. The paper has observed that breaking the initial low adoption equilibrium for any network products with similar traits, such as credit cards, requires a mix of clever strategies and luck.</p>

<p>The relationship between the eNaira and mobile money operators (MMOs) in Nigeria is a key question raised in the paper. The CBDC could either compete with the MMOs on the retail market or facilitate MMOs&#8217; operations by providing a bridge between them. The paper has called the eNaira&#8217;s replacement of all the MMOs&#8217; services &#8220;hard to imagine,&#8221; but also noted that a bridge function could set off a difficult &#8220;industry reshuffle.&#8221;</p>



<p>As a single-currency system, the IMF has mentioned that the eNaira is unable to accommodate remittances directly. However, this could be overcome either by allowing international money transfer operators to receive eNaira wallets or through intermediation. The researchers have recommended the former, though both options will remain expensive, which the IMF considers a serious problem in light of the parallel, underground market that serves the same purpose.</p>



<p>The paper has recommended a few steps for boosting eNaira usage. For instance, the eNaira could be used for social payments in conjunction with MMOs that improve the social cash transfer system and increase adoption. Merchants could also be incentivised to use the eNaira. The Central Bank of Nigeria has already started to work on inclusivity through the eNaira, according to the paper. However, remittances remain problematic, and resolving this issue is crucial for achieving the eNaira&#8217;s full potential.</p>
