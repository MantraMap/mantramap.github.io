Binance.US, in response to the aggressive tactics employed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its ideological campaign against the American digital asset industry, on its official Twitter handle has announced the suspension of USD deposits and impending fiat (USD) withdrawal pause. The exchange cites the need to protect its customers and platform amidst the challenges created by the SEC&#8217;s actions. While transitioning to a crypto-only exchange temporarily, Binance.US  assures its customers of maintaining 1:1 reserves for all customer assets, with crypto-related services remaining fully operational. Binance Prioritizing Customer Protection And Defending the Digital Asset Industry Binance.US&#8217;s proactive steps aim to prioritize customer interests and ensure the security of their assets. The suspension of USD deposits and notification regarding the impending pause in fiat withdrawal channels come as a defensive measure to address the challenges posed by the SEC&#8217;s aggressive tactics. The exchange encourages its customers to take appropriate action with their USD holdings in light of these developments.
