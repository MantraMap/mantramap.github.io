This support coincides with the 50% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">Fibonacci retracement level</a> creating a strong accumulation zone that could assist buyers to recuperate bullish momentum. Moreover, a bullish reversal pattern spotted at $0.94 indicates a high possibility for the polygon coin to initiate a fresh rally.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A correction phase to 50% FIB highlights the overall trend for polygon coins as bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bearish crossover between the 50-and-100-day EMA could encourage more selling in the market.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the MATIC is $415.5 Million, indicating a 16% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/1/1W1dYNXy.png" alt="MATIC Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the daily time frame chart, the MATIC price shows the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/double-bottom-pattern/#:~:text=It%20is%20formed%20when%20a,downtrend%20in%20the%20asset's%20price.">double-bottom pattern</a>. This is a commonly spotted reversal pattern that reflects the increasing buying pressure at a particular support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the influence of this pattern, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/polygon/#:~:text=The%20live%20Polygon%20price%20today,cap%20of%20%247.53B%20USD.">MATIC price</a> has surged 6.5% in the last two days and is currently trading at $0.9945. If the buying pressure persists, the coin price should rise another 4% and poke the $1.036 neckline resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential breakout from this resistance may keep the bullish momentum and offer buyers a significant footing to prolong the bullish rally. In favorable conditions, a breakout from this pattern’s neckline resistance offers a price rally of the same distance between the neckline and base support.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/new-upcoming-binance-listing/">New Upcoming Binance Listing For 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the pattern completion may encourage another 9-10% jump to hit the $1.12 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicators</span></h2>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The 20-and-200-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> aligned with a $1.036 neckline strengthens the resistance power of this level.</span></p>
<p><b>Relative strength index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">An uptick in the daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> accentuates the increasing buying pressure in the market.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">MATIC Coin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.995</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Low</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $1.03 and $1.12</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $0.94 and $0.84</span></li>

He made the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-hWy7EMfzo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">comment</a> in the post FOMC press conference on Wednesday. The FOMC said in its statement that the committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy appropriately if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the committee&#8217;s goals. The markets perceived this as a signal from the central bank to opening doors for a rate hike pause.</p>

<p>Earlier, the U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the Federal funds target rate by 25 bps, on expected lines. The latest hike effectively brought the current target rate to 500-525 bps range.</p>
<h2>No Decision On Rate Hike Pause Yet</h2>
<p>Powell said in the post FOMC press conference that there was no decision made during the meeting about rate hike pause. He added that the committee would take rate determination decision meeting by meeting. Traders have been anticipating a signal on possibility of a rate hike pause in the June 2023 FOMC meeting. Meanwhile, the committee <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230503a.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">observed</a> that the U.S. banking system is sound and resilient, despite recent hurdles in the form of First Republic Bank collapse and subsequent ripple effect in the US regional banking sector.</p>
<p>Powell reiterated that the central bank is committed to bring inflation down to the 2% target. He also said it won&#8217;t be possible to confidently say if a sufficiently restrictive level has been reached, with regard to the policy tightening. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin price</a> suffered slight drop in reaction to Powell speech today. On the other hand, the US Dollar Index (DXY) recovered after a sharp fall in reaction to the 25 bps rate hike announcement.</p>

With yet another relatively mild interest rate hike, the US Fed Reserve has maintained its dovish tone, signaling the interest rate hikes may be tapered in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Federal Reserve Chairman said the decision to hike interest rate by 25 BPS by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was a unanimous one, a show of unity in the fight to take the US economy back to its desired level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Market experts have been projecting a slowdown in rate hike considering the recent turmoil the US financial ecosystem has faced with about </span><a href="https://coingape.com/experts-predict-more-bank-runs-will-fed-hike-interest-rates/"><span style="font-weight: 400">4 banks collapsing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in recent times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Fed’s rate hike is an indication that the Feds prioritize the inflation fight and its impact on the economy. This rate hike is considered one of the most important ones ahead of the next major economic data releases, that is the CPI data later this month. Should the inflationary growth exceed the 5% that was reported for March, we can expect the pivot to be suspended in the near term.</span></p>
<h2><b>Interest Rate Hike: Market Reaction</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the minutes after the release of the interest rate hike, the broader market has started reaction While Bitcoin (BTC) has printed a marginal loss of 1.28%, the milder than expected volatility indicates a major </span><a href="https://coingape.com/markets/bitcoin-price-prediction-btc-price-at-risk-of-12-fall-as-buyers-loss-key-support/"><span style="font-weight: 400">rebound from its earlier slips</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> is possibly underway. Ethereum (ETH) is holding down the fort with its visible 0.64% uptick atop a $1,881.94 spot price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The digital currency ecosystem is trading in antagonism to the mainstream financial market in which the S&amp;P 500 Index is up by 0.21% to 4,128.15. The tech heavy Nasdaq Composite has also inked a 0.48% growth to 12,138.28 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has added a negligible 2 points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The encompassing growth in the top market indices is an indication that the rate hike is in line with the broader market expectation, opening investors to perfecting their approaches to the market over the next couple of weeks</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Binance, the world’s largest crypto trading platform has announced it plans to launch USDⓈ-M SUI perpetual contract as a way to further support the digital currency whose mainnet launched earlier today. According to the Binance announcement, the launch was slated for May 3 at 16:00 UTC.

According to the Binance announcement, the launch was slated for May 3 at 16:00 UTC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the underlying asset for the perpetual contract being SUI token, the trading platform said the settlement will be made using the Tether (USDT) stablecoin. While the trading platform noted that the new product will support a multi asset mode, it also confirmed that the perpetual contracts will be accessible for trading 24/7.</span></p>
<p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://coingape.com/fomc-jerome-powell-fed-interest-rate/">FOMC Live News: Will Jerome Powell Deliver Fed’s Dovish Stance?</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most important feature that the Binance USDⓈ-M SUI perpetual contract is launching with is that it comes with a 50x leverage with a tick size of 0.0001.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides Binance being one of the first exchanges to unveil it will be </span><a href="https://coingape.com/sui-gets-binance-listing-iou-price-set-to-skyrocket/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supporting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the SUI token launch, it is also effectively now ranking as the trading platform that will be pioneering the listing of SUI’s perpetual contract. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a note to prospective SUI perpetual contract traders, Binance said it will be observing the market’s momentum and may adjust the tick size and other launch parameters if there is a need to do so.</span></p>
<h2><b>SUI Token Seeing Intense Volatility</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sui Network is arguably the biggest protocol that made its way into the Web3.0 world thus far this year and the anticipation was met with extreme token volatility post-mainnet launch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As </span><a href="https://coingape.com/sui-price-slumps-by-72-amid-mainnet-launch/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier by Coingape, the SUI token recorded a massive 70% slump in its price after its launch, an indication that early backers are offloading the digital currency. While this is not uncommon for new token launches, the Sui slump came almost at the same time when XIRTAM, a token supported by Cult DAO, </span><a href="https://coingape.com/cult-dao-clarifies-involvement-in-newly-rugpulled-xirtam/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reportedly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rug-pulled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sentiment in the possibility of the price slumping has pushed big holders including several known influencers to offload their bags. At the time of writing, SUI is </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sui/ico/" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trading at a price of $1.39</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, down by 69% over the past 24 hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For what it’s worth, the digital currency is maintaining a crucial support at $1.30, a level that is worth watching as the protocol’s ecosystem evolves.</span></p>

A downsloping trendline gave a specific direction to this downfall and assisted sellers to prolong this correction phase. However, the buyers recently found significant support at the $0.67 level allowing them to recuperate bullish momentum.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 2nd, the stacks coin price witnessed a significant inflow and gave a bullish breakout from the long coming resistance trendline. The sellers have been using this trendline to recuperate supply pressure at price rallies to maintain a seedy downfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the recent breakout indicates an early signal of trend reversal and reflects the sentiment shift from selling on rallies to buying on dips. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a trendline breakout, each swing high stands as viable support and thus, the Stacks price is at potential growth of 62% to hit the $1.31 mark.</span></p>

With a 5.36% intraday jump, the coin price tries to breach this pattern’s neckline resistance at $0.84, giving additional confirmation for a bullish recovery,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 4-hour candle closing above the neckline can provide an entry opportunity for interested traders to go long with the first target at $0.93.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative Strength Index:</strong> A bullish divergence in the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> with the formation of a double bottom pattern indicated a higher possibility for buyers to prIce neckline resistance.</span></p>

Amid pressure from the ongoing US regional banking crisis, the markets are expecting that the central bank implements a 25 bps rate hike for the last time in a series of target rate raises. This would take the current target of 475-500 bps to the 500-525 bps range.</p>

<p>The CME FedWatch Tool indicates that 85% of respondents feel the Fed go for a 25 bps hike.

With the likes of PEPE in the lead among the new ones in circulation, the interest generated thus far is rising by a mile.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto Market News: Even as the crypto community awaits the summary judgment in the XRP lawsuit, an old court judgement ruling that went against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could give a lot of confidence to the XRP token holders.

John Deaton, the attorney representing the more than 70,000 XRP token holders, said there could be a logical conclusion end to the lawsuit in the form of a settlement only in case if Ripple wins against the SEC.</p>

<p>In a recent comment, Deaton <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-win-sec-settlement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> there will not be any chance for settlement if the SEC emerges victorious in the lawsuit. Meanwhile, Ripple Labs and its executives are confident of a win for XRP.</p>
<h2>SEC Lost A Case Overseen By Judge Analisa Torres</h2>
<p>In an interesting finding, the US SEC lost in a lawsuit overseen by Judge Analisa Torres, who is also now in charge of the XRP Vs SEC lawsuit. In 2019, the judge ruled against the regulatory agency in the SEC v. Rio Tinto <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/attorneyjeremy1/status/1653558215110434816?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuit</a>. When the SEC appealed, the appellate Court upheld the Judge&#8217;s decision, pointed attorney Jeremy Hogan. Hence, this forms an important precedent against the SEC by the same judge overseeing the Ripple lawsuit.</p>
<p>Also, the SEC could face a fresh challenge some time later in 2023 if the US Supreme Court goes for abolishing the Chevron Doctrine. Earlierm CoinGape <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-attorney-fight-against-chevron-doctrine-most-important-in-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that the top US court agreed to consider the proposal to look into the decision making powers federal agencies gain through the Doctrine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="800" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/10155831/crises.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="Data Shows More US Bank Failures Ahead, Who Will SEC Blame Now?" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p>The year 2023 started with U.S. banking regulators the <strong>OCC</strong>, the <strong>Federal Reserve Board</strong>, and the <strong>FDIC</strong> <a href="https://coingape.com/us-federal-watchdogs-issue-joint-warning-on-crypto-activities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joint statement</a> highlighting risks posed by crypto to the banking sector. The regulators stated to take a cautious approach related to crypto asset-related activities and exposures at each banking organization.</p>
<p>The positive sentiment led by favorable <strong>on-chain</strong> and <strong>technical indicators</strong> drove Bitcoin price to rally 40% in January. The shares of banks including <strong>Silvergate</strong>, <strong>Silicon Valley Bank</strong>, and <strong>Signature</strong> traded normally and regulators didn&#8217;t take any action against these banks. However, the Federal Reserve Board rejected <strong>Custodia Bank</strong>&#8216;s application for Federal Reserve System membership and release a statement to reduce banks&#8217; exposure to crypto.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Board has not identified any authority permitting national banks to hold most crypto-assets [&#8230;] As principal in any amount, and there is no federal statute or rule expressly permitting state banks to hold crypto-assets as principal. Therefore, the Board would presumptively prohibit state member banks from engaging in such activity under section 9(13) of the [Federal Reserve] Act.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In February, crypto leaders with connections in the U.S. government agencies and Washington, D.C. warned of a widespread crackdown against the crypto market planned by the <strong>Biden Administration</strong>. Crypto-friendly banks such as Silvergate, Signature, and <strong>Metropolitan Commercial Bank</strong> were predicted to be the first target of regulators.</p>
<h2>Operation Choke Point 2.0</h2>
<p>Venture capitalist <strong>Nic Carter</strong> termed &#8220;<a href="https://coingape.com/operation-choke-point-2-0-us-planning-crackdown-against-crypto-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Operation Choke Point 2.0</a>&#8221; coordinated by the SEC, Treasury Dept, Federal Reserve Board, and other regulators to strangle the crypto industry by cutting its ties with the banking sector. Coinbase CEO <a href="https://coingape.com/coinbase-ceo-says-sec-could-possibly-ban-crypto-staking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Armstrong revealed</a> that the <strong>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> (SEC) is likely looking to ban <strong>crypto staking</strong>.</p>
<p>A regulatory crackdown against crypto led by U.S. SEC started a series of problems for the crypto market. The SEC took action against crypto staking offered by <strong>Kraken</strong>, regulators took action against <strong>Binance</strong> and <strong>BUSD</strong>, and other crypto exchanges such as <strong>Coinbase</strong> and <strong>Bittrex</strong>.</p>
<p>In March, the regulators-led crackdown surprisingly caused the closure of crypto-friendly banks <strong>Silvergate</strong>, <strong>Silicon Valley Bank</strong>, and <strong>Signature </strong>in a week. Regulators <a href="https://coingape.com/operation-choke-point-2-0-crypto-banking-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blamed crypto for the banking crisis</a>, but the turmoil happened due to continued rate hikes by Federal Reserve and wrong management decisions.</p>
<p>Brian Armstrong, CZ, Elon Musk, Nic Carter, Arthur Hayes, and Cathie Wood blasted regulators for blaming crypto. Congressman <a href="https://coingape.com/stop-weaponizing-banks-to-purge-legal-crypto-activity-congressman-tells-fdic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Emmer wrote a letter</a> to the FDIC chairman Gruenberg blaming him for instability in the banking sector to choke crypto activity in the U.S.</p>
<p>The <strong>U.S. House Financial Services Committee</strong> is finally looking into potential coordinated efforts by the U.S. regulators to <a href="https://coingape.com/us-house-investigating-potential-operation-choke-point-2-0-to-de-bank-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">de-bank the crypto market</a>.</p>
<h2>Who Will SEC Chair Gensler Blame For Collapse of Non-Crypto First Republic Bank?</h2>
<p>SEC Chair <strong>Gary Gensler</strong> blamed crypto for the collapse of banks when he was asked by House Republicans over the agency’s treatment of digital assets, including the lack of clarity. This week, <strong>JPMorgan</strong> absorbed <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/first-republic-bank" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Republic Bank</a> after the new problems started with the bank despite a $30 billion deposit in March by Big banks including JPMorgan and PNC. With the collapse of First Republic Bank, the year it&#8217;s tuning out to be the worst for banks in terms of asset losses as compared to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.</p>

<p>With another wave of banking crisis starting, who will SEC Chair Gary Gensler blame for the collapse of non-crypto First Republic Bank? The regulators need to admit that their policies and decisions caused the banking crisis. 3 out of 5 largest banks have collapsed this year, hinting at more bank collapses.</p>
<p>Despite the banking crisis and looming debt crisis, the Fed plans to raise interest rates by another 25 bps on May 3. It is likely to trigger a collapse of banks such as <strong>PacWest Bancorp</strong> and <strong>Western Alliance Bancorp</strong>. In fact, former Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President <strong>Robert Kaplan</strong> said the banking crisis is just getting started.</p>

During this consolidation, the prices resonated between the two converging trendlines indicating the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/education/bull-flag-pattern-in-crypto-meaning-and-how-to-identify/">bullish flag pattern</a>. Thus, the decreasing volume action indicates this sideways trend is temporary, and the buyers may region trend control.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, the flag pattern offers a short break before the bull run continues</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Solana price may prolong a sideways trend until the pattern is intact.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Solana coin is $6.1 Billion, indicating a 41% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/u/uqDqdW27.png" alt="Solana Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent sell-off in the crypto market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/solana/#:~:text=Solana%20is%20spotted%20trading%20at,in%20the%20last%2024%20hours.">Solana price</a> has plunged back to the flag pattern’s support trendline and is currently trading at $21.37. With a 4% intraday fall, the coin price retests the lower trendline to check if buyers can sustain a higher level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the altcoin manages to hold above the aforementioned trendline, the coin holders may witness a bull cycle within this chart pattern. This bullish reversal may drive the prices 20% high to rechallenge the overhead trendline.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the influence of this pattern, the Solana price is poised to break the resistance trendline and flip it into viable support to climb higher levels of the chart. This breakout would intensify the buying momentum and soar this coin another 40% higher to hit the first target of $36.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While things look bullish for Solana coin, a breakdown below the support trendline shown above the bullish thesis will get invalidated.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Despite the lower higher formation in price action, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily-RSI slope</a> is rising which indicates increasing buying pressure and a higher possibility for a flag upside breakout.</span></p>
<p><b>Fibonacci Retracement:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The correction during the flag pattern also tested a 50% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">FIB</a> level which is considered a healthy uptrend continuation.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solana Coin Price Intraday Level</span></h2>

The mainnet </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759"><span style="font-weight: 400">went live</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> earlier today in what signifies a successful outing for the protocol which has been under development for years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The launch was acknowledged to be connected to a genesis blob and it signifies the entrance of the protocol into the Web3.0 ecosystem as it aims to compete with its peers for transaction throughput.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This launch is complemented by the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/sui-gets-binance-listing-iou-price-set-to-skyrocket/"><span style="font-weight: 400">launch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of the native token of the Sui Blockchain on several cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance, OKX, Bybit, and Kucoin. Also, the team has assured that in the coming days, more than 200 decentralized applications (dApps) including Non-fungible tokens (NFTs),  Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and gaming would go live on the protocol.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ultimately, Sui has now joined the list of other high-performing L1 blockchains that are collectively tagged Ethereum killers including Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL) and Aptos amongst others. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Sui Network and its Promised Advantage</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The highly scalable layer 1 blockchain Sui was designed by Mysten Labs to support dApps with a block finality of less than half second. Mysten Labs is comprised of former engineers from Meta Labs which was formerly known as Facebook. The experience of the team stems from the design of Libra/Diem project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sui boasts of about a $2 billion valuation with over 200 projects in its directory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As an added benefit the network is brandishing, the team promises fast transaction speed that can notably rival its peers. While Sui&#8217;s closest rival Aptos is pushing for a transaction speed of 9tps, a  Twitter post </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/SuiNetwork/status/1651701079128821760"><span style="font-weight: 400">made</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by the Sui team revealed that the network is able to achieve a throughput rate of more than 300,000 Transactions Per Second (TPS) with 100 validators on testnet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sui has showcased its plans to support an ecommerce or micro-transaction focused economy and it is notably </span><a href="https://coingape.com/south-koreas-largest-exchange-joins-the-sui-token-hype/"><span style="font-weight: 400">garnering support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from different investors and protocols in the ecosystem. Its competitive throughput, if sustained can also place it at the top of the food chain in what can spell a major milestone for the protocol and the industry at large.</span></p>

While the markets are expecting a 25 bps Fed funds target rate from the current range of 4.75 to 5%, it is the likelihood of a ‘dovish’ signal that could rake up markets which are already stressed from the impact of the U.S. regional banking crisis. In this context, Barclays released its version on how the official Fed statement could be.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 Index and Nasdaq closed with over 1% drop on Tuesday, while another regional bank, PacWest Bancorp’s stock <a href="https://coingape.com/pacwest-bancorp-other-us-bank-stocks-drop-pre-market-ahead-of-fomc-meet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped</a> around 28% during the day. The sentiment continued on Wednesday in the pre-market hours. On the other hand, the US Dollar Index (DXY) also dropped, continuing in the lowest range since February 2023.</p>
<h2>Barclays Predicts Dovish Stance</h2>
<p>The bank predicts a Fed statement giving signs of dovish sentiment, although with an increase in rate hike by 25 bps, as per market expectations. Overall, the statement is dovish in nature but comes with a warning of further tightening risks depending on the economic conditions. The predicted statement <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1653721316057391104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The committee judges that with today’s increase in the target range, the stance of monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="675" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/26155944/pepecoin.webp" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="pepe coin news price" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PEPE-the new Meme cryptocurrency continues to surprise crypto participants with its massive growth and increasing popularity. In the 4-hour time frame, the coin price showcased a parabolic growth from the low of $0.000000185 to a high of $0.00000148, recording nearly 700% growth. This strong growth could be associated with its listing on top crypto exchanges just like <a href="https://coingape.com/pepe-coin-rally-bitmes-listing/">Bitmex announced</a> on Tuesday. Will the PEPE coin continue to recover further?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An evening star candle pattern in the daily increase hints the PEPE coin may face further correction.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A retracement to 50% FIB level is considered healthy for a sustained bull while below it the traders must be watchful</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the Pepe coin is $251.2 Million, indicating a 42% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/3/3oVbTAbF.png" alt="Pepe Price " width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fast recovery PEPE coin price recently topped at the $0.00000148 mark and reverted for a minor correction. This bearish pullback evaporated around 40% from this memecoin’s market value and plunged it to $0.0000009206.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this retracement is normal for the massive growth mentioned above and is in fact beneficial to check sustainability at higher levels. Moreover, the $0.0000009206 support aligned with the 50% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">Fibonacci retracement level</a> creating a strong accumulation phase to replenish the bullish recovery.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/low-cap-crypto-gems-gunning-to-explode/">Low Cap Crypto Gems Gunning To Explode In 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the buyers manage to sustain above the aforementioned support zone, the coin price may surge higher to rechallenge the $0.00000148 peak. As per the trend-based Fibonacci extension tool, the potential rally may rise 130% higher to hit $0.00000215(100% FIB). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a 4-hour candle closing below the $0.00000092 support will weaken the bullish thesis and may tumble the price another 25-27% to hit $0.0000006 psychological support.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative Strength Index:</strong> A sharp drop in the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> reflects the excessive selling pressure in the market after a strong rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Exponential Moving Average:</strong> The 50 <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> slope currently moving near the $0.000007 level may offer additional support to fuel price recovery.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pepe Coin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.000000861</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $0.000000275 and $0.00000037</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $0.000000176 and $0.0000001</span></li>

<h2>Who’s Next On The Bank Run?</h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) reportedly stated that it would buy most of the troubled First Republic Bank (NYSE: FRC) assets. Instead of witnessing a relief rally, banking stocks registered heavy selling.</p>
<p>PacWest Bancorp’s declining share price caught the attention of investors. It slid by worrying 28% to a record low in the last session to trade at $6.55. However, PacWest share price has dropped by almost 45% in the last 5 days. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/banking-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More Banking Crisis News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>

<p>Banking stocks remained volatile as the market saw a fourth lender collapse in just 4 months into the year 2023.</p>
<p>The crypto market seems to be rejoicing in the ongoing banking crisis as its cumulative cap jumped by around 1.5% over the last day to stand at $1.18 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC), the biggest crypto price surged by 2% in the last 24 hours. However, BTC price has gained by 28% over the past 60 days. It is trading at an average price of $28,576, at the press time.</p>

US Fed, Wall Street Predictions" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p>The crypto market awaits another key rate hike decision by the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Federal Reserve</a> as the banking crisis and the debt ceiling crisis raise risks of <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-breaks-key-level-risks-falling-to-26k-ahead-us-fed-rate-hike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an &#8220;economic catastrophe&#8221;</a>. Bitcoin and Ethereum price continues upside momentum as the Fed is expected to hike rates by another 25 bps after the monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, bringing borrowing to 5%-5.25%.</p>
<p>Market sentiment for the next few weeks fully depends on Fed Chair Jerome Powell&#8217;s guidance on rate hikes in the future. Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq index futures are trading flat in green today, with GDP growth and earnings coming in lower for the first quarter. The collapse of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/first-republic-bank" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Republic Bank</a> has renewed banking crisis fears, but JPMorgan predicts the banking crisis is almost over.</p>

<h2>Fed Officials and Wall Street Estimates on Rate Hike Decision</h2>
<p>Former Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12Fi6NuoG30" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> the US Federal Reserve should consider a &#8220;hawkish pause,&#8221; signaling a pause in its aggressive rate hike campaign while maintaining a tightening stance. He believes the banking crisis is just getting started as shares of US regional lenders fell sharply on Tuesday.</p>
<p>JPMorgan chief market strategist Tai Hui asserts the economy is gradually slowing as <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-gains-after-us-jobs-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">job openings data</a> revealed Tuesday. He believes the Fed should hike rates by another 25 bps and then pause. He cites the Reserve Bank of Australia rate hike yesterday after a pause last month. Further, he argues rate cuts are coming this year and the Fed will look to bring inflation to its target rate by 2024.</p>
<p>Wall Street banks overall forecast a 25 bps rate hike this month. Barclays, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and others predict a rate hike before starting to pause. As per the <strong>CME</strong> <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">data</a>, the probability of a 25 bps rate hike is almost 89%.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Price Expected to Hit $30K</h2>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC price</a> jumped 2% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $28,652. The 24-hour low and high are $27,935 and $28,881, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has increased slightly by 5% in the last 24 hours, indicating an interest among traders.</p>
<p>The US dollar index (<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">DXY</a>) fell to a low of 101.51 today. The DXY is showing volatility and is likely to jump higher after the Fed rate hike. It will bring some pressure on the Bitcoin price. However, the positive sentiment will prevail of Powell hints at a pause in the coming months.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Interestingly this move has been welcomed by many within the crypto community, who sees Bhutan’s embrace of mining as a way to help legitimize the industry and promote its adoption on a broader scale, of which Jihan Wu’s Bitdeer, a leading provider of cloud-based cryptocurrency mining services happens to be among. </span></p>
<h2><b>The Bhutan and Bitdeer Alliance</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitdeer, known for its </span><a href="https://coingape.com/bitdeer-group-contributes-to-local-communities-in-wyoming-and-texas/"><span style="font-weight: 400">landmark engagements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the crypto mining space has reportedly been in talks with Bhutanese officials about collaborating on various mining projects as its involvement in the new fund could help to bring even more attention and investment to the sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, the Singapore-based company will serve as the overall partner of the fund while Druk Holding &amp; Investments (DHI), the commercial arm of Bhutan’s government will act as a strategic partner. The fundraising is expected to commence by the end of this month, according to both entities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Additionally, the fund raised will be channeled toward greenfield operations in Bhutan. Likewise, the partnership will create job opportunities for individuals based in the country, jobs ranging from engineering to project management, as well as supervisory opportunities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, the creation of a $500 million crypto mining fund in Bhutan represents a significant development for both the country and the wider cryptocurrency industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While there are certain risks and challenges associated with this endeavor, the potential rewards could be substantial for those involved. As the sector continues to evolve and mature, it will be interesting to see how Bhutan and other nations navigate the opportunities and complexities of crypto mining.</span></p>
<h2><b>Crypto Miners face Operational Difficulties</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are also concerns about the environmental impact of crypto mining, particularly in a country like Bhutan that relies heavily on hydropower for its energy needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lot of factors including increased energy costs, fall in market prices, and high mining difficulty has contributed to making the crypto sub-sector increasingly less profitable. Hence a number of players in the mining industry have had to trade off a part of their Bitcoin (BTC) holdings to repay debts and fund operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Due to factors that have plagued the industry and affected profitability, Core Scientific was </span><a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-core-scientific-filing-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-in-texas-today/"><span style="font-weight: 400">forced to file</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year. Though the industry is normalizing, firms are still watchful for headwinds ahead.</span></p>

This lower peak gives sellers an opportunity to recuperate and prolong the retracement phase. Moreover, the two highs shown in the daily chart can be used to draw new resistance trend lines which could determine how long the BTC price may remain in a correction phase.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bitcoin price may prolong the bear trend until the overhead trendline is intact.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index at 64% reflects a bullish sentiment among traders</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $16.1 Billion, indicating a 2.83% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/q/QM9xLN9i.png" alt="Bitcoin Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1105" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 1st, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">Bitcoin price</a> flipped local support of $28875 into a suitable resistance that sellers can use to pressurize the buyers for further fall. By the press time, the coin price trades at $28777 with an intraday loss of 0.12%. With sustained selling, the coin price should tumble 6% and hit the $27000 support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aforementioned support has managed to hold the Bitcoin price higher since mid-March and aligned with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level it creates a strong accumulation zone. Thus, it is likely that the coin holders may whiteness a consolidation for a few trading sessions before giving a decisive breakout. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, interested traders must keep a close eye and the $27000 support and the above-mentioned trendline, as a breakout from either of them will determine the future trend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakout above the trendline will replenish the bullish momentum and surge the bitcoin price by 8% to hit a $31000 peak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a breakdown below $27000 will prolong the correction phase by another 6-7% to hit $25000. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The breached 20-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> slope flips into a viable resistance encouraging the resumption of a downward trend.</span></p>
<p><b>Fibonacci retracement level: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A retracement to 23.6% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">FIB</a> level is still considered healthy and keeps the overall trend bullish.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Price Intraday Levels </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $28762</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $28875 and $30750</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $27000 and $25000</span></li>
