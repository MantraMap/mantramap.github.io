<p>He has pled guilty to multiple cybercrime offenses, including conducting a complex SIM swap attack to steal large amounts of cryptocurrency, hacking Twitter, conducting computer intrusions to take over social media accounts, and even cyberstalking two victims, including a minor victim. The U.S. Attorney’s Office Southern District of New York announced Tuesday the charges against O&#8217;Connor.</p>



<p>The 2020 Twitter hack was a major event that resulted in the takeover of multiple high-profile Twitter accounts and used to promote a bitcoin giveaway scam. The attackers managed to hide scam warning responses, including from Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, and amassed approximately 11.3 BTC ($103,960) from the fraudulent activity. Despite multi-factor authentication being enabled on some of the accounts, the attackers still managed to take over the accounts and conduct their fraudulent activity.</p>



<p>Florida resident Graham Ivan Clark, an associate of O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s who also participated in the attack, was arrested in March 2021 and tried as a young offender, as he was 17 at the time of the hack. O&#8217;Connor, 23, was also charged by the SDNY and pled guilty for his role in SIM-swapping attacks targeting high-profile executives in the cryptocurrency industry. These attacks resulted in the theft of $794,000 in digital assets.</p>



<p>The SDNY declined to name the company, only stating that it “provided wallet infrastructure and related software to cryptocurrency”, but there have been numerous cases of targeted crypto companies using this same technique. Telecoms such as AT&amp;T and T-Mobile have also been sued by victims over the lack of internal security measures that have allowed these attacks to take place.</p>



<p>It is clear that cybercrime is a major issue, and it is important for companies to take steps to protect themselves and their customers. Cybersecurity measures such as multi-factor authentication and internal security protocols can go a long way in preventing attacks like the 2020 Twitter hack. It is also important for law enforcement agencies to work together to bring cybercriminals to justice.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>US President Joe Biden called for an end to the tax loophole in favor of crypto investors.</em></li>



<li><em>Such cuts are expected to save $18 billion, he said.</em></li>



<li><em>However, the comments expressed displeasure because Biden has not indicated any remaining tax loopholes.</em></li>
</ul>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>US President <a href="https://news.coincu.com/144584-joe-biden-calls-stricter-crypto-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe Biden</a> has called for an end to unspecified crypto tax regulations that can be used to circumvent the law by wealthy crypto investors. On Twitter, Biden posted an infographic that reads: &#8220;We think Congress should cut tax loopholes to make crypto investors rich.&#8221;</strong></h5>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>According to the infographic, such cuts are expected to save $18 billion. However, Joe Biden did not specify which tax loopholes exist where the reforms would generate those savings. It was this that led to comments that disagreed with his opinion.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;what loopholes ser? i gave y&#8217;all more money than i made off this stuff, while taking all the risk. You also realize most american crypto users aren&#8217;t rich, but are using crypto cuz they don&#8217;t feel like they have enough to make ends meet &#8211; because of you guys?&#8221;</p>
<cite>Dogecoin co-founder Bill Markus tweeted about the hype.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Biden also considers opponents of his plan to be Republican supporters.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We don&#8217;t have to guess what MAGA House Republicans value. They&#8217;re telling us.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Initial accounts of Joe Biden&#8217;s tax plan, released in March, suggest that the government could raise $24 billion through crypto tax regulations focused on wash trading.</p>



<p>The Biden administration also proposed a 30% tax on cryptocurrency mining, which was raised again on May 2. However, it remains to be seen how much money this tax could generate. This funding and regulation seem to target miners rather than investors. He wants the government to research ways to make crypto innovation more &#8220;responsible,&#8221; minimizing any negative impacts on the climate.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="614" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364-1024x614.png" alt="US President Calls To Eliminate Tax Loopholes For Wealthy Crypto Investors" class="wp-image-186347" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364-1024x614.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364-300x180.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364-768x461.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364-750x450.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364-1140x684.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="US President Calls To Eliminate Tax Loopholes For Wealthy Crypto Investors 6"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>That has set off alarm bells for policymakers worldwide, with China even banning cryptocurrency mining last year. That move led to an exodus of cryptocurrency miners from the country to the United States and other countries, such as Kazakhstan.</p>



<p>Before that, in early March, Biden signed an executive order on Wednesday calling on the government to consider the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies. It is a long-awaited directive that has plagued the crypto industry, primarily due to growing regulatory concerns around the world surrounding the nascent digital asset market. The measures focus on six key areas: consumer protection, financial stability, illicit activity, US competitiveness, financial inclusion, and responsible innovation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:16px">The forthcoming <a href="https://fintechfestival.asia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FinTech Festival (FTF) Asia 2023</a> is poised to be a momentous occasion that will delve into the dynamic fintech landscape. This event is scheduled for the 27th and 28th of September, 2023, at the esteemed Royal Paragon Hall in Bangkok, Thailand. The event aims to showcase the latest industry trends, innovations, and technologies while exploring how these subjects change the fintech industry and their impact on the ecosystem. AI has the potential to revolutionise the financial sector by making it more efficient, personalised, and secure. As AI technology advances, we will likely see even more innovative uses of AI in fintech, from risk management, customer service, and investment management to compliance.</h2>



<p>AI also can be used to personalise financial products and services based on individual user preferences and behaviour. For example, AI-powered robo-advisors can create investment portfolios tailored to individual users&#8217; needs and goals.</p>



<p>On Day 1 of the festival, the Conference Hall will host a compelling session on AI: &#8220;The Role of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in FinTech: How advancements in AI and Machine learning are transforming the FinTech landscape.&#8221; The event will feature prominent keynotespeakers, engaging panel discussions, and insightful fireside chats geared towards exploring this topic in-depth.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Market makers Jane Street and Jump Trading are leaving the US crypto exchange market.</em></li>



<li><em>The move comes as US regulatory scrutiny of the crypto industry has intensified.</em></li>



<li><em>Reportedly, the two companies still provide market-making services and have yet to abandon the crypto industry completely.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, as regulators crack down on the crypto industry, market makers Jane Street and Jump Trading are pulling out of the cryptocurrency exchange market in the United States.</strong></h5>

<p>Jane Street, a global trading company known for its cutting-edge approach. Similarly, Jump Trading is said to have stopped creating markets for physically settled crypto derivatives in the United States. This decision is in line with their risk management strategy. It aims to avoid potential legal challenges that may arise in the future.</p>



<p>According to reports, the two businesses still offer market-making services and are still involved in cryptocurrency. While Jump Trading&#8217;s division for trading digital assets, Jump Crypto, is quitting the US market despite its aspirations to grow abroad, Jane Street is reducing the scope of its global crypto operations.</p>



<p>Following the FTX crash, US policymakers and regulators stepped up scrutiny of the crypto industry. Some observers have even called it the &#8220;crypto war.&#8221; Industry giants such as Coinbase, a16z, or the Blockchain Association <a href="https://news.coincu.com/186110-a16z-blockchain-association-criticizes-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have responded</a> and criticized the US SEC&#8217;s tightening proposals.</p>

<p>The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has sued cryptocurrency exchange Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, accusing the company of knowingly providing unregistered crypto derivatives products in the United States.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s just say that US lawmakers and authorities have intensified their regulatory assault on the cryptocurrency industry in the wake of the stunning collapse of the centralized exchange FTX, which has made investors and company owners wary about all business decisions.</p>



<p>Former FTX SBF CEO worked at Jane Street before entering the crypto industry and has hired several former Jane Street employees to join FTX, including former FTX US President Brett Harrison.</p>

<p>A Delaware statutory trust structure called Grayscale Funds Trust, which will improve our skills as a global asset manager, was also created, according to the business.</p>

<p>A registration statement regarding the Grayscale Funds Trust has been filed with the SEC but has yet to enter into force. Ethereum Futures Funds and Bitcoin Composite ETFs will not invest directly in digital assets. These securities are neither sold nor accepted for purchase before the registration statement&#8217;s effective date.</p>



<p>Refers to an Ethereum Futures fund that will seek to purchase a number of Ether Futures Contracts so that the total nominal value (i.e., the full value of an underlying asset) of the ether underlying the Ether Futures Contracts held by the Fund has approximately 100% of the Fund&#8217;s net assets.</p>



<p>This message is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase, nor is it a sale of these securities in any state where such an offer, solicitation, or sale would be permissible without first registering with or meeting the requirements of that state&#8217;s securities laws.</p>



<p>Investment objectives, risks, fees, costs, and other important information about the Fund are included in the prospectus.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Digital Currency Group (DCG) has reassured the community about the company&#8217;s situation and the debt that needs to be paid to Genesis in May.</em></li>



<li><em>Outstanding liabilities might be loans, receivables, or other payments owed by the two companies.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Digital Currency Group (DCG) has issued the latest updates in light of the crypto community&#8217;s suspicions regarding the company&#8217;s status and debt with Genesis.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-355.png"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="600" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-355.png" alt="DCG Seeks To Raise New Funds To Pay Genesis Debts" class="wp-image-186312" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-355.png 1000w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-355-300x180.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-355-768x461.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-355-750x450.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="DCG Seeks To Raise New Funds To Pay Genesis Debts 20"></a></figure></div>


<p>DCG said on Tuesday that it is attempting to restructure outstanding commitments with its collapse lending segment Genesis and obtain expansion capital.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1) DCG Statement on Genesis Mediation:<a href="https://t.co/f6h8kI9G5S" target="_blank">https://t.co/f6h8kI9G5S</a><br><br>DCG continues to be engaged with the various stakeholders in the Genesis Capital restructuring process pursuant to the 30-day mediation period entered into by all parties on May 1.</p>&mdash; Digital Currency Group (@DCGco) <a href="https://twitter.com/DCGco/status/1655912314632040448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 9, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Outstanding liabilities might be loans, receivables, or other payments owed by the two businesses.</p>



<p>Genesis is a cryptocurrency loan organization that has been in a liquidity crisis since the November 2022 meltdown of the FTX market. Genesis had to declare bankruptcy in January of this year, revealing that it owed over $900 million to Gemini consumers.</p>



<p>According to the lending platform&#8217;s January bankruptcy papers, DCG&#8217;s total debt to Genesis includes $575 million due this month and a $1.1 billion promissory note due in June 2032. DCG may have borrowed $500 million in cash and up to $100 million in Bitcoin (BTC) from Genesis in February.</p>



<p>But, since the Digital Currency Group also incurred significant losses in the previous year, the crypto community is doubtful of DCG&#8217;s capacity to repay, which, if not, increases the likelihood of another catastrophe. </p>



<p>Genesis abruptly stated at the end of April that the debt restructuring deal between the firm and its creditors was in jeopardy due to shifting circumstances.</p>



<p>In the most recent report, DCG said that it would continue to communicate with Genesis creditors for 30 days beginning May 1 in order to identify a common voice amongst the parties.</p>



<p>Moreover, Digital Currency Group is in talks with capital providers about raising funds for internal purposes, as well as negotiating an extension or modification in loan terms with Genesis. The company is likewise dedicated to reaching a fair settlement for all parties and wants to do so within the time frame specified above.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Pudgy Penguins has secured $9 million in a seed round led by 1kx in order to extend its Web3 intellectual property.</em></li>



<li><em>The fresh funds will be used to expand the company&#8217;s intellectual property and staff.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Six months after the CEO of Pudgy Penguins denied that the NFT collection was looking to raise up to $10 million, the company has <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230509006064/en/Pudgy-Penguins-Raises-9-million-Seed-Round-led-by-1kx-to-Build-the-Next-Great-IP-Company" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that it has raised $9 million in its seed round.</strong></h5>

<p>1kx, an early-stage investment company specializing in ecosystem development, led the deal. According to the release, Big Brain Holdings, Kronos Research, the creators of LayerZero Labs, Old Fashion Research, and CRIT Investments also participated.</p>



<p>After its start in 2021 and purchase by now-CEO Luca Netz in April 2022, the popular NFT brand has grown its IP. The company said that its Pudgy GIFs had received 3 billion views and that it now has hundreds of thousands of Instagram followers.</p>



<p>Pudgy Penguins&#8217; Chief Executive Officer, Luca Netz, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Pudgy Penguins is more than just an NFT project – it is a transcendent IP brand that is providing a community of both crypto-native and non-crypto native consumers with enjoyable products, experiences, and content. With the backing of our partners and community, we are excited to create the leading Web3 IP brand of tomorrow, and to introduce Web3 to the public in a simple, seamless way.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The brand has almost 40,000 users on Discord, which often has the most passionate community players. Thus far, Pudgy Penguins has done an outstanding job of creating a recognizable brand. </p>



<p>Pudgy Penguins has already brought Web3 IP to folks who may not even know what NFTs are, with over 3 billion views on its GIFs and 500,000 followers, and tens of millions of views on Instagram. The company, in addition to its incredible marketing force, is introducing a toy line, Pudgy Toys, that puts Web3 IP and blockchain technology into the homes of ordinary people in unprecedented ways.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-354.png"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="675" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-354.png" alt="NFT Project Pudgy Penguins Secures $9 Million" class="wp-image-186308" title="NFT Project Pudgy Penguins Secures $9 Million 24"></a></figure></div>


<p>Netz said that Pudgy Penguins is more than simply an NFT endeavor, highlighting the brand&#8217;s community component. The complete supply of 8,888 Pudgy Penguin NFTs, a collection of photos of penguins in different attire, is owned by 4,592 owners.</p>



<p>Pudgy Penguins said in its financing announcement that the company would utilize the new funds to further commercialize its brand&#8217;s intellectual property, including via merchandise.</p>



<p>And, although those actions have put Pudgy Penguins up to explore mainstream ambitions, the project has also developed its cachet among NFT die-hards, no doubt aided in part by being one of the few profile picture (PFP) projects that have actually gained value despite the industry&#8217;s overall decline.</p>

<p>Roblox has successfully increased revenue and attracted new users by improving the user experience within their game-oriented metaverse. While strong bookings performance in previous quarters and monthly data reported through March have given investors peace of mind for the time being, executives must remain vigilant of Meta, a competitor willing to lose billions of dollars a year to build its Horizon Worlds. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/05/09/roblox-lures-users-with-improved-metaverse-but-they-are-not-dropping-much-cash/?sh=28daeae14c8f" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/05/09/roblox-lures-users-with-improved-metaverse-but-they-are-not-dropping-much-cash/?sh=28daeae14c8f" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a>, Nick McKay, Vice President of Equity Research at Wedbush Securities, suggests the introduction of ads and a more open economy to accelerate bookings.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Because they&#8217;ve been performing so well in terms of bookings growth, that decreases the pressure on them to introduce new products,”<strong> </strong>like new marketplaces and ads on user-generated content, “over the near term.”</p>
<cite>says Nick McKay</cite></blockquote>



<p>Analysts attribute the booking growth to consistent gains in daily active users, which increased 22% YoY in February and 26% YoY in March. Bookings, the company’s measure of the virtual Robux currency users spend playing, have also seen steady increases in the 20% range.</p>



<p>Roblox users purchase Robux to buy in-game assets such as special powers, virtual clothing, and accessories for their avatars. The company’s open-ecosystem approach allows game developers to create content and earn Robux, which can be cashed out and spent within the metaverse.</p>



<p>As Roblox seeks profitability, it faces growing competition in the metaverse sector. While benefiting from its &#8220;first-mover advantage,&#8221; Meta and Epic Games competition cannot be ignored. Epic Games recently announced during the Game Developer&#8217;s Conference in March that its Fortnite multi-player battle game will add user-generated monetization and open-ecosystem marketplaces, posing a potential threat to Roblox.</p>

<p>The BRC-20 token standard is a novel fungible token that employs Ordinals and Inscriptions to create and manage token contracts, token minting, and token transfers stored on the Bitcoin base chain. Ordinals is a numbering system that assigns a unique number to each satoshi, allowing for tracking and transfer. At the same time, the inscription process adds a layer of data to each satoshi, allowing users to create unique digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>



<p>Domodata, a Twitter user, developed the BRC-20 token standard on March 8th. Over 17,000 BRC-20 tokens are deployed on Bitcoin compared to an estimated 400 million tokens on Ethereum. Despite its traction, BRC-20&#8217;s creator has openly stated that the standard is worthless, and users should not waste money mass minting this fun experiment.</p>

<p>For interchain communication, the protocol employs Axelar&#8217;s Generic Message Passing, allowing users to cross-margin their entire portfolio and borrow against all of their on-chain assets through a single protocol.</p>

<p>It will allow users to borrow against the value of their whole asset portfolio across a number of supported blockchains, including Moonbeam, Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Avalanche, without the usage of token bridges.</p>



<p>According to Colney, Prime resolves infrastructure for that user to have a smooth experience by enabling users to receive quick liquidity on the chain, regardless of where collateral has been locked up.</p>



<p>After a deposit is made, Axelar will send a message and record the transaction on Moonbeam. When a user wishes to withdraw or borrow funds, they may do so using any chain allowed by the Prime protocol. After that, Axelar facilitates the message and distributes the tokens to the user&#8217;s preferred network.</p>



<p>Token bridges, which transfer cryptocurrency tokens from one blockchain network to another, might be vulnerable to attacks, possibly resulting in users losing their crypto to hackers.</p>



<p>Derek Yoo, CEO of PureStake, a development team for Moonbeam, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“This is a significant security enhancement for the entire DeFi industry because it eliminates manual bridging as a point of vulnerability that is often exploited.”</p>
</blockquote>
