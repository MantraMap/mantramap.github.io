<p>Cryptocurrencies with real-world use cases that bring something new to the table will always triumph over ones that don't. For this reason, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), which is up 805% in stage 3 of its presale, is expected to rise alongside both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and World Cup Inu (WCI) in 2023! And as we all know, investing early in these projects is where the most profits are made. </p>

<p class="s9">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) </p>
<p>Raising capital quickly can be difficult for many startup businesses. There are a lot of hurdles and rejections they must go through before they get their funding in order. Even more difficult is building and connecting to a community. Orbeon Protocol seeks to change this. </p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol will create a one-of-a-kind platform where startups can mint equity-backed, fractionalized NFTs as a form of investment. Investors will then be able to purchase a small part of this NFT for a price as low as $1. This system will bring faster and cheaper fundraising for both businesses, while providing new opportunities for investors! </p>
<p>What happens if a company fails to reach its funding goal? Orbeon Protocol has implemented a unique "Fill or Kill" system directly into its smart contract, which will provide refunds to all investors if the project fails to reach its target.</p>
<p>The project features a native ORBN token, which provides holders with various benefits. ORBN holders will be privy to priority access to funding rounds, governance rights, staking rewards and trading fee discounts. This utility has seen ORBN surge from $0.004 to its current price of $0.0362 in presale. And since experts believe the ORBN price may surge by 6,000% in the next few months, a significant profit for investors is not out of the question.</p>

<p class="s9">Shiba Inu (SHIB) </p>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) was created after the success of Dogecoin (DOGE). Essentially, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme coin similar to DOGE. With Shiba Inu (SHIB), users can pay fees and help make network decisions.</p>
<p>Shytoshi Kusama, the anonymous principal creator of Shibarium, is upbeat about the fate of Shiba Inu (SHIB) regardless of the broad crypto downturn. However, many traders are not so optimistic as Shiba Inu (SHIB) is worth $0.00000807 at the moment. Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders remain optimistic that the token&rsquo;s newfound utility will help it to retain value. </p>
<p class="s9">World Cup Inu (WCI)</p>
<p>The first ETH token to sponsor the World Cup is World Cup Inu (WCI). At its core, the World Cup Inu (WCI) presents a unique betting web3 platform. With the help of the World Cup Inu (WCI), users may employ Ethereum from their digital wallets to wager on their favorite team's victory.</p>
<p>World Cup Inu (WCI), like Shiba Inu (SHIB), has suffered dramatically due to its low practical value. The World Cup Inu (WCI) is currently worth $0.002106, a drastic 50% fall in just a month. Unfortunately, the World Cup Inu (WCI) disappears as soon as the sporting event ends. At this moment, an investment in the World Cup Inu (WCI) is not a good idea. </p>
