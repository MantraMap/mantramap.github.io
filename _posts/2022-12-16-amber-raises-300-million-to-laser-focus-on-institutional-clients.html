<p>Amber Group has raised &pound;300 million in a Series C funding round led by Fenbushi Capital US.</p>
<p>Amid the carnage of collapsing crypto firms across the sector, Amber Group is looking to buck the trend with its recent funding raise which it announced this morning on Twitter.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">1) Today, we&rsquo;re announcing that Amber Group has completed a $300M Series-C round, led by Fenbushi Capital US and joined by other crypto-native investors and family offices.</p>

<p>Following on from the news that it had decided to end its partnership with the UK premiership&rsquo;s Chelsea Football Club, and had also cut its workforce by 40%, Amber Group has now received backing to go ahead and reinvigorate its business.</p>
<p>Amber also said on Twitter that it would be adapting to the changing demands in the crypto market.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">2) This new round of fundraising demonstrates investor confidence in Amber&rsquo;s business and the commitment to shape our future together. As part of that future, it's important for us to adapt and protect our clients in this challenging market environment.</p>

<p>It also announced that it had changed its fundraising strategy in order to continue attracting the investment and backing from its Series C investors.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">6) That&rsquo;s why we reacted quickly to adjust our fundraising strategy. The Series C investors came on board with the understanding that we will be laser-focused on providing best-in-class services to our client base of institutional and high-net-worth investors.</p>

<p>Amber has certainly had to cut its cloth in a major effort to remain at the forefront of crypto trading, and of providing liquidity and market-making services, mainly in Asia. Its valuation has decreased below the $3 billion figure it was valued at in February of this year.</p>
<p>With its renewed investment now received and a much leaner staff with which to do business, Amber Group will be hoping that 2023 will be a lot more positive as it focuses on its core business and clients.</p>
