			  <description><![CDATA[<p>More than 40 celebrities and companies are defendants in a lawsuit brought against Yuga Labs and Moonpay over their alleged use to misleadingly promote NFTs.</p>
Lawsuit
<p>Yuga Labs and MoonPay, two companies at the centre of a legal dispute concerning the sale of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) featuring the likenesses of various celebrities, have been thrust into the spotlight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed by a group of investors in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that Yuga Labs and MoonPay defrauded investors and violated U.S. securities laws by selling unregistered securities.</p>
Alleged misleading sale of NFTs
<p>The lawsuit follows a campaign by Yuga Labs to promote the sale of NFTs featuring various celebrities, including Paris Hilton, The Weeknd, and Snoop Dogg.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NFTs, which are digital tokens stored on a blockchain, are meant to represent a certain asset in a digital format. The NFTs offered by Yuga Labs were sold using MoonPay's platform, which allegedly allowed investors to purchase the NFTs without the necessary verification and disclosure requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lawsuit further alleges that Yuga Labs and MoonPay misrepresented the sale of the NFTs, as well as their value. Specifically, the suit claims that Yuga Labs and MoonPay did not adequately disclose the risks associated with investing in the NFTs, as well as the fees associated with their sale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, Yuga Labs and MoonPay allegedly failed to provide investors with accurate information regarding the celebrities whose likenesses were featured on the NFTs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The investors behind the lawsuit are seeking compensation for the alleged losses incurred as a result of the alleged misrepresentations. They are also seeking an injunction to prevent Yuga Labs and MoonPay from selling any further unregistered securities.&nbsp;</p>
Due diligence
<p>With government enforcement agencies cracking down on all things crypto, and heavy regulation for the sector possibly arriving in the near future, investors will need to increase their diligence when purchasing such new assets as NFTs.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Again Tests 17052 Support:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 11 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to test technical support early in the Asian session as the pair bounced after trading as low as the 17060.69 area, representing a test of the 50% retracement of the recent depreciating range from 17424.59 to 16679.52.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional downside retracement levels in this depreciating range include the 16964 and 16855 levels.&nbsp; Stops were elected below the 17193.77 and 17095.50 areas during the pullback, representing the 23.6% and 38.2% retracements of the recent appreciating range from 16679.52 and 17352.62.&nbsp; If BTC/USD is able to resume its recent upward trajectory, upside areas of potential technical resistance and selling pressure include the 17791, 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, this 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Associated downside price objectives below current price activity include the 13369, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Technicians continue to eye the 14500.15 and 10432.73 areas as major downside targets, and additional downside price objectives include the 14613, 10727, and 9682 levels, areas that are related to selling pressure that intensified around the 20894.96 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;100-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 17029.33 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 17075.17.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bearishly below MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A report by global audit and advisory company Mazars proves that Binance&rsquo;s Bitcoin reserves are overcollateralised.</p>
Confirmation of overcollateralisation
<p>The world of cryptocurrencies is rapidly changing, and Binance is serious about taking a lead role in the evolution. The world's largest crypto exchange recently completed an independent audit which confirms that Binance&rsquo;s Bitcoin reserves are overcollateralized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a big deal and could signal a major shift in the way that crypto exchanges manage their reserves. While this news may not surprise those familiar with the crypto industry, it's a significant milestone for the sector as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To put it simply, overcollateralization means that Binance holds more Bitcoin than is necessary to cover customer deposits. This provides a greater level of security for customers, ensuring that their funds are not at risk of being lost in the event of a hack or other incident.&nbsp;</p>
Customer Bitcoin assets safe and secure
<p>According to the audit, Binance&rsquo;s custodial services are safe and sound, with no customer funds held in unsecured wallets. This is something that many exchanges have struggled with in the past, so this offers a clear indication that Binance is taking customer security seriously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The audit also found that Binance is compliant with the FATF&rsquo;s Travel Rule. This rule requires cryptocurrency exchanges to collect, verify and transfer customer information when sending funds to another exchange. This is a significant step forward for the entire crypto industry and could provide a much-needed layer of oversight and regulation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, the results of the audit show that Binance is committed to providing its users with a safe and secure experience. The fact that their Bitcoin reserves are overcollateralized is a clear indication that the exchange isn&rsquo;t taking any chances when it comes to the safety of customer funds.&nbsp;</p>
A contrarian opinion
<p>However, not everyone has taken the Mazars audit at its word. According to a Coindesk article, Francine McKenna, lecturer in financial accounting at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, gave the view that the audit was worthless. She said:&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They did a comparison of balances per public key address from a list they got from management. They did not compare any balances in independent banks or custodians or depositories,"</p>

<p>Mckenna was even more derogatory of the audit when she added:</p>

<p>"This is more worthless than even the Tether or USDC report,"</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>London, United Kingdom, 10th December, 2022, Chainwire</p><p>Pillar&rsquo;s latest release for its non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet ships with a sophisticated recovery mechanism that protects user funds without compromising security. Other game-changing updates include in-app cross-chain swaps and meta-transactions, which allow users to pay for gas fees on any chain with stablecoins housed on any other chain.</p>
<p>The security that is a major benefit of non-custodial wallets is also a user&rsquo;s main risk. Should they lose their private or public key, there is no other way to regain access to the wallet. People often lose access to their funds because their private key was written on a scrap of paper and got lost.</p>
<p>Pillar Wallet solves this single point of failure without compromising security through a sophisticated and fully decentralized mechanism. The private keys to a Pillar Wallet are secured by a smart contract, meaning that if the owner loses access to it, they can still recover their funds. At the same time, Pillar never retains knowledge of the private key.

A community-run, multichain DeFi wallet, Pillar supports Ethereum, Polygon, Gnosis Chain, BNB Chain, and Optimism with more coming. Pillar Wallet is powered by Etherspot SDK. While private key wallets are usually free, smart wallets come with a small cost, as a smart contract must be deployed on the blockchain. However, Pillar Wallet offers to deploy Polygon and Gnosis wallets for free, covering all deployment fees.</p>
<p>Users of Pillar Wallet can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Store, buy, send, trade, and swap assets with low-to-no gas fees on numerous EVM-compatible chains within the app</li>
  <li>Buy crypto directly on Ethereum or Polygon with card or bank transfer via implemented on-ramps</li>
  <li>Move funds seamlessly between different EVM chains without the need for external bridging apps</li>
  <li>Perform cross-chain swaps without gas tokens on the destination chain. Users can cover gas fees with any stablecoin they have in their wallet on any chain (Meta-transactions)</li>
  <li>Use Wallet Connect to interact with a wide range of supported DeFi applications directly within the in-app browser</li>
</ul>
<p>Pillar is a fully decentralized, open-source, non-custodial, and community-run wallet. Users are free to join the Pillar DAO, help manage the project&rsquo;s treasury, make proposals to the DAO and shape future developments.</p>
<p>About Pillar Wallet
Pillar Wallet is a next-generation crypto wallet that stores your cryptocurrencies securely and provides you with the same level of comfort as any custodial wallet. Its advanced smart contract design supports account recovery without exposing the private key to any third party including Pillar.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s come to light that leading crypto news platform The Block was secretly funded by Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s FTX for more than a year.</p>
<p>For a crypto news platform that led the industry with transparency and a fervent pursuit of truth and justice, this must be a bitter pill to swallow for the management and journalists who were not aware of secret loans channelled through SBF&rsquo;s Alameda Research.</p>
<p>The Block CEO Michael McCaffrey has resigned from the company following the news and he has also stepped down from the board. Meanwhile the shock and disbelief continues to be exhibited on social media channels.</p>
<p>Frank Chaparro, Editor of The Block, was particularly scathing of the actions of McCaffrey, saying that he was gutted by the news.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">1) I'm absolutely gutted by this news, which was briefed to the company this afternoon.Underpinning my shock are feelings of utter disgust and betrayal by Mike&rsquo;s actions, greed, lack of disclosure. He's literal scum. He kept every single one of us in the dark. https://t.co/jIZCxtHrfc</p>
&mdash; Frank Chaparro (@fintechfrank) December 9, 2022
<p>

</p>
<p>Bobby Moran, the Chief Revenue Officer at The Block, published a Medium post on Friday announcing that he had assumed the role of CEO following McCaffrey&rsquo;s resignation. He also expressed his disappointment at what had transpired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This news came as both a shock and disappointment to The Block leadership team. Mike&rsquo;s decision to take out a loan from SBF and not disclose that information demonstrates a serious lack of judgment. It undermines The Block&rsquo;s reputation and credibility, especially that of our reporters and researchers, as well as our efforts at industry-leading transparency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He added that neither he nor anyone else at The Block had any knowledge of the loan arrangement from Alameda and he maintained that he had seen no evidence that there was any bias in The Block&rsquo;s reporting of SBF, FTX or Alameda.</p>
<p>Mike Dudas, co-founder and ex-CEO of The Block, was also shocked and offered a harsh criticism of McCaffrey&rsquo;s dealings with Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Block's new CEO Bobby Moran evidently knew about the $43m in SBF loans *before* Thanksgiving but told employees about it today?McCaffrey never told me once that SBF was involved in any transaction related to The Block, nor did SBF.These two sociopaths deserved each other.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The collapse of FTX saw a major push for transparency in the crypto space, leading several exchanges to disclose proof of reserves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crypto.com has become the latest exchange to provide its proof of reserves, featuring an audit from Mazars Group, an independent crypto-focused advisory firm.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto.com Proof Of Reserves&nbsp;
<p>Crypto.com has joined Binance in providing proof of reserves, announcing the move in a statement issued on the 9th of December on its website. The proof of reserves revealed that the exchange has more than enough crypto assets backing any customer liabilities. The exchange&rsquo;s customer balances for top cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are over 100% backed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proof of reserves shows that Crypto.com has 102% of the Bitcoin, 101% of the Ether, and 102% of the USD Coin it needs to process withdrawals on the platform. Additionally, Tether (USDT), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Chainlink (LINK), and MANA are also included in the report, which shows that Crypto.com is maintaining reserves above 100% for all of them. The exchange shared an update on Twitter, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crypto.com releases Proof of Reserves audited results. Mazars Group compared the assets held in on-chain addresses proven to be controlled by Crypto.com with customer balances through an auditor-overseen live query of a production database as of the 7th of December.&rdquo;</p>

Audit Conducted By Mazars Group&nbsp;
<p>The statement revealed that the audit was conducted by the international audit, tax, and accounting firm, Mazars Group, which had also conducted Binance&rsquo;s proof of reserves just last month. Mazar claims its auditor page runs a version of the open-source Silver Sixpence Merkle Tree Generator program. If the auditor page was doctored to produce false results, programmers could discover the false results by running the program in their developer environment.&nbsp;</p>
An Important Step For The Industry&nbsp;
<p>The cryptocurrency community has cast considerable scrutiny on centralized exchanges since the spectacular unraveling of the Sam Bankman-Fried-led FTX. Crypto.com itself was not immune from the resulting contagion, having to pause withdrawals on Solana. The team at Crypto.com stated that by releasing its proof of reserves, it hopes to prove to users that it is a good steward of user assets and has the required capability to process all withdrawals, should the need arise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CEO of Crypto.com, Kris Marszalek elaborated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Providing audited Proof of Reserves is an important step for the entire industry to increase transparency and begin the process of restoring trust. [...] Crypto.com is fully committed to providing customers around the world a safe, secure, and compliant means of engaging with digital currencies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crypto.com is one of many exchanges to submit their proof of reserves. Crypto exchange OKX offered its proof of reserves on the 23rd of November, although its liabilities are yet to be audited. Binance has also submitted its proof of reserves for the Bitcoin it holds.</p>
Users Can Self Audit Reserves&nbsp;
<p>For users who would be a little skeptical of the exchange&rsquo;s reporting on its assets and liabilities, Crypto.com has also given the option to self-audit the exchange&rsquo;s reserves. Users can log into the app, verify the assets held by them when the audit was conducted, and copy the Merkle hash derived from the balances. After obtaining the Merkle hash, customers can navigate to a separate audit page and check if their liabilities are part of the larger Merkle tree of the exchange&rsquo;s audited liabilities.&nbsp;</p>
Criticism Of Proof Of Reserves&nbsp;
<p>Proof of reserves has come under some criticism because its proper implementation requires an external auditor to analyze the company&rsquo;s liability to ensure its solvency. This has been criticized by Jesse Powell, Kraken CEO, who was also critical of Binance&rsquo;s proof of reserves earlier in the week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ok, I&rsquo;ll give you a hint. This is just the easy stuff that says this OBVIOUSLY is not a traditional Proof of Reserves and should immediately have had actual journalists digging. Why use collateral value? Why are negative balances included? No wallet signing? Who issues BTCB &amp; BBTC?&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Elects Stops Above 17265:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 9 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) worked to sustain recent gains early in the Asian session as the pair elected Stops above the 17265.15 level, representing the 78.6% retracement of the recent depreciating range from 17424.59 to 16679.52.&nbsp; Recent upside progress has increased risk that Stops above the 17424.59 area could be tested and lead to a test of the 17759.18 area, representing the 38.2% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460.&nbsp; Additional upside retracement levels in this depreciating range include the 18469 and 19179 areas.&nbsp; Traders are watching to see if BTC/USD can establish a constructive base around the 16880 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range.&nbsp; If BTC/USD is able to extend its upward trajectory, upside areas of potential technical resistance and selling pressure include the 17791, 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, this 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas. &nbsp;Associated downside price objectives below current price activity include the 13369, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Technicians continue to eye the 14500.15 and 10432.73 areas as major downside targets, and additional downside price objectives include the 14613, 10727, and 9682 levels, areas that are related to selling pressure that intensified around the 20894.96 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;100-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 17352.03 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 17007.11.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, this 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas. &nbsp;Associated downside price objectives below current price activity include the 13369, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Technicians continue to eye the 14500.15 and 10432.73 areas as major downside targets, and additional downside price objectives include the 14613, 10727, and 9682 levels, areas that are related to selling pressure that intensified around the 20894.96 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;100-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 17352.03 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 17007.11.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Binance crypto exchange has control over more than 87% of the entire exchange volume, according to the Block analytical platform that aggregates sheer information on trading volumes using CryptoCompare data.</p>
<p>Although an analysis of raw data provided by the same global cryptocurrency market data provider comes out to be around 28%, while CoinMarketCap, that is controlled by Binance, shows roughly the same figure at 24% for the first week of December 2022.</p>
<p>By the end of November, Binance controlled around 75% of the exchange volume in the crypto industry, according to data collected by The Block. One way or another, Binance is dominating the market and is expanding further. The exchange has recently taken over the Japanese market by acquiring Sakura Exchange BitCoin. Now the exchange has obtained the first license in Asia.</p>
<p>Binance has also started negotiations to take over the Indonesian Tokocrypto exchange that is currently suffering from bad market conditions. It has also acquired a stake in the Malaysian regulated MX Global trading platform. After claims by Japan&rsquo;s Financial Services Agency that Binance was operating without a license in Japan, it exited Japan in 2018 and also received another warning from the regulator in 2021 as some Japanese residents continued to still do business with Binance.</p>
<p>With these issues cleared up, Binance is now compliant to conduct operations not only in Japan and Malaysia, but also in France, Italy, Spain, Bahrain, Abu Dhabi, New Zealand, Kazakhstan, Poland, Lithuania, and Cyprus. The company plans to continue its expansion as it has accumulated over $1 billion to bail out troubled digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the company has no-office style culture of operations and may be easily targeted by local watchdogs in one of these countries. First on the list is the U.S. Congress which may approve more vigilant regulations to tract the activity of crypto exchanges followed by SEC. However, Binance U.S. is only a small portion of Binance&rsquo;s global business. So, it could be a matter of interest for some European Securities and exchange commissions to keep a close look on Binance operations in 2023.</p>
<p>Thus, the centralisation of the crypto market may become its weakness as other crypto exchanges are far behind the leader, as OKX exchange, the second largest exchange, controls about 6% of the daily trading volume in the crypto market, according to data from The Block.</p>
<p>Whether or not Binance will finally win this battle will largely depend on the actions of local authorities. Any witch hunt in the crypto market by monetary authorities may lead to the decentralisation of companies, like Binance, and lead to the immediate loss of confidence in regulators. So, any harsh actions could simply discourage crypto enthusiasts from the regulated market and push local exchanges to act without any regulation.</p>
<p>Binance itself may easily transform its business to operate in &ldquo;decentralised structures&rdquo; as it has no offices and no compliance department that would regularly communicate with officials, as is the norm with other regulated companies in other financial segments.</p>
<p>So far, Binance is a trend setter in the crypto market as it has been pioneering the industry with larger transparency than any other market players. Immediately after the crash of FTX, one of the largest crypto exchanges, on November 8, Binance&rsquo;s CEO, Changpeng Zhao, said that the company was ready to publish proof of reserves.</p>
<p>Moreover, the exchange has published a guide of &ldquo;What is Proof of Reserves and How it Works on Binance&rdquo;. On November 15 Changpeng Zhao continued with his &ldquo;Best practices for Exchanges&rdquo; and continued with a recovery fund to prop up legitimate projects in distress.</p>
<p>Other crypto exchanges majors like Bitfinex, Crypto.com, Huobi, OKX, and Kucoin, had to follow this example and release their &ldquo;proof of reserves&rdquo;. All of the majors have shown support to Binance&rsquo;s recovery fund and promised to invest more in crypto startups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, transparency is not the only element that could challenge Binance&rsquo;s leadership. The company or event that will transform the crypto industry towards new standards while keeping it decentralised is the one that will become the new market leader.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In light of the FTX incident, United States lawmakers are putting pressure on key federal financial regulators to investigate banks with ties to cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
Senators Question Banks&nbsp;
<p>Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tina Smith have written to multiple federal agencies and regulators, questioning the close ties between crypto markets and traditional banking. The aftermath of the FTX collapse has stirred up trouble, especially among lawmakers who have intensified their scrutiny of the industry even more since then. In this case, both the Senators, who are members of the Senate Banking House and Urban Affairs Committee, have addressed the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in their letter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>An excerpt from the letter reads,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While the banking system has so far [been] relatively unscathed by the latest crypto crash, FTX&rsquo;s collapse shows that crypto may be more integrated into the banking system than regulators are aware.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;Banks Had Close Ties To Crypto&rdquo;
<p>There have been other instances of associations between FTX and financial institutions. Several noteworthy banks, like Silvergate Capital, Provident Bancorp, Metropolitan Commercial, Signature, and Customers Bancorp, have all landed in hot water due to their significant exposure to the FTX ecosystem. The Senators&rsquo; letter referenced several banks and financial corporations struggling after prolonged exposure to FTX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The letter wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It appears crypto firms may have closer ties to the banking system than previously understood. Banks&rsquo; relationships with crypto firms raise questions about the safety and soundness of our banking system and highlight potential loopholes that crypto firms may try to exploit to gain further access.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Banks In Trouble After FTX Crash
<p>Almost 90% of Silvergate&rsquo;s overall deposit base consisted of crypto deposits. In addition, more than 50% of the equity capital for Provident bank consisted of crypto loans. In the aftermath of the crash, Provident bank is experiencing losses as high as $27 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a report in The New York Times, FTX&rsquo;s sister company Alameda Research had an $11.5 million investment in the Washington state-based Moonstone Bank. The latter&rsquo;s parent company FBH Corp was headed by Jean Chalopin, who is also the Chairman of the Bahamas-based Deltec Bank, which had a working relationship with stablecoin issuer Tether (an FTX trading partner).&nbsp;</p>
Regulators' Attention On SBF
<p>On the other hand, regulators have been focusing most of their attention on ex-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. The Texas Securities Board has summoned him to investigate whether Texas securities laws were violated by offering unregistered securities products through FTX&rsquo;s yield-bearing service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other regulators, like the Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee, have also summoned Bankman-Fried to hearings discussing the collapse of the FTX ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cardano (ADA) and Flow (FLOW) are among the top 50 biggest cryptocurrencies in market cap. However, many investors and traders are abandoning the coins in favor of new projects with better real-world utilities. The Hideaways (HDWY) is anticipated to climb to the top 50 cryptocurrencies in 2023.&nbsp;</p>
Is Cardano Under Selling Pressure?
<p>Active address usage on the Cardano (ADA) network has increased dramatically by 90% daily. It has been reported that there are now over 1.2 million allocated wallets on the blockchain.</p>
<p>The price of ADA has decreased by 5% during the past week. The current price of Cardano is $0.304558. However, a look at the token's 24-hour chart reveals that bulls are in command, leading the ADA/USD pair toward a bullish momentum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, ADA bulls pushed the price to $0.318917, but they could not maintain momentum.</p>
<p>Since ADA has been doing poorly, there may be more on-chain action related to Cardano.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One possible explanation for the uptick in on-chain activity is traders cutting their losses and reducing their exposure to a faltering market by selling their holdings or taking profits.</p>
Flow Is Not Worth Your Money‒Here&rsquo;s Why
<p>The FLOW utility token helps the Flow economy function by functioning as both a means of trade and deposit. Despite its many utilities, FLOW had fallen this week after earlier in the week when it showed a more unexpected pattern of minor gains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After dropping 5.1% last week, the currency is trading at $1.11. During the past 30 days, FLOW has decreased by more than 34.5%. Do not make any new purchases of FLOW coins right now, advised veteran crypto traders.&nbsp;</p>
The Hideaways Is A Once-In-A-Lifetime Investment

<p>Stella (XLM) holders had a difficult year as the token's value has continued to decrease throughout the course of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Analysts question what will happen to Stellar (XLM) when over 25 billion tokens have been distributed. Stellar (XLM) is a novel coin that enables value transfer between assets, and it has several potential use cases.</p>
<p>Stellar (XLM) tokens enable smart contracts and facilitate the transfer of a wide variety of assets across the Stellar network. Unlike Bitcoin, XLM cannot be mined since it does not use the proof-of-work algorithm.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, one unit of Stellar (XLM) costs $0.09 and had a 24-hour trading volume of $53,669,096.</p>
Bitcoin (BTC) Price Struggling
<p>On Friday, cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin (BTC), fell. There are signs of widespread pessimism among market participants as the digital asset field continues to feel the effects of the repercussions of the bankruptcy of the crypto exchange FTX.</p>
<p>Bitcoin's value was decreasing, down to roughly $16,500, or less than 1% in the preceding 24 hours. Even while the entire repercussions of FTX's bankruptcy are likely still unknown, the largest crypto has maintained above its two-year lows near $15,550, which were recorded during peaks of selling over fears over instability at FTX and eventually its bankruptcy. However, Bitcoin has still lost over 20% of its value in the past few weeks and is currently selling for less than 25% of its record-high price of around $69,000 from a year ago.</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC) investors are looking elsewhere, and The Hideaways (HDWY) are the latest hot ticket.</p>
The Hideaways (HDWY) Price Is Expected To Grow By 15,000%
<p>The Hideaways (HDWY) could be an excellent option for anyone looking to invest in cryptocurrencies at the moment.&nbsp; When you join The Hideaways, you'll have access to a curated portfolio of luxury rental properties across the world, where you may invest and collect a passive income through rentals.</p>
<p>Here are some advantages of investing in HDWY tokens:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The platform's security has been validated by SolidProof, the industry-leading crypto security auditing organization.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">By doing this, the organization is assuring that there will be sufficient funds to operate into the next millennium.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">You can increase your return on investment (ROI) and avoid dealing with middlemen if you buy more high-end real estate anywhere in the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>The HDWY token is now selling for a miniscule price, with an expected price increase to $1 at the start of 2023.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Alameda Research-backed Ren Protocol has warned users of a potential risk of losses as it winds down its current Ren Version 1.0.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ren team stated that once version 1.0 is retired, users may not be able to recover their assets.&nbsp;</p>
Potential Losses As Version 1.0 Shuts Down&nbsp;
<p>Alameda Research-backed Ren Protocol, which issues the wrapped bitcoin asset RenBTC, warned users that they risk losing their assets once it shuts down its existing Ren 1.0 version. The project team encouraged users to redeem their tokens before the current version shuts down and the tokens lose all their value. The primary reason behind the shuttering of version 1.0 is the lack of funding after the collapse of Alameda Research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The developers added that users could unwrap their tokens and bridge them back to their native chains. The Ren team plans to disable mints on Ren shortly, meaning it would be impossible to deposit assets on the platform to bridge to other networks. Additionally, burns will also be disabled within 30 days.</p>
Compatibility Issues&nbsp;
<p>Once Ren&rsquo;s version 1.0 is shut down, it will be replaced by Ren 2.0, a new, community-run version. However, the Ren team warned that the two projects might not be compatible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As announced previously, the Ren 1.0 network is shutting down due to the events surrounding Alameda. As compatibility between Ren 1.0 and 2.0 cannot be guaranteed, holders of Ren assets should bridge back to native chains ASAP, or risk losing them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ren announced on the 18th of November that it was releasing a new protocol version. The announcement stated that the new protocol would be launched in parallel with the shutdown of the current version. This implied to users that current bridged assets may still be usable. However, the announcement has made it clear that current assets would not be usable on the new version of the platform and may be lost forever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>RenVM, the company behind the protocol, was acquired by Alameda Research in 2021. However, the collapse of Alameda necessitated the speeding up of the move to the new version of Ren.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marking this event as the end of Alameda&rsquo;s involvement in the project by sunsetting Ren 1.0 safeguards the reputation, integrity, and hence long-term prospects of the Ren ecosystem.</p>

<p>According to available data, there are currently 1130 renBTC currently on Ethereum.</p>
Users Are Confused And Angry&nbsp;
<p>The announcement from the Ren team has created considerable confusion and anger in the community as users woke up to the possibility of losing their assets in their entirety. Users also wondered if the Ren token itself was in any type of danger following recent events. One frustrated user vented,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we hold tokens on a CEX, do we need to do something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other users were confused, asking for clarification about their REN tokens and if the current update would impact those as well. Several users asked the Ren team to issue a clarification, adding that the announcement had led to panic selling. So far, the Ren team has not responded to these tweets. However, it did issue instructions on how users could check if they have bridged assets that need withdrawing.</p>

<p>Amber Group, one of the leading trading and lending platforms in Asia, has terminated a partnership with the London-based Chelsea football club. The partnership only began last May and had the Chelsea players wearing the Amber WhaleFin logo on their shirts.</p>
<p>As reported by an article on Bloomberg, the sponsorship deal was said to be worth $25 million a year. Amber is now following a legal process which will enable it to end the deal.</p>
<p>On top of the scrapping of the sponsorship deal Amber Group has also cut its workforce again. The latest cuts will see the workforce slashed from 700 to less than 400. At the peak of operations the trading and lending platform employed around 1,100.</p>
<p>In order to further cut costs Amber plans to move to cheaper offices in Hong Kong. Offices in other regions will likely close, with the employees there given the opportunity to work from home.</p>
<p>All of these moves are part of a major strategy to cut costs in what is a very difficult time for the crypto sector following the collapse and ensuing fall out from Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s FTX platform.</p>
<p>Amber Group will now move its focus away from retail customers and will instead target larger institutions such as family offices and high-net-worth individuals.</p>
<p>The Asian digital asset platform has also suffered bereavement in recent times. Its co-founder Tiantian Kullander died in his sleep at the age of only 30.</p>

			  <guid isPermaLink="false">https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2022/12/defi-and-web3-are-broken-developers-can-fix-it-using-blockchain</guid>
			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Web2 and Web3 are similar technologies, but developers approach challenges differently. Web2 focuses on reading and writing content, whereas Web3 focuses on creating content. The latter utilizes blockchain technology to facilitate user information exchange and enhance security.</p>
<p>Around 20,000 smart contract developers work full-time in DeFi and Web3, but it's a small number of the 27 million developers globally. At the same time, the number of Unique Active Wallets interacting with blockchain applications reached an average of two million per day. Still, compared to Web2 app Instagram&rsquo;s 500 million daily active users and 4.2 billion likes per day - blockchain apps fight to onboard users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ethereum and its Solidity programming language have long been the go-to choice for DeFi developers building financial services on the blockchain. However, DeFi on Ethereum has seen over $285m in hacks; the rewards could be more fairly shared, and Ethereum continues to be congested and expensive.</p>
<p>These issues cause developers to hurry to alternatives like NEAR, Avalanche, and Solana to offer financial services. But unfortunately, they also spend countless hours ensuring their decentralized application is secure, only to wake up and realize bad actors drained millions of dollars of users' funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, business leaders search the earth for people with the skills needed to build smart contracts and do whatever it takes to find users prepared to put up with the inferior user experiences presented by DeFi apps. Only to be further capped by network congestion and fees.</p>
<p>As we rapidly enter the Web3 era, where value and data quickly move across decentralized platforms with distributed ownership and authority, entrepreneurs and developers need the tools to craft ideas and build quickly, easily, and safely. Moreover, if DeFi is to ever scale beyond crypto natives, developers in Web3 need standardized tools to build applications with user experience at the core.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The argument for better DeFi&nbsp;
<p>Consumer saving and spending arguably power the world. As a result, we, the little guys, control the most critical parts of the global economy and financial system. The internet was all about information, but DeFi is about money - and in a world where cash is power, DeFi flips the model on its head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most people these days spend and save using a bank, limited by regulatory compliance and further legacy issues. Web3 gives rise to a new way of doing things. New financial products built using smart contracts allow consumers to move between providers in seconds, all from the comfort of a mobile device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DeFi also creates more competition for building financial products by lowering the barrier to entry, sharing a user base between applications, and letting money move instantly and seamlessly between opportunities.</p>
<p>The argument is that decentralized financial programs like Aave, Uniswap, and MakerDAO can directly control assets and allow financial products to operate 24/7, all year round, with 100% uptime and no staff, which will be appealing to end-users if presented in the right way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Sticky points&nbsp;
<p>Arguably the end-user experience of most decentralized apps leaves much to be desired. Blockchain wallets and asset custody, alongside a complex web of transactions and signatures, await beginners, while hardened veterans navigate the space with caution, often making mistakes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, according to DeFi Lama&rsquo;s hack rankings, more than $700m was siphoned out of the crypto space in malicious attacks from the start of October 2022 to date. So if DeFi is to succeed, users must be able to trust and use the services offered in an intuitive, familiar, almost Web2 way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For that to happen, blockchain platforms must provide more incentives for Web2 developers and pioneers to leave a familiar world and embrace Web3. These incentives don't need to be financial but provide builders with the tools to deliver stunning products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Executives at tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon will likely lead the way, leaving high-profile jobs at market-leading brands to take positions in the promising blockchain space.</p>
<p>Polygon and Circle have hired top talent from tech firms, enticing them with the angle of working on the next big thing in Web3. Further Silicon Valley talent heading for crypto includes Sherice Torres, the former Chief Marketing Officer of Facebook&rsquo;s crypto and payments team, Novi. At the same time, Amazon Cloud executive Pravjit Tiwana joined Gemini as its Chief Technical Officer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add to this a series of mass layoffs in the tech sector, including Twitter, Amazon, and Meta&rsquo;s dismissal of thousands of workers amidst the highest rates of global inflation seen for decades. This creates an incredible opportunity for businesses that previously wanted to expand their tech and payment capabilities but couldn&rsquo;t because of the shortage of talent available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, blockchain firms can now compete with recruiters from Silicon Valley for the brightest minds with a track record of taking products to market. Arguably, there has never been a better time to think about leaping into Web3 and DeFi development as more powerful tools, and no code solutions come online for those with a solid programming foundation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Playing around proves useful&nbsp;
<p>Gaming, and more importantly, the Unity game engine, led the way regarding the standardization of tools needed to build games. It gave game developers rendering and basic physics engines from which to build&mdash;altogether simplifying the process, lowering the barrier to entry, and making way for innovation and healthy competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, games got more complex while libraries of reusable art and in-game items became available for other developers to use creatively. As a result, developers, entrepreneurs, and users rushed in. With this straightforward invention of an engine and powerful tools, gaming grew bigger than music, TV, and film combined to become a billion-dollar industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ethereum has by far the most developers in the space, and according to DappRadar, more than 3500 dapps currently run from its smart contracts. The network is also the layer for many cryptocurrencies and blue-chip NFTs. However, as discussed earlier, Ethereum is no longer the sole player in smart contracts and Web3 development.</p>
<p>Moreover, Ethereum doesn't offer developers plug-and-play solutions to build dapps. Instead, developers tend to fork existing applications, as was the case for Sushiswap, a fork of Uniswap. In this scenario, developers often take the bad UX from the forked application, choosing not to improve it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ethereum is simply an industry-standard choice. However, as MySpace fell from its once high perch, and as competition increases and developers focus on end-users, other networks deliver solutions that entice Web2 builders to leap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
There are solutions&nbsp;
<p>One blockchain stack applying the plug-and-play model outlined by Unity to decentralized finance and Web3 is Radix. The company, with its roots in the United Kingdom, has been working to deliver seamless DeFi for a decade and showcased its Radix Engine, which promises to be the Unity engine of DeFi, at an event called RadFi, where CEO Piers Ridyard laid bare the inefficiencies of DeFi.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right now, crypto, DeFi, and Web3 are just one big glorified tech demo. For everyday people to use it, we've got to improve it radically.&rdquo; Piers Ridyard, CEO of Radix&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the virtual Keynote event, CEO Piers Ridyard also said what differentiates Radix is the fundamental shift in how the platform is built. The network features the world&rsquo;s first programmable DeFi engine that takes concepts such as tokens and vaults and makes them native and fully interoperable. In addition, there&rsquo;s a catalog of tools and pre-made solutions where Web2 developers can find helpful building blocks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Radix engine promises to remove all the complex, low-level work that Web3 and DeFi developers spend 80% of their time on other platforms. Creating a programming language specifically for Web3 and DeFi called Scrypto, Radix hopes to tempt millions of Web2 developers into Web3. But, more importantly, provide them with a soft landing and the ability to build scalable DeFi products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Radix also claims they studied how bad actors were hacking applications built on public networks like Ethereum. For example, events such as reentrancy attacks, spend approval attacks, or signature manipulation attacks have cost the Ethereum ecosystem millions. The Radix Engine makes many of these attacks impossible, prioritizing asset security as a primary network operation, not an afterthought.</p>
<p>Another Layer-1 blockchain trying to simplify the developer building process is Fuse Network, with its Charge product and Fuse Cash wallet. Charge takes a drag-and-drop approach to DeFi and payment infrastructure, partnering with ecosystem allies and matching them to build on their no-code platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a close focus on everyday payments and DeFi, Fuse and Radix are just a few of many teams out there trying to entice Web2 developers to embrace crypto and DeFi by helping them provide an experience similar to that of Web2 without investing years of study.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Focus where it matters&nbsp;
<p>User experience in DeFi and decentralized apps has arguably suffered as brilliant people worked on the wrong problems. Successful Web3 developers may focus on pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology and the inner workings of finance and tokenomics. Still, it comes at the expense of genuinely usable applications that the mainstream user could adopt and feel safe using.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solutions like the Radix Engine could profoundly affect the industry and attract Web2 developers to build mobile-first, user-friendly applications delivering DeFi and crypto solutions. In addition, Web2 developers bring a wealth of user onboarding and knowledge that could hold the key to the mass adoption of decentralized applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With tools becoming available Web2 developers can tap into battle-hardened code, spend less time on day-to-day app maintenance and security, and allocate resources to building beautiful applications that work, gain traction, and deliver a smooth user experience. In addition, web2 developers can join and complement the work already done by leading blockchain teams while not having to risk learning complex new programming languages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing that attracts Web2 developer talent from big tech companies to Web3 is money. According to data from Blind, a social network for professionals, Coinbase offers as much as $900,000 a year for software engineers. At the same time, the average salary for Web3 developers ranges between $75,000 and $200,000.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>INTERNET CITY, DUBAI, 9th December, 2022, Chainwire</p><p>LBank Exchange, a global digital asset trading platform, has listed SILK on December 9, 2022. For all users of LBank Exchange, the SILK/USDT trading pair is now officially available for trading.</p>

<p>Spider Tanks is a blockchain-based PVP brawler created by award-winning Netherlands based GAMEDIA and brought to players by Gala Games. Players choose between a number of Tank Bodies and Weapons in the garage, then battle it out in one of the many Spider Tanks arena maps. And since all tank parts are owned as NFTs, they can be upgraded, then sold on the secondary market at any time the player chooses.</p>
<p>Different game modes of Spider Tanks present different strategic and team-based challenges to always keep gameplay fresh. TEAM DEATHMATCH is an all-out brawl style match where the team with the most kills gets the victory. Players need to create killer destructive combinations with their teams, and let the chaos ensure. CAPTURE THE CHICKEN is a mode where the player&rsquo;s team's goal is to capture as many moving chickens as possible and become a Spider Tanks chicken master. And in CAPTURE THE FLAG, the team who holds the only one flag in their possession the longest will be victorious in the match.</p>
<p>Spider Tanks is free to play, but also incorporates a variety of play-to-earn mechanics, centering around skill-based competition, resource collection, and a player-driven upgrade cycle. It builds an ecosystem where a web of participants including NFT holders, players, and game developers revolves around playing Spider Tanks matches and receiving Victory Points that can be submitted for game token reward distribution.</p>
<p>Whether the player wants to play with a small group of close friends, or tests their skills in high-stakes competition, Spider Tanks will be the worldwide play-to-earn esports for them. Players can enjoy the free to play game or compete with other players by purchasing fully tradable Weapons, Tanks and Bodies in the Spider Tanks store for advantages to the upgrade cycle, rarity head starts and more.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cross-chain bridge Nomad has announced that it is preparing to relaunch its bridge and offer partial refunds to users impacted by the hack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nomad suffered a crippling hack in August when malicious actors discovered and exploited a loophole in Nomad&rsquo;s smart contracts.&nbsp;</p>
Relaunch And Reimburse&nbsp;
<p>The Nomad cross-chain bridge has announced that it is preparing to relaunch its bridge and reimburse users that lost funds during the $190 million exploit that took place earlier in the year. The Nomad team announced the launch of its relaunch guide after it fixed the smart contract vulnerability that hackers exploited to orchestrate the August hack. In a Medium post, the team stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since the Nomad Token Bridge hack, the team has been working hard on recovering funds and making the necessary updates to safely relaunch the Nomad Token Bridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Nomad, the protocol would allow users to bridge back their madAssets, and access a pro-rata share of the recovered funds. The company also implemented a redesign for the token bridge, without which, according to the company, the &ldquo;first people to bridge back their madAssets would receive canonical tokens on a one-to-one basis until there were no canonical tokens left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an attempt to avoid this first-come, first-serve approach, Nomad implemented several changes in the protocol and gave users the ability to bridge back, access a portion of the recovered funds, and ensure that the tokens accessed are in the original token, providing impacted users with a mechanism to access any funds recovered in future. Nomad added,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given the scope of these changes, a full audit of the smart contracts was completed along with an additional re-review of any remediations with our auditors.&rdquo;</p>

Verification Process Open&nbsp;
<p>Nomad also asked its users to go through and comply with all Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations through CoinList, a centralized exchange and launchpad, to receive their reimbursed funds. The team stated that KYC was essential to ensure that all payments were in line with compliance norms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the verification process is completed, users will receive a special NFT that will grant them access to a proportional share of the recovered funds on the Ethereum blockchain. The NFTs will be non-transferable and allow holders to receive any other funds that are recovered in the future.&nbsp;</p>
The Nomad Bridge Hack&nbsp;
<p>Nomad&rsquo;s cross-chain bridge allows users to move assets across Ethereum, Avalanche, Moonbeam, and Evmos blockchains. In August, malicious actors discovered a security vulnerability in Nomad&rsquo;s smart contracts, which enabled them to steal funds through dubious transactions. An analysis of the hack revealed that the original hackers were joined by hundreds of copycat hackers, using the same vulnerability, but modifying the recipient address, token amount, and target tokens.</p>
<p>The hack resulted from a faulty software update initiated by the Nomad developers, which allowed anyone to drain funds from the protocol. The hack resulted in $190 million being stolen from Nomad, making it one of the biggest crypto hacks of 2022. As of August, Nomad had managed to recover almost $37 million from the stolen funds with help from ethical hackers, with the company still asking hackers to return the stolen tokens.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Tests 16960 Technical Resistance:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 9 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) looked to add to marginal gains early in the Asian session as the pair appreciated to the 16959.63 level after buying pressure emerged around the 16738 area, with the intraday high representing a test of the 23.6% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 15460 to 17424.59.&nbsp; Stops were elected below the 16877 and 16708 levels during the recent pullback, representing the 38.2% and 50% retracements of the recent appreciating range from 15992.64 to 17424.59.&nbsp; Additional downside retracement levels in these recent appreciating ranges include the 16539, 16442, 16330, 16299, 16210, 15923, and 15880 levels.&nbsp; If recent downside momentum accelerates, traders may test recent two-year lows around the 15460 level established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area, a previous relative low that represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Associated downside price objectives below current price activity include the 13369, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Technicians continue to eye the 14500.15 and 10432.73 areas as major downside targets, and additional downside price objectives include the 14613, 10727, and 9682 levels, areas that are related to selling pressure that intensified around the 20894.96 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; If BTC/USD is able to resume its upward trajectory, upside areas of potential technical resistance and selling pressure include the 17791, 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;100-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16991.83 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16887.11.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bearishly below MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
