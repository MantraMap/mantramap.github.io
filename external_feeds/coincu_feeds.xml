<p>After the launch of the secure cross-chain interoperability <strong>XCM (Cross-Consensus Message)</strong>, more than <strong>350,000 XCM </strong>transfers have been sent so far. <strong>SubStrate</strong> has nearly <strong>1,000 fork-free upgrades in 2022</strong>, including <strong>15 upgrades </strong>on the Polkadot blockchain.</p>



<p>More than <strong>200 teams</strong> are now developing or launching purpose-built blockchains on the blockchain technology stack. In a huge vote of confidence in the future of the Polkadot ecosystem, the community has funded over <strong>130 million DOT</strong> and approximately <strong>300,000 KSM</strong> through crowdloans to support parachains&#8217; auction bids.</p>

<p>Partnerships with <strong>Astar Network &#8211; NTT DOCOMO</strong>,<strong> Efinity &#8211; Square Enix</strong>, and<strong> Kilt Protocol &#8211; dena news</strong> were some of the significant ecosystem adoption triumphs this year, illustrating why <a href="https://news.coincu.com/139750-polkadot-developers-claim-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polkadot</a> is the ideal home for the fast-developing Web3 potential.</p>



<p>The ecosystem teams, projects, and dapps on Polkadot continued to push the boundaries of what is possible with blockchains throughout the year, demonstrating Polkadot&#8217;s position as a leader in <strong>DeFi, NFTs, identification, gaming, privacy, robotics, IoT, supply chain,</strong> and many other use cases.</p>



<p>Additionally, on August 8, 2022, <strong>Manta Network</strong> launched the largest trusted setup in the world on the blockchain, encompassing <strong>177 countries</strong> and including more than <strong>13,000 participants.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Key</strong> <strong>Points</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Securities Commission of the Bahamas asserted that it owned $3.5 billion worth of assets belonging to the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, but FTX refuted this assertion.</em></li>



<li><em>The digital assets of the exchange were only worth $296 million when the Commission confiscated them in November, the company claimed in a statement.</em></li>



<li><em>Since mas, FTX Digital Markets is merely a &#8220;local service company&#8221; and does not hold the exchange or any of the cryptocurrencies seized, the company said it would seek the recovery of any assets that have been taken.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>According to <em>Reuters</em>, FTX refuted the statement that the Securities Commission of the Bahamas (SCB) holds $3.5 billion worth of the exchange digital assets.</strong></h5>

<p><strong>FTX</strong> said in a statement that when <strong>SCB</strong> seized its digital assets in November of this year, <strong>they were worth only $296 million</strong>.</p>



<p>The exchange urged SCB to clarify its holdings and their value. In November, <strong>SCB</strong> began the liquidation of its Bahamian subsidiary, <strong>FTX Digital Markets Ltd.</strong></p>



<p>The company said it would seek to return all seized assets, as <strong>FTX DM is only a &#8220;local services company&#8221; and does not own the exchange or any seized cryptocurrencies.</strong></p>



<p><strong>SCB</strong> <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156720-securities-commission-of-the-bahamas-ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on Thursday that it had controlled more than<strong> $3.5 billion in digital assets of the exchange</strong>, which will be used to repay the customers and other creditors in the future. SCB did not specify the type of assets or their value.</p>

<p><strong>FTX</strong> and Bahamian authorities have been at odds since the company requested bankruptcy protection on November 11. In order to help with the liquidation of <strong>FTX DM,</strong> Bahamian officials have requested access to the exchange data, but the US bankruptcy team has stated that <strong>they do not trust Bahamian officials with that information.</strong></p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157068-bankman-fried-crypto-wallets-targeted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, federal authorities are looking into a number of cryptocurrency transactions that web analysts have connected to digital wallets linked to disgraced crypto tycoon<strong> Sam Bankman-Fried</strong>. If Bankman-Fried is doing the transactions, prosecutors from the <strong>Southern District of New York (SDNY)</strong> are investigating whether he is merely shifting his own assets or cashing them out without permission.</p>

<p>If <strong>Bankman-Fried</strong> is doing the transactions, prosecutors from the <strong>Southern District of New York (SDNY)</strong> are investigating whether he is merely shifting his own assets or cashing them out without permission, according to the article.</p>



<p>Blockchain experts have been monitoring the movement of funds over the past few days that appear to be tied to digital wallets connected to the former CEO of the FTX exchange and his shuttered hedge fund <strong>Alameda Research</strong>, with a total estimated value of more than <strong>$1 million</strong> by data tracker <strong>Arkham</strong> <strong>Intelligence</strong>. After being declared a billionaire earlier,<strong> Bankman-Fried claims he still has roughly $100,000 in his bank account.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bankman-Fried</strong> <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156982-sbf-tweets-for-the-first-time-since-arrest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> he was not carrying out the transactions in a tweet on Friday.</p>

<p>Last week, Bankman-Fried was granted freedom on a <strong>$250 million</strong> bail. A <strong>$372 million </strong>worth of tokens was allegedly taken from the exchange just hours after FTX filed for bankruptcy on <strong>November 11</strong>, according to bankruptcy records.</p>

<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156720-securities-commission-of-the-bahamas-ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, the Securities Commission of The Bahamas has directed the transfer of all digital assets in<strong> FTX Digital Markets</strong>, the Bahamas unit of FTX, valued at more than <strong>$3.5 billion</strong>, to digital wallets controlled by the commission.</p>



<p>The <strong>Bahamas Securities Commission </strong>explained that based on information provided to the Commission by SBF about cyberattacks on the <strong>FTX Digital Markets Ltd (FTXDM) </strong>system, limited access by FTXDM employees to its AWS system name and other available information, the Commission has determined that <strong>digital assets under the custody or control of FTXDM already exist.</strong></p>

<p>According to data from December 31, <strong>Coinbase shares price</strong> has plunged to a historical low this week, closing <strong>at $35.39</strong> on Friday. Ark Fund boosted its Coinbase shares (COIN) holdings by <strong>164,295 shares </strong>this week, with no trades on <strong>Grayscale GBTC</strong>. Base on Decrypt&#8217;s study of Ark&#8217;s daily trading information newsletter, the full purchase was allocated to the <strong>ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF)</strong>, which invests in equity securities for fintech companies. The move comes only days after the stock of America&#8217;s top cryptocurrency exchange dropped to a new all-time low <strong>of $31.86</strong> per share on <strong>December 28</strong> before recovering over <strong>7% on Thursday.</strong> This is Ark&#8217;s largest COIN buy since December 14, when the firm purchased <strong>296,578 Coinbase shares</strong> valued more than<strong> $11.9 million</strong> for its funds.</p>



<p>Following this, the firm made two smaller acquisitions last week,<strong> acquiring 5,000 and 23,509 COIN</strong> <strong>on December 22 and December 23</strong>, respectively. Despite <strong>COIN&#8217;s 86% drop</strong> this year and the bulk of other stocks taking a beating in 2022, damaging Ark&#8217;s funds&#8217; performance, Cathie Wood has defended the firm&#8217;s policy, pointing to a five-year investing horizon.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, <strong>Ark CEO issued her year-end message</strong> with investors, saying that &#8220;anxiety about the future is tangible these days, yet catastrophe has traditionally created possibilities.&#8221; According to the most recent Bank of America Fund Manager Survey, &#8220;cash levels have not been this high since the <strong>9/11 tragedy in 2001</strong>.&#8221;</p>



<p>The statement also mentioned <strong>the CBOE equities put-to-call ratio</strong>, which <strong>reached 2.4</strong> on Wednesday, a new high for the indicator even when compared to the <strong>early 2000s tech meltdown</strong> and<strong> the 2008 financial crisis</strong>. When this metric is high, it implies that the market is unduly bearish; when it is low, it signals that a bubble is emerging.</p>

<p>On December 31, <strong>Vitalik Buterin</strong>, founder of Ethereum, responded to <strong>Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang&#8217;s</strong> query on &#8220;what is the definition of expansion of the good vision of cryptocurrency?&#8221;. Vitalik explained the enlarged concept of the beautiful vision of bitcoin in his tweet, which included <strong>better expansion, privacy, UX, and encrypted social interaction, among other things.</strong></p>

<p>In terms of safer user accounts (decentralized services), <strong>payment + SoV + DeFi delivering value</strong> to more people, <strong>encrypted social take-off</strong>, <strong>identity</strong> and<strong> SIWE (Sign-In with Ethereum) </strong>success, <strong>DAO&#8217;s new organizational paradigm</strong> is gaining traction, and so on.</p>



<p>Currently, Vitalik is regarded as one of the most prominent KOLs in the Crypto sector. Vitalik is still<strong> the leader of the cryptocurrency sector</strong>, thanks to his contributions mostly in code and his persistent commitment to the business. His influence can be seen in his point of view while evaluating a market topic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most recent occurrence was when he used a tweet to help <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156758-vitalik-buterin-helped-solana/">Solana recover</a> from a <strong>22-month low</strong>. Ironically, Ether is Solana&#8217;s most significant adversary, despite the fact that Solana was once labeled the &#8220;<strong>Ethereum killer,</strong>&#8221; which now appears a little egotistical. After Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin tweeted support for the blockchain most harmed by FTX&#8217;s demise, <strong>SOL&#8217;s 15% drop</strong> was mostly reversed. SOL recovered from its <strong>$8.02</strong> low on Thursday to reclaim its trading range of <strong>$9.63</strong>, where it had spent the majority of the day. This is also the lowest point in the previous<strong> 22 months, dating back to March 2021</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>On December 17</strong>, he also mentioned <a href="https://news.coincu.com/153790-vitalik-buterin-three-significant-crypto/">three major untapped crypto potentials</a> that he intends to realize: large-scale crypto wallet usage, the development of inflation-resistant stablecoins, and the increasing adoption of Ethereum-based applications.</p>
