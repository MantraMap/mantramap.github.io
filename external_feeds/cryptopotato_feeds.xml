			            <description><![CDATA[Shiba Inu whales are on the move. Here's one possible reason why. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shiba Inu has always been an explosive cryptocurrency to watch ever since it was launched. Even though it has become one of the largest coins by means of total market capitalization, its sudden moves are as surprising as they&#8217;ve ever been.</p>
<p>Now, it appears that whales are starting to take note and accumulate tremendous numbers of SHIB tokens. But Why?</p>
<h2>SHIB Whales Accumulate Trillions of Coins</h2>
<p>Noted in two separate transactions by the popular whale monitoring account Whale Alert, Shiba Inu seems to have new whales on board.</p>
<p>First, on August 6th at around 16:00 UTC time, a whale bought a total of 4,412,252,578,938 SHIB.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> 4,412,252,578,938 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SHIB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#SHIB</a> (40,672,144 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet<a href="https://t.co/zrqGNV5Jn9" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://t.co/zrqGNV5Jn9</a></p>
<p>— Whale Alert (@whale_alert) <a href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1688220474256330752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">August 6, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As you can see, someone added a whopping $40.6 million worth of SHIB in a single transaction. The second one took place on August 7th, again at around the same time. This time, a different whale bought 4,367,252,578,938 SHIB worth just shy of $40 million.</p>
<p>So why are big accounts accumulating millions worth of SHIB right now? Do they know something we don&#8217;t?</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shibainu_whales_cover.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265090" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shibainu_whales_cover.jpg" alt="shibainu_whales_cover" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shibainu_whales_cover.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shibainu_whales_cover-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shibainu_whales_cover-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shibainu_whales_cover-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shibainu_whales_cover-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h2>One Possible Reason</h2>
<p>One possible reason behind this behavior could be the anticipated launch of Shiba Inu&#8217;s own blockchain network &#8211; Shibarium. Its launch is supposedly slated to happen this month.</p>
<p>As <em>CryptoPotato </em><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/shibarium-beta-bridge-goes-live-for-public-testing-as-layer-2-launch-inches-closer/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> earlier in July, the Shibarium Beta Bridge went live for public testing.</p>
<p>Back in June, one of the lead developers of the Shiba Inu ecosystem <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/shiba-inu-pumps-after-lead-developer-shares-shibarium-update-details/" data-wpel-link="internal">revealed</a> that the Shibarium launch will include interesting functionalities. It will let users link NFTs to real-world assets to provide authentication and proof-of-ownership for physical items.</p>

The cryptocurrency is shaping up to be an exciting challenger to some of the largest meme coins. Let&#8217;s find out why.</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-1.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265003" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-1.png" alt="Picture4" width="468" height="312" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-1.png 468w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-1-300x200.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-1-50x33.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></a></p>
<h2>Pomerdoge (POMD): A New Age Meme Coin Model</h2>
<p>The meme coin universe is about to witness a dramatic shift as Pomerdoge positions itself to take over from Pepe as the new king of meme-themed cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Centered around the playful image of a Pomeranian dog, Pomerdoge is generating significant demand during its presale period. But what really sets this new entrant apart from other meme coins is its ambitious and comprehensive ecosystem.</p>
<p>Pomerdoge aims to redefine the meme coin space by integrating games, NFTs, and a rewarding incentive system. Users can immerse themselves in enjoyable gameplay and simultaneously earn rewards, an innovative approach designed to attract and retain users within the Pomerdoge universe.</p>
<h2>POMD Token: The Heartbeat of the Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Powering the Pomerdoge ecosystem is POMD, the utility token that fuels all transactions and activities within the platform. Acquiring POMD tokens enables users to unlock NFTs, engage in the Pomerdoge marketplace, and gain access to exclusive in-game rewards.</p>
<p>POMD is also a power meme token in its own right. As you may have guessed, a pomeranian mascot graces the face of the POMD token. Its image alone has attracted a great influx of meme-lovers to join in on its presale and is actively contributing to POMD&#8217;s increasing value as an investment asset.</p>
<h2>A Tweet From Elon Musk?</h2>
<p>The burgeoning popularity of Pomerdoge (POMD) might just catch the attention of the renowned entrepreneur and cryptocurrency enthusiast, Elon Musk. Known for his fondness for meme coins, especially those with a canine theme, such as Dogecoin, a tweet from Musk about Pomerdoge could be a game-changer.</p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s tweets have previously sent the value of Dogecoin soaring, illustrating the influence he wields in the crypto market. With the unique features of Pomerdoge &#8211; its engaging gaming platform, NFT integration, and rewarding ecosystem, it shouldn&#8217;t be surprising if Musk decides to throw his weight behind this new meme coin.</p>
<h2>The Current Presale</h2>
<p>With the Phase 1 presale price pinned at $0.007, potential investors are presented with a golden ticket. This presale is time-sensitive, as the price will increase in subsequent phases as more POMD tokens are sold to people around the world.</p>
<p>There is only a limited amount of POMD available, and 46 million have already sold in the last week alone.</p>
<h2>The Road Ahead for Pomerdoge (POMD)</h2>
<p>Pomerdoge&#8217;s unique blend of utility, high demand, and well-designed ecosystem has caught the eye of analysts. Some predict that the value of Pomerdoge could surge by as much as 5,000% this year, an extraordinary projection that reflects the project&#8217;s potential.</p>
<p>As the presale continues and more details emerge, the excitement surrounding Pomerdoge will likely grow to a fever pitch. It&#8217;s an exciting time for cryptocurrency investors, and <a href="https://pomerdoge.com/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">POMD</a> could be the spark that ignites the crypto market this year!</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Shiba Inu broke several key levels. However, it appears to struggle to maintain its recent gains.</p>
<p><strong>Key Support levels: $0.0000080</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Resistance levels: $0.0000094  </strong></p>
<h2>1. Breakout or Fakeout?</h2>
<p>Despite a significant breakout that saw the price quickly move above the resistance at $0.000094, sellers returned in force and pushed SHIB under this key level.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency is now attempting to find support on top of the ascending wedge. If successful, then the rally might continue. Otherwise, the SHIB price may fall within the wedge, which could put an end to this bullish momentum.</p>

<h2>2. Buy Volume Exploded</h2>
<p>The level of buying pressure on Saturday was not seen since early 2023, when SHIB had a similar spike in price. Back then, bulls dominated for over a month. To reach a similar result, buyers have to hold above the wedge and push higher by turning the resistance at $0.0000094 into support.</p>
<figure id="attachment_265027" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265027" style="width: 1815px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-58.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-265027" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-58.png" alt="SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-58" width="1815" height="854" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-58.png 1815w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-58-300x141.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-58-1024x482.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-58-768x361.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-58-1536x723.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-58-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1815px) 100vw, 1815px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-265027" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>3. RSI Spiked into Overbought Area</h2>
<p>During the massive buying, SHIB&#8217;s daily RSI reached 77 points which placed it in the overbought area. This prompted sellers to come back and push the price down.</p>
<p>As presented in the below chart, the RSI is making higher lows and highs. This is widely perceived as a bullish indication, and so long the price holds above the wedge, then SHIB might continue higher.</p>
<figure id="attachment_265025" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265025" style="width: 1814px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-15-31.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-265025" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-15-31.png" alt="SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-15-31" width="1814" height="854" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-15-31.png 1814w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-15-31-300x141.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-15-31-1024x482.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-15-31-768x362.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-15-31-1536x723.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-15-31-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1814px) 100vw, 1814px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-265025" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Bias</h2>
<p>The bias for SHIB is bullish.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Prediction for SHIB Price</h2>
<p>A battle at the $0.0000088 level seems likely as buyers and sellers look to position themselves above the wedge. Whoever is successful will decide where SHIB&#8217;s price goes next.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Trading volumes for Bitcoin futures and options contracts have contracted to record lows as market volatility remains low.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin derivatives are all about predicting future prices, and this generally needs prices to actually move in one direction or the other.</p>
<p>The recent market lethargy and weeks of stagnation have led to decreased activity on derivatives markers, according to Glassnode.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Bitcoin prices are infamously volatile, however the market is currently experiencing an extreme volatility compression,” it stated.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Bitcoin prices are infamously volatile, however the market is currently experiencing an extreme volatility compression. Whilst options markets reflect this, it suggests that Bitcoin is either no longer infamously volatile&#8230; or volatility could be mispriced.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p></blockquote>
<h2>Low Market Volatility Dampens Derivatives</h2>
<p>The on-chain analytics provider noted that the combined futures and options trade volume for the two assets is at or approaching all-time lows.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is currently seeing $19 billion in aggregate derivatives trade volume, whilst Ethereum markets have just $9.2 billion per day. These are less than the January lows in the depth of the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/did-you-know-this-is-the-longest-crypto-bear-market-ever-as-altcoins-languish-regulation-looms-and-tradfi-encroaches/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto winter</a> cycle.</p>
<p>It added that open interest (OI) in Bitcoin futures markets has also been flat at $12 billion over the last month. OI refers to the number of contracts that have yet to be settled. However, options markets have ticked up slightly and are now equal to futures in OI magnitude.</p>
<p>Futures are contracts that allow speculators to bet on a future price of BTC to be settled on a set date, whereas options contracts have flexible settlement dates and can be extended.</p>
<p>Implied volatility, which measures the market&#8217;s view of the likelihood of changes in prices, is also at historical lows. This suggests that market participants expect the inactivity to continue for a little while yet.</p>
<p>According to the ‘DeFi Investor’, the Bitcoin volatility index has reached an all-time low.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">BTC Volatility Index reached a new all-time low.</p>
<p>The real challenge is not surviving downtrends, but enduring the boredom of a sideways market.</p>
<p>Stay strong frens. <a href="https://t.co/009vsbTimI" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/009vsbTimI</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Furthermore, the fear and greed index remains neutral, where it has been for the past month.</p>
<h2>BTC Price Outlook</h2>
<p>Crypto markets are unmoved for yet another day, with total capitalization hovering just above $1.2 trillion. It has remained flat at this level for the past seven weeks.</p>
<p>Bitcoin dipped below $29K during late trading on Aug. 7 but rapidly recovered to return to its sideways channel at $29,150 at the time of writing.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[Press Release &#8211; Vienna, Austria, August 8th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.taskchain.co/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">TaskChain</a>, a groundbreaking Web3 project, has just announced the launch of its presale today. This new development comes prior to the introduction of TaskChain’s innovative platform which is set to transform the way users earn income online.</p>
<p>For early investors, the news about TaskChain’s presale launch is another exciting opportunity to be part of a new Web3 platform’s journey.</p>
<p>With a vision to empower individuals worldwide, TaskChain combines Web3 technology with GameFi features with the ultimate goal of creating a virtual space where everyone can easily find diverse opportunities for extra income as they collaborate with others.</p>
<p><div class="embed"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zFy5hOhYZAw?showinfo=0"></iframe></div></p>
<h2>What is TaskChain’s Mission</h2>
<p>At its core, TaskChain champions the financial inclusion of the masses through fun and user-friendly Web3 features. The platform has the potential to level the playing field, especially for low-income regions, thanks to the Quests, digital jobs, or one-time gigs that users can take on to earn cryptocurrency rewards on the platform.</p>
<p>Each “Quest” fulfillment is supported by video game mechanics with plans to introduce VR/AR features into the platform for a more immersive experience for users in the future.</p>
<p>Simply put, each “Quest” on TaskChain’s “Quest2Earn” feature breaks down everyday tasks into a game-like experience where users who fulfill these tasks get to earn XP points as they level up and collect rewards.</p>
<p>The rewards are paid in TaskChain’s native token called $TASKC.</p>
<p>In contrast to other similar platforms, TaskChain stands out as a true pioneer in the Web3 space.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional microtask platforms, TaskChain&#8217;s Quest2Earn feature brings the thrill of gaming to real-life tasks, making the earning process enjoyable. By providing a wide range of Quests and Quest2Earn functions tailored to individual preferences, TaskChain ensures that everyone, regardless of their background or location, can participate and earn rewards.</p>
<p>This inclusive approach empowers users from all walks of life to access valuable income opportunities and take charge of their financial futures.</p>
<h2>How TaskChain works</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Quest2Earn is at the heart of TaskChain&#8217;s platform. Inspired by popular video game quests, Quest2Earn offers a dynamic and engaging earning experience, allowing users to boost their income, regardless of their location or skills.</p>
<p>Quest2Earn presents a wide array of exciting quests, each tailored to individual interests and categorized into various themes such as shopping, traveling, learning, trading, events, etc. By completing these and many other tasks within these quests, users not only earn cryptocurrency rewards but also gain experience (XP) points to level up and unlock milestone rewards, making the earning process enjoyable and rewarding.</p>
<p>Tom Klein, CEO of TaskChain, said;</p>
<p>&#8220;TaskChain&#8217;s Quest2Earn is a game-changer, transforming mundane tasks into exciting opportunities to earn income while having fun. We believe in providing diverse earning opportunities for our users and creating a vibrant community where collaboration and support thrive.&#8221;</p>
<p><img src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/FIX_TaskChain_diagram_1200x720_02_1691411272T6jtZNWUsY.jpg" /></p>
<h2>TaskChain Presale</h2>
<p>TaskChain is set for kick-off with a listing price of $0.011 per TASKC token. With a current beta-stage price set at $0.004 per token, the 175% price difference marks the first phase of the presale. Early investors can participate in funding the project in an earlier price tranche.</p>
<p>TaskChain has confirmed it has successfully passed a full security audit and KYC, providing extra security for investors.</p>
<p>There is also a massive <a href="https://www.taskchain.co/giveaway" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">giveaway</a> of $120,000 in rewards for presale participants to spice up involvement in the presale.</p>
<h2>$TASKC Token</h2>
<p>$TASKC ERC20 token, the lifeblood of TaskChain, is built on the most popular Ethereum Blockchain, which will provide transparency, security, and fast payouts with valuable rewards.</p>
<p>With a total supply of 4 billion $TASKC tokens, scarcity, and value are baked into $TASKC’s design, the presale will give investors a chance to grab a share of 2.8 billion tokens spread across all the 11 exclusive stages.</p>
<h2>About TaskChain:</h2>
<p>TaskChain is set to build the world’s first unique Web3 earning platform. By combining a fun experience with crypto earnings and financial inclusion, TaskChain’s Quest2Earn feature will revolutionize the way individuals earn income and interact with blockchain technology.

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Major Shiba Inu ($SHIB) holders have been accumulating trillions of $SHIB tokens recently, leading analysts to speculate that large investors are gearing up for a potentially explosive rally.</p>
<p>These so-called “whales” appear to be stockpiling $SHIB in anticipation of a price spike, which many believe could occur around the launch of the Shibarium scaling protocol.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, investors are also flocking to purchase the emerging meme token <a href="https://bs_6e47ad52.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=shiba-inu-whales-buy-trillions-ahead-of-shibarium-as-investors-also-back-shibie-coin" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shibie Coin ($SHIBIE)</a> amid the current Shiba Inu hype, which has seen the project&#8217;s presale raise over $195,000 in early funding.</p>
<h2>Whales Accumulate Trillions of $SHIB As Major Catalysts Loom</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.whalestats.com/analysis-of-the-top-100-eth-wallets" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">data from WhaleStats</a>, the top 100 $SHIB whales now control 31% of the total supply, each boasting an average balance of 3.14 billion tokens.</p>
<p>This rapid accumulation may indicate that big investors are gearing up for significant price appreciation, sending a bullish signal to the rest of the market.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/LucieSHIB/status/1688470616188342272?s=20" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">recent tweet from LucieSHIB</a>, a member of the Shiba Inu ecosystem with over 91,000 followers, highlighted that one whale even added 4.41 trillion $SHIB tokens to their wallet on August 6.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-10.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265045" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-10.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="233" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-10.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-10-300x116.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-10-50x19.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Based on the $SHIB price at the time, this equated to a whopping $40.4 million worth of the token.</p>
<p>The Whale Alert Twitter account, which has an audience of over 2.2 million people, even <a href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1688578185380630528?s=20" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">noted another transaction of 4.36 trillion $SHIB tokens</a> less than 24 hours ago.</p>
<p>This transaction was valued at over $39.2 million – evidence that wealthy investors are continuing to take huge positions in anticipation of significant catalysts ahead.</p>
<h2>$SHIB Whales Load Up Ahead of Imminent Shibarium Launch</h2>
<p>Perhaps the biggest catalyst whales are likely anticipating is the launch of Shibarium – Shiba Inu’s highly anticipated layer-2 solution.</p>
<p>Shibarium is expected to go live after a Toronto conference in August, meaning it could now only be weeks away.</p>
<p>Shibarium aims to substantially reduce $SHIB transaction fees and improve speeds, which may potentially increase demand for the token.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-10.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265044" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-10.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="468" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-10.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-10-300x233.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-10-50x39.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Given that the mainnet’s launch is slated to occur soon, whales appear to be stockpiling tokens to maximize gains from the potential buying frenzy upon release.</p>
<p>If Shibarium can deliver tangible utility improvements for $SHIB, the token’s price could take off – handing whales sizable profits.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CoinGecko sentiment analysis</a> detailing that 76% of the community is “feeling good” about Shiba Inu, the stage may be set for a prosperous few months for $SHIB.</p>
<h2>Presale Buzz Builds Around Shibie Coin Ahead of Upcoming DEX Launch</h2>
<p>While whales are loading up on Shiba Inu, speculative crypto investors have also been jumping into a new meme coin called <a href="https://bs_6e47ad52.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=shiba-inu-whales-buy-trillions-ahead-of-shibarium-as-investors-also-back-shibie-coin" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shibie Coin ($SHIBIE)</a> amid the recent hype.</p>
<p>$SHIBIE brands itself as a fusion between Shiba Inu and Barbie, aiming to make its mark on the saturated meme coin space.</p>
<p>The project has already raised over $195,000 in its ongoing presale phase as buyers seek early exposure to a potential breakout star.</p>
<p>As noted in <a href="https://shibie.io/whitepaper/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shibie Coin’s whitepaper</a>, 60% of the 10 billion token supply is being offered to presale investors before decentralized exchange (DEX) listings commence.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-13.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265043" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-13.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="385" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-13.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-13-300x192.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-13-50x32.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>The meme coin’s detailed roadmap and focus on community-building have further stoked excitement – with many early adopters hoping $SHIBIE can produce gains reminiscent of early $DOGE and $SHIB.</p>
<p>This buzz is evidenced by the rapid growth in <a href="https://t.me/ShibieCoin" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shibie Coin’s Telegram channel</a>, which now boasts over 1,200 members at this early stage.</p>
<p>Several crypto influencers have also taken note of $SHIBIE’s potential, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dznQXK3Pd1U&amp;pp=ygULc2hpYmllIGNvaW4%3D" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">YouTuber Crypto Gains</a>, who praised the project in a recent video to his 107,000+ subscribers.</p>
<p>While the meme coin market remains unpredictable, Shibie Coin’s presale traction and clever branding could position it as a token to watch in the coming weeks.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[Press Release &#8211; Geneva, Switzerland, August 8th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>On July 30, Huawei Web 3.0 Node Engine Service (NES) went live, with its earliest support extended to two blockchains, Ethereum and TRON. A spokesperson at TRON revealed that this support is a landmark moment for its ecosystem. To be enlisted among the first networks supported by Huawei Web 3.0 Node Engine Service (NES) will not only enhance TRON&#8217;s global clout and technical prowess but also catalyze its global expansion. Meanwhile, the NES will further energize the development of Web3 and inspire innovations in blockchain applications.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify"><img src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/AC7hmrNbMjDGlfOhcghsAEApJ4VyFsqHWKICgr-bBfsc3SEO70_1691480403hxEnpjmv9y.jpeg" /></p>
<p>According to Huawei, Web 3.0 NES is a node engine platform developed by Huawei Cloud, which connects developers to mainstream blockchains, including TRON and Ethereum. It helps users streamline the management of blockchain networks, resources, and verification, whilst offering Web3 services featuring higher stability, efficiency, and security.</p>
<p>As one of the first blockchains supported by NES, TRON boasts higher transactions per second (TPS) than Ethereum, which is made possible by its unique consensus mechanism, providing a faster experience for developers.</p>
<p>NES spares its users the hassle of node operation and maintenance, allowing for rapid node configuration on TRON. By hosting a node, users can interact with the blockchain seamlessly while being able to develop DApps.</p>
<p>As one of the earliest receivers of NES&#8217;s support, TRON has already assumed an essential role in the global payment industry. TRON boasts an extensive user base while enjoying global recognition across the industry for the remarkable ecosystem it offers. Excelling in transaction speed, security, and scalability: TRON keeps raising its game to meet the ever-growing demands of its users.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://tronscan.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">TRONSCAN</a>, the total number of transactions on TRON has surpassed 6.2 billion, with over 177 million accounts across the network. Moreover, the total value locked (TVL) has exceeded $13.2 billion. TRON has established itself as a crucial global payment network and has evolved into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governed by its community. In October of last year, TRON was officially recognized by the government of Dominica as its national blockchain infrastructure, making it the country&#8217;s national public blockchain. This significant collaboration marked TRON as the first major public blockchain to partner with a sovereign nation for the development of Web3 infrastructure.</p>
<p>Currently, TRON is setting its sights on Asia, with a particular focus on Hong Kong and Japan, where Web3 unfolds vibrantly. The introduction of Huawei Web 3.0 NES has simplified network configuration. This empowers TRON to offer more efficient services to its community.</p>
<p>As a world-leading public blockchain, TRON propels the development of blockchain technology and the global digital economy. TRON will continue to execute its mission of establishing a metaverse free port and ensure its compliance with international governments while consistently improving its ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>About TRON DAO</strong></p>
<p>TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.</p>
<p>Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of August 2023, it has over 177.44 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 6.22 billion total transactions, and over $13.27 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN.</p>
<p>In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government’s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (“DMC”), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica’s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens &#8211; TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.</p>
