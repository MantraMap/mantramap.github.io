										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="630" src="https://coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hedera-hashgraph-social.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="HBAR COIN" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" srcset="https://coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hedera-hashgraph-social.jpg 1200w, https://coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hedera-hashgraph-social-300x158.jpg 300w, https://coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hedera-hashgraph-social-768x403.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent recovery in the crypto market, the Hedera coin rebounded from the $0.037 mark and witnessed a parabolic recovery. Moreover, this V-shaped recovery surged the coin to its current price of $0.071, registering a 93% gain since January 1st. Along with multiple resistance, the coin price recently breached the resistance trendline of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wedge-pattern/">falling wedge pattern</a>. Here’s how completing this pattern may influence the HBAR coin’s future price.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key  Points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intense supply pressure at $0.074 hints at HBAR price for a 10-20% correction.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish crossover between the 20-and-50-day EMA may accelerate the bullish momentum.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the HBAR coin is $302.4 Million, indicating a 234.5% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/lmHPWtQZ.png" alt="Hedera Coin " width="1946" height="1104" />Source-  Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The falling wedge pattern continuation pattern has been directing a steady downtrend for the past seven months. On January 20th,  the coin price gave a high momentum breakout from the pattern’s resistance trendline, hinting at an early sign of trend reversal. In theory, the potential target from this pattern is the highest swing top within the pattern, which is $0.1 for a Hedera coin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On January 20th, the coin price witnessed a significant inflow and showed an 18.5% intraday jump. However, this massive bullish candle closed below the local resistance of $0.074, displaying a long-wick rejection.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/best-telegram-crypto-channels-list/">CRYPTO TELEGRAM CHANNELS LIST 2023 </a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This price rejection indicates the sellers continue to defend and suggests a higher possibility for price reversal. Anyhow, a minor correction could be beneficial for Hedera coin as it will stabilize the excessive buying and check whether the buyers could sustain higher prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential retracement may tumble the altcoin price 10-to-20% by revisiting the $0.0644 or $0.0565 support, respectively.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI</strong>: The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily RSI(85.5%)</a> surged into the oversold region, indicating the over-extended buying from traders. Thus, this indicator&#8217;s value above 80% usually increases the possibility of price correction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMA&#8217;s</strong>: the recent recovery cycle pushed the Hedera coin price above the crucial EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200) in one strike. Moreover, these EMAs could provide significant support to buyers in case of price pullback.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hedera Coin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.07</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $0.74 and $0.83</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $0.64 and $0.54</span></li>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>According to documents filed in court on Friday, federal authorities have seized more than $697 million in cash and assets associated with Sam Bankman-Fried. The majority of these assets were in the form of Robinhood shares that were owned by the founder of FTX.

The majority of these assets were in the form of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/robinhood/">Robinhood</a> shares that were owned by the founder of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a>. Bankman-Fried disclosed in May that he had acquired a 7.6% stake in Robinhood which at that time appeared to be an &#8220;attractive investment.&#8221;</p>
<h2>$700 Mn Of SBF&#8217;s Assets Seized</h2>
<p>The 55 million or more Robinhood shares are at the center of a heated legal dispute that involves multiple parties, including claimants from the Caribbean, representatives of defunct <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> lender <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/blockfi/">BlockFi</a>, Bankman-Fried himself, and the leadership of <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-ftx-exchange-files-for-bankruptcy/">FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy</a> proceedings. Federal prosecutors have made the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.deb.188450/gov.uscourts.deb.188450.291.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">claim</a> that these Robinhood shares were purchased with the money that was allegedly stolen from FTX customers.</p>

<p>Over $6 million was taken from three accounts at Silvergate Bank that was in the name of FTX Digital Markets. These assets, which were formerly owned by a Bahamian company, were later acquired by the U.S. government on January 11. Silvergate recently reported that in the fourth quarter of 2022, it <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-silvergate-posts-1-billion-net-loss/">witnessed a net loss of $1 billion</a> due to the FTX collapse. In addition, the court petition claimed that about $50 million were stored at Moonstone Bank, a financial institution in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a> that has connections to the FTX administration.</p>
<h2>SBF&#8217;s Binance Accounts</h2>
<p>On the other hand, the total worth of the funds and valuables held in one <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">Binance</a> account and two Binance.US accounts were not disclosed by federal prosecutors. These three Binance <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-wallets/">wallets</a> were the only assets that had been seized which did not have any monetary worth associated with them.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/sbf-resigns-john-ray-iii-joins-as-new-ftx-ceo/">John J. Ray III,</a> who took over as the new CEO of FTX when Bankman-Fried resigned, is currently focusing on the company&#8217;s reorganization while working to recover funds that were lost by the firm&#8217;s depositors. The 30-year-old Bankman-Fried was later taken into custody in December on allegations of criminal fraud, and he is presently under house arrest upon paying a $250 million bail. SBF has pleaded not guilty and is currently awaiting trial which is slated to be on the 2nd of October.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Robinhood is finally entering the crypto wallet business with the company announcing the launch of the Robinhood Wallet today; a smartphone app that enables users to trade &#38; transfer digital assets like crypto and NFTs. According to Robinhood, it is currently being handed out gradually to more than 1 million users who signed up for <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="https://coingape.com/memecoin-is-coming-dogecoin-doge-robinhoods-wallet/" title="This Memecoin Is Coming Next On Robinhood&#8217;s Crypto Wallet"></a></p>

According to Robinhood, it is currently being handed out gradually to more than 1 million users who signed up for their waitlist.  However, to the dismay of many, the wallet came without the initial support for <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/dogecoin/">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a>.</p>
<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE) Coming Soon</h2>
<p>After the DOGE community raised concerns about the absence of the asset, the U.S.-based retail trading platform revealed that it is &#8220;hard at work&#8221; on adding support for the popular memecoin to its newly launched <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-wallets/">cryptocurrency wallet</a>. The announcement was positively greeted by the meme-community, particularly in light of the fact that Robinhood would be open to newer <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/">meme cryptocurrency</a> listings in the coming days.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;re hard at work on supporting Doge <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RobinhoodWallet?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RobinhoodWallet</a> <a href="https://t.co/Hu1Be7EGrT">https://t.co/Hu1Be7EGrT</a></p>

<h2>Robinhood&#8217;s GM Hints DOGE Listing</h2>
<p>The formal response is consistent with the statements made previously by Johann Kerbrat, the General Manager of Cryptocurrency at Robinhood. When queries concerning Dogecoin support were brought forward, Kerbrat <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/JohannKerbrat/status/1616210423472345096" rel="nofollow">acknowledged</a> that they do plan on adding additional chains and assets, albeit without disclosing which one.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-136250" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/21032258/Screenshot-2023-01-21-032156.png" alt="" width="741" height="215" /></p>
<p>However, Robinhood&#8217;s trading app already includes support for the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> dogecoin. And, in August 2021, the firm disclosed that Dogecoin (DOGE) was responsible for around 62% of the company&#8217;s revenue during the second quarter of 2021. This figure was greater than that of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and Ethereum. Also, a few days back, <a href="https://coingape.com/robinhood-latest-venture-sherwood/">Robinhood also launched Sherwood</a> which is a new media organization that would serve as a source for news and information relevant to financial markets, economics, business, &amp; technology.</p>
<p>Among the other features in the wallet, the app includes further support for exchanging cryptocurrencies without paying the network fees. This is made possible by harnessing the power of <a href="https://coingape.com/what-what-is-polygon-blockchain-how-does-matic-works-and-why-it-matters-explained/">Polygon (MATIC)</a>, which is an Ethereum sidechain. At the moment, the wallet is capable of supporting about 50 different cryptocurrencies. These include Shiba Inu, Ethereum (ETH), <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/solana-sol/">Solana (SOL)</a>, and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/usd-coin-usdc/">USDC</a>, amongst others.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin (BTC) Price To Hit $35K?</h2>
<p>Bitcoin recently surpassed the $420 billion <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization/#:~:text=The%20term%20market%20capitalization%20or,coin%20at%20any%20given%20time." target="_blank" rel="noopener">market cap</a> as its trading volume witnessed an increase of 17.45% at $25 billion in the course of the past 24 hours. This has led many to believe Bitcoin&#8217;s (BTC) price to hit the coveted $25K price mark in the coming days if the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a> is devoid of any further black swan events. However, according to the prominent crypto analyst, Michael van de Poppe, the price of the flagship <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency</a> might reach as high as $35,000. According to his <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1616514648500539400" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">analysis</a>, there will most likely be a certain time period this year &#8211;ranging from two to four months&#8211;during which the markets will see a significant relief rally. It&#8217;s possible that the scenario is already set in motion at the present time.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This year we&#39;ll probably have a window of 2-4 months in which the markets are having a strong relief rally.</p>
<p>Might actually be the case right now already. </p>
<p>A rally towards $35K is therefore possible for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a>.</p>

<h2>Massive BTC Whale Activity</h2>

The ruling, which was handed down by Judge John T. Dorsey on Friday morning, was made in spite of the recent controversy around the possibility that the high-powered law firm had potential conflicts of interest with regard to the case.</p>
<h2>Sullivan &amp; Cromwell Gets Green Signal</h2>
<p>Two creditors of FTX have accused the law firm of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell of having a conflict of interest in the matter due to the fact that a former partner of the company worked as a leading in-house lawyer for FTX. These creditors are being represented by a law firm, which has initiated legal action against <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sam-bankman-fried/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, the founder of FTX, as well as other corporate leaders.</p>
<p>During the hearing in Wilmington, Delaware, Dorsey was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no evidence of any actual conflict here. The document is certainly not something I’d allow to be submitted into the evidence in any event.</p></blockquote>
<p>On Thursday afternoon, former FTX compliance officer Dan Friedberg, who was involved in the Ultimate Bet poker disaster that occurred in 2008, issued a last-minute affidavit against Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. Marshal J. Hoda, who has been representing the FTX creditors, submitted a request to Dorsey asking that Friedberg be allowed to testify via a Zoom call. The judge stated that the witnesses had to be physically present in the courtroom, hence could not grant the request.</p>

<h2>Rumors Put To Rest</h2>
<p>According to the documents submitted to the court, FTX paid Sullivan &amp; Cromwell $8.5 million for their services on 20 separate cases. Sullivan &amp; Cromwell was a law firm that both FTX General Counsel Ryne Miller and FTX lawyer Tim Wilson worked for in the past. Mr. Miller was a partner at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, while Mr. Wilson was an associate there. Sullivan &amp; Cromwell has <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-20/ftx-judge-backs-company-law-firm-rejecting-last-minute-rumors?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow">announced</a> that it will not investigate any matters that involve the firm or any of its former partners or associates; instead, it will delegate the investigation to another law firm.</p>
<p>In significant Chapter 11 cases like the one involving FTX, judges rarely remove law firms from the case unless there is conclusive demonstration that the attorneys involved have a direct conflict of interest that cannot be resolved. Once worth $32 billion, FTX&#8217;s <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization/#:~:text=The%20term%20market%20capitalization%20or,coin%20at%20any%20given%20time.">market cap</a> plummeted due to a liquidity shortage &amp; Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder, is being <a href="https://coingape.com/the-bahamas-authorities-arrest-ftx-founder-on-criminal-charges-before-u-s-hearing/">charged with fraud</a> in a separate case.</p>

This is one of the commonly observed reversal patterns that replenished bullish momentum for further price recovery. However, can this post-correction assist <a href="https://coingape.com/price/polygon/">MATIC price</a> surpass the new local top of $1.05?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish reversal from the $0.935 breached resistance projects price sustainability at higher levels.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The range between $0.935 and $0.87 stands as a strong support zone as crucial EMAs waver between this level.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the MATIC  is $392.5 Million, indicating a 32.6% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/j/j5vZn4fQ.png" alt="TradingView Chart" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source- &#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MATIC  coin price has increased phenomenally with the start of 2023, accounting for a price jump of 38% within three weeks. However, amid the recovery phase, a sudden drop in the MATIC  market value resulted in the retest of the broken resistance of $0.935. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The minor correction should have benefitted the MATIC price by absorbing the excessive buying of recovery sentiment and stabilizing it for the future rally. Nonetheless, the price action displays lower price rejection in the recent daily candle, projecting the possibility of a continued bull run.</span></p>
<p>Also Read:<a href="https://coingape.com/defi-lending-platforms/"> Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms In 2023</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interested traders can enter this pullback opportunity a: gain confirmation once the price breaks the $1.05 ceiling. Moreover, the decline in the intraday trading volume during the retest phase bolsters the possibility of a long-term bull trend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the Polygon coin price trades at the value of $0.98, with a recovery of 2.9% in the last 24 hours. If the MATIC  coin price breaks above the recent swing high of $1.05, the buyers will obtain suitable support and raise the prices by 8% high in the coming weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a lack of buying pressure can result in a consolidation phase between $1.05 and $0.935.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicators</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>: the daily EMAs show two bullish crossovers between the 20-200 EMA and 50-100 EMA. This crossover attracts more  buyers in the market and accentuates the recovery motion in coin and </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI</strong>: the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily-RSI slope</a> turned down from close to the overbought region, indicating the recent correction tried to stabilize the ongoing bullish rally.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.98</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>

Here’s how this chart pattern may influence the future price of Apecoin price.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A parallel channel pattern is currently carrying the ongoing recovery in Apecoin price.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $5.26 is a highly concentrated resistance zone for coin holder</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Apecoin is $173. Million, indicating a 26% gain</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent recovery in the crypto market, the APE price has recently formed a local top at $5.26 resistance. However, this level, accompanied by other technical resistances such as the 200-day EMA and the parallel channel patterns trendline, creates a high supply zone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, the rising parallel channel pattern is a famous bearish continuation pattern. Though this pattern carries a steady, the chances are higher that loss of bullish momentum will break the lower trendline. Thus, a bearish breakdown from the support trendline will intensify the selling pressure and resume the prevailing downtrend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, the coin buyers could enjoy the ongoing police trend until the channel pattern is intact. By the press time, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/apecoin/">Apecoin price</a> trades at $5 and is 11.% up in the last two days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With sustained buying, the coin price will rise another 5% to revisit the dollar 5.2 resistance mentioned above. Traders should be cautious at this level as it holds the power to undermine the bullish momentum.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Vortex indicator:</strong> the reduced gap between the VI+(Blue) and VI-(Red) slope indicates a loss of bullishness momentum. However, a bearish crossover between these slopes is prevented, indicating the buyer still has the upper hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>: the 20-50-and-100-day EMA wavering around the $4.4 to $4.2 mark creates a strong support zone.</span></p>

However, a former SEC official has raised doubts about Nexo&#8217;s self-proclaimed &#8220;win&#8221; in the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> when the financial watchdog is relentlessly pursuing top crypto firms operating in the country.</p>
<h2>Nexo&#8217;s Claim For Victory</h2>
<p>On Thursday, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it had determined the Earn Interest Product offered by Nexo constituted a security that ought to have been registered with the agency. While <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1616437409163661317">speaking</a> on Nexo&#8217;s supposed self-proclaimed victory, John Reed Stark, the former chief at the SEC Office of Internet Enforcement stated that &#8212; Nexo just like every other defendant and respondent before, during, and after an investigation by the SEC, reached a settlement without &#8220;admitting or denying wrongdoing.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>Nexo pays a whopping $45M to the SEC but claims a victory for &#8220;innovation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Stark, this latest <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> trend was started by BlockFi, who, after paying a $100M fine to the SEC, instantaneously bragged that BlockFi&#8217;s appeasement was an exceptional &amp; phenomenal win for &#8220;regulatory clarity.&#8221; BlockFi&#8217;s absurd post-SEC enforcement settlement spin is now being followed by other cryptocurrency companies as well.</p>

<h2>SEC&#8217;s Tussle With Crypto Firms</h2>
<p>In a similar vein, the SEC registration threatened to level charges against <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/coinbase/">Coinbase</a> when the U.S.-based <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a> began marketing a similar crypto-lend program and when confronted by the SEC about the potential securities violation, called the financial watchdog &#8220;sketchy&#8221; in a blog post. Coinbase, unsurprisingly, capitulated in the end and decided not to launch the program.</p>
<p>Stark was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Coinbase dodged a bullet when it stopped its Lend program dead in its tracks, giving up its fight against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p></blockquote>
<p>While speaking on <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/gemini/">Gemini&#8217;s</a> tussle with the SEC, Stark noted that Gemini&#8217;s principal defense against the SEC accusation is that the SEC is being &#8220;very lame,&#8221; which does not bode well given what happened to Coinbase, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/blockfi/">BlockFi</a>, and Nexo. In conclusion, the former SEC official states that the statements made by these companies&#8211;which comprise of claiming victory for winning “regulatory clarity”&#8211;have become spontaneous and sporadic while drawing comparisons to politicians who are far more conservative in their spin.</p>

The market leader showed higher price rejection on their daily chart, indicating the formation of a local top. However, the possibility for temporary correction is high as the excess buying need to stabilize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the global crypto market cap stands at $979.20 Billion, gaining 1.13% since yesterday. Moreover, the total crypto market volume dropped 30.5% to reach the 39.3% Billion mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top Gainers and Losers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-136232" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/20203340/Screenshot_20230120_202718.png" alt="heatmap of cryptocurrency prices" width="1200" height="675" />Source- Coin360 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, the Nexo and Synthetix tokens are the highest gainers, in which NEXO price surged 18.07% to hit the $0.8467 mark, while SNX price rose 12.46% to $2.37. On the other hand, Casper and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentraland</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tokens are the top losers, with the CSPR price 1.85% down to $0.03586, whereas the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">MANA </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">price tumbled </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.53%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reach the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$0.6302</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-136233" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/20203416/Screenshot_20230120_202738.png" alt="BTC" width="1200" height="355" />Source- Coinmarketcap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following a remarkable bull run in the first two weeks of 2023, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">Bitcoin price</a> registered 30% growth and reached $21600. However, over the last few days, the daily chart showcased several higher price rejection candles at the mentioned level, indicating the exhausted bullish momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, a minor correction will be beneficial for Bitcoin as it will stabilize the excessive buying activity and validate whether the buyers can sustain higher levels.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the coin forms a local top at the $21600 mark, the potential retracement can tumble the prices 10-14% down to revisit the $19000 or $18200 level, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interested buyers could enter at this pullback opportunity or wait for $21600 to add additional coins.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-136234" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/20203449/Screenshot_20230120_202812.png" alt="eth" width="1200" height="377" />Source- Coinmarketcap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent recovery in the crypto market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">Ethereum price</a> gave a massive breakout from the combined resistance of $1500 and 20-day EMA. Thus, similar aforementioned Bitcoin price analysis, the ETH chart shows higher price rejection near the $1600 mark, indicating the profit booking from temporary traders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the altcoin may witness a short-term consolidation above at retracement to neutralize the aggressive buying. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/0/0NrHeF8H.png" alt="Ethereum Price Prediction" width="1562" height="816" />Source-Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recently reclaimed $1500 mark should switch to strong support and assist buyers in sustaining higher levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, interested traders can grab entry opportunities near the $1500 mark or at $1420 local support in case of a deeper correction.</span></p>

In its bankruptcy announcement, the company said it was looking at potentially selling or equitization process to operate under new ownership. The solution coming out of the chapter 11 process also impacts the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/gemini/">Gemini</a> users. The company said it was weighing options to achieve an optimal outcome for Genesis clients and Gemini Earn users.</p>

<h2>Timeline Target</h2>
<p>According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1616435309302153217?s=20&amp;t=TWL4szaKgAUcTl1bqovmRA">Walter Bloomberg</a> on Twitter, Genesis is planning for a potential bankruptcy exit by May 19. The timeline announcement comes in context of Gemini cofounder Cameron Winklevoss threatening to file a lawsuit against Barry Silbert and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/digital-currency-group/">Digital Currency Group (DCG)</a> if a fair deal is not offered to Earn users. However, Winklevoss acknowledged that the Genesis bankruptcy was a crucial step towards <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1616298056097624064" rel="nofollow">recovering Gemini Earn user assets</a>.</p>
<p>The Gemini cofounder said his company will work towards making Silbert and DCG accountable for the situation.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We will use every tool available to us in the bankruptcy court to maximize recovery for Earn users and any other parties within the bankruptcy court’s jurisdiction.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In this context, it remains to be seen if Silbert goes ahead with any actionable steps with regard to DCG&#8217;s subsidiaries like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which is the world&#8217;s largest Bitcoin fund. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) remained at the current levels on Friday despite the news of Genesis chapter 11 initiation. On the other side, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) continues to stay low amid rising concerns of economic slowdown.</p>

Ever since <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> announced bankruptcy, it was almost as if Genesis was next in line.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the recent relief rally with BTC price recovery since the beginning of 2023 is one of the longest such pump in Bitcoin history. The top cryptocurrency grew by as much as 27% compared to January 1.</p>
<h2>U.S. Dollar &#8211; Bitcoin Correlation</h2>
<p>Amid worries of a possible economic slowdown in the U.S., the US Dollar continues to remain at the seven month low level. Compared to the previous high of 114 in September 2022, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is down by around 12%. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> price has been maintaining an inverse correlation with DXY. In this context, the recent price rise of BTC is justified especially with no signs of a positive macroeconomic environment in near future. As of writing, the BTC price stands at $21,128 up 2.12% in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">CoinGape price tracker</a>.</p>
<h2>Genesis &#8211; DCG Scenario</h2>
<p>Perhaps owing to the prolonged speculation around Genesis bankruptcy, the crypto market seemed to have taken into account the imminent news in context of the FTX collapse in November 2022. Genesis Global had on Thursday filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the Manhattan federal court. This makes it tougher for the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/digital-currency-group/">Digital Currency Group (DCG)</a>, which is looking for a potential buyer for its media company CoinDesk. In this context, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which is also owned by DCG, is facing immense pressure with the GBTC discount now reaching 40.45%.</p>
<p>More importantly, it remains to be seen if the Genesis bankruptcy and possible worsening DCG crisis could lead to tougher regulatory stance from various governments.</p>

ERC20 allows smart-contract-enabled tokens to be used across Ethereum-based networks and projects across <a href="https://coingape.com/category/news/defi-news/">DeFi- Decentralized Finance</a>, GameFi, Decentralized Applications, and other categories.</p>
<p>Now that there are so many Ethereum ecosystem tokens it can be hard to keep track of them all. To help we have comprised a list of the top 7 ERC20 Tokens on the market today that could be a great addition to any crypto portfolio.</p>
<h4>BudBlockz</h4>
<p>BudBlockz is a growing ecosystem perfectly positioned to benefit from the increasing legalization and decriminalization of cannabis worldwide. According to the marketers, its growth rate is estimated to be 23.9%, and by 2030, the industry will reach $176.5 billion.</p>
<h4>Uniswap</h4>
<p>Uniswap is a popular decentralized trading protocol, known for its role in facilitating automated trading of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/">decentralized finance</a> (DeFi) tokens. Users can trade Ethereum tokens on Uniswap without relying on an intermediary to hold their funds. The platform uses a new trading model called an automated liquidity protocol.</p>

<h4>MakerDAO</h4>
<p>Next in the list of top Ethereum Ecosystem tokens, we have MakerDAO is a peer-to-peer decentralized protocol based on the Ethereum network that facilitates borrowing, lending, and savings. Users can borrow by depositing Ethereum-based tokens such as UNI, YFI, or BTC into the protocol, creating a collateralized debt position for the amount against which they wish to borrow. The protocol allows you to borrow funds denominated in DAI. You need Ethereum and a MetaMask wallet to do this.</p>

<h4>0x (ZRX)</h4>
<p>Ox is a DEX based on the Ethereum blockchain. It is an infrastructure protocol that allows users to easily trade ERC20 tokens and other assets on the Ethereum blockchain without relying on centralized intermediaries like traditional <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">cryptocurrency exchanges</a>.</p>
<h4>Aave</h4>
<p><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://aave.com/" rel="nofollow">Aave</a> is an open-sourced lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. Lenders can contribute various Ethereum-based assets into liquidity pools to earn rewards, while borrowers can place approved assets up for collateral to borrow against.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-136194" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/20173157/Aave-price.png" alt="" width="1163" height="571" /></p>
<h4>Chainlink</h4>
<p>Chainlink is a decentralized ‘oracle’ network launched in 2017. Chainlink is without a doubt the most popular decentralized oracles in the crypto market—others include Band Protocol and MakerDAO—and is among the best Ethereum ecosystem tokens to own. As <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/smart-contract/">smart contracts</a> are on-chain but need off-chain data, oracles – also known as middleware – act as intermediaries to link real-world data to the blockchain. It is surely one of the best Ethereum ecosystem tokens to consider as your next investment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Pre-Budget 2023: Last year when Finance Minister Sitaraman presented the Union Budget, it came as a surprise as there was a new tax imposition added.

A massive 30% tax on all the income generated from crypto trading in India. To get some relief from this, the crypto community has certain expectations from the Budget 2023.</p>
<p>The tax rates and set-off advantages that apply to securities as an asset class &#8211; and to VDAs as a suitable asset class &#8211; should likewise be applied to crypto assets.</p>
<p>Based on the risks they carry, securities are categorized as an asset class. There are items ranging from low-risk government bonds to high-risk derivatives. VDAs should be properly categorized and regulated as a result, allowing investors to comprehend the risks involved and make investment decisions accordingly.</p>
<h2>Removing hefty taxes on crypto</h2>
<p>Many people think that taxing virtual digital assets is a good place to start. The reason is, it has given investors in cryptocurrencies confidence that the government has taken this asset class seriously. The present tax rate, which is 30%, is somewhat high. We anticipate that the government will lower the capital gains tax rate in the 2023 budget.</p>

<p>According to experts, the taxation of cryptocurrencies is still in its infancy not just in India but around the world, and will develop over time. While the laws are clear on many points, the crypto sector is still looking for clarification in a few areas. Investors anticipate some taxation certainty in addition to tax relief for cryptos.</p>
<p>The government should also consider the removal or at least some reduction <a href="https://coingape.com/1-tds-on-crypto-in-india-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the 1% TDS rate</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When the TDS mandate was announced, we acknowledged and appreciated the government’s effort to track and monitor VDA transactions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>said Sumit Gupta, Co-Founder &amp; CEO, CoinDCX.</p>
<p>He also talked about their suggestion to the government as they are a partner and collaborator with the government in their effort to understand and monitor the VDA ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Notably, through our representation for the upcoming Union Budget 2023 – 2024, we have suggested that the rate of TDS be brought down to 0.01%. This lower rate will help Indian VDA businesses offer competitive prices to Indian VDA users and protect them from exposure to unregulated foreign exchanges,&#8221; he added.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Expectations to classify VDA</h2>
<p>In response to parallels of digital assets to highly speculative activities like gambling, betting, and other similar activities, the 30% barrier was established. When it comes to requiring clear ownership and title of the assets as well as enough liquidity in the system to conduct transactions, VDAs are more like securities trading. The current tax structures will only hinder risk-taking traders from trading.</p>
<p>Uncertainty exists around the possibility of offsetting losses from one crypto against gains from another. Although understandably, losses incurred through crypto cannot be offset against any other revenue, an inter-source set-off should be allowed, and clarifications should be made to this effect.</p>

The most notable revolution currently is the interest the world has in the cutting-edge chatbot ChatGPT.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/what-is-chatgpt-3-why-it-has-become-so-popular/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence model</a></strong> that engages in conversational dialogue. It&#8217;s a chatbot, similar to the automated chat services available on some companies&#8217; customer service websites. It was created by <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/education/who-is-elon-musk-discover-tesla-founder-investments-net-worth-and-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI</a></strong>, a technology research firm dedicated to ensuring that artificial intelligence benefits humanity as a whole. The &#8220;GPT&#8221; in ChatGPT stands for &#8220;Generative Pre-training Transformer,&#8221; which refers to how ChatGPT processes language.</p>
<p><iframe title="What is ChatGPT and How You Can Use It" width="678" height="381" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/40Kp_fa8vIw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3><b>Potential uses of ChatGPT</b></h3>
<p>This could be used in a variety of ways, including improving search engine functionality, automating processes such as disputing traffic tickets or bills, and creating code, among many other applications. ChatGPT has also been accused of being abused by malicious actors. The bot could be used by hackers to create convincing <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/how-to-spot-a-crypto-scam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">malware or phishing scams</a></strong>. Also, the model could be tasked with creating and disseminating misinformation.</p>
<h3><b>How does ChatGPT generate revenue?</b></h3>
<p>The business that developed ChatGPT, OpenAI, has not yet extensively monetized the platform. Through the OpenAI website, ChatGPT was available without charge as of January 11, 2023. According to Investopedia&#8217;s inquiry to ChatGPT itself, the business does, however, sell the application programming interface on a subscription basis to organizations looking to use the model for their own purposes.</p>
<p>OpenAI revealed in mid-January 2023 that it would introduce ChatGPT Professional, a paid version of the software. According to reports, the paid version of the model will offer advantages like no blackout windows, an unlimited number of messages to send to the bot, and similar advantages.</p>
<h2><b>Will ChatGPT Replace Google?</b></h2>
<p>It can be useful to ask a computer questions and get prompt answers, and Chatbot does just that. In addition to its own suggested responses to user queries, <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a></strong> typically offers users links to websites it believes to be relevant. As it makes use of the most recent, carefully trained <a href="https://coingape.com/5-ways-metaverse-and-artificial-intelligence-influence-avatar-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI algorithms</a>, ChatGPT responses frequently outperform Google&#8217;s suggestions.</p>
<p>Users should verify the information from reliable sources before putting their trust in ChatGPT replies. Since ChatGPT, unlike Google, only uses raw text without any links or citations, confirming the accuracy of its responses requires work. Additionally, Google is developing its own substantial language models and heavily utilizing AI in its search algorithms as ChatGPT advances. Therefore, it seems a little unrealistic to think that ChatGPT will replace Google&#8217;s search engine, but it is undoubtedly paving the way in that direction.</p>

<h2><b>How to use ChatGPT for Cryptocurrency Trading?</b></h2>
<p>The ability to analyze and mechanization of AI Chatbots makes digital token trading possible. Trading digital token with ChatGPT enables traders to make effective decisions based on real-time information, maximizing opportunities and profits.</p>
<h3><b>1. Real-Time Cryptocurrency Analysis by ChatGPT</b></h3>
<p>The cryptocurrency market could undergo a complete transformation thanks to ChatGPT&#8217;s effective analysis and automation capabilities. By providing real-time data and insights, Chatbot can help traders and investors make more strategic decisions that maximize price developments and opportunities.</p>
<h3><b>2. To develop a cryptocurrency trading algorithm</b></h3>
<p>Using Pine Script, a computer language used by TradingView, a Twitter user showed how they communicated with Chatbot. Also, how the tool turned a straightforward notification into a basic trading bot. By using the application programming interface provided by <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a></strong>, traders can also direct ChatGPT to create code. However, that will display the current orders for the <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin BTC</a></strong> and other <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency</a></strong> trading pairs (API).</p>
<h3><b>3. MYC Trading</b></h3>
<p>MYC Trading can be done using Chatbot. To predict whether a digital token will enter a bullish or bearish stage of evolution, MYC Trading uses a combination of trend analysis and momentum oscillators. The trend line serves as a distinguishing feature; when the price touches an upward direction, a long signal may be shown; when the price crosses an outward direction, a short signal may be shown. This index suggests a starting point.</p>
<h3><b>4. Creation of Smart Contracts</b></h3>
<p>The ability of Chatbot to create and manage smart contracts enables the creation of <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/dao-decentralized-autonomous-organization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DAOs</a></strong>. However, that can improve organizational performance and make decisions based on predetermined norms and methodologies. DAOs can operate without the need for centralized control or long-term planning, allowing them to make decisions and carry out actions in accordance with the rules outlined in their smart contracts.</p>

Picking up hints from Shytoshi Kusama&#8217;s Twitter status, ShibArmy believes the Shibarium Beta release to happen on February 14, Valentine&#8217;s Day.</p>
<h2>Shibarium Beta Launch Anticipated on Valentine&#8217;s Day</h2>
<p>Shiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama changed his Twitter bio and added hints on the anticipated launch of the Shibarium Layer-2 blockchain. The new bio reads:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">&#8220;tending the Pine Tree of Life. Quickly learning to play the flute before putting </span><span class="r-18u37iz"><a rel='nofollow'  class="css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-901oao css-16my406 r-1cvl2hr r-1loqt21 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0" dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Shibarium?src=hashtag_click">#Shibarium</a></span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> in a heart-shaped box with a bow.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Shiba Inu whale SHIB HOLDER in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/ShibaInuHodler/status/1616376818864476162">tweet</a> on January 20 shared that Shibarium is expected on February 14 — Valentine&#8217;s Day. The Shiba Inu community believes the new bio indeed points to the Shibarium Beta launch on Valentine&#8217;s Day.</p>
<p>While the preparedness for the launch is not fully complete, release of <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-shibarium-beta-is-about-to-be-launched-confirms-shiba-inu-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documents on fundamental concepts</a> and the BONE gas token by Shibarium&#8217;s official Twitter account indicates the launch is near. The development activity has also increased related to Shibarium, as per data on GitHub.</p>
<p>However, the launch could be delayed due to unforeseen circumstances as it had happened earlier. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu and BONE tokens attract <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/whale-accumulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whale accumulation</a>, the SHIB burn rate has increased, and social sentiment hit an all-time high. Shiba Inu ranks as the <a href="https://coingape.com/shiba-inu-shib-ranks-2nd-in-most-secure-crypto-projects-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2nd most secured crypto project</a> in an analysis by blockchain security pioneer CertiK.</p>
