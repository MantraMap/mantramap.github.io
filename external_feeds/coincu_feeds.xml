<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Circle&#8217;s USDC is still showing less attractiveness after being affected by the collapse of SVB.</em></li>



<li><em>The circulation of the stablecoin continues to drop $400 million in the past week.</em></li>



<li><em>Its rival, USDT, is still dominating the market.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Circle has enough reserves in its treasury to support its stablecoin USDC. Notwithstanding the belief in its stablecoin, USDC underperformed.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-200.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="640" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-200-1024x640.png" alt="Circle USDC Continues Circulation Fall After March Crisis" class="wp-image-185710" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-200-1024x640.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-200-300x188.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-200-768x480.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-200-1536x961.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-200-2048x1281.png 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-200-750x469.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-200-1140x713.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Circle USDC Continues Circulation Fall After March Crisis 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to official data, in the past 7 days, Circle issued a total of $600 million in USDC and redeemed $1 billion in USDC, and the circulation decreased by about $400 million. As of May 4, the total circulation of USDC was $30.1 billion, and the reserve was $30.2 billion, including $4.8 billion in cash and $25.4 billion in short-term US treasury bonds.</p>



<p>USDC&#8217;s substantial reserves, which include a large amount in short-term US Treasury bonds, may help reassure consumers that their holdings are backed by dependable and safe assets.</p>



<p>Circle generated 140 million USDC yesterday and transferred it to Coinbase on behalf of a significant buyer, according to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">gm<br><br>Some big moves last night!<br><br>Circle minted $140M USDC, transferring it to Coinbase on behalf of a big buyer.<br><br>Also, the Ethereum Foundation transferred 15K ETH, or about $30M, to Kraken.<br><br>They still hold over 320K ETH. <a href="https://t.co/KEkPpQYsRZ" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/KEkPpQYsRZ</a></p>&mdash; Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1654801359714041861?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 6, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>USDC Coin was the most troubled stablecoin when its Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) holdings failed. Notwithstanding the challenges that USDC has experienced, Circle, the stablecoin&#8217;s issuer, has continued to profit from its development.</p>



<p>Despite demonstrating reserves, USDC&#8217;s market worth continued to fall. At the time of publication, USDT was eroding the former&#8217;s market share. Currently, the circulating supply of USDT is still leading the stablecoin market with over $82.2 billion. Compared to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USDT</a>, USDC is quite modest with more than 30 billion dollars but it is still the 2nd stablecoin.</p>



<p>If the US government acts quickly and offers more clarification on the stablecoin area, the market may improve.</p>



<p>Yet, as of press time, interest in USDC has continued to fall. Fresh addresses lost interest in the stablecoin as well. This was shown by the stablecoin&#8217;s decreased network expansion over the previous month.</p>

<li><em>The plan is intended to fortify both the United States&#8217; basis for protecting American customers&#8217; technology and the United States&#8217; leadership in worldwide standards creation.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cryptocurrencies have been included in the White House&#8217;s newest list of emerging technologies.

<p>In a statement issued Thursday, the White House said that the plan intends to boost technology for consumer protection as well as U.S. leadership and competitiveness in worldwide standard-setting. According to the statement, universal standards guarantee that technology stays consistent in terms of security.</p>



<p>According to the paper, the federal government would prioritize digital identity infrastructure and distributed ledger technologies, which are having an expanding influence on a variety of vital economic sectors. Biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and semiconductors are also on the list.</p>



<p>The White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) <a href="https://news.coincu.com/185181-white-house-taxing-crypto-mining-30/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a Digital Asset Mining Excise (DAME) on cryptocurrency mining companies on Tuesday. The CEA said that if enacted, it would levy a 30% tax on miners&#8217; power expenses to cover economic and environmental consequences. The idea has riled the sector.</p>



<p>Although other energy-intensive enterprises would not be subject to the new levy, the CEA claims that crypto mining does not produce the same local and national economic advantages as firms that use comparable quantities of power.</p>



<p>Apart from environmental issues, the government claims that digital asset mining has a disproportionate effect on communities of color due to pollution and pushes up renewable energy prices.</p>



<p>Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital, Cipher Mining, Greenidge Generation, BitDeer, and CleanSpark are among the major mining companies in the United States. According to Bitcoin mining outfit Riot, the tax would relegate the United States to leader place in the crypto industry.</p>

<p>Wu reported that upon analyzing the holding addresses of many PEPE tokens, it had been discovered that many early purchasers possessed Milady NFT. One multisig wallet, in particular, manages 6.9% of the total PEPE supply, with its earliest ETH transaction originating from an address that holds a significant amount of Milady&#8217;s sister project, Remilio. </p>



<p>During the early stages of PEPE&#8217;s growth, the NFT community and Chinese investors in Dubai joined forces to purchase PEPE, ultimately becoming the primary driving force behind its early success.</p>

<li><em>The protocol&#8217;s DEI stablecoin was hacked on the Arbitrum network yesterday, causing the DEUS token to drop by more than 30%.</em></li>

<p>On May 7, DeFi protocol DEUS tweeted an update on the progress of the DEI stablecoin security breach. All contracts are currently suspended, and on-chain DEI tokens are destroyed to prevent further disruption.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today:<br>We are currently in the process of comprehending the actual backing of DEI tokens. To achieve this, snapshots of all DEI balances are taken before the tokens are burnt.<br>After evaluating all balances, we will formulate a comprehensive recovery and redemption plan.</p>&mdash; DEUS (@DeusDao) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeusDao/status/1654808613934989312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 6, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The team is currently learning about DEI&#8217;s solid support. To achieve this, a snapshot of all DEI balances is taken before tokens are burned. After assessing all balances, a comprehensive collection and redemption plan will be developed. For users having trouble trying to arbitrage after the hack, there will be an assessment, and they may be allowed to reverse those trades as soon as possible.</p>



<p>This action will involve recording the DEI in circulation and adding support from all other users. DEUS advises users to be patient and only interact with an existing DEI contract once a specific redemption plan is in place.</p>



<p>In addition, DEUS states that it will not take any legal action if the funds are returned. This event will be considered a white hat rescue, and 20% of the money will be awarded as a bug bounty. The team also confirmed that the multi-signature on the BSC chain is controlled by the DEUS team. The team will publicly confirm the receipt of the funds.</p>



<p>DEI stablecoin token<a href="https://news.coincu.com/185587-deus-finances-stablecoin-dei-was-hacked-token-price-drop-more-than-30/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> was hacked </a>and lost $1. The token was recently pegged at $0.30 and lost that peg during the attack. The cause of the attack was discovered to be a fundamental technical problem in the token contract, and this also led to a drop in the protocol&#8217;s DEUS token by more than 30%.</p>



<p>Before that, in May of last year, the ecosystem <a href="https://news.coincu.com/89239-deus-stablecoin-loses-its-dollar-peg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was hit</a> by two flash loan attacks in the past two months, resulting in a loss of more than $30 million.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Six of the top ten memecoin PEPE holding addresses are cryptocurrency exchange hot wallet addresses.</em></li>



<li><em>Exchanges, including Binance, OKX, Huobi, MEXC, KuCoin, and Gate are said to have whales holding large amounts of this memecoin.</em></li>



<li><em>It has created a fever for investors with the return of the memecoin wave, causing its trading volume to skyrocket.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>PEPE&#8217;s market valuation surpassed $1 billion after its launch in Binance&#8217;s Innovation Zone and saw trading volume skyrocket. However, the majority of coins <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x6982508145454Ce325dDbE47a25d4ec3d2311933#balances" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">held</a> by the top 10 wallet addresses come mainly from whales on exchanges.</strong></h5>

<p>Etherscan data shows that among the top 10 holding addresses of memecoin PEPE, 6 are hot wallet addresses of cryptocurrency exchanges. Among them, Binance, OKX, Huobi, MEXC, KuCoin, and Gate ranked 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 8th, and 9th, respectively, and the memecoin held by these addresses accounted for about 17.23% of the total issuance.</p>



<p>Pepecoin is a new coin meme created on the Ethereum network, inspired by the famous internet green frog meme of the same name. The memecoin also specifically states on its website that PEPE is a memecoin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no official team or roadmap. The coin is completely useless and is for entertainment purposes only.</p>



<p>Yet after just four days, Pepecoin has increased more than 500 times, with over 25,000 transactions taking place for this unit. This memecoin was also highlighted as a top Twitter search term. From there, we can plainly understand the market&#8217;s FOMO with not just PEPE but also memecoin.</p>



<p>It is well known that <a href="https://news.coincu.com/185623-pepecoin-memecoin-market-warning-rings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pepecoin</a> not only provides fresh wind to the market but has also generated record-high profits for certain early investors.</p>



<p>As of this writing, the memecoin exchanged hands at $0.00000257, with an over 30% decrease in trading volume within the last 24 hours.

<p>The popularity of PEPE has made its profits skyrocket. Its market cap soared past $1 billion in just a few weeks of its launch, leaving investors strongly intrigued despite <a href="https://news.coincu.com/185623-pepecoin-memecoin-market-warning-rings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warnings</a> of an impending crash.</p>



<p>Besides, with the recent popularity of Memecoin, several honeypot tokens with the same name as Memecoin have appeared. 0xBc…8Faa has issued many popular Tokens of the same name, such as PEPE, POGAI, TURBO, etc, on Arbitrum for profit.</p>



<p>The basic method is to push these Tokens of the same name to the top position in custodian platforms like Dex Screener and DexTools through swiping trading volume and adding more liquidity, attracting users to buy and then sell a large number of Reserved Tokens when the price rises to a certain extent break the market to make a profit.</p>

<li><em>This artwork depicts St. Edward&#8217;s Crown, the centerpiece of the United Kingdom&#8217;s Royal Jewels.</em></li>



<li><em>The non-fungible token is currently accessible for free on the Nifty Gateway marketplace.</em></li>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-187.png"><img decoding="async" width="429" height="1024" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-187-429x1024.png" alt="The Evening Standard To Issue The Free Coronation NFT Of King Charles" class="wp-image-185664" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-187-429x1024.png 429w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-187-126x300.png 126w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-187-768x1832.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-187-644x1536.png 644w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-187-858x2048.png 858w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-187-750x1789.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" title="The Evening Standard To Issue The Free Coronation NFT Of King Charles 22"></a></figure></div>


<p>The collectible NFT features an animated version of Trevor Jones&#8217; &#8220;The Oath.&#8221; The centerpiece of the UK&#8217;s Crown Jewels, St. Edward&#8217;s Crown, is seen in this picture.</p>



<p>In the Nifty Gateway marketplace, the non-fungible token is now accessible for free. Users simply need to enter an email address to register and collect the item, however it is unclear if a transaction charge is required to obtain the item.</p>



<p>The NFT is &#8220;open edition,&#8221; which means there is no restriction to how many NFTs may be issued. As of 11:30 p.m. UTC on May 5, users have minted 9,200 copies of the NFT.</p>



<p>Since there is no restriction to the number of NFTs that may be issued, there is a time constraint. The token may only be minted between Thursday, May 4, and Sunday, May 7.</p>



<p>Jones started The Oath NFT as a physical artwork at his Edinburgh studio. The artwork portrays Queen Elizabeth II wearing Saint Edward&#8217;s Crown during her coronation in 1953.</p>



<p>The Oath is not the first NFT coin to honor the British royal family. After the death of Queen Elizabeth II in September, an NFT collection, QueenE, by Web3 builders Fabio Sevá, Vincius Rodrigues, Everton Matumoto, and the pseudonymous mladen.eth, was published to commemorate the life of England&#8217;s longest reigning queen (1952-2022).</p>



<p>The event marks a major UK company&#8217;s entry into the crypto space. The Evening Standard was the fourth biggest daily publication in the United Kingdom by circulation in 2020, after only The Metro, The Sun, and The Daily Mail. In January 2023, it distributed about 314,000 papers every day.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Oath,&#8221; created in partnership with Apollo NFT, may be claimed immediately via Nifty Gateway or by a QR code printed in the newspaper. The QR codes are also shown on billboards along Oxford Street for individuals who want to attend the festivities in person. Nevertheless, before you get too excited, keep in mind that the NFTs will not be minted and handed to collectors&#8217; wallets until May 7.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Texas House of Representatives committee is promoting a bill that aims to issue a 100% gold-backed digital currency.</em></li>



<li><em>Redemptions of the currency will be processed in physical or monetary form in gold, with the State Comptroller or a contracted third party administering these redemptions.</em></li>



<li><em>Implementing the bill is estimated to cost the state $25 million in a limited system.</em></li>

<p>The bill, known as <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/88R/billtext/pdf/HB04903I.pdf#navpanes=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HB4903</a>, was presented on March 10 by Representative Mark Dorazio and had 42 sponsors. It is now being considered by the House State Affairs Committee before being voted on by the House.</p>



<p>If passed, the state government would establish an electronic infrastructure enabling users to trade and pay with the digital currency, as well as conduct redemptions for the gold or tokens that support it.</p>



<p>According to the law, the state comptroller would create a digital currency that is backed by gold such that each unit of digital currency produced reflects a certain fraction of a troy ounce of gold held in trust. Similarly, the government will need to develop an electronic system that would enable people to freely deal with this money in order to make payments.</p>



<p>Currency redemptions will be conducted in physical or monetary form in gold, with the State Comptroller or a contracted third party handling the administration. The bill&#8217;s implementation is expected to cost the state $25 million in the case of a restricted system and up to $100 million in the case of a full transactional system.</p>



<p>Yet, the bill has gained grassroots support, as indicated by a 78-page document submitted on April 26 and signed by numerous Texas in favor of this tough money legislation.</p>



<p>In its current form, the bill establishes that the Texas state comptroller will provide custody of the gold backing the digital currency or that it can be assigned to a third party, who must maintain the same amount of gold as the digital currency&#8217;s issuance, making it a 100% backed digital currency.</p>

<p>President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev signed a new law titled &#8220;On Digital Assets in the Republic of Kazakhstan&#8221; on February 6 of this year; however, some of the terms of that law have not yet taken effect. In particular, the law places limitations on the availability of affordable electricity for miners.</p>



<p>The fact that the law was passed shows that this country is interested in the growth of the business, as stated by Sergey Putra, Senior Coordinator for Government Relations at the National Blockchain and Data Center business Association in Kazakhstan. industry of cryptocurrencies in its whole.</p>



<p>Since China began cracking down on cryptocurrency mining in the spring of 2021, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/165565-kazakhstan-new-law-digital-assets/">Kazakhstan</a> has emerged as a prominent center for the industry. Because it offers subsidized electricity to miners, Kazakhstan was ranked third in the world in terms of its average hash rate during the month of January 2022.</p>



<p>However, according to researcher Jaran Mellerud, Kazakhstan&#8217;s market share has fallen from a high of 18% in October 2021 to just 4% in May 2023. This decline occurred during the years 2021 and 2023.</p>

<p>Following Binance&#8217;s exit from the Voyager Digital transaction on April 25, the now-defunct crypto lender recently informed creditors that they can anticipate their initial cash and crypto payouts &#8220;within the next few weeks.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Voyager Digital has issued a creditor update. According to the firm&#8217;s tweet, they may be able to anticipate some cash or cryptocurrency back &#8220;in a few weeks.&#8221; This update follows the TSX-listed crypto lender&#8217;s long and challenging journey. Voyager Digital suspended withdrawals on July 1, 2022, and filed for bankruptcy three days later. Since then, the failed company has been navigating the bankruptcy process after being on the verge of being acquired by Binance US.</p>



<p>After Binance US pulled out of the arrangement, the crypto lender was forced to file for bankruptcy in the Southern District of New York in order to repay creditors. Despite the difficulties, Voyager Digital claims to be making progress. The firm revealed in a tweet on Thursday that they are &#8220;in the process of finalizing liquidation procedures.&#8221; Voyager also informed creditors that the liquidation procedures had to be completed before the proposal could be implemented.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://news.coincu.com/185390-voyager-creditors-may-be-optimistic/">Voyager</a> is pushing through with their plan to reimburse creditors, there is still the possibility of opposition. Parties will have 10 full days to object to the idea, according to the firm. If no objections are made, Voyager aims to make the plan &#8220;effective&#8221; at that time. If an objection is raised, however, the court will convene a hearing to consider the issue before the plan can be implemented.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plan included a provision outlining what would happen if the Binance US transaction fell through, allowing Voyager to begin liquidating assets. &#8220;Voyager is also finalizing everything internally that is required to make distributions to creditors,&#8221; the firm says. We anticipate that initial distributions will occur in the coming weeks.&#8221; Reactions to Voyager Digital&#8217;s attempt to compensate creditors have been divided. While many clients are happy with the progress, some are dissatisfied.</p>
