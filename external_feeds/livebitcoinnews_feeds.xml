TRX price could rise further if it clears the $0.060 resistance.</em></p>
<h2>Tron Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, tron price started a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tron-trx-price-analysis-more-gains-possible-above-0-055/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">decent increase</a> from the $0.050 support zone against the US Dollar. TRX price remained well bid and started a decent increase above the $0.055 zone.</p>
<p>It traded above the $0.0565 and $0.0580 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. The price even surged above the $0.060 resistance zone. The price traded as high as $0.0657 and is currently correcting lower. There was a move below the $0.064 level.</p>
<p>The price declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.0497 swing low to $0.0657 high. It is now trading above $0.058 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).</p>
<p>On the upside, TRX is facing resistance near the $0.0632 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.0650 level. A close above $0.065 is must for a fresh increase. In the stated case, the price could rise towards the $0.070 resistance in the near term.</p>

<p>The next major support is now forming near $0.058. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.0497 swing low to $0.0657 high.</p>
<p>If there is a downside break below the $0.058 support, the price might revisit the $0.0550 support. Any more losses might call for a move towards the $0.0520 zone in the near term.</p>

A base was formed and the price climbed higher above the $19,500 resistance zone.</p>
<p>The bulls pushed the price above the $20,000 resistance and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). The upward move was such that the price climbed towards the $21,500 resistance zone. A high is formed near $21,595 and the price is now consolidating gains.</p>

<p>An immediate resistance on the upside is near the $21,500 level. The next major resistance might near the $22,000 zone. The first major resistance is near the $22,500 level. A clear move above the $22,500 level might send the price towards $24,000, above which the price might rise towards the $25,000 level.</p>
<p>Any more gains might push the price towards the $26,200 zone. If there is no upside break, the price might decline below the $21,000 level. The first major support is near $20,900 or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $18,714 swing low to $21,595 high.</p>
<p>The next key support is near the $20,500 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $18,714 swing low to $21,595 high, below which the price might accelerate lower.</p>
<p>In the stated case, the price could decline towards the $19,450 level. Any more losses might send the price towards the $18,000 level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Andy Yen is the CEO and co-founder of Proton, a privacy-centered organization that seeks to provide a whole new (autonomous) <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerhuang/2022/12/27/andy-yen-ceo-of-proton-on-the-tech-giants-that-dominate-the-internet-the-webs-future-and-bitcoin/?sh=2ba9e2d34075" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">version of the Internet</a>.</p>
<h2>Yen Wants to See Change in the Crypto Space</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, he gave his thoughts on <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>, crypto, and what traders can expect in terms of legislation and what the space will hold.</p>
<p>In the past, Yen has gone on record about being a bitcoin and crypto supporter. Right now, bitcoin is only accepted as a form of payment amongst limited agencies and enterprises, and given the circumstances surrounding bitcoin, Yen himself is not entirely sure about what will happen. He’s not sure if he’ll continue to hold it or not, nor is he sure if Proton will accept payments via the Bitcoin Lightning Network. In the interview, he stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Okay, so you know, it&#8217;s kind of an interesting topic given the meltdown in the financial markets. Proton has always kept some of our reserves in bitcoin, and this is something that&#8217;s already known out in the world. There’s an internal debate; I don&#8217;t have the answer to that yet. I&#8217;m not sure if we continue to hold bitcoin or not hold bitcoin. Again, I&#8217;m not, let&#8217;s say a bitcoin industry insider, but I&#8217;m happy to share some of my perspectives. I think there&#8217;s just too much fraud and abuse and other objectionable things, incredulous things, especially when you look at things like NFTs and some of the other things that happened at the tail end of let&#8217;s say, the recent bubble, right? There&#8217;s just too much fraud and too much icky stuff in the space.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Regulation Could Possibly Work</h2>
<p>He continued with his thoughts on regulation and appears to be in favor of it. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, this might not be a popular opinion, but I do believe the crypto community is well served by taking a stronger stance on regulation, and I don&#8217;t mean by having lawmakers come in and set rules and laws on what you can and cannot do because they don&#8217;t understand the space, but I think a lot of players within the space. We ought to have some moderation and maybe you know, self-regulation, if that&#8217;s even possible, right? I think it&#8217;s important to do that or else we have a continuous cycle of spikes and crashes and spikes and crashes, and that&#8217;s not good in the long term. People are not going to have faith and confidence and trust in an asset class if it’s frequently having 80 percent crash cycles. We need the crash cycles to be less and less severe over time, and that&#8217;s just not happening. This crash cycle is just as bad as the last one, and that shows me that we haven&#8217;t really learned our lesson here, so maybe a controversial view, but that&#8217;s my personal view on this.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It appears <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a> is taking another beating, only this time, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/stocks-and-bitcoin-may-be-down-but-gold-prices-just-hit-a-six-month-high-above-1-800/ar-AA15IhIB" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">it’s from its rival gold</a>. The precious metal has long been considered a solid commodity and a hedge against a wide array of economic problems and similar troubles, but it looks like the asset has recently hit a new six-month high and is now trading for more than $1,800.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Keeps Suffering While Gold Is Jumping</h2>
<p>This is not necessarily good for bitcoin because it’s done nothing but taken serious plummets over the time that it’s taken for gold to surge. The world’s number one digital currency has fallen by about 70 percent since hitting its all-time high of about $68,000 in November of 2021. Since then, it’s fallen into the high $16,000 range, and many people who were once believers are turning their backs on the asset and flocking to other potential investing tools, the precious metal being a big one.</p>
<p>Mobeen Tahir – an investment strategist at Wisdom Tree – says bitcoin has fallen drastically mainly because banks all over the world are hiking interest rates as a means of fighting inflation. This gave the asset the perfect opportunity to jump in price and put other assets to shame. In an interview, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>What should have been smooth sailing for gold became the perfect storm. A rising U.S. dollar and rising treasury yields became headwinds for gold… These are sort of goldilocks conditions for gold; perfect conditions for gold.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s also believed that gold is on the rise because the stability and strength of the U.S. dollar is fading drastically. Many analysts claim that gold is also going to see a massive rise in popularity in countries like China, which currently stands as the biggest haven for precious metals. These boosts to the price of gold are slated to last well into 2023.</p>
<p>Lastly, they say that if the Federal Reserve decides to either slow down rate hikes or pause them altogether, things could potentially get even stronger for gold, and the precious metal is going to jump like nobody’s ever anticipated. In the World Gold Council’s 2023 Gold Outlook, the analysts wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lower inflation should mean potentially diminished interest in gold from an inflation hedging perspective… Although higher bond yields are associated with lower gold returns and might now be deemed attractive by some investors, current yield levels are historically not a hindrance to gold doing well, particularly when accounting for a weaker U.S. dollar… We may see a lot of investors express their bullish view on gold via silver next year.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Silver Is Also Up</h2>
<p>As the report shows, gold is not the only precious metal up at press time. Silver has also experienced a jump of about 1.5 percent over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>In the last few months, silver has experienced price hikes exceeding 15 percent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two men in Nigeria have been arrested for <a href="https://leadership.ng/police-arrest-2-suspects-over-alleged-cryptocurrency-fraud/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">allegedly taking part in crypto</a> fraud. The pair obtained quite a bit of money by cheating investors and lying to them about their potential returns.</p>
<h2>Two Arrests for Crypto Fraud in Nigeria</h2>
<p>Force PRO – which is the national cybercrime force in Nigeria – said that the duo admitted to being part of a larger syndicate that specialized in defrauding people of their hard-earned funds. The syndicate is reported to attack investors in foreign countries by assuming false identities and making romantic promises to those they seek to victimize.</p>
<p>In a statement, the police force stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the extant case, a report on their activities was received from Incheon Metropolitan Police Agency in Korea through the Interpol National Central Bureau that in May 2021, the suspects approached the victim, one Baek Seong-hee, a Korean national, via Kakaotalk, a mobile messaging application used majorly in South Korea, in the guise of being a member of the US Armed Forces stationed in Yemen. The suspects used the pretext of a romantic relationship and defrauded the victims of 259,637,941 Korean Won (KRW) worth of cryptocurrency equivalent to about 91 million Nigerian Naira.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/romance-scam/" data-wpel-link="internal">Romance scams</a> have been rather prominent in the crypto space as of late. The process occurs when a potential cyberthief takes on an entirely separate identity and pretends to be someone seeking the love and companionship of another. They either pursue others themselves or answer the calls of those looking to find lasting partners.</p>
<p>When they’ve locked onto a victim, things start out normally with courting and wooing and all the other standard elements of a loving relationship. It doesn’t take long, however, for things to take a drastic and technical turn. They begin persuading the person to invest in an alleged crypto platform that they say will give them lots of money and high returns.</p>
<p>Eventually, the person gives in and begins to put their money into the platform, not knowing that it’s controlled by the scammer and his or her associates. When they see that their funds are expanding and they’re potentially making money, they seek to make a small withdrawal. However, they usually can’t unless it’s a specific amount or they’re willing to put more money into the platform.</p>
<p>Most often, those who invest their money via romance scams never see their funds again, and the problem has been persisting for some time.</p>
<h2>Who Are the Suspects?</h2>
<p>The suspects in Nigeria are Odia Theophilus, age 24, and Ebo Junior Success, age 25. Their hideout was in Benin City in Edo State.</p>
<p>The state of crypto fraud has only grown over the past few years. Aside from romance scams, other major forms of fraud – such as what happened with <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">fallen crypto exchange FTX</a> – have also taken place.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite several bullish predictions for 2023, Brian Armstrong – the CEO of Coinbase – believes it will be <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/12/24/cryptopocalypse-coinbase-ceo-issues-serious-contagion-warning-after-bitcoin-and-ethereum-price-crash/?sh=58a54be1a07f" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">some time before the crypto</a> space relieves itself of the drama caused by FTX, and he doesn’t think 2023 will offer the improvement over 2022 that so many analysts are either predicting or hoping for.</p>
<h2>Brian Armstrong Doesn&#8217;t Think 2023 Will Offer Much Improvement</h2>
<p>FTX will likely go down as one of the biggest blunders of the crypto world. Once considered one of the largest and most popular digital currency trading platforms in the world, FTX took only three years to rise to fruition, and its head executive – a young man named Sam Bankman-Fried – was lauded as a genius, a reputation he would only hold temporarily.</p>
<p>In mid-November, he complained on <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-i-the-fall-of-a-token/" data-wpel-link="internal">social media of a liquidity crunch</a>, and said that the exchange was in desperate need of fast cash. However, things didn’t quite go according to plan. Initially, he sought the aid of Binance, his largest rival. The idea was <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-ii-binance-said-it-would-buy-the-firm/" data-wpel-link="internal">that the big exchange</a> would buy out the smaller one, thus giving it the support and money that it needed to stay afloat.</p>
<p>But Binance <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">eventually backed away</a> from the deal, claiming that the problems FTX was facing were far too big for it to handle. From there, the company had <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">to file bankruptcy</a> and SBF resigned from his post. This was to be the least of his problems as he would later be arrested in the Bahamas for allegedly tampering with people’s money. From there, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/21/technology/sbf-ftx-extradition.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">would be extradited</a> to the United States, and he is currently awaiting his trial while living at his parents’ California home.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Armstrong explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think there could be a little more contagion from FTX, but my hope is that [everything moves] through the system in the next couple of months or quarters at most. After 18 months, people moved on and nobody asked me about it after that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many exchanges such as Armstrong’s Coinbase have been dealing with the aftermath of the FTX debacle. Coinbase has fallen into oblivion and its stock shares have plummeted from the near $300 unit prices they were enjoying when the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-spikes-following-public-debut-of-coinbase/" data-wpel-link="internal">company first went public</a> in April of 2021.</p>
<p>It appears there are many exchanges out there that have fallen under a light of distrust. Nobody really sees exchanges as the powerhouses they once were anymore, and they are rushing to get their money out and into cold wallets or decentralized platforms.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Wants to Do Things the Right Way</h2>
<p>Armstrong continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>The bull case for Coinbase is we&#8217;re the leader in the market from a trust point of view and the largest [exchange] in the U.S. The market is giving us very clear feedback that they want to work with trusted companies if they’re going to be centralized actors.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s happened again, folks. Another crypto hack is in the books. This time, the victim is alleged to be BTC.com, one of <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/btccom-lost-3-million-worth-of-cryptocurrency-in-cyberattack/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">the biggest crypto mining</a> pools in the world.</p>
<h2>BTC.com Hacked; A Lot of Money Gone</h2>
<p>The mining pool is believed to have lost as much as $3 million at the time of writing, which on paper, doesn’t appear as big as some of the other major hacks and scams that have occurred within the confines of the crypto space in recent years. However, it’s still another clear message that the digital currency arena is not where it needs to be. That safety measures aren’t as strong as we believe, and that the time has come for companies to step up and make sure all their users’ funds are safe and sound.</p>
<p>The money that was stolen belonged to both the company and its customers. BTC.com is reportedly the seventh largest crypto mining pool in the world and accounts for close to three percent of the bitcoin network’s total hash rate.</p>
<p>Approximately $700,000 in crypto was taken from the customers of the company, while just over $2 million belonged to BTC.com itself. The company explained in a recent statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the cyberattack, certain digital assets were stolen, including approximately US$700,000 in asset value owned by BTC.com&#8217;s clients, and approximately US$2.3 million in asset value owned by the company. On December 23rd, 2022, the authorities had launched an investigation, began collecting evidence, and had requested assistance from and coordination with relevant agencies. The company will devote considerable efforts to recover the stolen digital assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>The event has been reported to Chinese law enforcement agencies, and it is alleged that some of the stolen funds have been recovered at press time, though just how much is presently unclear. The company continued its statement by claiming it is now implementing new security protocols designed to keep its customers’ funds safer in the future and that operations are continuing as normal. It said:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the wake of discovering this cyberattack, the company has implemented technology to better block and intercept hackers. BTC.com is currently operating its business as usual, and apart from its digital asset services, its client fund services are unaffected.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Small Compared to Past Cases</h2>
<p>As bad as it all sounds, this is small beans when compared with major hacking incidents such as <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/mt-gox/" data-wpel-link="internal">Mt. Gox</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/coincheck/" data-wpel-link="internal">Coincheck</a>. Both took place in Japan approximately four years apart from each other, with Mt. Gox happening in February of 2014 and Coincheck in January of 2018, respectively.</p>
<p>Together, the companies lost more than $1 billion in crypto funds, with roughly $400 million in BTC taken from Mt. Gox and over half a billion in crypto stolen from Coincheck. The latter incident led to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/japans-cryptocurrency-association-to-vote-on-new-regulations-this-month/" data-wpel-link="internal">Japanese financial agencies</a> getting involved in crypto regulation and safety protocols.</p>
