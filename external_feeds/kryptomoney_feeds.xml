										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Amid a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N37M0MH">volatile period</a> in the cryptocurrency sector, European Union authorities have received recommendations from the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), an EU watchdog, to implement stricter regulations on leveraged bets involving crypto assets. The objective is to prevent potential shocks from the crypto sector that could pose risks to the overall financial stability of broader markets.<br /><br />The ESRB&#8217;s proposals encompass a range of strategies, including mandating regular reporting from all firms involved in crypto asset dealings and establishing specific rules for the largest players in the sector. This call for action comes as the crypto industry experiences significant price volatility, exemplified by Bitcoin&#8217;s staggering 77% drop and the notable decline of Luna, another cryptocurrency. The bankruptcy of FTX, previously known for its Super Bowl advertising, has further underscored the challenges faced by the industry.<br /><br /><em>&#8220;The emergence of systemic risks can occur rapidly and unexpectedly,&#8221;</em> cautions the ESRB in a report, emphasizing that the ongoing rapid growth of crypto assets could potentially endanger financial stability. One of the ESRB&#8217;s key recommendations is the implementation of leverage limits for investment funds exposed to crypto assets, representing a notable departure from recent EU regulations.<br /><br />In addition, the watchdog proposes restrictions on crypto firms&#8217; ability to lend tokens to clients, a common practice for facilitating leveraged bets. <br /><br />The ESRB also suggests imposing higher collateral requirements for decentralized finance products and stablecoins. Although the ESRB&#8217;s recommendations are not legally binding, they are expected to wield influence over the EU&#8217;s forthcoming efforts to refine its regulation of crypto assets under the Markets in Cryptoassets Regulation (MiCA).<br /><br />The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ecb-says-stablecoin-laws-must-be-enforced-with-urgency/">European regulators</a>&#8216; push for stricter crypto regulations reflects concerns that a potential economic downturn in traditional markets may drive more investors toward the crypto market, necessitating a robust regulatory framework to safeguard financial stability. These proposed changes, aimed at preserving market stability, demonstrate a cautious and proactive approach from European regulators to managing the dynamic and volatile crypto market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The forex trading industry has seen a massive surge in the number of users. More and more people are diving into the world of trading currencies, hoping to strike it big. It&#8217;s like the whole world is hooked on forex. So why would you miss a chance? In this article, we are going to talk about two important ways to take part in forex trading if your dream is to become a forex broker and start your business!</p>
<h2>What is White Label?</h2>
<p>A White Label business partners up with an existing forex brokerage firm. They have a special <a href="https://fxview.com/whitelabel">agreement</a> with the brokerage that allows them to use the broker&#8217;s trading platform and liquidity but under their own brand. They have more control and freedom to make their mark. They can put their logo on the trading platform, decide the amount of spread (the difference between buying and selling prices), and manage their clients. Let’s find the advantages and disadvantages of a White Label forex Solution.</p>
<h3>Pros:</h3>
<h4>Cost Effective</h4>
<p>Cost-effectiveness means getting the most out of what you spend. White-label forex brokerage is affordable compared to starting as an independent forex broker, where you need a larger amount of capital upfront. With a white-label forex brokerage, you can enjoy the benefits of a ready-made platform and infrastructure without the hefty price tag. Instead of building everything from scratch, you partner with an established broker who provides you with their technology, trading software, back-office support and other forex tools, which can come in handy for your clients. The upfront investment is significantly lower, allowing you to allocate your resources more efficiently.</p>
<h4>Quick to Get Started</h4>
<p>Becoming a white-label <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/mastercards-crypto-head-security-and-simplicity-vital-for-blockchain-full-potential/">forex</a> broker requires minimal effort on your part, so you can hit the ground running in no time. Instead of going through all the painstaking steps of building your own brokerage from scratch, you team up with an established broker and get access to a ready-made platform with all the bells and whistles, top-notch trading software, and even support from the back-office wizards. Basically, with a white-label solution, you can bypass all the time-consuming tasks that come with starting from scratch.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to worry about dealing with complicated regulations, building your own trading platform, or finding banking partners. Moreover, you won&#8217;t be scratching your head over coding or software configurations. Nope, none of that! The whole process is designed to be smooth and hassle-free. You sign up with a primary broker who offers a white-label solution, and they take care of all the technical mumbo jumbo for you. You will get the same trading platforms that they offer, so in case the broker offers MT4 and MT5, then you can <a href="https://fxview.com/mt5">offer</a> the same platforms to your clients. Some primary brokers offer lightning-fast onboarding, where you can go from signing up to trading within just a few weeks. That&#8217;s right &#8211; weeks, not months or years! You don&#8217;t have to wait for ages to start making those forex moves.</p>
<h4>Flexibility</h4>
<p>You have the freedom to customise and establish your own platform according to your preferences. How awesome is that? You get to create a unique brand image that&#8217;ll draw traders to your Forex platform, setting you on the path to building a loyal customer base. You can customise your Forex platform by choosing the colours, the logo, and even the layout to reflect your brand&#8217;s personality. Whether you want it to be sleek and professional or vibrant and exciting, it&#8217;s up to you! You set yourself apart from other brokers by building a unique brand image.</p>
<h4>Guidance and Support</h4>
<p>The primary broker has already been around the forex block and knows the ins and outs of the business. They&#8217;ve got the experience and knowledge to guide you through the process, ensuring you&#8217;re on the right track. Some primary brokers go the extra mile and offer training programs as part of their white-label forex solution. These programs are designed to give you the skills and know-how you need to succeed. You&#8217;ll learn from the experts themselves, following in their footsteps as they share their industry secrets and strategies.</p>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<h3>Brand Establishment is Time-consuming</h3>
<p>Establishing a brand name takes time and effort. Traders tend to lean towards well-known brand names when choosing a forex broker. They want to feel secure and confident in their choice. If you&#8217;re a fresh-faced broker entering the scene, it might take a little while to win the trust and attention of traders. By showcasing what makes your platform unique, offering exceptional services, or providing enticing promotions, you can grab the attention of traders and build your brand faster than you&#8217;d expect. You&#8217;ll need to come up with ideas that make traders go, &#8220;Wow, this is something different!&#8221;</p>
<h4>Limited Control</h4>
<p>When you opt for a white-label setup, a parent organisation (the boss, if you will) offers the core services. They call the shots on certain key aspects, and you need full control over them. The parent organisation decides things like which financial assets can be traded or the operational times. It means you don&#8217;t have complete freedom to shape every aspect of your Forex business. You&#8217;ll need to abide by the rules and limitations the parent organisation sets.</p>
<h2>What is an Introducing Broker (IB)?</h2>
<p>An Introducing Broker, or IB for short, is like a middle person that helps connect traders with the main broker. As an IB, you&#8217;re an independent agent working with the main broker. Your job is to find traders who are interested in trading with your main broker, and you guide them through the sign-up process.  However, the main broker handles everything else, like transactions and technology. They have the expertise and resources to take care of all the details.</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<h4>Opportunity to Build Connections</h4>
<p>When you become an IB broker, you&#8217;re opening the door to a world of exciting prospects and building valuable contacts. It&#8217;s like your debut into the industry, and trust me, it&#8217;s a big deal! This path offers you a lucrative opportunity to establish yourself with a solid client base, connect with investment managers, and even rub shoulders with the big shots in the industry. Building your contact base is like laying the foundation for long-term success. Those connections you make as an IB broker can tremendously impact your future career. They&#8217;re like stepping stones that lead to greater opportunities and bigger achievements down the road.</p>
<h4>No Strict Requirements</h4>
<p>The essential requirements for IB are way fewer compared to a regular brokerage. Regular brokerages have to invest big bucks in all sorts of technical requirements to keep things running smoothly. But as an IB broker, you get to skip all that.</p>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<h4>Irregular Incomes</h4>
<p>Your main source of income as an IB broker comes from commissions. Therefore, your earnings as an IB can be a bit unpredictable. When you successfully enrol clients with your parent brokerage partner, you earn a commission based on their trading activities. The more trades they make, the more money they can make. It&#8217;s like a partnership where your income is tied to your trading success. It can be inconsistent at times. Some months you see a surge in commissions, while others might not be as booming.</p>
<h4>No Individual Identity</h4>
<p>One of the biggest concerns is that you&#8217;re seen as an extension of the parent brokerage rather than a standalone player. As an IB broker, you&#8217;re kind of hitching a ride on someone else&#8217;s success train. You don&#8217;t have your own logo or office. It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re borrowing someone else&#8217;s brand and reputation. Without your own identity and infrastructure, it&#8217;s hard to carve out your own path in the industry.<br />
Key Differences Between WL &amp; IB?</p>
<p>As an IB, you&#8217;re like the middle person between the existing broker and the traders. You need to have your own brand identity or full control over your clients. On the other hand, White Labels are proper businesses with more independence and control. You have the freedom to build your own brand and have your own brokerage infrastructure.</p>
<p>As an IB, you must follow the rules and regulations set by the brokerage firm you&#8217;re working with. You&#8217;re bound by their terms and conditions. You need more freedom to decide things on your own when it comes to dealing with traders. As a WLB, you can manage your own relationships with the traders. You have the power to set your own terms and conditions.</p>
<p>As an IB, your income depends on the number of successful referrals you make to the broker firm. You get a reward for each referral, but it&#8217;s based on the pre-decided terms. It&#8217;s like a commission-based gig, my friend. On the other hand, WLBs have different earning games. Your income as a WLB depends on the magnitude of trading done by the traders through your firm. The more they trade, the more potential earnings you have.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Introducing Broker (IB) and White Label (WL) work to bring in new clients who will trade on the Main Broker&#8217;s platform. Both IB and WL rely on the trading volumes of their clients. The more those clients trade, the more revenue the broker earns. The success of an IB or WL depends on how active their clients are. When clients trade more frequently and in larger volumes, it means more profits for the broker. And when the broker makes money, it also means success for the IB or WL partner.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/mastercard-and-binance-jointly-introduce-new-prepaid-card-in-brazil/">Mastercard</a>, a global leader in the financial industry, is confident that crypto and blockchain technology can deliver significant value to financial sectors once they address the fundamental challenges of security and simplicity. Raj Dhamodharan, Executive Vice President and Head of Crypto and Blockchain at Mastercard, emphasized this<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/24/mastercard-blockchain-crypto/?tpcc=tcplustwitter&amp;guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9jcnlwdG9zbGF0ZS5jb20v&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAD4Bn4I9ub1n4eNn8yb63N4JyFF3bFYGJzCvVUX4IG18tzpqmlMZYmShj-Aqos4J1OXbMsb4S_Ctt_b_UnbPaINUgjl5THBwHE_kT1a_34MXRz2eEMN1TIPhJumtZ6GU2BsNZu_FXSDOb6a9FAAfcPaDeG6kgE83n5ngp6FPxaWB"> viewpoint</a> during a blockchain-focused panel at Mastercard&#8217;s North America Innovation Day on May 23.<br /><br />Dhamodharan acknowledged that crypto and blockchain technology has been gaining increasing global traction. However, their current use cases are limited due to insufficient security measures and complex user interactions. He stressed the criticality of establishing trust in the blockchain ecosystem, stating that resolving these issues would boost confidence among brands and companies, leading to increased engagement with the web3 industry.<br /><br />Highlighting the technology&#8217;s untapped potential, Dhamodharan mentioned that while many perceive crypto primarily as an investment opportunity, the technology itself holds significant promise beyond its role in capital movement and storage.<br /><br />Johan Berger, Mastercard&#8217;s EVP of Security and Cyber Innovation, echoed Dhamodharan&#8217;s sentiments during the panel, stating that the global scalability of the technology depends on interoperability and a secure foundation of trust. Mastercard has been among the first traditional financial institutions to actively engage with the crypto industry.<br /><br />Over the years, the company has expanded its range of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/paypal-partners-with-paxos-to-offer-crypto-services-to-325-million-customers/">crypto services</a> through partnerships with industry players such as Binance, Gemini, and Paxos. Many exchanges offer debit and credit cards powered by Mastercard. Additionally, Mastercard is actively involved in assisting governments in their exploration of central bank digital currencies and the underlying payment infrastructure.<br /><br />Dhamodharan, who joined Mastercard in 2010 and assumed the role of head of the crypto division in 2019, has spearheaded the company&#8217;s ambitious foray into the crypto space. He considers the industry an opportunity rather than a threat to Mastercard&#8217;s dominance in the payments sector.<br /><br />In a 2022 interview with Protocol, Dhamodharan expressed that Mastercard doesn&#8217;t perceive crypto as a threat, emphasizing the maturity cycles of various crypto technologies, with crypto as an investment asset class being the most mature. He also highlighted that Mastercard ventured into crypto due to customer demand for purchasing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and the company intends to provide a secure avenue for users to engage with crypto.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a remarkable feat for the XRP ecosystem, the XRP Ledger has recently achieved the closure of an impressive 80 million ledgers in approximately 10.5 years, as reported by <a href="https://twitter.com/xrpscan/status/1661441862656294921">XRPScan</a>, a renowned blockchain explorer dedicated to the XRP Ledger. For those unfamiliar with the term, a ledger serves as a comprehensive record of transactions within a blockchain network.<br /><br />This milestone serves as a testament to the rapidity, dependability, and increasing popularity of the XRP ledger as a groundbreaking technology for processing transactions on the Ripple network. Launched in December 2012, the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xrp-ledger-records-impressive-growth-in-q1/">XRP Ledger</a> (also known as XRPL) has played a pivotal role in enabling real-time, cross-border payments. As an open-source and decentralized blockchain technology, it offers a seamless solution for fast and cost-effective international transactions.<br /><br />The XRPL empowers individuals to effortlessly send any currency to anyone around the globe within a matter of seconds, making it an ideal choice for cross-border transactions. While the XRP ledger has received accolades for its speed and low transaction fees, it has also faced scrutiny regarding its level of centralization.<br /><br />Although technically decentralized, skeptics argue that the XRP Ledger&#8217;s close association with Ripple Labs and the substantial amount of XRP held by the company have resulted in a degree of centralization that distinguishes it from other blockchain systems.<br /><br />In September 2019, the network celebrated its 50 million ledger milestone, and within just over a year, it had successfully added 10 million. This rapid pace underscores the growing acceptance and utilization of the XRP ledger, along with the Ripple network&#8217;s expanding capacity to handle a substantial volume of transactions.<br /><br />The journey of the XRP Ledger has not been without controversy. Critics, including Blockstream CEO Adam Back, have frequently pointed out the permanent loss of the first week of the XRP Ledger&#8217;s existence. Despite such criticism, reaching this new milestone symbolizes the resilience and perseverance of the XRP ledger in the ever-evolving realm of blockchain technology.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/hong-kong-sets-sights-on-may-for-crypto-exchange-licensing-rules/">Hong Kong</a> is poised to announce the outcome of its consultation, signaling a push to permit retail crypto investors to engage in cryptocurrency trading. <br /><br />According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-23/hong-kong-to-step-up-push-for-crypto-hub-in-contrast-with-clampdowns-in-asia">Bloomberg</a>, the Securities and Financial Commission (SFC) will unveil a new regulatory framework that prioritizes investor protection. <br /><br />Hong Kong, once a prominent crypto hub where many platforms originated, faced challenges with stringent rules that restricted crypto trading to institutional investors with a minimum capital of $1 million. To revive its former prominence, the SFC is now allowing retail investors to trade major tokens like Bitcoin (BTC).<br /><br />The final approval appears imminent, with discussions on this matter ongoing for some time. To ensure necessary safeguards, the SFC plans to introduce a licensing regime for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) beginning June 1. <br /><br />Crypto industry leaders have long touted the potential of digital currencies to revolutionize finance, yet regulatory constraints in various jurisdictions have hindered progress. <br /><br />The move by the Hong Kong SFC sets a positive precedent, potentially inspiring other regulators to follow suit and nurture the nascent ecosystem. <br /><br />The convergence of these favorable regulatory changes is expected to fuel industry growth and exert significant influence on the prices of supported digital assets, which already show promising growth projections.</p>

<p>Strike, a digital payments platform, has integrated <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-usdt-to-be-integrated-onto-strike-leading-global-money-app/">Tether&#8217;s USDT stablecoin</a> into its platform, aiming to enhance the speed, safety, and efficiency of payments for its users. The integration not only facilitates seamless transactions but also promotes the broader adoption of USDT. <br /><br />By incorporating USDT into its <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-lightning-capacity-hits-all-time-high-at-4200-btc/">Bitcoin lightning network</a>-based platform, Strike allows users to transfer their cryptocurrencies globally without being concerned about market volatility.<br /><br />The addition of Tether&#8217;s stablecoin enables users to swiftly convert their digital assets into fiat currency, resolving previous liquidity challenges that hindered widespread adoption. <br /><br />Paolo Ardoino, Tether&#8217;s CTO, expressed that this collaboration reflects the increasing acceptance and recognition of stablecoins as reliable and efficient digital payment solutions. He further emphasized that this partnership would drive innovation, foster the adoption of digital currencies, and contribute to building a more inclusive financial ecosystem.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Strike believes that this integration will reshape the crypto industry landscape and create new avenues for seamless digital transactions.<br /><br />According to CEO Jack Mallers, the<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/05/21/whos-laughing-now-bitcoin-price-braced-for-3-billion-user-shock-as-strike-ceo-slams-coinbase-ethereum-bnb-xrp-cardano-dogecoin-polygon-and-solana/?sh=795e5be7e501"> decision</a> to choose USDT over Circle-backed USDC was based on the trust factor, as people outside the U.S. have concerns regarding Circle. Mallers revealed that Strike has expanded its services to over 65 countries, and the company plans to relocate its headquarters to the Bitcoin-friendly nation of El Salvador. <br /><br />This expansion will introduce Strike to new markets in Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Asia, and the Caribbean, including countries such as Zambia and Antigua and Barbuda.<br /><br />The company&#8217;s ambitious move is expected to reach nearly 3 billion people, thereby driving global crypto adoption and usage to new heights.</p>

<p>In the wake of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/stablecoin-issuer-tethers-q1-profits-surge-to-1-5-billion/">Tether</a>&#8216;s groundbreaking announcement regarding their plans to purchase Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency industry was buzzing with excitement and speculation. As the company behind the world&#8217;s largest stablecoin, Tether&#8217;s decision to allocate a significant portion of its monthly net realized operating profits for Bitcoin purchases sent shockwaves through the market.<br /><br />Previously, Tether had acquired BTC but had kept it separate from its excess reserves. However, this marked the first time the company had unveiled a long-term strategy specifically aimed at Bitcoin. What made this announcement even more significant was that it was the first instance of a large crypto company openly sharing plans for recurring, monthly investments in BTC.<br /><br />The timing of Tether&#8217;s announcement was no coincidence. Just a few days earlier, on May 10, the company had released its attestation report for the first quarter of the year. This report, prepared by BDO Italia, an independent public accounting firm, provided a detailed breakdown of Tether Holdings&#8217; assets. It offered a level of transparency previously unseen, unveiling separate categories for Bitcoin, physical gold, corporate bonds, and overnight repo.<br /><br />The newfound transparency into Tether&#8217;s reserves sparked intense debate and speculation within the crypto industry. Traders and analysts eagerly dissected the implications of the company&#8217;s Bitcoin purchases and their exposure to U.S. Treasurys. Some experts praised Tether&#8217;s move as a bold step towards diversifying their holdings and embracing the potential of Bitcoin. They believed that Tether&#8217;s increased investment in BTC could further strengthen its stability and position in the market.<br /><br />On the other hand, skeptics voiced concerns about the risks associated with Tether&#8217;s Bitcoin investments. Questions arose regarding the potential impact on the stability of the stablecoin if the volatile nature of Bitcoin were to affect Tether&#8217;s balance sheet. Additionally, discussions ignited around the level of exposure Tether had to U.S. Treasurys and how this factor could influence its overall financial standing.<br /><br />Amidst the heated debates, the broader crypto community eagerly awaited the outcome of Tether&#8217;s bold strategy. As the dust settled, market participants were left wondering how this move would reshape the landscape of stablecoins, Bitcoin&#8217;s market dynamics, and the future of Tether itself.<br /><br />Regardless of the arguments and uncertainties, Tether&#8217;s decision to embrace<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/microstrategy-rolls-out-wallet-and-lightning-address-for-account-holders/"> Bitcoin</a> through regular monthly purchases marked a significant milestone in the evolution of the cryptocurrency industry. It served as a testament to the growing importance and acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset, even among major players like Tether. The effects of this strategy would undoubtedly reverberate throughout the market, influencing the behavior and strategies of other crypto companies in the months and years to come.</p>

<p>According to a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1659289748341653510">report</a> by Messari, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) experienced significant growth during the first quarter of 2023. Key indicators highlighted a surge in activity, with a 13.9% increase in daily active addresses and a 10.7% rise in daily transactions.<br /><br />The most notable development was the impressive 55.5% price increase of XRP, surging from $0.35 to $0.54. This boost was largely influenced by positive news from the ongoing legal case between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).<br /><br />The Q1 report also emphasized the evolution of the<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xrpl-nft-marketplace-reports-record-breaking-traffic-shortly-after-launch-of-xls-20-that-brings-native-nft-support/"> XRPL</a> ecosystem. The introduction of the XLS-20 standard facilitated NFT transactions, with five new transaction types established and five more proposed. Despite a slight decrease in NFT activity compared to the previous quarter, Q1 still saw 436,000 NFT mints and 277,000 accepted NFT offers. Additionally, the Coreum and Flare Network sidechains, focusing on interoperability and decentralized data, successfully reached their mainnet.<br /><br />XRP&#8217;s financial performance surpassed the overall increase in the total crypto market cap. XRP&#8217;s market cap rose by an impressive 59.9%, from $17.4 billion to $27.8 billion. A positive development in the SEC case against Ripple acted as a significant catalyst, leading to two substantial price surges in March. The transaction fees on the XRPL, which are burned, created deflationary pressure on the total supply of XRP, offsetting the inflation rate and contributing to the price increase.<br /><br />Looking ahead, XRPL developers are focused on NFTs, the metaverse, and smart contracts. The report outlined plans for Futureverse&#8217;s Root Network, Hooks, and an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain. If successfully implemented, these advancements will add a layer of functionality to the XRPL ecosystem, which already offers features such as fast, energy-efficient cross-currency and cross-border payments.</p>

<p>Commodity Futures Trading Commission (<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/cftc-chairman-confirms-commodity-status-of-bitcoin-and-ether-says-xrp-is-uncertain/">CFTC</a>) has no power to regulate cash crypto markets, admits chairman. According to Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman Rostin Benham, his agency lacks the legal authority to regulate cash crypto markets. <br /><br />In a recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-18/transcript-cftc-chair-rostin-behnam-on-the-fight-to-regulate-crypto">interview</a>, Benham clarified that the CFTC&#8217;s jurisdiction is limited to addressing fraud and manipulation in cash markets.<br /><br />However, he emphasized that the CFTC will still regulate the crypto sector through other means to protect investors. Benham considers many cryptocurrency tokens as commodity financial assets, allowing the application of regulations, notices, advisories, and enforcement actions. <br /><br />This aligns with his previous statements in March, where he classified assets like Ethereum and stablecoins as commodities. <br /><br />Despite the unique challenges presented by cryptocurrencies, Benham believes that existing policy approaches can be adapted to address them.<br /><br />It is noteworthy that the CFTC and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are the two main government agencies responsible for regulating the cryptocurrency space.<br /><br />While SEC chair Gary Gensler believes the CFTC should regulate certain assets without overriding the SEC&#8217;s authority, Benham contends that the CFTC should oversee assets that are not considered securities.</p>

Garlinghouse attributed this decision to the ongoing uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency regulations in the United States. <br /><br />This ambiguity has prompted entrepreneurs and investors to explore more accommodating jurisdictions, with Europe emerging as a significant beneficiary due to its well-defined and robust regulatory framework for digital assets.<br /><br />Garlinghouse emphasized the impact of regulatory confusion in the United States on <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ripple-teams-up-with-central-bank-of-montenegro-for-cbdc-stablecoin-initiatives/">Ripple</a>&#8216;s operations, explaining that the company has been compelled to allocate a significant portion of its resources outside of the country. He stated,<em> &#8220;95 percent of our customers are non-U.S., and this year most of our hiring will be non-U.S. for some of those exact same reasons.&#8221;</em> Ripple&#8217;s expansion in Europe is partially driven by the favorable regulatory environment offered by the continent.<br /><br />Looking ahead to the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in light of the FTX case, Garlinghouse highlighted nations such as the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and Europe for their clear rules and roadmaps. He believes that this clarity enables entrepreneurs and investors to engage more effectively with regulators. The recent acquisition of Swiss-based firm Medico by Ripple was partly influenced by the regulatory clarity found in Switzerland. Garlinghouse stressed the importance of differentiating between issues specific to cryptocurrencies and broader problems like fraud.<br /><br />To illustrate this point, he referred to the FTX case as a fraud issue rather than one specific to cryptocurrencies. He emphasized that fraud can occur in various asset classes and is not limited to the crypto industry. Garlinghouse suggested that the United States could learn from Europe and other countries that provide clear regulatory frameworks for digital assets.</p>
