<p class="s4">With the lack of news about the integration of Dogecoin (DOGE) into Twitter, investors quickly lost interest in the meme coin. DOGE holders have decided to drop most of their holdings as the price momentum continues to skid.</p>
<p class="s4">Upon learning what The Hideaways (HDWY) could offer, analysts are convinced that the project could be the next major token.</p>
<p class="s7">Dogecoin (DOGE) Bleeds As Crypto Flash Red</p>
<p class="s4">The profitability of Dogecoin (DOGE) has always been a question, as the high volatility of the token indicates a threat to the stability of holders&rsquo; portfolios.</p>
<p class="s4">At the time of writing, DOGE has slashed 10.20% to $0.077490 in the past 30 days as the crypto market sell-off worsens.</p>
<p class="s4">Accordingly, the descending movement of the token reflects the poor state of Dogecoin (DOGE) on the market, citing a lack of speculative interest from both bulls and bears toward the coin.</p>
<p class="s4">Market participants now rush to exit their DOGE holdings as the meme coin does not have a foreseeable future. Differently, The Hideaways (HDWY) guaranteed safety for investors thanks to its permanently locked liquidity, offering security and profitability.</p>

<p class="s4">A minor consolation for Dogecoin (DOGE) holders could be the recent massive transfer from the crypto exchange Binance. Reports revealed that a whale transferred out 81,396,088 DOGE, amounting to $6.50 million.</p>
<p class="s4">Nevertheless, DOGE's drawback persisted despite its explosive performance in November and October.</p>
<p class="s4">Notably, Dogecoin (DOGE) gained popularity after receiving support from celebrities and public figures like Tesla CEO Elon Musk. However, the lack of real use of the token remains its main weakness amid the dragging market factors.</p>
<p class="s4">Fortunately, The Hideaways (HDWY) offers profitable functionality to save investors from further woes in the crypto space.</p>
