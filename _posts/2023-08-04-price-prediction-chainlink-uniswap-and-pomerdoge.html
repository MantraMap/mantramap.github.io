Chainlink (LINK) Price Prediction
<p class="s6">Chainlink (LINK) caught the attention of many investors and traders for its major rally during the bear market of June. From June 20 to July 20, the price of Chainlink spiked by almost 70%. Starting at $5.1, Chainlink traded as high as $8.4 in July.</p>
<p class="s6">Chainlink now appears to have broken market structure, entering a bear market. Over the last two weeks, the price of Chainlink has tumbled by 15%. In addition, the number of whale transactions on Chainlink is now 78% fewer than they were two weeks ago.</p>
<p class="s6">The price of Chainlink now stands at $7.3, but data from Global In/Out of Money Around Price (GIOM) remains bearish. According to the firm, the price of Chainlink could continue its decline in the coming weeks and drop to the $6.5 support.</p>
Uniswap (UNI) Price Prediction
<p class="s6">Uniswap also enjoyed a massive rally from June to July, increasing by 60%. Following its peak at $6.7, the price of Uniswap has tumbled down to $6.22. Despite growing bearish pressure, the price outlook of Uniswap remains fairly bullish.</p>
<p class="s6">With support at $6.0, the number of buyers are overtaking the number of sellers. If buyers successfully hold this price at the 200-day SMA, Uniswap could see a price increase in the coming days. However, the overall outlook of the crypto market could contribute to this.</p>
<p class="s6">Crypto analysts at Changelly have predicted that the price of Uniswap could top $7 in August. For 2023, the analysts have forecasted a maximum price of $8.44 for Uniswap.</p>
Pomerdoge (POMD) Price Prediction
<p class="s6">Unlike Uniswap, crypto experts are more bullish about the prospects of Pomerdoge (POMD) in the coming weeks. Creating a revolutionary P2E game, crypto experts have given very bullish predictions for Pomerdoge.</p>
<p class="s6">In the Pomergame, players will create unique characters known as Pomerdoges. With their Pomerdoges, they will enter into competitions and challenges for amazing rewards. Pomerdogecombines the thrilling gameplay of the Pomergame with a social infrastructure allowing gamers from around the world to communicate.</p>
<p class="s6">With the prospects of combining the best features of top P2E games, the Pomerdoge utility token has been given very bullish ratings. Now in its first presale stage, you can buy a POMD token for as low as $0.007. However, crypto experts have predicted a 280% price surge over the next few weeks as the project prepares for launch.</p>
<p class="s6">One feature that has caught the attention of investors is the shared earnings of Pomerdoge. The team recently announced that early presale investors will receive a share of the game's earnings depending on their token holdings. This innovative model effectively aligns the interests of investors, leading to the growth of the Pomerdoge ecosystem.</p>
