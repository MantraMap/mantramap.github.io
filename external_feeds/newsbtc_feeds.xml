Bitcoin seems to be facing a strong resistance near the $21,450 and $21,500 levels. The price is trading above $20,500 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $20,920 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a downside correction below the $20,880 and $20,750 support levels. Bitcoin Price Faces Resistance Bitcoin price started a strong increase above the $20,000 resistance zone. BTC was able to climb above the $20,500 and $21,000 levels to start a major uptrend. Finally, the price tested the $21,500 resistance zone. A high is formed near $21,485 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $21,200 level.

Any more gains might send btc price towards the $22,500 level. Downside Correction in BTC? If bitcoin price fails to clear the $21,500 resistance, it could slowly move down. An immediate support on the downside is near the $21,000 zone and the trend line. The next major support is near the $20,720 level. It is near the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $20,249 swing low to $21,489 high. The main support is now forming near the $20,500 level, below which the price might retest $20,000. Any more losses might send the price to $19,000. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $20,720, followed by $20,500. Major Resistance Levels – $21,250, $21,500 and $22,000.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The beta testnet of Shibarium will soon release, benefiting the entire Shiba Inu community. Shibarium is a layer-2 network operable on the Ethereum mainnet. After the release of Shibarium, the Shina Inu community can build and grow projects. The release of Shibarium will address the scalability, speed, and expense challenges facing the existing projects on Ethereum.  Shiba Inu Shibarium Beta Testnet Release Shiba Inu developers will only release a beta testnet version in the coming months. A testnet mimics the use cases and applications of real-world functions. Its release aims to test the network for any gaps or performance issues and assess its capabilities. Moreover, the layer two testnet aims to address the issues faced with scalability and data.  Related Reading: Whale Moves Huge Amount Of Shiba Inu Tokens As SHIB Unveils To Metaverse With this release, Shiba Inu developers wish to educate the community about a blockchain’s development process from scratch. Before its release, some experts claimed Shibarium was a marketing move and a price &#8220;increase gimmick.&#8221; But the development team refutes such claims.  After its release, Shibarium is also expected to improve the platform’s transaction speed and lower its costs. The users will be able to interact with a metaverse solution, DEX, and several blockchain games.  The ultimate goal of Shibrium is to facilitate a solution that leads to innovation and improves the DeFi security aspects of the project. Today, Shiba Inu has over a $5 billion market cap, collectively obtained by SHIB, LEASH, and BONE.  The project lead and developer announced recently that the World Economic Forum wishes to work with the ecosystem. The purpose of this collaboration is to work on a global metaverse policy. Other IT giants like Facebook, Sand, and Decentraland will also be present in this global policymaking.  I just want to say that I appreciate the updates. That&#39;s all I asked for. Now, this is transparent. Second, anyone asking in the comment section when shibarium is coming out, read the first 2 paragraphs.

					<description><![CDATA[The price momentum of VeChain (VET) registered a halt over the last 24 hours after the altcoin started to trade laterally. In the same time frame, the coin dipped 0.9%, which is minor meaning that VeChain was in consolidation. The coin had picked up bullish momentum at the beginning of this year, but the bears could not sustain the price above the $0.021 mark. The technical outlook of VeChain still points towards bullishness. The altcoin was overvalued at the time of writing, which emphasizes that a price correction is on the way. Related Reading: Glassnode Points Out This Bizarre Consistency In Bitcoin Cycles A price correction also presents a shorting opportunity for traders. The accumulation on the chart also noted a downtick, but despite the downtick, demand for VET was substantial. However, VET will soon lose its current price level if buyers continue to lose interest. At the moment, VeChain has secured the $0.019 price level as its current support mark. Moving below the price above the mark will make VeChain come under the influence of bears again. The VET price is 92% lower than its all-time high secured in 2021. VET Price Analysis: One-Day Chart VeChain was trading at $0.0207 at the time of writing. The altcoin was trading within an upward parallel channel, which showed bullishness. However, VET traded outside the parallel chain over the past trading sessions. As the coin moved outside of the parallel chain, the bulls failed to cross the $0.0212 price level, which acts as the current resistance price level for the coin. Local support for the coin stood at $0.020, and as VeChain depicted a correction, it is expected to fall below the $0.0193 level. Both the $0.020 and the $0.0193 price levels can act as shorting levels for the coin. The amount of VeChain traded in the last session declined, which meant a slight fall in demand. Technical Analysis The altcoin was overvalued on the daily chart, and although demand for the coin registered a fall, the bulls were still hovering in the market. The Relative Strength Index was a few points below 80, indicating that the coin was under the influence of buyers. With a price correction, VET can dip to $0.0193 before it starts to pick up momentum. On the same note, the VET price was above the 20-Simple Moving Average line (SMA), which meant that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. It was also above the 50-SMA line (yellow); however, another pull from the bears will drag VET below the 50-SMA line. Technical indicators continued to suggest that VET hasn&#8217;t lost its bullish steam. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence, which indicates price momentum and reversals, showed green signal bars. Related Reading: Crypto.com Decides To Let Go 20% Of Its Current Workforce Green signal bars are tied to a buy signal, but the recent bar was declining in strength, implying that traders should skip buying the asset right away. The Chaikin Money Flow was above the half-line and registered a fall; the capital inflows were far higher than capital outflows despite the fall. Overall, the market remains on the bulls&#8217; side, but VET has to stay above its crucial support line to keep the bears from returning.

<p>With a price correction, VET can dip to $0.0193 before it starts to pick up momentum. On the same note, the VET price was above the 20-Simple Moving Average line (SMA), which meant that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market.</p>
<p>It was also above the 50-SMA line (yellow); however, another pull from the bears will drag VET below the 50-SMA line.</p>

<p>Technical indicators continued to suggest that VET hasn&#8217;t lost its bullish steam. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence, which indicates price momentum and reversals, showed green signal bars.</p>

<p>Green signal bars are tied to a buy signal, but the recent bar was declining in strength, implying that traders should skip buying the asset right away. The Chaikin Money Flow was above the half-line and registered a fall; the capital inflows were far higher than capital outflows despite the fall.</p>
<p>Overall, the market remains on the bulls&#8217; side, but VET has to stay above its crucial support line to keep the bears from returning.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[As crypto assets recover from the 2022 crypto winter, Cronos (CRO) has recorded massive gains in 24 hours. Cronos&#8217; trading volume has spiked by 301.28%, showing that the coin has attracted more trading activity. Generally, the crypto market has seen a slight price increase. Bitcoin, the number one cryptocurrency, has enjoyed a positive rally and has influenced the rise of altcoins such as CRO.  Related Reading: Lazarus Group Transfers $64M ETH From Harmony Bridge Hack Cronos&#8217; price surged by over 9% in 24 hours, continuing its impressive price action into 2023. The cryptocurrency&#8217;s wide range of applications in various spheres has also helped to push this crypto revival. What Is Behind This Rally? Cronos is an open-source blockchain that facilitates Crypto.com’s Pay mobile app payments. However, the Cronos blockchain, which is Ethereum compatible, has upgraded and redesigned the project focus to integrate Web 3 and NFTs.  The asset&#8217;s price has benefitted from increased adoption, evident in the more than 100% spike in trading activity. Cronos network now supports activities on the Metaverse. NFTs and Games are part of the new projects adopted to keep up with modern trends. The network has also maintained its core objective of providing decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Crypto users can carry out financial transactions on the blockchain fast and anonymously. Cronos has built a strong followership that interacts on social media channels. The launch of Cronos Chain, compatible with Ethereum, has put the project on the front foot. The Cronos chain allows the migration of DApps built on the Ethereum blockchain and supports the Inter Blockchain Communications (IBC) protocol. The IBC protocol lets Cronos connect to the Cosmos ecosystem and interact with its DApps.  Cronos (CRO) Price Prediction What To Expect CRO is gaining in the market today, currently trading at $0.0806. The support levels for CRO are $0.070164, $0.071703, and $0.072919, while the resistance levels are $0.075674, $0.077213, and $0.078429.  Cronos is currently trading above its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) but is below its 200-day SMA. It implies that this price action could operate as a short-lived rally. On the price chart, the candles are in an ascending pattern. However, the candle for today has a long upper wick implying that the bears are trying to push the price down. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is bullish and in the overbought zone, at 79.27. It represents the massive spike in trading volume in Cronos. However, the RSI might retrace into the channel in the coming days. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD is above its signal line, which is also a buy signal. But, the MACD is showing minimal divergence, implying that there might be a trend reversal in the short term. Cronos will likely continue to trade in the green for a few days before slightly retracing. Related Reading: What Matters In Crypto This Week: Will Bitcoin Keep Pumping? A conservative approach to trading the asset might be the best option. More importantly, understand that a digital asset that declines in value by 50% will need to rally to 100% to return to its former value. This feat is difficult for altcoins and meme coins to accomplish.  Featured image from Pixabay and chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price is already turning heads after reclaiming $20,000 per coin, but if the current monthly candle closes on BTCUSD price charts, the top cryptocurrency will satisfy the conditions of a morning star reversal pattern.  The last time the signal occurred at the bottom of a major downtrend, Bitcoin began a two-year-long bull run in cryptocurrencies and went on to climb more than 6,000% after the morning star confirmed. Bitcoin Reclaims $20,000: A Wake Up Call For The Bull Market Bitcoin is once again above $20,000, but a lot has changed since 2020 when it passed the key level for the first time. The number one cryptocurrency by market cap has declined by 78%, and altcoins have dramatically collapsed by as much as 99%.  But markets are cyclical, and some signs are beginning to point to the end of a bearish phase in crypto and the possibility of a new bull trend blossoming. Top analysts are starting to wake up and take notice, and are now calling for a bottom and a cyclical low.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Touches $20,000 For First Time Post-FTX Collapse Reaching above $21,000 has put BTCUSD above pre-FTX crash levels from two months prior. More importantly, the three-month period has resulted in a three-candlestick reversal pattern called a morning star.  The morning star reversal pattern is a bullish Japanese candlestick reversal pattern, than when confirmed should result in three to five months worth of follow-through. A substantial shift from bearish to bullish would return Bitcoin to its previously bullish state. A morning star reversal pattern has formed &#124; BTCUSD on TradingView.com What A Morning Star Reversal Could Mean For Crypto According to Investopedia, “a morning star is a visual pattern made up of a tall black candlestick,” a black or white doji, “and a third tall white candlestick.” “The middle candle of the morning star captures a moment of market indecision where the bears begin to give way to bulls. The third candle confirms the reversal and can mark a new uptrend,” an excerpt reads.

The most direct comparison, took place in 2015, when another morning star reversal pattern helped trigger a new bull trend.  In that instance, BTCUSD went on to climb by 6,000% in 24 months — after the signal appeared. Confirmation requires this month’s candle to engulf at least 50% of the black, November down candle. The more this month engulfs the November candle, the stronger the signal.

					<description><![CDATA[According to CoinMarketCap’s data, Decentraland&#8217;s native token, MANA, has gained 17.59% in the last 24 hours, following the stellar performance of metaverse tokens since the start of the new year. MANA is one of the top 100 cryptocurrencies and has grown by 95% in the last month. In addition, it has been in the green for 14 of the previous 16 days. Related Reading: Decentraland (MANA) And The Sandbox (SAND) Surge Over 20%, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Set To Gain 6000% In Its Presale What Pushed MANA To The Sky? At the time of writing, MANA is trading at $0.6887. Since last week, the token&#8217;s price has increased by approximately 70%, bringing its market capitalization to $1,2 million. As investor opinion in the crypto markets has improved in response to positive macroeconomic news, smaller market cap cryptocurrencies have outperformed their larger competitors.  #mana pump was inevitable, @decentraland is the platform of the future. NOW 😍 pic.twitter.com/x2LLJrCWO1 — jasonx.eth (@DCLjasonx) January 15, 2023 The recent U.S. economic data is also why the increase in MANA price. According to data released last week, US inflation has been trending downward over the past few months. From its all-time high of 9.1% in 2022 down to 6.5% in December of that year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports a dramatic decline in the consumer price index (CPI) for the United States. The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) has been hiking interest rates to bring down inflation. This data suggest their efforts are working, and the market is feeling more optimistic as the chances of a monetary policy pivot are increasing, according to their expectations.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to CoinMarketCap’s <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decentraland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">data</a>, Decentraland&#8217;s native token, MANA, has gained 17.59% in the last 24 hours, following the stellar performance of metaverse tokens since the start of the new year. MANA is one of the top 100 cryptocurrencies and has grown by 95% in the last month. In addition, it has been in the green for 14 of the previous 16 days.</p>

<h2>What Pushed MANA To The Sky?</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, MANA is trading at $0.6887. Since last week, the token&#8217;s price has increased by approximately 70%, bringing its market capitalization to $1,2 million. As investor opinion in the crypto markets has improved in response to positive macroeconomic news, smaller market cap cryptocurrencies have outperformed their larger competitors. </p>

<p>The recent U.S. economic data is also why the increase in MANA price. According to data released last week, US inflation has been trending downward over the past few months. From its all-time high of 9.1% in 2022 down to 6.5% in December of that year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports a dramatic decline in the consumer price index (CPI) for the United States.</p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) has been hiking interest rates to bring down inflation. This data suggest their efforts are working, and the market is feeling more optimistic as the chances of a monetary policy pivot are increasing, according to their expectations.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The crypto industry continues to stagger under a massive wave of layoffs that have been occurring in recent times. Among the recent companies from the sector, Crypto.com has planned on axing 20% of its workforce. The Singapore-based company, Crypto.com, has confirmed its decision via a blog post. According to Co-Founder and CEO Kris Marszalek, the platform must let go of 20% of its current employees. Related Reading: What Matters In Crypto This Week: Will Bitcoin Keep Pumping? Crypto.com has faced significant criticism after attempting to reassure investors that the crypto exchange is in good financial health and has nothing to worry about. The reason for the layoffs is the current economic headwinds and industry situation. This will be the second major layoff carried out by the company. Crypto.com laid off nearly 260 employees in 2022, accounting for nearly 5% of its workforce. Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek stated: We grew ambitiously at the start of 2022, building on our incredible momentum and aligning with the trajectory of the broader industry. That trajectory changed rapidly with a confluence of negative economic developments. The exchange platform has not specifically mentioned the positions that were laid off. The decision to fire employees has been attributed to broader market weakness and the FTX crash. The crash caused a misappropriation of customer funds and eventually bankruptcy, which has gone on to affect the industry considerably. Crypto.com Says That It Continues To Perform Well Kriz Marszalek had initially mentioned that the exchange platform maintained adequate reserves for every single coin which the platform held. Two months after that statement, the exchange could not withstand the collapse of FTX without adopting measures to cut costs. Marszalek quoted: Today we made the difficult decision to reduce our global workforce by approximately 20 per cent. All impacted personnel have already been notified. These reductions were in no way related to performance, and we extend our deepest gratitude for all their contributions to Crypto.com. He additionally stated: Several factors played into our decision to reduce headcount. While we continue to perform well, growing to more than 70 million users worldwide and maintaining a strong balance sheet, we’ve had to navigate ongoing economic headwinds and unforeseeable industry events. Crypto.com Admits To Not Navigating Well After FTX Crash The Founder of Crypto.com has mentioned that even though Crypto.com was doing well, there has been a change in trajectory with a &#8216;confluence&#8217; of negative economic developments. He spoke about the layoffs in July last year as the exchange could not navigate the macroeconomic downturn. It also could not gauge the damage the FTX collapse would have caused to the industry. Related Reading: Polkadot: Why Recent On-Chain Feats Could Trigger Strong Investor Sentiment The fall of FTX has been terrible for investors&#8217; sentiments. The exchange now wants to focus on making prudent financial decisions to manage the company better, and layoffs are among such necessary measures. The exchange states that these additional reductions were mandatory to ensure that the company&#8217;s position remains profitable in the long term. At the moment, Crypto.com has 2,450 employees, and a 20 percent layoff from that population will mean that close to 490 employees lose their jobs.

					<description><![CDATA[After the collapse of the popular blockchain network Terra, developers have been trying to revive it; many reforms have already taken place to sustain the Terra Classic (LUNC and prevent further collapse). Terra Classic, the original blockchain, was forked to create Terra (LUNA). Among these reforms is a recent integration with Interchain Station. The news boosted the Terra Classic (LUNC) price. According to Jared, lead developer at Terraform Labs, more integrations and reforms are coming to Terra soon. The sudden crash of Terra LUNA sent a cascade effect across the crypto industry, leading several firms to bankruptcy. Many investors are yet to recover from the loss incurred from the Terra implosion. There are still uncleared controversies surrounding the ecosystem&#8217;s sudden collapse. Some say Terra LUNA was a rug pull scheme by Do Kwon, founder of Terraform Labs, to launder and steal people&#8217;s money. Meanwhile, Do Kwon and his executives are still on the run from South Korean prosecutors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rates Hit 14-Month High – What Could This Mean For The Market Leader? More Integrations Coming To Terra Classic Network In a Twitter announcement, Jared revealed that the Terra Network would partner with other blockchains, including SEI, Juno, Osmosis, Mars, Pisco, and many more. He said the integrations aim to protect the network in the right direction and allow seamless cross-chain communication between Terra and other blockchains. Jared also told the Terra community to expect a rollout of more features while their main focus is to launch the wallet on mobile devices. The current station supports many mainnets including LUNC, LUNA, Osmosis, Juno, Kujira, Carbon, HuaHua, and Cresent. Terra’s interchain station wallet would simplify the complex process of interacting with multiple blockchain networks. The wallet would allow users to stake, vote, send, receive tokens, and interact with decentralized applications (dApps) across supported chains. LUNC price soared by 3% on January 10 when Jared first shared news of the interchain wallet feature via his Twitter handle. Jared referred to the development as a breakthrough in chain integrations. This move comes after several attempts by the Terra Classic community to revive the sinking Terra Classic project. With the new station wallet, DeFi developers can now access oracle data from several chains through the interchain facility. Why New Governance Implementation Is Important To LUNC Community The Terra Classic blockchain saw a rough start in 2023 after being impacted by crypto exchange KuCoin’s December 30 move. On December 30, 2022, KuCoin removed (undelegated) 48 billion Terra Classic (LUNC) tokens from circulation. This issue reduced the voting power of KuCoin’s Terra Classic Validator by 0.25%, taking it up to the 44th position. The exchange later said it would continue pledging LUNC tokens after a 14-day lock period. However, the move caused a drastic reduction in on-chain activity and stirred much anxiety in the LUNC community, causing the price to fall. After Kucoin’s move, the community responded by approving and implementing new governance proposals to improve the overall operation of the chain. The Terra ecosystem also started burning tokens to stir up on-chain activity. The new governance proposals got overwhelming votes from the community with the support of major crypto exchanges. As a result, one of the new implementations is governance proposal 11242, which aims to stop the reminting of already destroyed LUNC tokens. Once the implementation is complete, it will ensure the effective elimination of tokens from LUNC&#8217;s circulating supply which will also boost its price. Presently, the amount of Terra Classic tokens in circulation is nearly 6 trillion.

The aim of proposal 11242 is to stop the reminting burnt LUNC tokens and effectively reduce the seigniorage reward policy to zero. LUNC price is trading at $0.000177 with a minor decline. The token has gained up to 15.50% in the past week.]]></description>

<p>The exchange later said it would continue pledging LUNC tokens after a 14-day lock period. However, the move caused a drastic reduction in on-chain activity and stirred much anxiety in the LUNC community, causing the price to fall.</p>
<p>After Kucoin’s move, the community responded by approving and implementing new governance proposals to improve the overall operation of the chain. The Terra ecosystem also started burning tokens to stir up on-chain activity.</p>
<p>The new governance proposals got overwhelming votes from the community with the support of major crypto exchanges. As a result, one of the new implementations is <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/158844" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">governance proposal 11242</a>, which aims to stop the reminting of already destroyed LUNC tokens.</p>
<p>Once the implementation is complete, it will ensure the effective elimination of tokens from LUNC&#8217;s circulating supply which will also boost its price. Presently, the amount of Terra Classic tokens in circulation is nearly 6 trillion.</p>

<p>After the reduction in on-chain activity in the past month, the developers published proposal 11242 at the beginning of January. The aim of proposal 11242 is to stop the reminting burnt LUNC tokens and effectively reduce the seigniorage reward policy to zero.</p>

<p>LUNC price is trading at $0.000177 with a minor decline. The token has gained up to 15.50% in the past week.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Ethereum price rally is on an upward trajectory since the last fortnight. Performing a little over Bitcoin’s growth, Ethereum gained 30%. On the morning of 16th January, Ethereum woke up to exciting news as Ethereum is riding high on the $1600 market price.  This comes after several contributory factors play a role in the price increase. From the accumulation of assets, particularly by Shark Addresses, it crossed above $1400 for the first time since 7th November on 12th January.  Related Reading: ETH Whales Scoop Up SAND – Up Nearly 80% – For Its Highly Bought Crypto Menu Shark Addresses are also the highest in this period, with Santiment observing 3000 new Shark Addresses, taking the total tally to the highest since February 2021.  Ethereum Bullish Momentum Before The Shanghai Upgrade Ethereum is two months away from the Shanghai Upgrade, and the prices have surged to the highest in ten weeks. After this upgrade, Ethereum will implement EIP Proposal 4895, enabling consensus layer withdrawals.  Following the Shanghai Upgrade, the users can withdraw staked ETH tokens on the Beacon chain for over 2 years. This upgrade is going to streamline the ETH withdrawal and will improve the exit process.  This upgrade is going to benefit ETH liquid staking platforms. Simply put, liquid staking is locking up funds to generate rewards. However, in this, the users can still access their locked funds. Given the fact that with the upgrade, the users can withdraw their staked amounts, subject to the correct exit process, which will be an attractive factor.  Lido is one of the platforms allowing liquid staking, and its performance is great. The amount of ETH staked on Lido crosses a cumulative value of $22.5 billion. Crypto experts believe that after the new upgrade, ETH will be staked to leverage better yield opportunities.  More Ethereum Is Burning Than Produced Ethereum’s performance in 2022 was not good. However, come 2023, the ETH holders are in a celebratory mood as the coin’s price increases amidst a deflationary trend. As the on-chain fundamentals strengthen ETH issue goes into a deflationary mood as the current supply growth reduces by -0.10%, according to the latest trends by Ultrasound Money. According to the same source, 732,000 ETH was burned, and 622,000 ETH was issued. The overall trend in the market is still bearish, but seeing the current upward trend in ETH and its price increase, the market is expected to take a bullish turn. Moreover, with the gas price increase, the burn rate will increase further.  Consequently, the higher deflation rate will lead to a shrinking supply. As compared to Bitcoin, Ethereum has a higher value settlement. This is an interesting trend for the future as ETH holders stand to gain more than BTC holders in the future when the contracts mature.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Trigger Buy Signal, Has Miner Capitulation Concluded?

Notably, the organization transferred over $63.5 million, or approximately 41,000 ETH.  Related Reading: FTX Hacker Mobilizes Ethereum Again, Lock And Loaded For The Dump? On January 16, blockchain detective ZachXBT published information about the transfer of a significant amount of Ethereum. The cryptocurrency assets which originated from Tornado Cash were transferred via Railgun. Railgun is a private smart contract platform that uses zero-knowledge proofs to hide financial transactions.

As a result, the accounts were frozen by the exchange.  We detected Harmony One hacker fund movement. They previously tried to launder through Binance and we froze his accounts. This time he used Huobi. We assisted Huobi team to freeze his accounts. Together, 124 BTC have been recovered. CeFi helping to keep DeFi #SAFU! 🙏 — CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) January 16, 2023 The Group had been keeping its money in Tornado Cash, a service that helps keep people&#8217;s identities secret and is used by criminals to launder money in the crypto industry. The experts followed the funds through more than three hundred addresses. They concluded that Railgun had spread around 41,000 ETH among multiple receivers before the cryptocurrencies were deposited at various exchanges. He did not name the exchanges, but he did say that the Lazarus Group routinely makes rapid withdrawals from such platforms. Connections Between Lazarus And Harmony&#8217;s Attack Lazarus is now quite skilled at hiding their movements from law enforcement agencies while transferring illegal cryptocurrencies. For example, they were suspected of being behind the attack on Harmony Bridge in June 2022. In-depth information about the attack was published by Elliptic, a blockchain analytics service, at the time it occurred. Multiple large crypto heists, totaling over $2 billion, have been linked to the Lazarus Group. DeFi and cross-chain bridges became a new target in 2022, and the group was also suspected of being behind the $600 million Ronin Bridge attack. According to a recent report by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, another North Korean hacker group BlueNoroff has expanded its illegal activities by posing as venture capitalists looking to invest in cryptocurrency startups. Kaspersky&#8217;s report shows the global attacks by BlueNoroff against cryptocurrency businesses were uncovered in January 2022 but slowed down until the fall. Theft of cryptocurrency has become a profitable business for North Korean hackers. According to information about their operations, South Korean spying services estimate that over $1.2 billion in cryptocurrency has been stolen from the global community since 2017. In 2022, numerous companies, including FTX, were victims of cyberattacks. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $20,800, up 21% in the last week. It is currently trading above its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), which indicates that the price will remain bullish in the short term.
