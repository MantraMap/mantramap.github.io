										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>RSI stays above 50 in 2023</li>
<li>The weekly chart points out an ascending triangle pattern</li>
<li>$45k is the next target, providing the Bitcoin price holds above $25k</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Bitcoin bulls must be frustrated by the slow price action in the last few months. After all, ever since it met resistance at the $30k level, Bitcoin moved in a very tight range compared to historical volatility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the same happened to the FX market. Volatility remains subdued since the EUR/USD climbed over the pivotal 1.10 level, and now traders wonder what comes next &ndash; further upside or a reversal of the bullish trend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two are connected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If one looks at the EUR/USD rally from 0.95 and compares it to the Bitcoin rally from $15,000, similarities can&rsquo;t be ignored. In other words, it is more of a US dollar&rsquo;s story than Bitcoin investors accumulating more coins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faced with this ambiguity, sometimes it helps to look at the bigger picture and interpret charts. In doing so, the bias for Bitcoin price is bullish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here are two technical reasons to buy Bitcoin (or sell the US dollar):&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>RSI stays above 50 in 2023</li>
<li>The weekly chart points out an ascending triangle pattern</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/07/13/1691922492938-6ad0d9ef-f5d5-4615-a99d-55c97030cd8c.jpg" style="width: 1800px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="1800" height="444"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/?exchange=CRYPTO" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bitcoin chart by TradingView</a></p>
<h2>RSI holds above 50 in 2023</h2>
<p>The first technical bullish setup for Bitcoin comes from the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The RSI is an oscillator, typically displayed at the bottom of a chart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main theme of the weekly chart above is Bitcoin&rsquo;s rally from the 2022 lows. The move from $15k to above $30k resulted in the RSI crossing above 50.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RSI &ldquo;oscillates&rdquo; between overbought and oversold levels, marked with 70, respectively 30. When in-between levels, technical traders focus on the 50 mark. More precisely, when the RSI crosses above 50, the price action is bullish, and when it crosses below, the price action is bearish. Of course, traders should be aware of false breakouts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the timeframe above (i.e., weekly) suggests no such thing as a false breakout. Just the opposite, considering that the price action has held above 50 since the start of 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hence, the bias remains bullish while the RSI holds above 50, and the next move should be a climb into the overbought territory.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>An ascending triangle pattern hints at a move above $45k</h2>
<p>An ascending triangle is a bullish pattern characterized by the price action pushing against horizontal resistance. Its measured move equals the longest segment in the triangle formation and points to further advances toward the $45k area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there is one condition &ndash; the price action must hold above $25k. If it does so, the RSI will stay above 50, meaning Bitcoin&rsquo;s price will finally build energy to break above horizontal resistance.&nbsp;</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals is a profitable trading service with more than 64% signal accuracy.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals has raised $1.3 million in presale as investors show interest in AI trading</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">$ASI token has been lauded as a 10x investment ahead of Uniswap listing in Q3 2023.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">2023 has been a year of twists and turns in crypto. Major cryptos have underperformed, but newly launched projects have found a soft landing. This means Investors are looking for projects out of the ordinary. Cryptocurrencies with the potential to surge strongly in the next bull cycle have benefited. AltSignals ($ASI) has been one of them, with a fast-selling presale suggestion of high investor interest. $ASI has raised $1.3 million in&nbsp;<a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>presale</u></a> amid a huge interest in its new AI-led trading platform.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>AltSignals&rsquo; AI application in trading</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Artificial intelligence is growing and finding applications in numerous sectors. Trading has been one of them, with Altsignals the latest to jump into the AI bandwagon. The company is creating an AI platform dubbed ActualizeAI. Investors will hold $ASI tokens to become a member of ActualizeAI.</p>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals is a profitable trading signal provider in the UK with half a decade of existence. The company covers financial instruments ranging from forex, stock, and cryptocurrencies. Up to now, AltSignals has been using an algorithm indicator AltAlgo&trade; to generate trading signals. The company generates signals with an average accuracy rate of 64%.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">With AI, AltSignals expects to cover more trading instruments and increase the quality of its signals. In the trading world, AI has been used for generating quality signals. This is achieved through machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive modelling. AI is also devoid of human emotions, enabling traders to make better decisions in trading.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The AltSignals team believes AI will supercharge earnings and give investors more value for money. $ASI, the token of the AI-powered platform, will be the unit of exchanging value. This includes allowing investors to participate in the governance of the platform. Members can earn more tokens by contributing ideas through an AI Members Club. There are also trading competitions where investors can improve their trading skills and earn $ASI.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>$ASI prediction and investment opportunity</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">$ASI has a huge opportunity to succeed, given that it powers an already successful trading platform. Success is illustrated by its over $52,000 followers on Telegram and 1,400 VIP members. That gives $ASI a headstart as it gears to list on Uniswap in the third quarter.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">But the future growth of AltSignals depends on how much it continues to attract users. With a blockchain and AI angle, the visibility of the platform could grow. As more members join to benefit from the trading signals, the value of $ASI could skyrocket.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It means that AltSignals is an ideal investment for investors looking for a token with real-world utility. The token can deliver consistent returns and sustainable returns on increased use of ActualizeAI.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Predictably, analysts expect $ASI to close the year at $0.20. The current price for the token is $0.01875, implying an increase of nearly 1,000%. An increase of this magnitude happens quite often with newly launched tokens. This means $ASI has a real chance to rise by 10x, per analysts&rsquo; estimates.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">While this thesis finds $ASI with such a realistic potential, the increase could occur in the medium term. Potentially, the increase could occur over 2024 as the use of the platform grows. In 2023, a price increase of three-digit percentages would be more realistic.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Should you buy AltSignals in August?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals presale is happening first, while the token listing is fast approaching. $ASI&rsquo;s value could increase exponentially after listing. Investors might be forced to pay a premium buying a token on exchanges than on presale.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">An ideal investment decision is to buy $ASI when the price is still low on presale. This allows investors to benefit from a possible rise in value when the token is listed.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The token of SEI Network debuts on Binance on August 15, with price estimates of $0.26</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The token of the Chancer platform, a predictive markets application, will list in Q3 2023</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Chancer token could rise by up to 10x after debuting with higher predictions in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Binance is set to debut the token of Layer-1 blockchain SEI Network on August 15. Traders have huge expectations of the token, with its market expected to hit almost half a billion US dollars. Meanwhile, the robust presale of Chancer token continues, with over $1.32 million raised. The prospect of peer-to-peer betting by Chancer has accelerated the presale. Investors can&nbsp;<a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>buy</u></a> the token via ETH, USDT, BNB, and BUSD.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Upcoming SEI token debut and price predictions</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">SEI, the token of the SEI Network, will go live on Binance on August 15. The listing comes amid positive predictions, with price estimates of $0.26 immediately after going live. A&nbsp;<a href="https://app.aevo.xyz/perpetual/sei" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pre-listing futures data</u></a> by Aevo shows at the estimated price, SEI will have a market cap of $486 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It means that SEI will enter the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap after listing. The token will have a circulating supply of 1.8 billion, equivalent to 18% of its 10 billion total supply. SEI&rsquo;s pre-listing futures contracts went live on Aevo on Wednesday. They allow traders and investors to speculate on the post-listing price of the token.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>About Chancer and the Chancer token</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer is the world&rsquo;s first blockchain-based predictive market application. The Chancer token will be the unit of exchanging value on the platform and claiming winnings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The platform enables betting in a P2P environment. What has made Chancer exciting is that it allows betting on multiple events. Users create P2P markets, decide what to bet on, determine rules and odds, and invite others.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let&rsquo;s say you predict that it will rain in the evening. You can create a Chancer market and invite your friends to place bets for or against the outcome. Winners get rewarded with a Chancer token.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer decentralises betting by taking betting to blockchain and allowing users to be in charge. This allows more users to join and benefit from the predictive market.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What value does the Chancer token carry?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Like any other cryptocurrency, Chancer carries value based on current and future price movements. Presently, the token is valued at $0.011, with the price increasing at each presale stage. In the future, the token&rsquo;s value could be higher when it is listed on exchanges. Investors buying the token will benefit from a potential price surge. With betting a popular sector, a high price potential remains.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer also carries value for investors for continued use of the platform. Users can join in on live betting games, create Chancer markets, and claim winnings on accurate predictions. Investors can also stake the token for passive income.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Chancer presale and listing</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer&rsquo;s presale will occur in 12 phases, targeting $15,000,000. The presale is in the second stage, with the selling occurring fast, barely two months since it was launched.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Chancer token will be listed in Q3 2023, starting with Uniswap. The aim is to get the token on at least two centralised exchanges in the third quarter. The listing will welcome more demand for the token, and the price could skyrocket.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Chancer token prediction</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Although predicting a new token is quite subjective, a price increase of up to 10x is not off the table. Newly-launched tokens have risen by similar margins a few weeks after listing. Given the huge expectation around the Chancer platform, high speculation is a plus for the token. Thus, a price of up to 10x is possible in 2024 and near similar margins in 2023.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2025 and beyond, Chancer could be a 20x or more investment. The value could increase consistently into the future as blockchain-based betting gathers momentum. This means Chancer is a potential investment that can deliver sustainable returns over time.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Bankman-Fried, whose criminal trial begins on October 2, will be jailed at Putnam.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Judge Lewis Kaplan has revoked the bail granted to former <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, and ordered his detention after a hearing over alleged witness tampering. CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/11/us-judge-sends-sam-bankman-fried-to-jail-over-witness-tampering.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> the development on Friday.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Judge sands Bankman-Fried to jail</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Judge Kaplan on Friday ruled in favour of a motion filed by federal prosecutors after the government complained about Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s potential to tamper with both witnesses and the jury in his upcoming criminal trial.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In denying the defendant&rsquo;s plea for a delayed detention ahead of an appeal, Judge Kaplan said that SBF had tried to interfere with witnesses on at least two occasions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bankman-Fried is to be remanded at the Putnam jail pending his appeal and ahead of the October 2 trial. Prosecutors said the ex-FTX chief will have access to the internet at the facility as he prepares his defence, which would not be the case at MDC that is closest to the court but offers limited internet access.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Inner City Press has reported that defence lawyers already filed an appeal.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

<p dir="ltr">As CoinJournal <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/us-justice-department-wants-bankman-fried-jailed/">highlighted</a> in July, prosecution had sought to have Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s bail revoked and he be jailed following instances of alleged witness tampering. The DOJ had <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/doj-accuses-bankman-fried-of-leaking-ellisons-diary-to-discredit-her/">allleged</a> that SBF leaked the private diary of his former colleague and now star federal witness Caroline Alison to a New York Times reporter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the government, the disgraced ex-billionaire&rsquo;s goal was to discredit Alison and possibly affect the jurors. During the last hearing, Judge Kaplan had warned Bankman-Fried about his behaviour, noting the bail could be revoked.</p>

<li dir="ltr">SEC announced the delay today, publishing a letter calling for more information from the public.</li>
<li dir="ltr">A decision on Ark Invest spot Bitcoin ETF could come towards the end of the year.</li>
<li dir="ltr">BlackRock and Fidelity are two of the leading firms seeking approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Today&rsquo;s top <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/crypto-regulation/">crypto regulation news</a> revolves around the move by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to delay a decision on one of the several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) before it. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">SEC has yet to approve a spot <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bitcoin-etf/">Bitcoin ETF</a> for the US market, despite allowing multiple futures-based ones.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">ETF delay largely expected</h2>
<p dir="ltr">A lot of exuberance permeated the industry when global asset management and investment behemoths BlackRock and Fidelity filed proposals to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs for the US market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the SEC now calling for more public input for the Ark 21Shares spot Bitcoin ETF, the reaction across the crypto industry has largely been one of muted disappointment. This is because as Bloomberg ETFs expert James Seyffart <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1689649670522589184" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">highlighted</a> on Thursday, the market had largely priced in a delay.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">TIMELINE: I've had questions in DMs and mentions over the last few days. The next SEC deadline for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> ETFs is <a href="https://twitter.com/ARKInvest?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ARKInvest</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/21co__?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@21co__</a>'s  on 8/13. That's a Sunday so we should see a decision by tomorrow. My bet is after market close tomorrow. We are fully expecting a DELAY. <a href="https://t.co/meejrBZaQp">pic.twitter.com/meejrBZaQp</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">As has been the case with previous applications to face a similar trend, the regulator&rsquo;s consideration for the Ark Invest ETF will now encompass further comments and review for up to 60 days. A decision could come much later in the year, with the third deadline for the Ark ETF in the second week of November and the final deadline in January 2024.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the first deadline for the applications by BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco, Valkyrie, Bitwise and WisdomTree is early next month.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The expectation is that these will also be pushed, although as Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/cathie-wood-sec-approve-more-than-one-bitcoin-etfs/">noted</a> earlier this, the SEC may decide to approve more than one Bitcoin ETF all at once.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Inu is up by more than 30% over the last 30 days, outperforming other major cryptocurrencies.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Chancer&rsquo;s presale is now closing in on the $1.3 million mark.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Inu has outperformed the other major cryptocurrencies over the past 30 days and could be set to surge higher ahead of the Shibarium launch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer&rsquo;s presale continues to move according to plan, with more than $1.2 million raised so far in the current stage.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">SHIB rallies ahead of Shibarium launch</h2>
<p dir="ltr">SHIB, the native token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, is up by more than 30% over the last month. The rally makes it the best performer amongst the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap during that period.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At press time, the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/shiba-inu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Shiba Inu</u></a> stands at $0.00001006 per token. The rally can be attributed to the upcoming Shibarium launch. The Shibarium launch is expected to take place over the next few days or weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shibarium is Shiba Inu&rsquo;s upcoming layer-2 blockchain network built on Ethereum. The blockchain is expected to transform Shiba Inu, a memecoin, into a complete ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">SHIB could rally higher and likely hit a one-year high of $0.00014 once Shibarium launches.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Chancer?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">While Shiba Inu has been rallying, the broader market has been stagnant. However, that hasn&rsquo;t affected Chancer&rsquo;s presale.&nbsp;<a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Chancer</u></a> is a web3 project designed to decentralise the betting ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer is a web3 peer-to-peer (P2P) custom betting platform that allows users to place bets on a wide range of events, including custom-made ones. The bets can be live-streamed to ensure transparency. Chancer will operate as a completely decentralised online gaming platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer&rsquo;s platform wants to improve the services offered by traditional sports and casino betting platforms. Chancer users can bet on any event, even ones they make up themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The funds from the presale rounds would be channelled towards building Chancer&rsquo;s decentralised P2P betting platform. The Chancer platform will come with some exciting features, including betting markets in real-time and based on user interests, social media connections, and expertise.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Users can set up their custom P2P betting markets, allowing other users to bet on their events and games.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Chancer&rsquo;s second presale closes in on $1.3 million</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer is currently in its second presale stage, and it has raised more than 60% of the required funds. So far, the team is close to generating $1.3 million in the second stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">There will be 12 presale events, with a combined target of $15 million. In the second stage, CHANCER, the native token of the ecosystem, is going for $0.011 per token, with the price set to increase to $0.012 in the third presale round.</p>
<p dir="ltr">CHANCER will power so many activities on the platform. By holding the token, users can create custom P2P betting events on the Chancer platform. Users can also participate in markets launched by others.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the CHANCER token, users can create, participate in, and profit from their predictive markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The CHANCER token can be purchased via the official Chancer website. Simply connect any supported wallets to the presale link. Trust Wallet, MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Rainbow are some supported wallets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Chancer website</u></a> to get more information about the presale.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Should you buy CHANCER tokens now?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Presale is perhaps the best time to invest in Web3 projects. During this period, the project is only accessible to a limited number of investors, and prices are usually discounted.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Chancer</u></a> could become a leading Web3 project thanks to its effort of trying to decentralise the betting ecosystem. If it succeeds, Chancer could gain massive adoption over the coming months and years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the adoption level rises, CHANCER&rsquo;s price could experience a massive surge, and early investors could benefit.&nbsp;</p>

<li dir="ltr">HKVAX has moved closer to becoming only the third platform to receive a VATP licence in Hong Kong.</li>
<li dir="ltr">This is after it obtained an approval-in-principle from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC)</li>
<li dir="ltr">The SFC website lists OSL and Hashkey as only two VATP licensed companies.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Hong Kong Virtual Asset Exchange (HKVAX) has received a notice of approval-in-principle from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).</p>
<p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.hkvax.com/news/detail?diffId=1673250247927656448" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> from HKVAX noted that the approval will see the platform become only the third virtual asset trading platform (VATP) to be licensed by the SFC.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>We are delighted to have received approval-in-principle from the SFC and look forward to creating a safe and trusted environment for investors in one of the world&rsquo;s largest and most dynamic financial centres</em>,&rdquo; said Dr. Anthony Ng, co-founder and CEO of HKVAX.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to HKVAX, a final approval from the regulator will allow the company to provide regulated activities identified as Type 1 (securities offerings) and Type 7 (automated trading services) to customers. HKVAX will offer three core products to users once the regulatory process is done &ndash; an OTC brokerage, an institutional-grade exchange platform, and custody solution.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">HKVAX to join OSL and Hashkey as third VATP licence</h2>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;HKVAX&rsquo;s approval-in-principle could see it join OSL and Hashkey as the third licensed VATP in Hong Kong. Details on the SFC <a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Welcome-to-the-Fintech-Contact-Point/Virtual-assets/Virtual-asset-trading-platforms-operators/Lists-of-virtual-asset-trading-platforms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a> show that OSL received the first digital assets broker licence in December 2020, while Hashkey was licensed in November 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The path to approval for HKVAX comes on the back of the Hong Kong government&rsquo;s push to bring into operation <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/hong-kong-to-release-crypto-framework-next-month-bloomberg/"><u>a new crypto framework</u></a> for the virtual asset industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Among the changes has been the requirement that registered institutions and banks extend services to SFC-licensed crypto platforms. Firms seeking to offer virtual assets are also obligated to apply for appropriate licences before providing these services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sam Fok, co-founder and COO at HKVAX said they welcome the new changes meant to provide regulatory clarity for the industry in Hong Kong. He added:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Over the last two years, we have worked very closely with the government and other stakeholders to strengthen regulations. We welcome the changes proposed recently by the SFC that open up virtual assets to a wider community while providing investors of all types with the transparency, reliability and protection they expect. The changes also signal Hong Kong&rsquo;s intent to become a global virtual asset hub</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On August 7, the SFC <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/hong-kong-warns-crypto-exchanges-about-improper-practices/"><u>published a warning to VATPs</u></a> that are yet to get properly licensed not to mislead users, particularly through statements published in relation to &ldquo;their intention to apply for licences.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the regulator, such announcements are likely to &ldquo;give the public a false sense of assurance&rdquo; that the VATP is compliant with SFC regulations.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Barcelona to host EBC9</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Barcelona, the Catalan capital, will host this year&rsquo;s European Blockchain Convention 9 (EBC9). This will be the largest European blockchain event so far and will take place from October 24-27.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the organisers, EBC9 will be the largest event of its kind for the second half of the year. The event will have in attendance roughly 5,000 delegates, making it the largest EBC event so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The event coincides with the El Cl&aacute;sico clash between Barcelona and Real Madrid, perhaps the most significant football rivalry in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The organisers revealed that 300 founders, CEOs, and industry experts will be in attendance to speak at the event. Some of the speakers include C-level execs from Nansen, Fidelity, Fabric Ventures, and Animoca Brands.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, there would be speakers from traditional companies, including Banco Santander and Volkswagen. Senior personnel from Binance Labs and Galaxy Digital will also be in attendance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Coinjournal is a proud media partner of the European Blockchain Convention.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">While commenting on this&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>latest cryptocurrency news</u></a>, Victoria Gago, co-founder of the European Blockchain Convention, stated that;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;We have seen a significant increase in registrations and interest from exhibitors and sponsors alike after the overwhelmingly positive feedback we got from our previous edition. Building on that momentum, we are moving EBC9 to Fira Barcelona, a much larger venue. As the largest convention centre in Spain, it offers ample space for exhibitors, a greater variety of content, and more engaging experiences.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">EBC speakers to touch on diverse topics</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Co-founder, Daniel Salmeron, said they are excited to bring together the worlds of TradFi, digital assets and web3. He said;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;The participation of so many traditional banks and financial institutions demonstrates their commitment and optimism about the future of crypto and digital assets.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">EBC9 will see speakers touch on a wide range of topics, including regulatory challenges, CBDCs, privacy, the institutionalization of crypto, DeFi, sustainability, tokenization, and the ascent of AI.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The event won&rsquo;t solely be around panel discussions and workshops. The organisers have put in place a 3,000 sqm exhibition area for sponsors and exhibitors. There will also be AMA sessions with speakers, a 1-to-1 meeting area, and five themed networking lounges.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other events for attendees to enjoy include an investor meetup, an art gallery, and the second edition of the EBC Start-up Awards.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Finally, there will be a Hackathon where 200+ hackers, 30+ mentors and 20 teams are expected to participate in a 48 hours hackathon.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">You can learn more about the European Blockchain Convention, including sponsorship, ticketing details and the full list of speakers, via their official website,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eblockchainconvention.com" rel="nofollow"><u>www.eblockchainconvention.com</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Launched in 2018, European Blockchain Convention is the most influential blockchain event in Europe, connecting industry professionals, startups, and technology leaders. The event provides a platform for sharing insights, fostering collaborations, and exploring the vast potential of blockchain, crypto, and digital assets.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Cardano has been criticized as one of the biggest ghost chains in the industry.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">But its metrics shows that its network activity is doing well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/cardano/"><u>Cardano</u></a>, one of the most popular blockchains, is also a highly controversial one as concerns about its ecosystem growth remain. Some crypto watchers believe that it is a highly overvalued project while others argue it is a ghost chain.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Is Cardano a ghost chain?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">A ghost chain is defined as a crypto project that has nothing going on in its ecosystem. And there are so many such chains in the crypto industry. Some of the top ghost chains are Kadena, Velas, and XDS Network among others.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cardano, on the other hand, cannot be defined as a ghost chain because its ecosystem is growing. For example, its&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/learn/what-is-defi/"><u>DeFi</u></a> ecosystem is thriving even as the crypto winter continues. Data compiled by DeFi Llama shows that Cardano&rsquo;s TVL has jumped to $227 million, making it the 14th biggest chain in the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In ADA terms, Cardano&rsquo;s TVL has jumped to an all-time high of over 750 million ADA coins. This growth has been driven by the rising number of DeFi protocols in Cardano and the performance of platforms like MuesliSwap, MinSwap, SundaeSwap, and Indigo.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Further, Cardano also has many users. As shown below, the network is <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Cardano?currency=ADA&amp;users=true&amp;tvl=false"><u>averaging</u></a> over 30k daily users. Most ghost chains rarely have any users.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/07/11/1691757737443-9c96b1e4-be0d-46bd-811b-9e41809aed49.jpg" style="width: 657px;height: 313.656px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="657" height="313.656"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Cardano is also active in the NFT industry. Data by CryptoSlam shows that the total sales of Cardano NFTs in the past 24 hours totaled $277k, making it the eighth biggest player in the industry after Ethereum, Polygon, Mythos, Immutable X, BNB Chain, and Bitcoin.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Cardano&rsquo;s valuation is stretched</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, we can conclude without a doubt that Cardano is not a ghost chain. Instead, I believe that Cardano is just highly overvalued. According to CoinMarketCap, Cardano is valued at over $10 billion. At its peak, it was valued at over $90 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the drawdown, it is hard to explain this valuation since $10 billion is a lot of money. Its valuation means that Cardano is valued higher than American Airlines, Lazard, and Moelis.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The biggest challenge is that the ecosystem is getting highly competitive. Most of this competition is coming from layer-2 networks like Arbitrum, Polygon, Base, and Optimism among others.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cardano has also failed to attract the biggest players in industries like tokenization, stablecoins, and DeFi. Instead, big players like AAVE, Uniswap, and PancakeSwap have moved to L2 networks.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How to buy Cardano</h2>
