            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cardano whales are seizing the opportunity of price inaction to rake in more tokens. One particular cohort of ADA holders has accumulated back to their highest level not seen in nearly a year as the current value of the crypto-asset struggles below the $0.30 level.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cardano_whale_cover.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265145" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cardano_whale_cover.jpg" alt="cardano_whale_cover" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cardano_whale_cover.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cardano_whale_cover-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cardano_whale_cover-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cardano_whale_cover-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cardano_whale_cover-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<p>According to the crypto-analytic platform, Santiment, whales and sharks holding between 100K-10M ADA have accumulated back to their highest level since September 2022. It was also observed that Cardano&#8217;s on-chain transaction volume was rising nearly every week for the past six months.</p>
<ul>
<li>ADA&#8217;s performance, so far, has been underwhelming. The crypto being dragged into court battles by the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) further reversed any potential upside moves.</li>
<li>However, the continued <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1688789040815075328" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">accumulation</a> depicts that investors are bullish about ADA&#8217;s price action even as it was trapped within the range of $0.35-$0.26 for the past several weeks.</li>
<li>On the DeFi side of things, Cardano registered notable growth with its total value locked (TVL) rising by nearly 10% quarter-over-quarter and climbing beyond $151 million.</li>
<li>The layer-1 smart contract platform&#8217;s year-to-date TVL also surged by almost 200%, propelling it from the 34th to the 21st position among all networks in 2023.</li>
<li>Cardano&#8217;s average daily dapp transactions also <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cardano-records-impressive-49-qoq-growth-in-dapp-transactions-10-rise-in-tvl-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">increased</a> by 49.0% increase from the previous quarter in Q2, retaining an average of 57,900 daily transactions, according to Messari’s report titled &#8216;State of Cardano.&#8217;</li>
<li>The transaction activity on the network also surged during the period by approximately 2% QoQ from 67,500 to 68,800.</li>
</ul>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price has been slowly dropping over the past few weeks, approaching a significant support level. Things will get interesting soon, as the market&#8217;s reaction to this level would likely determine the price action in the next few weeks.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart:</h3>
<p>On the daily timeframe, the ETH price has been declining since getting rejected from the $2,000 psychological level.</p>
<p>The 50-day moving average has also been broken to the downside around the $1,900 mark. Currently, the price is moving toward the 200-day moving average located near the $1,800 level. The $1,750 support zone is also nearby, adding to the significance of this area.</p>
<p>A rebound could result in a rally toward the $2,000 level and probably higher. On the other hand, a breakdown of the mentioned support zone can lead to a rapid drop to the $1,400 area in the short term. Yet, judging by the lack of bearish momentum in the recent decline, a rebound and rally seem more likely.</p>
<figure id="attachment_265128" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265128" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-8-2023-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-265128 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-8-2023-scaled.jpg" alt="eth_price_chart_0808231" width="2560" height="1464" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-8-2023-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-8-2023-300x172.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-8-2023-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-8-2023-768x439.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-8-2023-1536x879.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-8-2023-2048x1171.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-8-2023-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-265128" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart:</h3>
<p>The recent price action is much clearer in the 4-hour timeframe. As the chart depicts, the cryptocurrency has been oscillating inside a descending channel for the past few weeks. Currently, ETH is moving towards the higher boundary of the pattern, as the $1,820 short-term support has held strongly.</p>
<p>The RSI indicator has also risen above the 50% threshold, indicating that the buyers are once again in control. So, a bullish breakout from the channel and an uptrend toward the $1,920 resistance and even higher toward the $2,000 area might become possible in the coming days if things do not take an unexpected turn.</p>
<figure id="attachment_265129" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265129" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-4H-Aug-8-2023-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-265129 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-4H-Aug-8-2023-scaled.jpg" alt="eth_price_chart_0808232" width="2560" height="1464" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-4H-Aug-8-2023-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-4H-Aug-8-2023-300x172.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-4H-Aug-8-2023-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-4H-Aug-8-2023-768x439.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-4H-Aug-8-2023-1536x879.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-4H-Aug-8-2023-2048x1171.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-4H-Aug-8-2023-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-265129" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3>Ethereum Funding Rates</h3>
<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price action has yet to show any indication of moving higher or lower.</p>
<p>This chart represents the Ethereum funding rates. The metric determines whether long traders or short sellers are dominant. Positive values are usually associated with bullish sentiment, while negative ones indicate bearish sentiment.</p>
<p>It is evident that after a few weeks of positive values, funding rates turned extremely negative yesterday. While this is generally a sign of bearish sentiment, it could lead to positive consequences if the metric quickly returns below 1.</p>
<p>Negative funding rates also increase the chance of a short liquidation cascade, which could lead to a significant rally and push the price above the $2,000 level once more.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Shiba Inu whales are on the move. Here's one possible reason why. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shiba Inu has always been an explosive cryptocurrency to watch ever since it was launched. Even though it has become one of the largest coins by means of total market capitalization, its sudden moves are as surprising as they&#8217;ve ever been.</p>
<p>Now, it appears that whales are starting to take note and accumulate tremendous numbers of SHIB tokens. But Why?</p>
<h2>SHIB Whales Accumulate Trillions of Coins</h2>
<p>Noted in two separate transactions by the popular whale monitoring account Whale Alert, Shiba Inu seems to have new whales on board.</p>
<p>First, on August 6th at around 16:00 UTC time, a whale bought a total of 4,412,252,578,938 SHIB.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> 4,412,252,578,938 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SHIB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#SHIB</a> (40,672,144 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet<a href="https://t.co/zrqGNV5Jn9" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://t.co/zrqGNV5Jn9</a></p>
<p>— Whale Alert (@whale_alert) <a href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1688220474256330752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">August 6, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As you can see, someone added a whopping $40.6 million worth of SHIB in a single transaction. The second one took place on August 7th, again at around the same time. This time, a different whale bought 4,367,252,578,938 SHIB worth just shy of $40 million.</p>
<p>So why are big accounts accumulating millions worth of SHIB right now? Do they know something we don&#8217;t?</p>

<h2>One Possible Reason</h2>
<p>One possible reason behind this behavior could be the anticipated launch of Shiba Inu&#8217;s own blockchain network &#8211; Shibarium. Its launch is supposedly slated to happen this month.</p>
<p>As <em>CryptoPotato </em><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/shibarium-beta-bridge-goes-live-for-public-testing-as-layer-2-launch-inches-closer/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> earlier in July, the Shibarium Beta Bridge went live for public testing.</p>
<p>Back in June, one of the lead developers of the Shiba Inu ecosystem <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/shiba-inu-pumps-after-lead-developer-shares-shibarium-update-details/" data-wpel-link="internal">revealed</a> that the Shibarium launch will include interesting functionalities. It will let users link NFTs to real-world assets to provide authentication and proof-of-ownership for physical items.</p>

The cryptocurrency is shaping up to be an exciting challenger to some of the largest meme coins. Let&#8217;s find out why.</p>
<p><a href="https://pomerdoge.com/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-1.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265003" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-1.png" alt="Picture4" width="468" height="312" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-1.png 468w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-1-300x200.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-1-50x33.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></a></p>
<h2>Pomerdoge (POMD): A New Age Meme Coin Model</h2>
<p>The meme coin universe is about to witness a dramatic shift as Pomerdoge positions itself to take over from Pepe as the new king of meme-themed cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Centered around the playful image of a Pomeranian dog, Pomerdoge is generating significant demand during its presale period. But what really sets this new entrant apart from other meme coins is its ambitious and comprehensive ecosystem.</p>
<p>Pomerdoge aims to redefine the meme coin space by integrating games, NFTs, and a rewarding incentive system. Users can immerse themselves in enjoyable gameplay and simultaneously earn rewards, an innovative approach designed to attract and retain users within the Pomerdoge universe.</p>
<h2>POMD Token: The Heartbeat of the Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Powering the Pomerdoge ecosystem is POMD, the utility token that fuels all transactions and activities within the platform. Acquiring POMD tokens enables users to unlock NFTs, engage in the Pomerdoge marketplace, and gain access to exclusive in-game rewards.</p>
<p>POMD is also a power meme token in its own right. As you may have guessed, a pomeranian mascot graces the face of the POMD token. Its image alone has attracted a great influx of meme-lovers to join in on its presale and is actively contributing to POMD&#8217;s increasing value as an investment asset.</p>
<h2>A Tweet From Elon Musk?</h2>
<p>The burgeoning popularity of Pomerdoge (POMD) might just catch the attention of the renowned entrepreneur and cryptocurrency enthusiast, Elon Musk. Known for his fondness for meme coins, especially those with a canine theme, such as Dogecoin, a tweet from Musk about Pomerdoge could be a game-changer.</p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s tweets have previously sent the value of Dogecoin soaring, illustrating the influence he wields in the crypto market. With the unique features of Pomerdoge &#8211; its engaging gaming platform, NFT integration, and rewarding ecosystem, it shouldn&#8217;t be surprising if Musk decides to throw his weight behind this new meme coin.</p>
<h2>The Current Presale</h2>
<p>With the Phase 1 presale price pinned at $0.007, potential investors are presented with a golden ticket. This presale is time-sensitive, as the price will increase in subsequent phases as more POMD tokens are sold to people around the world.</p>
<p>There is only a limited amount of POMD available, and 46 million have already sold in the last week alone.</p>
<h2>The Road Ahead for Pomerdoge (POMD)</h2>
<p>Pomerdoge&#8217;s unique blend of utility, high demand, and well-designed ecosystem has caught the eye of analysts. Some predict that the value of Pomerdoge could surge by as much as 5,000% this year, an extraordinary projection that reflects the project&#8217;s potential.</p>
<p>As the presale continues and more details emerge, the excitement surrounding Pomerdoge will likely grow to a fever pitch. It&#8217;s an exciting time for cryptocurrency investors, and <a href="https://pomerdoge.com/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">POMD</a> could be the spark that ignites the crypto market this year!</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Shiba Inu broke several key levels. However, it appears to struggle to maintain its recent gains.</p>
<p><strong>Key Support levels: $0.0000080</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Resistance levels: $0.0000094  </strong></p>
<h2>1. Breakout or Fakeout?</h2>
<p>Despite a significant breakout that saw the price quickly move above the resistance at $0.000094, sellers returned in force and pushed SHIB under this key level.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency is now attempting to find support on top of the ascending wedge. If successful, then the rally might continue. Otherwise, the SHIB price may fall within the wedge, which could put an end to this bullish momentum.</p>
<figure id="attachment_265028" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265028" style="width: 1815px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-32.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-265028" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-32.png" alt="SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-32" width="1815" height="854" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-32.png 1815w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-32-300x141.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-32-1024x482.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-32-768x361.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-32-1536x723.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-32-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1815px) 100vw, 1815px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-265028" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>2. Buy Volume Exploded</h2>
<p>The level of buying pressure on Saturday was not seen since early 2023, when SHIB had a similar spike in price. Back then, bulls dominated for over a month. To reach a similar result, buyers have to hold above the wedge and push higher by turning the resistance at $0.0000094 into support.</p>
<figure id="attachment_265027" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265027" style="width: 1815px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-58.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-265027" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-58.png" alt="SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-58" width="1815" height="854" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-58.png 1815w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-58-300x141.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-58-1024x482.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-58-768x361.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-58-1536x723.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-11-58-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1815px) 100vw, 1815px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-265027" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>3. RSI Spiked into Overbought Area</h2>
<p>During the massive buying, SHIB&#8217;s daily RSI reached 77 points which placed it in the overbought area. This prompted sellers to come back and push the price down.</p>
<p>As presented in the below chart, the RSI is making higher lows and highs. This is widely perceived as a bullish indication, and so long the price holds above the wedge, then SHIB might continue higher.</p>
<figure id="attachment_265025" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265025" style="width: 1814px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-15-31.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-265025" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-15-31.png" alt="SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-15-31" width="1814" height="854" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-15-31.png 1814w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-15-31-300x141.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-15-31-1024x482.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-15-31-768x362.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-15-31-1536x723.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SHIBUSDT_2023-08-08_17-15-31-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1814px) 100vw, 1814px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-265025" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Bias</h2>
<p>The bias for SHIB is bullish.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Prediction for SHIB Price</h2>
<p>A battle at the $0.0000088 level seems likely as buyers and sellers look to position themselves above the wedge. Whoever is successful will decide where SHIB&#8217;s price goes next.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Trading volumes for Bitcoin futures and options contracts have contracted to record lows as market volatility remains low.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin derivatives are all about predicting future prices, and this generally needs prices to actually move in one direction or the other.</p>
<p>The recent market lethargy and weeks of stagnation have led to decreased activity on derivatives markers, according to Glassnode.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Bitcoin prices are infamously volatile, however the market is currently experiencing an extreme volatility compression,” it stated.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Bitcoin prices are infamously volatile, however the market is currently experiencing an extreme volatility compression. Whilst options markets reflect this, it suggests that Bitcoin is either no longer infamously volatile&#8230; or volatility could be mispriced.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p></blockquote>
<h2>Low Market Volatility Dampens Derivatives</h2>
<p>The on-chain analytics provider noted that the combined futures and options trade volume for the two assets is at or approaching all-time lows.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is currently seeing $19 billion in aggregate derivatives trade volume, whilst Ethereum markets have just $9.2 billion per day. These are less than the January lows in the depth of the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/did-you-know-this-is-the-longest-crypto-bear-market-ever-as-altcoins-languish-regulation-looms-and-tradfi-encroaches/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto winter</a> cycle.</p>
<p>It added that open interest (OI) in Bitcoin futures markets has also been flat at $12 billion over the last month. OI refers to the number of contracts that have yet to be settled. However, options markets have ticked up slightly and are now equal to futures in OI magnitude.</p>
<p>Futures are contracts that allow speculators to bet on a future price of BTC to be settled on a set date, whereas options contracts have flexible settlement dates and can be extended.</p>
<p>Implied volatility, which measures the market&#8217;s view of the likelihood of changes in prices, is also at historical lows. This suggests that market participants expect the inactivity to continue for a little while yet.</p>
<p>According to the ‘DeFi Investor’, the Bitcoin volatility index has reached an all-time low.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The real challenge is not surviving downtrends, but enduring the boredom of a sideways market.</p>

<p>Crypto markets are unmoved for yet another day, with total capitalization hovering just above $1.2 trillion. It has remained flat at this level for the past seven weeks.</p>
<p>Bitcoin dipped below $29K during late trading on Aug. 7 but rapidly recovered to return to its sideways channel at $29,150 at the time of writing.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[Press Release &#8211; Vienna, Austria, August 8th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.taskchain.co/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">TaskChain</a>, a groundbreaking Web3 project, has just announced the launch of its presale today. This new development comes prior to the introduction of TaskChain’s innovative platform which is set to transform the way users earn income online.</p>
<p>For early investors, the news about TaskChain’s presale launch is another exciting opportunity to be part of a new Web3 platform’s journey.</p>
<p>With a vision to empower individuals worldwide, TaskChain combines Web3 technology with GameFi features with the ultimate goal of creating a virtual space where everyone can easily find diverse opportunities for extra income as they collaborate with others.</p>
<p><div class="embed"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zFy5hOhYZAw?showinfo=0"></iframe></div></p>
<h2>What is TaskChain’s Mission</h2>
<p>At its core, TaskChain champions the financial inclusion of the masses through fun and user-friendly Web3 features. The platform has the potential to level the playing field, especially for low-income regions, thanks to the Quests, digital jobs, or one-time gigs that users can take on to earn cryptocurrency rewards on the platform.</p>
<p>Each “Quest” fulfillment is supported by video game mechanics with plans to introduce VR/AR features into the platform for a more immersive experience for users in the future.</p>
<p>Simply put, each “Quest” on TaskChain’s “Quest2Earn” feature breaks down everyday tasks into a game-like experience where users who fulfill these tasks get to earn XP points as they level up and collect rewards.</p>
<p>The rewards are paid in TaskChain’s native token called $TASKC.</p>
<p>In contrast to other similar platforms, TaskChain stands out as a true pioneer in the Web3 space.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional microtask platforms, TaskChain&#8217;s Quest2Earn feature brings the thrill of gaming to real-life tasks, making the earning process enjoyable. By providing a wide range of Quests and Quest2Earn functions tailored to individual preferences, TaskChain ensures that everyone, regardless of their background or location, can participate and earn rewards.</p>
<p>This inclusive approach empowers users from all walks of life to access valuable income opportunities and take charge of their financial futures.</p>
<h2>How TaskChain works</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Quest2Earn is at the heart of TaskChain&#8217;s platform. Inspired by popular video game quests, Quest2Earn offers a dynamic and engaging earning experience, allowing users to boost their income, regardless of their location or skills.</p>
<p>Quest2Earn presents a wide array of exciting quests, each tailored to individual interests and categorized into various themes such as shopping, traveling, learning, trading, events, etc. By completing these and many other tasks within these quests, users not only earn cryptocurrency rewards but also gain experience (XP) points to level up and unlock milestone rewards, making the earning process enjoyable and rewarding.</p>
<p>Tom Klein, CEO of TaskChain, said;</p>
<p>&#8220;TaskChain&#8217;s Quest2Earn is a game-changer, transforming mundane tasks into exciting opportunities to earn income while having fun. We believe in providing diverse earning opportunities for our users and creating a vibrant community where collaboration and support thrive.&#8221;</p>

<h2>TaskChain Presale</h2>
<p>TaskChain is set for kick-off with a listing price of $0.011 per TASKC token. With a current beta-stage price set at $0.004 per token, the 175% price difference marks the first phase of the presale. Early investors can participate in funding the project in an earlier price tranche.</p>
<p>TaskChain has confirmed it has successfully passed a full security audit and KYC, providing extra security for investors.</p>
<p>There is also a massive <a href="https://www.taskchain.co/giveaway" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">giveaway</a> of $120,000 in rewards for presale participants to spice up involvement in the presale.</p>
<h2>$TASKC Token</h2>
<p>$TASKC ERC20 token, the lifeblood of TaskChain, is built on the most popular Ethereum Blockchain, which will provide transparency, security, and fast payouts with valuable rewards.</p>
<p>With a total supply of 4 billion $TASKC tokens, scarcity, and value are baked into $TASKC’s design, the presale will give investors a chance to grab a share of 2.8 billion tokens spread across all the 11 exclusive stages.</p>
<h2>About TaskChain:</h2>
