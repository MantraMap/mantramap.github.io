The SHIB community can expect an immersive experience, featuring presentations, demonstrations, and discussions that will reshape the future of Shiba Inu&#8217;s decentralized finance and governance. The highlight of these events will undoubtedly be the introduction of Shibarium, the highly anticipated cornerstone of Shiba Inu&#8217;s ecosystem. Shibarium aims to push the boundaries of scaling Ethereum, providing innovative solutions for the Shiba Inu community. The long-awaited L2 holds immense potential for revolutionizing the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Remarkably, the event is not only about Shibarium. As part of the events, all SHIB-branded projects will be unveiled, showcasing the project&#8217;s commitment to building a diverse and vibrant ecosystem.

At press time, SHIB was trading at $0.00000758 and has risen around 3% since the publication of Kusama&#8217;s blog post. This puts the SHIB price on the verge of a possible breakout from the downtrend channel that has been in place since early February. A significant rise above $0.000008 towards the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level ($0.00000831) and a subsequent breakout above this resistance is needed to avoid a fakeout.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is captivating the attention of the crypto community with its ongoing price surge. The recent inclusion of BCH on EDX, a Citadel Securities-backed crypto exchange, has sparked fresh interest in this digital asset.  As investors eagerly monitor its progress, the price of BCH on CoinGecko stands at $291.80, showcasing a 24-hour rally of nearly 7% and an impressive seven-day surge of 27.5%. Source: Coingecko The overall bullish sentiment in the crypto market has contributed to the positive trajectory of BCH. As cryptocurrencies gain mainstream acceptance and adoption, investors are seeking alternatives beyond the traditional giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and BCH has emerged as a viable contender. However, the question on everyone&#8217;s mind is whether Bitcoin Cash can sustain its current bullish streak. BCH Whales Pause Buying Spree Amidst Price Surge While the recent listing on EDX has undoubtedly played a part in this rally, on-chain data reveals an intriguing aspect of the price surge. A cluster of Bitcoin Cash whales holding significant amounts of 1 million to 10 million coins has emerged as a pivotal player in driving last month’s rally. Source: Santiment Between June 21 and June 30, these BCH whales accumulated 170,000 coins, which amounted to approximately $52.4 million in value. Their substantial purchases had a significant impact on the asset&#8217;s price, as whales possess substantial financial power and strategic influence on other investors. When whales buy more coins, it often leads to an increase in the asset&#8217;s price. Related Reading: Recent 800 Billion Shiba Inu Dump Has Short Traders Worried – Here’s Why However, an interesting development emerged in July. The same cluster of BCH whales, who were actively accumulating coins during the June rally, has conspicuously paused their buying spree. Specifically, between July 1 and July 4, their total BCH balances remained relatively stable, hovering around 1.51 million coins. BCH market cap currently at $5.6 billion. Chart: TradingView.com The Future Trajectory Of Bitcoin Cash The whales&#8217; decision to halt their buying activity raises questions about the current market sentiment surrounding Bitcoin Cash. Are these whales taking a cautious approach, waiting to assess the market before making further moves? Or does their pause indicate a temporary lull in the BCH price surge? Related Reading: Dwindling Optimism (OP) Value May Be A Result Of This Factor Understanding the behavior of large-scale investors such as whales is essential in predicting market trends. Their actions often influence the sentiments and decisions of other traders and investors. The temporary pause in their buying activity could potentially impact the short-term price dynamics of Bitcoin Cash. As the market eagerly watches Bitcoin Cash, the question arises as to whether the recent price surge can be sustained without the continued support of these influential whales. The coming weeks will shed light on the market&#8217;s overall sentiment and the role these whales will play in shaping the future trajectory of Bitcoin Cash.

					<description><![CDATA[Shiba Inu (SHIB) recently faced a major token dump of epic proportions, with a whopping 800 billion SHIB tokens being thrown into the market. But what caused this massive sell-off and what does it mean for the future of Shiba Inu? This major token offloading extravaganza went down on Binance alone, with traders ditching their SHIB for USDT. The Buying Selling View indicator revealed that this frenzy took place from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. UTC. To understand the degree of the situation, let&#8217;s delve into the factors behind this recent market movement and explore the potential consequences for both short-term traders and long-term SHIB investors. What SHIB Offloading Means For Short-Term Traders When a massive token offloading event like the recent SHIB dump occurs, it creates a ripple effect that can have significant implications, especially for short-term sellers aiming for quick gains.  Related Reading: Dwindling Optimism (OP) Value May Be A Result Of This Factor Token dumps often result in increased market volatility, causing sudden price drops and erratic fluctuations. For short-term traders, this can be both a bane and boon. On one hand, volatility presents opportunities for quick profits if they time their trades well. On the other hand, it also raises the risk of unexpected losses if the market turns against their positions. Source: TradingView Massive offloading events tend to put downward pressure on the token&#8217;s price. The increased supply flooding the market can lead to price depreciation, which may discourage short-term traders from entering or maintaining their positions. This, in turn, can impact the overall trading sentiment and make it harder for traders to secure favorable gains. Related Reading: Lido (LDO) Sustains Weekly Run With 16% Gain – What Fuels It? Source: Coingecko As per CoinGecko, the price of SHIB currently stands at $0.00000743, reflecting a decline of 3.4% over the past 24 hours. However, despite this recent dip, SHIB has managed to rally by 2.8% over the course of the past seven days. SHIB market cap currently at $4.3 billion. Chart: TradingView.com SHIB Ecosystem Token&#8217;s Impressive Rally  Meanwhile, amidst all the action, Shiba Inu&#8217;s ecosystem token, Bone, experienced an astounding rally of over 25% in the past 14 days, delivering substantial returns to investors in the third quarter of 2023. This surge propelled the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price to surpass the $1 mark. However, after reaching a peak of $1.09, the price of Bone entered a correction phase and has been struggling to regain momentum on the charts. $BONE it’s time for $2-$3 serious pep talk pic.twitter.com/1MQgUHnXCw — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) July 3, 2023 LucieSHIB, a marketing specialist for Shiba Inu, recently took to Twitter and expressed optimism by stating that it&#8217;s time for Bone&#8217;s price to target the $2 to $3 range. While it remains to be seen whether Lucie&#8217;s prediction will come to fruition, only time will provide the answer to this intriguing question.

<p>Massive offloading events tend to put downward pressure on the token&#8217;s price. The increased supply flooding the market can lead to price depreciation, which may discourage short-term traders from entering or maintaining their positions. This, in turn, can impact the overall trading sentiment and make it harder for traders to secure favorable gains.</p>

<h2><strong>SHIB Ecosystem Token&#8217;s Impressive Rally </strong></h2>
<p>Meanwhile, amidst all the action, Shiba Inu&#8217;s ecosystem token, Bone, experienced an <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bone-shibaswap" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">astounding rally</a> of over 25% in the past 14 days, delivering substantial returns to investors in the third quarter of 2023.

					<description><![CDATA[Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network has begun the process of swapping altcoins for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The recent court approval (June 30) granted the company permission to convert its altcoin holdings into the two leading digital assets, raising concerns about a potential sell-off of popular altcoins. Celsius Network, known for its altcoin lending services, has been undergoing bankruptcy proceedings since July 2022 when it filed for Chapter 11 protection, revealing liabilities of up to $10 billion. The recent court ruling allows Celsius to convert its altcoins into BTC and ETH starting from July 1. LINK, AAVE And SNX Sell-Off Due To Celsius Coming? According to on-chain analysis provider Lookonchain, Celsius has been actively transferring altcoins to different wallets. Most of the altcoins have been moved to wallet address &#8220;0x4131&#8221;. Remarkably, Celsius made its first swap today. Lookonchain tweeted: Note that Celsius seems to be starting to swap altcoins for BTC and ETH. Currently: Most of the altcoins have been transferred to wallet&#8221;0x4131&#8243;. Transferred 1,393 StaFi( $rETH) to Wintermute Trading and received 1,393 $ETH.  The altcoins held by Celsius Network amount to approximately $164.5 million on the EVM chain, including: 3.16 million LINK ($19.9 million) 98,268 AAVE ($7.36 million) 2.9 million SNX ($6.2 million) 7.95 million TGBP ($5.49 million) 1,812 PAXG ($3.45 million) 12.650 BNB ($3.02 million) 3.841 million MATIC ($2.65 million) 419,899 UNI ($2.27 million) 9.25 million ZRX (2.00 million) In addition to the above, Celsius Network&#8217;s wallets also contain around $296 million worth of Bitcoin, $120 million worth of Ethereum, and approximately $100 million (in paper value) of its native token CEL. Yesterday, data from Arkham Intelligence revealed that Celsius moved around $70 million worth of altcoins and stablecoins to different wallets, including those related to crypto market maker Wintermute, crypto custodian Fireblocks, and stablecoin issuer Paxos. Related Reading: Blame The “Supermoon” If Bitcoin Crashes Or Rallies Towards $35,000 In July Today&#8217;s first swap of altcoins to Ethereum by Celsius Network raises concerns that the movements to new addresses was just the preparation for a potential sell-off for the aforementioned altcoins. LINK, AAVE and SNX could face a dump if Celsius sells these altcoins in one go, but the prices of MATIC, UNI, ZRX and BNB could also see a negative impact. It&#8217;s worth noting that while the court approval allows Celsius to convert altcoins into BTC and ETH, the exact details and timeline of the conversion process remain unclear. It is uncertain whether Celsius plans to sell all of its altcoins and in what proportion it intends to acquire BTC and ETH. Traders and investors holding the aforementioned altcoins should closely monitor market developments and prepare for possible market turbulence.

Earlier in the week, the LINK price was rejected at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. A dump of Celsius could put the price in danger of falling again to the lower end of the trading range. LINK marines should therefore closely monitor the addresses by the bankrupt crypto lender. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If historical Bitcoin price performance leads, one trader is adamant that the coin is at a critical inflection point at spot rates. Based on astronomical patterns and moon arrangement, trading desk QCP Capital believes Bitcoin prices can swing higher in a bull run towards the $33,000 to $35,000 level, reversing following sharp losses in 2022. Conversely, after a recovery that has seen Bitcoin price rally 20% from mid-June 2023, there can be a contraction that may see the coin dip after an impressive performance in the past few trading weeks. Supermoons Coincide With Key Bitcoin Price Reversals Based on technical and fundamental actions, the trading desk cited the past performance of Bitcoin at different cyclical stages. For instance, when Bitcoin fell in the early days of 2020, primarily due to fears of the far-reaching consequences of lockdowns brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, it posted a 161% rally from early March to May 2020. The same was observed from mid-June to August 2022 when Bitcoin, at the depth of the last cyclical bear market, prices soared 43%. Marking peaks, Bitcoin corrected from the end of April to June 2021, falling 51% in a predominantly bullish market. According to the trading desk, major reversals in bearish and bullish runs occurred during a &#8220;supermoon.&#8221; In astrology, a supermoon is a full moon that forms when the moon is at its closest point to the Earth in its elliptical orbit. The moon appears brighter than usual during this time and happens only once or twice a year. A supermoon formed on July 4, and the trader believes Bitcoin is at a critical reaction point. Related Reading: AAVE Records 26% Weekly Gain, Looks To Break Key Resistance For years, there has been a belief that supermoons correlate with bullish markets. However, no scientific findings support this, and neither have statistical correlations. Still, based on the trader&#8217;s analysis, the multiple correlations and timing of peaks and bottoms of Bitcoin prices during supermoons can be used to predict BTC markets. Will Prices Rally Or Dump? While it is yet to be seen whether BTC will edge higher, breaking above $31,300 and rally towards the $35,000 zone, the trading desk says fundamental factors will play a critical role and remains bullish that BTC may rally to within the $33,000 to $35,000 liquidation zone. Overall, monitoring how the Federal Reserve of the United States will implement its monetary policies will be necessary in the future. Although inflation has been dropping, the trader observes that it has not fallen low enough to warrant a rate cut. Rate cuts tend to move the capital to store-of-value assets from which Bitcoin will likely benefit.  Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Will Reach $100, Here’s Why On a more pessimistic side, the trading desk expresses caution saying BTC has strong resistance at spot levels since the recent leg up was most likely the fifth and the last wave from November 2022 lows. At the same time, the $33,000 to $35,000 resistance zone is a critical resistance trend line. For this reason, any dump may see BTC retest the $24,000 and $26,000 support zone.

					<description><![CDATA[The Shiba Inu community continues to mark new milestones with its testnet, Shibarium, as a steady surge of users links their crypto wallets to the network. Shibarium&#8217;s testnet, also known as Puppynet, launched on March 11 and has seen an increase in overall transaction count over the past 24 hours. Shibarium added almost a million transactions in a single day, catapulting past the 27 million mark and setting a new record. On June 13, a peak of 324,000 transactions was recorded, after which it slightly decreased over the following days. However, since June 19, the daily transactions have hovered around the 274,000 mark. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Records Surge In Daily New Addresses In Q2: A Sign Of Growing Interest? Consistent Growth In Wallet Links And Blocks Alongside transaction growth, the number of wallets linked to Shibarium continues to rise, albeit slower, according to Puppyscan data. The current count of linked wallets is over 17 million, with no substantial spikes recorded recently. The total blocks have increased to surpass 1.56 million, and the time required to create a new block has been reduced to 8.3 seconds. Notably, the community anticipates the official launch of Shibarium&#8217;s mainnet, with excitement fueled by a statement from the lead developer of Shiba Inu and Shibarium, the elusive Shytoshi Kusama. The developer informed the SHIB army about the planned &#8220;launch strategy&#8221; for Shibarium, noting that the date and time have been confirmed. The community speculates that the Shibarium mainnet could be launched between August 13 and 16 in Toronto, Canada, during the annual ETHToronto event. This event celebrates the creation of Ethereum, and given SHIB&#8217;s original launch on this blockchain, the community believes it would serve as a fitting tribute to Ethereum and its founder, Vitalik Buterin. Awaiting The Launch Of Shibarium Mainnet Kusama recently dropped a hint in a Telegram channel solely for Shibarium discussions, possibly confirming the theory regarding the mainnet&#8217;s launch date and location. Before this, he disclosed that Shiba Inu was &#8220;going somewhere&#8221; and clarified that this location would be outside the United States.

					<description><![CDATA[The total Bitcoin Options open interest, the number of open call and put orders, recently rose to $14.87 billion on June 30 before falling to $10.74 billion on July 4, on-chain data on July 5 shows. Related Reading: Valkyrie Follows In BlackRock’s Footsteps, Refiles For Spot Bitcoin ETF At $14.87 billion, the total number of Bitcoin Options open interest at top trading platforms, mostly Deribit, CME, and OKX, stood at near all-time highs registered in October 2021 when prices went on to rally, printing all-time highs of over $69,000. On October 21, the total Bitcoin open interest stood at $15.06 billion, a record high that has never been broken. BTC Options At Near 2021 Peaks Many traders seem optimistic about the future of Bitcoin, as open interest remains high and trending near the peak levels of October 2021. With a strong close to the first half of 2023, the expectation is for prices to continue rising. The recent surge in Bitcoin prices, reaching new highs in June 2023 at $31,300, could be seen as a sign of overall bullishness, similar to the period before prices reached over $69,000 in November 2021. This skew and apparent optimism can be shown by the distribution of &#8220;call&#8221; and &#8220;put&#8221; Bitcoin options across major crypto derivatives trading platforms of which Deribit dominates. For instance, as of July 5, over 65% of all Bitcoin options orders are &#8220;calls,&#8221; meaning more traders expect prices to rise from spot rates. At this level, roughly 206,000 BTC orders are placed as &#8220;calls.&#8221;  Meanwhile, a minority of traders expect price contracts from spot rates towards $28,300 or lower in the coming months. About 99,000 BTC options have been placed as &#8220;puts&#8221; to align with traders&#8217; expectations of worse prices in the coming months. Bitcoin Traders Bullish The same can be observed in trading patterns over the past 24 hours. Despite Bitcoin prices falling 2% but staying above the $30,000 psychological level, most options traders are bullish since there are more &#8220;calls&#8221; than &#8220;puts.&#8221;  Typically, Options give the contract holder the right or the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at an agreed price on or before the expiry date. Mostly, options contracted are used by traders to mitigate risks. More &#8220;calls&#8221; could mean more BTC traders are optimistic, expecting the coin to clear recent resistance levels. Based on recent trends, Options trading volumes have been decreasing on Deribit. After peaking at $3.29 billion on October 16, 2021, participation levels have been shrinking over the past 20 months.  Related Reading: Crypto Market Trade Volume Hits Lowest Point Since 2020 Amid Market Turbulence Trading was suppressed throughout 2022 during the bear market, which saw Bitcoin drop below $16,000 in November 2022.
