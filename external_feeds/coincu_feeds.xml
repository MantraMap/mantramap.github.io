<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cryptocurrency exchange Binance experienced massive outflows, causing concern in the community.</em></li>



<li><em>However, the majority of the bitcoin transfers were internal transfers, not outflows.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance is implementing measures to improve withdrawal efficiency, including enabling Bitcoin Lightning Network withdrawals.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin community was buzzing with speculation and concern over the massive outflows from Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, on May 8.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Why-Massive-Bitcoin-Outflows-Could-Spell-Opportunity-For-Investors.jpeg"><img decoding="async" width="602" height="656" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Why-Massive-Bitcoin-Outflows-Could-Spell-Opportunity-For-Investors.jpeg" alt="Why Massive Bitcoin Outflows Could Spell Opportunity For Investors" class="wp-image-186056" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Why-Massive-Bitcoin-Outflows-Could-Spell-Opportunity-For-Investors.jpeg 602w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Why-Massive-Bitcoin-Outflows-Could-Spell-Opportunity-For-Investors-275x300.jpeg 275w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" title="Why Massive Bitcoin Outflows Could Spell Opportunity For Investors? 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The outflows were initially thought to be significant, but it later turned out that the majority of the transfers were not outflows but rather internal transfers to newly created change addresses belonging to Binance. Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, revealed that the effective outflows were a much smaller figure, most likely around 10,100 bitcoin.</p>



<p>Many people were initially alarmed by Moreno&#8217;s tweet, which revealed two large transactions of 117,000 and 40,000 bitcoin. However, Moreno later clarified that these were internal Binance transfers to change addresses, rather than withdrawals by users. This revelation helped to alleviate concerns surrounding the cryptocurrency exchange&#8217;s stability and security.</p>



<p>After the incident, Binance confirmed in a series of tweets that bitcoin withdrawals had resumed on their platform after a temporary suspension. The exchange stated that it was processing pending transactions by replacing them with higher transaction fees to ensure faster completion. Additionally, Binance revealed plans to adjust fees to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future and expressed a commitment to monitoring on-chain activity and making necessary adjustments as required.</p>



<p>To further address concerns and improve withdrawal efficiency, Binance announced that its team is working on enabling Bitcoin Lightning Network withdrawals. The Lightning Network is a second-layer protocol that allows for faster and cheaper off-chain transactions. This development will help in alleviating withdrawal congestion during high-demand periods, which is a common issue with many cryptocurrency exchanges. The incident highlighted the importance of transparency and communication in the cryptocurrency industry and the need for exchanges to proactively address concerns and improve their services.</p>

<p>Bitcoin and gold have both seen significant gains in recent months as investors bet on the Federal Reserve, reducing the pace of interest rate rises.</p>



<p>Recent banking sector instability has also pushed up the value of these assets, causing some market experts to believe that Bitcoin may, in fact, live up to its &#8220;digital gold&#8221; promise and compete with gold for safe-haven asset status.</p>



<p>Investors who expect a protracted increase in both of these assets may now earn higher returns by combining both exposures in a single instrument.</p>



<p>The effort is one of the most recent initiatives among crypto sector businesses to deliver consistent profits amid moments of macroeconomic turmoil. It attempts to expose investors to gold and digital assets, both of which keep their worth.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We strive to offer high-end bespoke services to our clients, always balancing performance and risk management in the most efficient ways. This hybrid asset product is a perfect fit for investors that have experience in traditional assets such as gold and are now starting to dip their toes into digital assets,” OrBit Markets said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tether&#8217;s derivative product, XAUT, is a gold-backed token. When the product reaches maturity, it will be paid in either USDT, XAUT, or bitcoin, as determined by OrBit. According to the Singapore-based corporation, hybrid products, such as those that blend equities and commodities assets, are widespread in conventional finance.</p>



<p>MEV Capital, a DeFi-focused asset management firm, utilized OrBit markets-issued options contracts in March to hedge liquidity providers&#8217; positions and avoid losses in Uniswap (v3) liquidity pools.</p>

Earlier, federal prosecutors in Manhattan said Bankman-Fried stole billions of dollars in FTX customers&#8217; funds to cover losses at Alameda, purchase real estate, and make political contributions through a straw donation scheme illegal. They also accused him of bribing Chinese officials.</p>



<p>FTX quickly exploded following a series of customer withdrawals after it was reported that it had mixed assets with Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried&#8217;s crypto-focused hedge fund.</p>



<p>The SBF has faced a series of criminal charges from US prosecutors. In addition, his three powerful assistants &#8211; former co-CEO Alameda Caroline Ellison, former FTX chief technology officer Gary Wang and former FTX technical director Nishad Singh &#8211; all pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.</p>

<p>However, Sam, who is believed to be the mastermind of FTX and Alameda Research&#8217;s fraud scheme of the century, only admitted that FTX had inadequate risk management but denied 13 counts of fraud and conspiracy related involved in theft and non-transparency with customer funds and sought to stay away from the day-to-day operations of FTX.</p>



<p>Prosecutors have until May 29 to respond to Bankman-Fried&#8217;s motion to dismiss, and US District Judge Lewis Kaplan will hear arguments on June 15.</p>



<p>SBF has also been released on bail for $250 million from his parents and has been held at his parents&#8217; home since he was arrested in December in the Bahamas, where he lived and where FTX&#8217;s headquarters are located. He was extradited to the United States just over a week after his arrest. SBF was also banned from using technology after prosecutors warned him against having access to witnesses.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Paxful Bitcoin exchange has reopened after more than a month of closure.</em></li>



<li><em>In early April, Paxful announced a temporary shutdown when two founders, Artur Schaback and Ray Youssef, went to court to gain control of the company.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Peer-to-peer (P2P) bitcoin exchange Paxful is back up and running after being down for more than a month, the company said in an <a href="https://paxful.com/vi/sign-up-transition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official blog</a> post.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-284.png"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="480" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-284.png" alt="Paxful Bitcoin Exchange Is Back In Action After Over 1 Month Of Closure" class="wp-image-186033" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-284.png 1000w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-284-300x144.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-284-768x369.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-284-750x360.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Paxful Bitcoin Exchange Is Back In Action After Over 1 Month Of Closure 12"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;After a month away, we&#8217;re happy to announce that the Paxful marketplace is back online.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As mentioned in previous Coincu News articles, the largest P2P exchange, Paxful, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/179139-paxful-co-founders-fight-control-company/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suddenly closed</a> due to a battle for control of the company by the two co-founders when they accused each other of the case.</p>



<p>Many former employees have corroborated reports that their relationship had been troubled for a while and that the business had suffered a severe decline in management professionalism.</p>



<p>According to Schaback, Paxful is currently owned by a supervisor who is also a director of Paxful. In the lawsuit, Schabeck said a large amount of the company&#8217;s bitcoin was transferred to an entity other than a legitimate software company in Turkey called &#8220;EMiR.&#8221;</p>



<p>A formerly operated company by Paxful called Dekslektika, based in St. Petersburg, Russia, is a purported subcontractor allegedly receiving funds from EMiR. According to court documents, these organizations are accused of being responsible for &#8220;significant non-traditional transactions&#8221; that began shortly after Schaback&#8217;s access to the company&#8217;s operations was restricted.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-285.png"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="533" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-285.png" alt="Paxful Bitcoin Exchange Is Back In Action After Over 1 Month Of Closure" class="wp-image-186034" title="Paxful Bitcoin Exchange Is Back In Action After Over 1 Month Of Closure 13"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Youssef, who was charged, stated that the accusations related to Schaback&#8217;s refusal to pay a Turkish engineering business that was hired by this company, which caused the whole team of 80 engineers to cease working. Youssef said that keeping Schaback at the company was impossible since his team was about to quit.</p>



<p>During the suspension, the Paxful wallet remains completely open to users, and users can also choose from several peer-to-peer platforms to continue trading.</p>



<p>Due to the litigation brought by co-founder Artur Schaback, who is suing Youssef and the business for, among other things, wrongful termination, CEO Ray Youssef voiced worry over the security of customer assets.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Voyager updated that it now owns assets worth $ 1.334 billion, or 75.68% of the total assets customers claim.</em></li>



<li><em>Users can choose to make an initial withdrawal over two options either in crypto via the Voyager platform or wait until after the crypto withdrawal period to receive their initial withdrawal in USD.</em></li>



<li><em>Previously, the platform&#8217;s Unsecured Creditors Committee (UCC) <a href="https://news.coincu.com/185831-voyager-supports-users-to-transfer-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated </a>that when the platform reopens, account holders can only transfer their cryptocurrencies from the platform.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Voyager has released an <a href="https://www.investvoyager.com/blog/update-on-initial-recoveries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">important update</a> on the customer&#8217;s initial recovery on the official blog. According to the article, users can choose one of two recovery options provided by the platform.</strong></h5>



<p>This platform currently owns assets worth $ 1.334 billion, or 75.68% of the total assets that customers claim against Voyager. Due to inevitable delays, the customer will receive an initial recovery estimated at 35.72% of the requested amount.</p>

<p>Customers may receive additional recoveries in the future, subject to the resolution of the FTX/Alameda priority claim dispute, the success of additional claims made by the Voyager package administrator for third parties, and the recovery of Voyager&#8217;s assets as a creditor in the future liquidation of Three Arrows Capital. Subsequent payments may be made in cash or cryptocurrency at the Program Administrator&#8217;s discretion.</p>



<p>Users can choose to make an initial withdrawal in crypto through the Voyager platform or wait until after the crypto withdrawal period to receive their initial withdrawal in USD.</p>



<p>Once the Voyager app becomes accessible, users will have 30 days to log in and transfer supported cryptocurrencies from their account to the specified wallet address. Some crypto tokens do not support (i.e. non-transferable cryptocurrency from the Travel platform), and VGX holders will receive a prorated portion of USDC, which can then be transferred from the platform. The user requires no action to receive only the initial withdrawal in USD.</p>

<p>After the 30-day crypto withdrawal window ends, the user&#8217;s account will be liquidated, and the user will receive USD by check or can withdraw ACH. Once the plan is rolled out, Voyager will provide more information on the next steps, including when to open the 30-day window.</p>



<p>In addition, Voyager has filed liquidation proceedings with the bankruptcy court and will open the platform as soon as possible after the liquidation proceedings are approved. The crypto transfer window will close 30 days after this platform reopens.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>High fees associated with Bitcoin transactions in El Salvador can pose financial challenges for everyday users, particularly in a country where the average monthly salary is around $300-350.</em></li>



<li><em>The adoption of the Lightning Network, a second-layer protocol, could enable faster, cheaper, and more private Bitcoin transactions in El Salvador.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In El Salvador, Bitcoin cash withdrawals can cost up to $20 in fees, making transactions less accessible to everyday users.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-275.png"><img decoding="async" width="722" height="617" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-275.png" alt="Bitcoin Transactions In El Salvador: Pay $20 Fees To Cash Out $100" class="wp-image-186000" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-275.png 722w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-275-300x256.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" title="Bitcoin Transactions In El Salvador: Pay $20 Fees To Cash Out $100 23"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In 2021, El Salvador made history by becoming the first country to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender. While some have praised this move as a bold step towards financial inclusion, others have raised concerns about the potential risks of using a volatile and relatively untested cryptocurrency in everyday transactions.</p>



<p>One of the main issues that has arisen is the high fees associated with using Bitcoin for everyday transactions. For instance, in El Salvador, cash withdrawals via Bitcoin can cost up to $20 in fees, a significant expense in a country where the average monthly salary is around $300-350.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m in El Salvador <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1f8-1f1fb.png" alt="🇸🇻" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> right now.

</div></figure>



<p>High fees can make Bitcoin transactions less accessible and appealing to everyday users, especially those needing the most affordable and reliable financial services. This is a particular concern in El Salvador, where many households rely on remittances from overseas, and there is a large unbanked population.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-276.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-276-1024x576.png" alt="Bitcoin Transactions In El Salvador: Pay $20 Fees To Cash Out $100" class="wp-image-186001" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-276-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-276-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-276-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-276-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-276.png 1066w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bitcoin Transactions In El Salvador: Pay $20 Fees To Cash Out $100 24"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>To address this issue, some advocates have suggested the adoption of the Lightning Network, a second-layer protocol that enables faster, cheaper, and more private Bitcoin transactions. The Lightning Network creates a network of payment channels between users, allowing them to transact with each other without broadcasting every transaction to the blockchain.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The problem is Chivo, needs onchain for final settlement but I agree why not just use a lightning wallet maybe this will give everyone pause to think about their pay structure in the future</p>&mdash; Jason<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Hanna (@Zanshinstunts) <a href="https://twitter.com/Zanshinstunts/status/1655579730144362497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 8, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>There are indications that the Lightning Network is gaining ground in El Salvador, with some businesses and individuals reportedly using it to transact with Bitcoin. However, much more work is needed to promote its adoption and ensure it is accessible and user-friendly for everyday users.</p>

<p>Bittrex Inc. has filed for bankruptcy in Delaware following allegations from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the crypto platform violated securities rules for years. </p>



<p>The SEC accused Bittrex of breaking its rules from 2017 through 2022 while generating at least $1.3 billion in revenue. The SEC noted that Bittrex acted as a brokerage, exchange, and clearing agency at times but did not register with the regulator. </p>

<p>Bittrex listed assets and liabilities of up to $1 billion each in its Chapter 11 petition.

Bittrex released a statement disputing the allegations.</p>

<p>Bittrex&#8217;s top creditor in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy is the Office of Foreign Asset Control U.S department, to which the exchange agreed to pay $25 million to settle charges of violating sanctions and AML regulations.</p>

<p>The bankruptcy filing marks a significant setback for Bittrex and its users. The platform had gained a reputation as one of the most reliable and secure exchanges in the crypto space. The development highlights the need for increased regulation and oversight in the industry to protect users from unscrupulous actors. </p>



<p>It also serves as a reminder that investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before investing in any crypto-related project or platform.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Bank of Canada has launched a public consultation on a prospective CBDC.</em></li>



<li><em>In response to the fall in actual currency transactions, the central bank has been experimenting with the notion for many years.</em></li>



<li><em>The federal government, not the central bank, makes the decision on whether to establish a CBDC.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Bank of Canada <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2023/05/bank-canada-launches-public-consultations-digital-dollar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> a public consultation on a prospective central bank digital currency (CBDC), or digital Canadian dollar, on Monday. The CBDC consultation period will end on June 19.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-270.png"><img decoding="async" width="780" height="439" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-270.png" alt="Canada Launches Cbdc Consultation To Look At Positive Potentials Versus Cash" class="wp-image-185977" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-270.png 780w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-270-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-270-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-270-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" title="Canada Launches CBDC Consultation To Look At Positive Potentials Versus Cash 33"></a></figure></div>


<p>Participants will be able to voice their opinions on the attributes of the Canadian digital currency via the consultation website.</p>



<p>Although the central bank does not consider that a retail CBDC is now required, Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“As Canada’s central bank, we want to make sure everyone can always take part in our country’s economy. That means being ready for whatever the future holds.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Although the fall of cash has accelerated in certain areas owing to the COVID-19 epidemic, central banks throughout the globe are researching digital versions of their currencies in order to avoid leaving digital payments to the private sector.</p>



<p>China has been a forerunner in the development of CBDC, however, adoption is still in its early phases. Japan&#8217;s, Brazil&#8217;s, and Australia&#8217;s central banks have also made moves toward establishing a digital token.</p>



<p>US policymakers are split, with Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller among the naysayers.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-269.png"><img decoding="async" width="810" height="524" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-269.png" alt="Canada Launches Cbdc Consultation To Look At Positive Potentials Versus Cash" class="wp-image-185976" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-269.png 810w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-269-300x194.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-269-768x497.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-269-750x485.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" title="Canada Launches CBDC Consultation To Look At Positive Potentials Versus Cash 34"></a></figure></div>


<p>The other is about preserving monetary autonomy. Being a neighbor to the US, there is a possibility that it will be dollarized, whether through a CBDC or a US dollar stablecoin. While the United States was not specifically stated, the risk of a cryptocurrency or foreign CBDC being extensively utilized inside Canada, perhaps affecting its financial stability, was raised. This has been a source of worry for some time.</p>



<p>The federal government, not the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/153720-bank-of-canada-indicates-regulatory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bank of Canada</a>, makes the choice on whether to introduce a CBDC. Nonetheless, the Fed has been setting the foundation in case Canada approves the plan.</p>



<p>The concept of CBDCs is not without debate. Several commercial banks are concerned that the option to hold digital money directly at the central bank may reduce the value of commercial bank deposits. Last year, the Canadian Bankers Association issued a warning regarding CBDCs, claiming that they may undercut commercial bank financing and reduce financial system competitiveness.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Estonia has reduced the number of registered crypto companies by 80% after enacting a new regulation to combat money laundering.</em></li>



<li><em>The corporations themselves revoked almost 200 licenses.</em></li>



<li><em>The Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing Prevention Act is contentious legislation.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to the report <a href="https://fiu.ee/en/news/100-active-authorisations-estonia-providing-virtual-asset-services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> on Monday by the country&#8217;s money-laundering agency, contentious crypto legislation has cut the number of registered enterprises in Estonia by roughly 80%.</strong></h5>

<p>Over 200 licenses were revoked by the enterprises themselves, and a similar number were denied by the country&#8217;s Financial Intelligence Unit, which has been tasked with enforcing a 2022 rule requiring corporations to maintain substantial cash reserves and actual ties to Estonia.</p>



<p>According to a study issued by the country&#8217;s money laundering authority, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), the validity of 389 authorizations has expired, and there are just 100 current authorizations for virtual asset service providers.</p>



<p>The Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing Prevention Act is contentious legislation. The law&#8217;s amendments went into effect on March 15, 2022.</p>



<p>Individuals were assigned to management boards without their knowledge or with fraudulent qualifications, according to applications. According to the FIU, documentation was often similar amongst multiple corporations since many of them had employed the same cluster of legal and professional service firms.</p>



<p>Estonia, home of digital unicorns such as Wise, Bolt, and Skype, has also worked to rehabilitate its image after a scandal involving the laundering of Russian cash via the Tallinn branch of Danske Bank.</p>



<p>Being a member of the European Union, the nation will soon be required to apply the bloc&#8217;s <a href="https://news.coincu.com/182777-eu-finally-approves-mica/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Markets in Crypto Assets</a> law, which would necessitate the licensing of wallet providers and exchanges.</p>



<p>The documents submitted by firms that lost their authorization show that the legislator&#8217;s response with regard to the amendments to the Act, and the supervision activities both before and after the amendments, have been relevant, according to Matis Mäeker, Director of the FIU.</p>



<p>In order to rebuild its image, the FIU has strengthened its money laundering regulations and made it mandatory for cryptocurrency enterprises to reapply for licensing. While renewing authorizations, the regulator stated it saw instances that would startle any supervisor.</p>
