<p>Brazil&#8217;s central bank has granted Mercado Bitcoin, the country&#8217;s prominent cryptocurrency exchange, a payment provider license on June 2. This milestone paves the way for the introduction of MB Pay, the exchange&#8217;s new fintech solution.The license enables users to access digital banking services using crypto assets held on the exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the approval from the central bank, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/128776-mercado-bitcoin-brazilian-regulator/">Mercado Bitcoin</a> aims to enhance its services and expand its business further. According to Roberto Dagnoni, CEO of 2TM, the parent company of Mercado Bitcoin, the approval from the central bank is a crucial step in providing improved services to their customers.</p>



<p>As a licensed payment institution, MB Pay will offer Brazilian users access to various digital banking services utilizing crypto assets held on the exchange. This includes features like investing in digital fixed income, staking, and other financial transactions. Moreover, users can anticipate the introduction of a debit card that allows seamless conversion of cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>In a strategic move, Mercado Bitcoin recently partnered with traditional local broker Guide Investimentos to tap into the digital asset market. While the launch of Mercado Bitcoin&#8217;s fintech solution was delayed due to the approval process, this development showcases the exchange&#8217;s commitment to expanding its offerings.</p>



<p>The demand for digital solutions in Brazil, coupled with its large population of nearly 214 million, has attracted crypto firms to the country. Binance, a global cryptocurrency exchange, has recognized Brazil as one of its top markets. Additionally, Coinbase has been actively expanding its operations in Brazil since March, collaborating with local payment providers to facilitate crypto purchases, deposits, and withdrawals in the local currency.</p>



<p>Alongside Mercado Bitcoin, other licensed payment providers in Brazil&#8217;s crypto industry include Crypto.com and Bitso. With the crypto market gaining momentum in Brazil, these developments highlight the increasing adoption of digital assets and the growing opportunities in the country&#8217;s financial landscape.</p>

<p>This move comes after new legislation permitting Japanese trust banks to issue stablecoins came into effect recently. The Progmat Coin solution, developed by MUFG, enables stablecoin issuance by multiple trust banks, expanding its scope beyond the bank itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By leveraging blockchain interoperability startup DataChain&#8217;s technology, MUFG aims to facilitate cross-chain swaps, payments, and lending across public blockchains, such as Ethereum, Avalanche, Cosmos, and Polygon. This interoperability can enable seamless settlements of transactions involving different blockchain-based assets, including NFT purchases settled with Progmat Coin on a different blockchain.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the Progmat platform not only supports stablecoins but also security and utility tokens. As part of its evolution, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/120276-animoca-brands-japans-supported-by-mufg/">MUFG</a> is transforming Progmat into a joint venture with support from prominent financial institutions like JPX, Mizuho, SMBC, and SBI, in addition to backing from Japan&#8217;s main stock exchange operator.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1-1-4.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="870" height="550" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1-1-4.jpeg" alt="MUFG To Issue Bank-Backed Stablecoins On Multiple Blockchains Using Progmat Coin Solution" class="wp-image-192040" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1-1-4.jpeg 870w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1-1-4-300x190.jpeg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1-1-4-768x486.jpeg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1-1-4-750x474.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" title="MUFG To Issue Bank-Backed Stablecoins On Multiple Blockchains Using Progmat Coin Solution 7"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The core platform of Progmat utilizes R3&#8217;s Corda enterprise blockchain, known for its robustness and scalability. DataChain, which collaborates with MUFG, employs Cosmos&#8217; Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, allowing seamless interoperability between different blockchains. In fact, DataChain&#8217;s technology, known as Hyperledger YUI Lab, has been open sourced, promoting further innovation in the blockchain ecosystem.</p>



<p>To strengthen its offering, MUFG has also partnered with JCB, Japan&#8217;s leading card company akin to Visa, expanding the potential use cases and applications of its blockchain-based solutions.</p>



<p>The adoption of Progmat Coin and the collaboration with DataChain signify MUFG&#8217;s commitment to advancing blockchain technology in the financial sector, while the support from various stakeholders highlights the growing interest and potential of blockchain-based solutions in Japan&#8217;s financial landscape.</p>

<p>According to SlowMist, given that the official website has just undergone a big version change, it might be a supply chain assault (hackers tamper with the software source code on the server for ordinary users to download).</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We have received reports of wallets being compromised. We are doing all we can to investigate and analyse the situation. As we have more information, we will share it accordingly,&#8221; the team said on Twitter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Atomic Wallet is a decentralized wallet that will store all the private keys of the wallets completely internally on the user&#8217;s device, which will be much more beneficial than hosting directly on the server, which will help reduce the risk of being attacked.</p>



<p>It is developed and can work perfectly on multiple platforms, from computers to mobile devices, even Windows, macOS, Android, and Linux. This flexible compatibility will make transferring and receiving assets faster and more flexible.</p>



<p>A multi-purpose wallet like Atomic Wallet helps users simplify the process of managing, synchronizing, and using their digital assets in a very flexible way besides a variety of Web3 wallet applications such as Metamask, Trust Wallet, or other wallets.</p>

<p>Atomic Wallet users have complete control over their private keys, which are often encrypted and saved on their devices, providing them full custody of their cash. In terms of security, the wallet has earned a reputation in the cryptocurrency market since no security breaches have been reported. Atomic Wallet needs users to provide their passwords in order to approve any transactions.</p>



<p>Users may retrieve their accounts using a 12-word backup seed phrase created at random when they initially set up their Atomic wallets. Despite the fact that the wallet&#8217;s programming code is not accessible for peer review (it is not open-source), the platform provides users with tools for securing their wallets. One such site emphasizes the significance of using a Virtual Private Network to access the wallet (VPN). A VPN is a network that provides privacy and anonymity by converting a public network into a private network.</p>



<p>Atomic Wallet is at the forefront of privacy and anonymity. To access money kept in the wallet, no verification or KYC norms are required. This increases the risk of being compromised by malicious actors.</p>



<p>Although the wallet does not create a new address for each transaction and does not support coinjoin, transactions are completely anonymous. A wallet must support transaction anonymization techniques in order to allow coinjoin transactions.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s look at what this implies for the world of NFTs and how it streamlines the process of migrating NFT collectors to the Bitcoin network. But first, we have to explore the concept of BRC-721.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is the BRC-721 token standard?</h2>



<p>The BRC-721 token is a token standard for NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on the Bitcoin network, derived from BRC-20 (a token standard for fungible tokens). Each BRC-721 token contains a specific and non-replaceable identifier (Identifier inscription).</p>



<p>The inscription ID will be produced in numerical sequence from 1 to max (max is the maximum value of an NFT Collection&#8217;s entire supply).</p>



<p>The BRC-20 and BRC-721 vary in the following ways:</p>



<ul>
<li>BRC-721 is used for Non-Fungible Token (NFT), whereas BRC-20 is used for Fungible Token.</li>



<li>Upgrade: The BRC-721 meets the BRC-20 standards, with token identification and functionality handled by a JSON file.</li>



<li>BRC-20 requires users to mint a transfer subscription in order to send a transaction, resulting in higher transaction costs and more data kept on the Bitcoin network.</li>



<li>The BRC-721 standard uses serialization through ID inscription to convey transactions, lowering costs and minimizing the amount of data stored on the network.</li>
</ul>



<p>In summary, BRC-20 and BRC-721 both have their own advantages and disadvantages. Users need to learn carefully before deciding which token to use for their purposes on the Bitcoin blockchain platform.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-204.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-204.png" alt="Will New BRC-721E Token Standard Make A Revolution For Bitcoin Network?" class="wp-image-192018" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-204.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-204-300x100.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-204-768x256.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-204-750x250.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Will New BRC-721E Token Standard Make A Revolution For Bitcoin Network? 15"></a></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is the BRC-721E token standard?</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://news.coincu.com/190882-ordinals-market-and-bitcoin-miladys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BRC-721E token standard</a> is a game-changing technology that allows Ethereum-based ERC-721 projects to smoothly migrate to the Bitcoin network. The ERC-721 token is sent to a burn address, after which the NFT is inscribed into the Bitcoin network. After the bridging is finished, the NFT and its associated information will be viewable on the ordinals.market website.</p>



<p>The new blockchain token standard BRC-721E enables traders to convert their Ethereum-based NFTs into Bitcoin-based NFTs. This allows traders to easily migrate across blockchain platforms.</p>



<p>This token standard is supposed to be the link between the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks, enabling traders to exchange their ERC-721 NFTs for BRC-721E tokens on the Bitcoin network.</p>



<p>According to the Ordinals Market website, holders of Ethereum NFTs may burn them and copy them to a satoshi on the Bitcoin network. After copying, tokens will show complete information on Ordinals Market&#8217;s custom collection page.</p>



<p>It should be noted, however, that although the new standard permits ERC-721 NFTs to be converted into NFTs Ordinals, the original information will not be maintained on the blockchain. Ordinals Market provides a variety of previewing choices on the NFT blockchain, which may be shown in wallets or on existing markets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Migrating NFT from Ethereum to Bitcoin</h2>



<p>The migration path of an ERC-721 NFT starts with the burning process, which is performed through an ETH call function. This irreversible technique creates a one-of-a-kind inscription on the blockchain.</p>



<p>The user must inscribe correct BRC-721E data to validate the ETH burn on the Bitcoin network. After successful completion, the transmitted NFT appears on a customized Ordinals marketplace collection page with extensive metadata.</p>



<p>Indexers, who act as diligent gatekeepers, analyze the burnt NFT&#8217;s etched data. This stringent validation guarantees that each token has just one valid inscription and that the genesis address matches the burn transaction call data.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-205.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="724" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-205.png" alt="Will New BRC-721E Token Standard Make A Revolution For Bitcoin Network?" class="wp-image-192021" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-205.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-205-300x212.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-205-768x543.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-205-120x86.png 120w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-205-750x530.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Will New BRC-721E Token Standard Make A Revolution For Bitcoin Network? 16"></a></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Benefits of BRC-721E</h2>



<p>Earlier, collectors had difficulties transferring NFTs to Bitcoin owing to the high learning curve needed. The BRC-721E token standard, on the other hand, has significantly simplified this procedure. Users may now move their digital assets from Ethereum to Bitcoin with ease, providing new chances for NFT collectors.</p>



<p>BRC-721E is open to many projects that can make NFT ERC-721 to Bitcoin transition programs at a cheaper cost helping to boost existing projects. From there, the number of NFTs on Bitcoin becomes richer and increases the liquidity value.</p>



<p>Bitcoin is one of the first cryptocurrencies in the crypto market, so any developments on Bitcoin always attract the interest of users. However, the Bitcoin ecosystem is a new concept and in development, so the ability to implement features and standards on the Bitcoin network is still in its infancy.</p>



<p>To develop the Bitcoin ecosystem in the future, the implementation of token standards is essential first. This will provide a foundation for Bitcoin to build new applications and services, which in turn will open up many opportunities for users and developers in the crypto community.</p>



<p>The appearance of BRC-721 has provided a more secure solution for transactions and eliminated traditional and small transaction methods like BRC-20. Therefore, the BRC-721E will also follow this development momentum.</p>



<p>BRC-721E will bring many benefits to the Bitcoin ecosystem, especially in increasing the amount of NFT transactions on the network. This will contribute to the development of the Bitcoin NFT ecosystem in the future.</p>



<p>According to data from <a href="https://dune.com/dataalways/ordinals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dune Analytics</a>, the number of inscriptions on the Ordinals protocol surpassed 10 million, which is a significant increase from the 3 million recorded in the first week of May. </p>



<p>The Bitcoin network has also climbed to second place on the NFT session trading chart by network volume, according to data from CryptoSlam, surpassing Solana and second only to Ethereum. This growth is significant, considering that the Ordinal protocol has only been around since January. </p>



<p>Such high-volume transactions originally stressed the Bitcoin network, resulting in congestion and delays in transaction processing. About 500,000 transactions were left for confirmation at one time, sparking suspicion of a possible network assault.</p>



<p>Although weekly inscriptions have decreased in recent weeks as compared to the first half of May, the launch of the BRC-721E token standard is anticipated to revitalize the Bitcoin NFT market. As the onboarding process gets simpler and more streamlined, more collectors will be encouraged to investigate Bitcoin NFTs. Projects such as Taproot Wizards are already gaining popularity among Bitcoin NFT fans.</p>



<p>Bitcoin NFTs have advanced significantly with the introduction of the BRC-721E token standard. This move makes it easier for ERC-721 projects to migrate to the Bitcoin network and demonstrates Bitcoin&#8217;s rising prominence in the NFT sector. We should anticipate an inflow of collectors to embrace Bitcoin NFTs as the process becomes more user-friendly, boosting innovation and development in this interesting field.</p>



<p>The Ordinals market attests to the fact that the basic principles of the BRC-721E standard, along with the adaptability of indexers, provide the protocol with the potential to expand and adapt over time, even if the information is not originally maintained on-chain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>The smart combination of BRC-20 and Ordinals has opened up new avenues for token minting on the Bitcoin blockchain, resulting in the development of a slew of popular BRC-20 tokens among the thriving crypto community.</p>



<p>The groundbreaking BRC-721E standard is a big step forward in blockchain art transactions, building a strong bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In the DeFi market, liquidity is a must and a high priority. Taking this into consideration, iZUMi Finance is a DeFi initiative that focuses on supplying liquidity and maximizing its usage efficiency.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-115.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-115.png" alt="iZUMi Finance Review: Liquidity Support Solution On Uniswap v3" class="wp-image-191713" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-115.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-115-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-115-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-115-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="iZUMi Finance Review: Liquidity Support Solution On Uniswap v3 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>So, what exactly is iZUMi? What are the project&#8217;s standout outcomes? Let&#8217;s discover more about the project&#8217;s IZI token with Coincu.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is iZUMi?</h2>



<p>iZUMi Finance is a programmable LaaS platform built on top of Uniswap V3 and its built-in multi-chain DEX. In addition, iZUMi Finance presents novel liquidity mining procedures for successfully attracting liquidity by giving incentives within certain price ranges.</p>



<p>iZUMi Finance plans to extend its services to additional chains in the future, including DEX and Bridge connectivity. It will assist liquidity providers in earning more liquidity mining awards and trading fees on Uniswap V3.</p>



<p>iZUMi Finance uses Uniswap V3 to provide &#8220;Liquidity as a Service &#8211; LaaS&#8221; to tackle two problems: incentive inefficiency and pool 2 dilemma.</p>



<p>Moreover, it is the first effort to increase incentive efficiency by enabling &#8220;heterogeneous&#8221; Uniswap V3 liquidity mining and allowing protocols to apportion incentive payments across the broadest price ranges.</p>



<p>iZUMi overcomes the &#8220;pool 2 dilemma&#8221; by offering structured and auto-recovery incentive modules that may draw additional liquidity while maintaining a low emission rate for the protocol, while also permitting non-permanent liquidity mining for liquidity providers.</p>



<p>The iZUMi platform creates solutions with a focus on improving liquidity, such as iZiSwap, which allows users to trade tokens and participate in liquidity programs with LiquidBoxâ¦</p>



<p>On the other hand, this successful and long-term helps procedures attract additional liquidity. iZUMi Finance believes that all tokens in the cryptocurrency market need more liquidity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Highlights</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New DL-AMM Model</strong></h3>



<p>According to iZiSwap, the novel Discretized-Liquidity-AMM (DL-AMM) model outperforms the classic AMM model by 5,000 times (using the equation x*y=k).</p>



<p>The centralized liquidity element of the Uniswap V3 curve model is carried over to the DL-AMM. However, unlike Uniswap V3, DL-AMM divides the price curve into specific price points (as illustrated below), enabling liquidity to be supplied at any given price rather than a range.</p>



<p>As a consequence, users on iZiSwap may trade tokens swiftly and accurately, reducing slippage and avoiding front-run.</p>



<p>The DL-AMM model has the following advantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Improves price predictability and transaction transparency by providing precise pricing.</li>



<li>Allows traders to establish preferred price ranges and smoothly move between AMM and Limit Order interfaces while trading with Limit Orders.</li>



<li>Improve capital efficiency by using price point-based centralized liquidity discretization.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Various forms of liquidity provision</strong></h3>



<p>While engaging in liquidity mining schemes, LiquidBox gives consumers many alternatives, including the three types listed below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed Range: A centralized liquidity provider for stablecoin and pegged-asset pairings.</li>



<li>LiquidBox will immediately stake the UniSwap V3 NFT LP Token into the protocol after providing liquidity. This increases the predicted profit for users since they benefit from both the advantages of supplying liquidity from iZUMi and the protocol, as well as a portion of the income from transaction fees on Uniswap V3 (if the token price is still within the price range that LP set).</li>



<li>When LP provides liquidity, the liquidity portion of the stablecoin or pegged asset is placed at the established price range, and the project token portion is staked in the LiquidBox module (not on Uniswap V3) to lock in liquidity, preventing the token from being sold automatically when the price breaks out of the set range. Helps consumers minimize the danger of temporary loss while lowering the project&#8217;s reliance on passive token sales.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Other benefits</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Farm safely: Maintain your ideals in Uniswap. Decentralized and non-custodial in nature.</li>



<li>Simple to use: With a single click, you may deposit, zap, harvest, and withdraw.</li>



<li>Earning a high APR: Stake to earn LP fees and other benefits for taking part in liquidity mining.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Services providing liquidity of iZUMi Finance</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>LaaS on Uniswap V3: LiquidBox</strong></h3>



<p>iZUMi Finance&#8217;s LiquidBox enables Uniswap v3 LP NFT to Programmable Liquidity Miners (LM), enabling protocols to precisely and effectively distribute incentives within certain price ranges, which may improve liquidity distribution and incentivize users to stake Uniswap V3 LP to earn greater rewards.</p>



<p>LiquidBox participants include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Liquidity Provider (LP): While providing liquidity on Uniswap V3, LPs will get NFT LP tokens reflecting their holdings, which they may put in iZUMi.<br>Protocols may actively specify the range for LP token payouts while participating in LiquidBox&#8217;s liquidity mining program.</li>



<li>LiquidBox will automatically decide if the LP&#8217;s NFT LP token value range is inside the protocol&#8217;s range. If this is the case, LPs will be compensated with LP tokens as compensation for providing liquidity.</li>
</ul>



<p>LPs get an extra portion of the income from Uniswap V3 transaction fees, depending on the kind of liquidity provision.</p>



<p>Its LiquidBox technique is comparable to names like Tokemak or Mercurial in that the project transforms itself into a location to concentrate and pour liquidity where it is required. Exchanges, lending platforms, AMM, and other ventures may benefit from the ultimate liquidity.</p>



<p>To better comprehend LiquiBox, we will conduct a preliminary investigation into its mechanism of action, which will include the following steps:</p>



<ul>
<li>Step 1: Projects will contact iZUMi Finance to seek $10,000 in liquidity and offer certain details, such as the price range of liquidity provision, the date of the event, and the number of tokens utilized to provide incentives.</li>



<li>Step 2: If the pool is successful, iZUMi Finance will deploy it on its platform.</li>



<li>Step 3: On Uniswap V3, the user supplies liquidity and gets an NFT reflecting that liquidity.</li>



<li>Step 4: The user will enter the NFT into the iZUMi Finance protocol.</li>



<li>Step 5: The protocol examines the price at which users give liquidity on Uniswap V3 and adjusts if the price is out of range.</li>
</ul>



<p>That is the aim, and here is how LiquidBox implements a liquidity bootstrap event for a token that is launching a native token first.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Separate liquidity AMM across multiple chains: iZiSwap</strong></h3>



<p>iZiSwap was originally implemented on the BNB Chain network and is what iZUMi Finance refers to as a Discretized &#8211; Liquidity &#8211; AMM with the capacity to provide about 5000 times greater capital efficiency than typical AMM models utilizing the formula x * y = k.</p>



<p>In essence, Discretized &#8211; Liquidity &#8211; AMM is a comparable AMM to what Uniswap V3 accomplished, however, instead of Uniswap V3, LPs set price ranges to supply liquidity using iZiSwap. Then, similar to Trader Joe&#8217;s Liquidity Book, the LPs will supply liquidity at predetermined prices.</p>



<p>Uniswap V3 and other centralized liquidity services should be extended across numerous chains. To boost capital efficiency across several chains, iZiSwap will allow limited orders and be compatible with orderbook and Uniswap V3.</p>



<p>iZiSwap has the following features:</p>



<ul>
<li>Swap: Immediate transactions at precise prices, without slippage or front-running.</li>



<li>Limit Order: A limit order is an order to exchange tokens at a certain price.</li>



<li>Pro Trading: With the Pro Trading interface, iZiSwap delivers a CEX-like trading experience, letting users make orders to buy and sell tokens on the order book (Order-book).</li>



<li>Liquidity: Provides centralized liquidity in a price range and is rewarded with trading fees.</li>



<li>Campaign: Participate in iZiSwap events to get incentives.</li>



<li>Analytics: This page gives an overview of iZiSwap statistics, such as TVL, trading volume, liquidity pool, top tokens, transaction details, and so on.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Centralized liquidity service on the bridge: C-AMM Bridge</strong></h3>



<p>Cross-chain bridges that are fast, decentralized, and self-balancing are critical in the multi-chain age.</p>



<p>The C-AMM Bridge from iZUMi will execute cross-chain transactions in under a minute and with reduced gas expenses. Multi-confirmation relay networks, which are decentralized and entirely transparent, will assure cross-chain security.</p>



<p>The following are the main characteristics of the iZUMi C-AMM Bridge:</p>



<ul>
<li>Cross-chain liquidity swap: The user experience will be similar to contributing USDC to ChainA&#8217;s reserve pool and then getting USDC from ChainB&#8217;s reserve pool. It should be emphasized that the transmitted USDC is not a bridge-wrapped token but rather a legally issued token.</li>



<li>Multi-validator Relay Network: The data in each block is read by several validators on the Relay Network. When they discover transactions related to the reserve pool on either side of the bridge, they vote to establish a consensus and then transmit the multisig transaction to the other side.</li>



<li>Concentrated-liquidity AMM</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The iZUMi Bond (iUSD)</strong></h3>



<p>The iZUMi Bond (or iUSD, iZUMi Bond USD) is a 100% collateral and project revenue-backed bond issued by iZUMi Finance.</p>



<p>The iUSD is tied to the USD at a 1:1 ratio.</p>



<p>In a private financing round, iZUMi Finance offers iUSDs to investors in order to raise cash for the future growth of the iZUMi ecosystem.</p>



<p>Uzumi Finance is the pioneer in the issuance of convertible bonds in the form of stablecoins. The principle of operation is relatively simple: users will pay ETH or BIT to purchase iZUMi Finance bonds in the form of iUSD stablecoins, which will subsequently be converted into the project&#8217;s native token IZI at a discount of IZI.</p>



<p>Uzumi Finance collaborates with the Solv Protocol project to create stablecoin convertible bonds.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Impermanent Loss (IL) Insurance</strong></h3>



<p>The Uzumi Finance platform, when combined with derivative protocols, may assist LPs in avoiding Impermant Loss while providing liquidity on the AMM protocols that the project supports.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dual Currency Product</strong></h3>



<p>This is a tool that assists consumers in maximizing their earnings both now and in the future if the market is in a strong rise.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fixed Income Product</strong></h3>



<p>iZUMi Finance may pay a set APR of up to 10% within 30 days for investors by engaging in fascinating DeFi activities such as lending and borrowing, trading, farming, staking, and so on.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>veiZi</strong></h3>



<p>veiZi (iZUMi DAO veNFT) is iZUMi Finance&#8217;s governance token in the form of an NFT that adheres to the ERC-721 standard.</p>



<p>veiZi may be used to do the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Voting: Take part in voting on governance issues in the iZUMi DAO.</li>



<li>Staking: 50% of iZUMi&#8217;s monthly earnings will be utilized to redeem IZI tokens and distribute them as staking incentives to veiZi holders.</li>



<li>Boosting: Holding veiZi is seen as a kind of NFT staking on LiquidBox, which boosts the APR of pools by up to 2.5 times.</li>
</ul>



<p>Users must lock IZI tokens for a certain length of time in order to mint veiZi (at least 7 days and maximum 4 years). The more veiZi you get, the longer the IZI lock time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>iZUMi Finance is the first protocol to offer Uniswap V3 liquidity mining, allowing multi-chain users to benefit from centralized liquidity services.</p>



<p>We are certain that the IZI token is a suitable long-term investment since iZUMi Finance answers existing issues with Uniswap v3. In addition to supporting one of the most prominent DEXs in the crypto market, the iZi token has other utility properties, making it a good investment.</p>



<p>One thing to keep in mind is that ve-iZi tokens are neither marketable nor transferable and can only be gained by staking iZi tokens, with ve-iZi acquired coins equaling the staked iZi tokens. This eventually improves the iZi tokens&#8217; long-term worth since users are motivated to stake them and enjoy the benefit that comes with the ve-iZi token.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>As Bitcoin reclaims $27,000, market participants will closely monitor its price action and key levels to gauge the strength of the current bullish momentum.</em></li>



<li><em>In May, the United States experienced a higher-than-expected unemployment rate of 3.7%, surpassing the forecasted 3.5%.</em></li>



<li><em>At $30,000, perhaps investors need to be more patient.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin price posted steady at $27,000, alongside the recent move by the United States that left investors wondering.</strong></h5>

<p>On Friday, Bitcoin was severely jolted by an unexpectedly good employment report, as well as a week&#8217;s worth of shock and commotion about the United States debt limit, end-game negotiations, and renewal fears.</p>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/191902-bloomberg-strategist-warning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> originally displayed positive momentum around the $27,200 mark, but a reversal occurred with the announcement of solid US non-farm payroll numbers, forcing it to fall below $27,000.</p>



<p>The most valuable cryptocurrency in terms of market value was recently trading at over $27,180.</p>

<p>This rising rise has spurred hope and discussion regarding BTC&#8217;s likely future trajectory.</p>



<p>Market players will carefully follow Bitcoin&#8217;s price behavior and key levels as it reclaims this critical level to measure the strength of the current bullish trend.</p>



<p>Ether was recently trading for a little more than $1,900. The second biggest cryptocurrency has spent most of the previous seven days below this level as ETH investors dealt with macroeconomic headwinds as well.</p>

<p>Markets rose after the Labor Department reported that the economy created 339,000 jobs in May, or 75% more than experts predicted and much more than the 294,000 jobs gained in April.</p>



<p>The hot jobs statistics provided the most recent indication that the labor market remains tight, indicating that the economy isn&#8217;t finished growing and that inflation will remain a problem. But, a May unemployment rate of 3.7%, higher than the expected 3.5%, provided a more encouraging figure that the US Federal Reserve may use to justify a pause in its steady diet of interest rate rises.</p>



<p>Over longer periods, bitcoin has created a descending triangle pattern, which often heralds a breakout.</p>



<p>If Bitcoin, on the other hand, succeeds in breaking over $27,500, the next goal may be around $28,200. If the price falls, the $26,500 level is a good place to purchase. At $30,000, maybe we need to wait for a better signal.</p>



<p>To make educated selections in bitcoin trading, it is essential to remain up to speed on the newest market trends and price changes.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>With around 1,400 machines installed in May, there was a notable rise in net crypto ATMs installations.</em></li>



<li><em>The overall number of crypto ATMs fell throughout the first four months of 2023.</em></li>



<li><em>Coinhub Bitcoin ATMs has announced ambitions to extend the quality of its Bitcoin ATM network to all major cities in the United States.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>After 4 months of seeing a decrease in the number of Bitcoin and <a href="https://news.coincu.com/185525-uks-fca-control-of-crypto-atms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crypto ATMs</a>, this past May has recorded a positive increase.</strong></h5>

<p>Over the first four months of 2023, the total number of crypto ATMs decreased steadily. At this time, the number of net crypto ATMs globally fell by 5,850. Yet, according to <a href="https://coinatmradar.com/charts/net-growth/?__cf_chl_tk=mkhwMXYdq_tjuZF0P8o1Mu6yrz7b9YR14k__RW.zlEs-1685776236-0-gaNycGzNDVA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coin ATM Radar</a> data, 1,397 machines were added back to the worldwide crypto ATM network in May.</p>



<p>Although large economies like as the United States and Europe contributed to the decline, Australia, Poland, and Spain increased crypto ATM installations in their respective areas.</p>



<p>Crypto ATMs, also known as Bitcoin ATMs, are electronic kiosks where consumers may perform financial transactions, however they are built for cryptocurrency rather than cash. According to the research company How Many Bitcoin ATMs, there are around 63,000 of these crypto ATMs in the United States. If you&#8217;ve ever contemplated using one, here&#8217;s what you should know about them.</p>



<p>Although Bitcoin ATMs do not contribute to the expansion of the Bitcoin network, they do act as a physical gateway for users to exchange fiat currency for crypto. Australia deployed a total of 233 ATMs in 2023, propelling it to the third-largest crypto ATM hub in the world.</p>

<p>Worldcoin&#8217;s key features, including its retina-scanning device and token offering, despite raising unsettling ethical and financial questions, but there are also crypto traders excited about the event.</p>

<p>Altman&#8217;s creative concept is creating a lot of buzz and spreading swiftly on social media. Hundreds of thousands of users have already performed the compulsory iris scan to become part of Worldcoin, indicating that the launch of Worldcoin is gaining traction among crypto traders and investors. With Worldcoin, the goal is to create a worldwide system for identification in order to launch the cryptocurrency of the same name.</p>



<p>Interest has also increased in the previous 90 days, according to Google Trends statistics. After a high in May 2023, news about Worldcoin&#8217;s future development might pique interest even further.</p>



<p>Worldcoin&#8217;s creators promote the project as the world&#8217;s biggest identification and financial network. The token will be released this year. The Worldcoin has been under testing since 2022 and will be formally introduced in the summer. Another significant milestone was the recent Series C investment.</p>



<p>Participants must scan their irises using a little gadget called an Orb to participate in the study. The scan records the so-called global ID, which acts as an identification for each person. This allows people to be distinguished from one another. To entice users to utilize the World App, they are given free WLD tokens when they scan their iris. The app presently claims to have 1.7 million users. The initiative is searching for global partners that want to install orbs in shopping malls, colleges, and other public spaces. These partner firms are well compensated for their efforts.</p>



<p>The crypto project Worldcoin completed the introduction of a crypto wallet in May 2023, which was the next phase in the program. The World App is a one-of-a-kind wallet that concentrates on a few important characteristics of Worldcoin and Ethereum. This emphasis was selected to make it simple and comfortable to use &#8211; Worldcoin should be targeted at everyone, not just crypto geeks.</p>



<p>At the same time, Worldcoin has already formed many alliances with well-known crypto firms and protocols. To facilitate nicer ERC-20 transfers, World App Wallets employ ENS usernames for peer-to-peer payments. The Uniswap protocol is used for token trading. Anyone worldwide may access a fully collateralized stablecoin at any moment using Circle&#8217;s USDC. Deposits and withdrawals are completed without difficulty by licensed partners such as MoonPay. Polygon is currently running the beta version.</p>

<p>The Worldcoin creator wants to provide free money for everyone in order to compensate for the potential consequences of artificial intelligence in the workplace. Yet, Sam Altman&#8217;s initiative is the subject of heated debate and widespread criticism. So even complete eye and facial scans present problems.</p>



<p>Worldcoin employs &#8220;World ID,&#8221; a digital identification that confirms you are a genuine and unique individual while completely preserving your privacy via the use of a novel cryptographic technique known as zero-knowledge proofs.</p>



<p>Although the emergence of AI has several potential advantages, recent improvements make it impossible to discern between AI and humans on the internet, and humans may soon find themselves at a significant disadvantage.</p>



<p>Because of the massive quantities of funds and growing awareness, investors should continue to follow the growth of Worldcoin. Since, despite the reasonable criticism, the project may just become too huge to ignore.</p>

<p>On June 2, the crypto community on Twitter published a video about the Uniswap conference, the biggest DEX in Ethereum today, which took place in May.</p>



<p>The meeting billed itself as &#8220;The first Uniswap Asian Summit,&#8221; with a special appearance by the &#8220;CEO of Uniswap.&#8221;</p>



<p>The intricate degree of the impersonation scheme is shown not only in the magnificent size and backdrop of the video conference but also in the fact that the persons behind it built up a website for the Chinese Uniswap community, posted articles in Mandarin, and directed users to the DEX. In addition, additional high-ranking people, such as the chief technology officer, chief operating officer, chief finance officer, and so on, take part in community exchanges.</p>



<p>Not content with that, the conference also included a video AMA with Uniswap&#8217;s CEO, who presented himself as &#8220;Mike Hanlon&#8221; and is presently the &#8220;Global Director of Uniswap Community.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hayden Adams, the true founder of Uniswap, quickly moved to Twitter to disavow any affiliation with the conference and warn the community about scammers imitating the organization.</p>



<p>It is unknown why the aforementioned Uniswap imitation conference could take place in China, which has prohibited cryptocurrencies since 2021. Yet, it demonstrates the members&#8217; audacity. To entice naive investors, fraud might be used.</p>



<p>Others claim that the meeting was hosted in Hong Kong and then invited Chinese guests.</p>

<p>Celebrity imitation frauds are still a concern in the crypto sector, with the most prevalent being the method of hacking huge project accounts to publish fake messages or shill spam initiatives.</p>



<p>According to others, <a href="https://twitter.com/thegrasscrown/status/1664818593299828736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this is not a new method</a> but has been used many times by Chinese whales to dump coins like FIL or OP on novices.</p>



<p>The crypto investing fever is returning to Asia, with the Hong Kong government beginning to accept operational licenses from crypto businesses on June 1 and allowing investors to purchase and sell digital assets.
