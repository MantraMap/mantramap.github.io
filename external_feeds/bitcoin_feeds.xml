<h2>&#8216;BRICS Currency Has a Real Prospect of Becoming Global Currency&#8217;</h2>
<p>Economist Alexis Habiyaremye discussed the challenges a common BRICS currency could pose to the U.S. dollar’s global reserve currency status in an interview with Putnik, published Saturday. Habiyaremye is a senior researcher who works for the South African Research Chair in Industrial Development at the University of Johannesburg, South Africa. He holds a Ph.D. in Economics and Policy Studies of Technical Change from the United Nations University/Maastricht University (UNU-MERIT).</p>
<p>Citing the &#8220;disproportionate advantage that the dollar enjoyed in the international monetary system,&#8221; the economist described: &#8220;This exorbitant privilege ensures that other countries end up financing the U.S. deficit because the U.S. federal reserve can simply print money, while other countries have to produce goods and services to have access to the dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is an increasing trend among countries to reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar and instead prioritize the use of their national currencies for trade settlements. One notable initiative in this regard is being undertaken by the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). The economic bloc is considering a proposal to establish a shared currency that would decrease member countries&#8217; dependence on the USD. Commenting on the challenges a common BRICS currency could pose to the U.S. dollar, Habiyaremye detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Introducing a new currency, if it were to be used effectively and systematically for all trade transactions between BRICS countries, would alleviate the burden on these countries to finance the exorbitant privilege.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Because of the extraterritoriality of U.S. law for all parts of the world where the U.S. dollar is used, using a different currency would also enable these countries to avoid the arbitrary imposition of U.S. laws on their territories,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>The economist noted that the BRICS countries&#8217; economic power has already surpassed that of Group of Seven (G7) countries in terms of purchasing power parity. He opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>In terms of economic weight, the BRICS currency has a real prospect of becoming a global currency if members commit to increasing trade exchange between themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>“In terms of economic output, BRICS nations have the potential of producing most commodities and manufactured products needed in their international trade,” he added.</p>
<p>However, the economist cautioned that &#8220;as long as each individual country continues privileging its trade exchanges with the U.S. (or its monetary allies) for historical or political reasons, the BRICS currency will only remain an empty rhetoric.&#8221;</p>

<p>Habiyaremye clarified that creating a new currency for BRICS countries would require political will from the leaders of these countries and enough trade between them to make the currency economically viable.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not enough to want to wean oneself from the dollar if the trade flows between the BRICS members or their immediate allies are not enough to support the new currency,&#8221; he stressed. Moreover, the economist pointed out that many BRICS countries currently trade more with the U.S. or with countries that use the U.S. dollar than they do with each other, emphasizing that the strength of a new BRICS currency would depend on these countries trading more with each other.</p>

In order to to “ensure the safety of customer assets,” the securities regulator deems this action as an urgent necessity.</strong></p>
<h2>SEC Files Emergency Motion to Freeze Assets Held by BAM Management US Holdings and BAM Trading Services</h2>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060.4.0.pdf">decisive action</a> on Tuesday by filing an emergency motion. This motion urgently requests a temporary restraining order from the court, aimed at freezing the assets under the control of BAM Management US Holdings and BAM Trading Services. These are the primary operating entities responsible for managing Binance US, a U.S. subsidiary of the prominent cryptocurrency exchange Binance.</p>

<p>In addition, the order explicitly forbids Binance from engaging in any activities that could lead to the destruction, alteration, or concealment of pertinent records. Another <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060.4.1.pdf">court order</a> issued by the SEC further emphasizes that BAM Management or Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the head of Binance, must present compelling reasons to prevent the imposition of a preliminary injunction.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The securities watchdog in the United States maintains that the restraining order is indispensable in safeguarding customer funds. “The SEC respectfully submits that this relief is necessary on an expedited basis to ensure the safety of customer assets,” the SEC filing on Tuesday notes. The action comes in the wake of the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against Binance and CZ, accusing them of running an unregistered exchange, brokerage, and clearing house.</p>

<p>The Tuesday news also comes on the heels of the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against Coinbase, the San Francisco-based exchange. In a similar vein, the SEC has accused Binance of offering unregistered securities and said it purportedly permitted U.S. residents to utilize its global platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the defendants’ years of violative conduct, disregard of the laws of the United States, evasion of regulatory oversight, and open questions about various financial transfers and the custody and control of customer assets,” SEC thinks that the restraining order is necessary. The SEC maintains that the court has the authority to hear this case and to compel the defendants to appear, and that the case should be heard in the district.</p>

<h2>Long-Term Trend Is Away From US Dollar, Says Economist</h2>
<p>Vikram Rai, a senior economist at financial services firm TD, discussed the global de-dollarization trend and currencies that have the potential to diminish the dominance of the U.S. dollar in a note published last week. He specifically mentioned the Chinese yuan, the euro, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as noteworthy challengers.</p>
<p>While stating that the U.S. dollar “remains the dominant and most-used currency,” the economist stressed that “the long-term trend is away from it.” He described:</p>
<blockquote><p>Several countries have shown frustration with the dominance of the dollar and are pursuing alternatives for conducting international trade and cross-border banking.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rai emphasized that the U.S. government’s decision to freeze the foreign currency reserves of the Russian central bank in February 2022 “has motivated some countries to make greater efforts to reduce their dependence on dollars.”</p>
<p>He noted that China has been at the forefront of de-dollarization efforts, adding that the country has pushed to trade crude oil in Chinese yuan and to conduct its trade with Brazil, India, and Russia in the renminbi (RMB) or local currencies. The senior economist explained that “The challenge to the ‘petrodollar’ is significant, both economically and symbolically,” citing that nearly 80% of global oil sales have been priced in U.S. dollars since the 1970s, creating significant demand for the USD.</p>
<p>There are also “other incremental efforts to chip away at the dollar&#8217;s status,” he stressed, mentioning the proposed common <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-leaders-set-to-discuss-common-currency-to-challenge-us-dollar-dominance-in-upcoming-summit/">BRICS currency</a> that is expected to be discussed at the economic bloc’s upcoming leaders’ summit. However, he opined: “A full-fledged currency union between such disparate economies is unlikely to come to pass, but the announcement signals a commitment to conduct more of their trade and finance without dollars.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Yuan, Euro, and Cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>While pointing out that the U.S. dollar is still more widely available and freely convertible than the euro and the Chinese yuan, he identified these two currencies as the primary contenders against the USD. The economist stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The largest challengers to the dollar today are the euro and the RMB.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Chinese yuan faces certain hurdles in its path to potentially replace the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency, he detailed, adding that the yuan “is not freely convertible, nor is it available in great supply outside of China today, making it a challenging choice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rai also believes that digital currencies could chip away at the U.S. dollar’s dominance, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Digital currencies, including central bank digital currencies, are another challenge to the system of dollar dominance. Widespread adoption of other digital currencies could erode the dollar&#8217;s position by removing the need to use it as a vehicle for settling payments.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, he pointed out that the majority of central banks are currently in the early stages of experimenting with central bank digital currencies. Once they complete the initial phases of their work, “We expect several years of work lie ahead in determining the legal and governance framework for central bank digital currencies,” the economist shared.</p>
<p>Moreover, Rai said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Digital platforms, including cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies, may one day offer an alternative.</p></blockquote>
<p>He concluded: “Within the next decade or two, there is great potential for regionally-dominant currencies and a multipolar international regime to emerge, with the roles filled now by the dollar shared with the euro, a more open yuan, future central bank digital currencies, and possibly other options we have yet to see.”</p>

<h2>Sam Altman Says He&#8217;s Not Close Enough to the Worldcoin Project to &#8216;Meaningfully Comment on the Plans&#8217;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Sam Altman holds an esteemed presence in the technology sphere and has performed various roles such as Y Combinator&#8217;s president, Reddit&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/a-new-team-at-reddit">brief CEO tenure</a>, and presently leading Openai, maker of AI-driven chatbot Chatgpt. In 2019, Altman teamed up with Max Novendstern and Alex Bania to establish Tools for Humanity (TFH), the creators behind Worldcoin&#8217;s iris biometric cryptocurrency venture.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://worldcoin.org">Worldcoin</a> envisions multiple objectives like constructing a vast identity and financial framework that supports universal basic income (UBI) principles. Supposedly based on Ethereum, the token project recently introduced its dual services—<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/worldcoin-launches-world-id-an-ai-resistant-iris-dependant-id-protocol/">World ID</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/worldcoin-launches-world-app-to-bolster-decentralized-identity-and-finance-for-mass-adoption/">World App</a>. While World ID claims to provide AI-resistant, iris-dependent identification procedures, the World App focuses on enhancing decentralized identification.</p>

<p dir="ltr">TFH recently acquired $115 million through a Series C financing round headlined by Blockchain Capital. Other participants included Andreessen Horowitz’s A16z crypto branch, Bain Capital Crypto, and Distributed Global. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/VWUhASix9ws?feature=share">video</a> published on Monday, Altman engaged with Dr. Nadav Cohen and others at a Tel Aviv University event discussing AI technology trends. Towards its conclusion, an attendee inquired about Altman&#8217;s &#8220;future plans&#8221; concerning the Worldcoin project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m an investor,” Altman replied to the woman. “I kind of like helped put the company together but I&#8217;m not involved day to day at all. I think it&#8217;s very exciting, I think experimenting with new ways to differentiate between … like to prove humanity in a privacy-preserving way and to think about things like global [universal basic income] and ways to fairly democratize access, is a super great area to explore.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Altman added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">But I&#8217;m not close enough to the company to like meaningfully comment on the plans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite its altruistic goals, Worldcoin has faced criticism. Whistleblower and former NSA contractor Edward Snowden <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iris-scanning-worldcoin-idea-fuels-objections-from-privacy-advocates-snowden-says-dont-catalog-eyeballs/">rebuked the idea</a> of registering eyeballs in October 2021. MIT Technology Review <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/06/1048981/worldcoin-cryptocurrency-biometrics-web3/">called out the project</a> in April 2022 for allegedly deceiving and exploiting third-world country citizens to expand its user base. Furthermore, Techcrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/12/hackers-stole-passwords-of-worldcoin-orb-operators/">reported</a> hackers allegedly compromised some of the Worldcoin scanning orbs administrators&#8217; credentials last month.</p>

Hoskinson commented that the complaint appears to be a component of a larger plan aiming to establish an &#x201C;agenda based [central bank digital currency (CBDC)].&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>Binance Lawsuit Triggers Warning From IOHK&#x2019;s Charles Hoskinson</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles">Charles Hoskinson</a>, co-founder of IOHK (Input Output Hong Kong) and Ethereum, has weighed in on the recent lawsuit against Binance. IOHK is the development team that develops the Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>) network, the world&#x2019;s eighth-largest cryptocurrency project by market capitalization. On Monday, Hoskinson revealed that the complaint appears to be a component of a larger plan to establish increased control over the U.S. financial system.</p>
<p>&#x201C;[The complaint is] over 130 pages, but seems like the next in a series of steps to implement chokepoint 2.0 in the United States,&#x201D; Hoskinson <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1665780536177217537?s=20">tweeted</a>. &#x201C;The end goal is a agenda based CBDC partnered with a handful of massive banks and end-to-end control over every aspect of your financial life.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Hoskinson is not alone in expressing concerns about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) ushering in a new era of totalitarian surveillance capitalism. U.S. Congressman Tom Emmer from Minnesota, for instance, has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmaker-launches-cbdc-anti-surveillance-state-act-to-protect-americans-right-to-financial-privacy/">introduced</a> the Anti-Surveillance State Act &#x201C;to halt efforts of unelected bureaucrats.&#x201D; Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kennedy-jr-government-could-ban-seize-bitcoin-cbdcs-could-lead-to-financial-slavery-political-tyranny/">shares</a> the apprehension that a CBDC could result in financial enslavement and tyranny.</p>

<p>The IOHK executive insisted that the regulatory development highlights a fundamental disagreement questioning the very existence of cryptocurrencies and the core principles they embody. &#x201C;An unelected group of people have decided that concepts like self-sovereign identity, owning your wallet, and the freedom to control your economic agency should be removed from the masses and given to the &#x2018;enlightened&#x2019; few,&#x201D; Hoskinson said.</p>
<p>Hoskinson continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>Honestly, what is happening isn&#x2019;t anything new. It&#x2019;s always the same fight between freedom and authoritarianism just with different players, technology, and words.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, Hoskinson thinks that amidst the challenges, the industry has a chance to unite and establish rational regulations to avert a 1984-like dystopian future for the United States. Despite the obstacles, the IOHK co-founder remains optimistic and he insisted &#x201C;everything&#x2019;s alright and the future is bright for the industry.&#x201D;</p>

<p>In its recent lawsuit against Coinbase and numerous other enforcement instances, the SEC has identified a variety of digital tokens as securities. The Coinbase complaint specified ICP, AXS, CHZ, FLOW, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DASH" target="_blank">DASH</a>, VGX, FIL, NEXO, NEAR, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>, SAND, SOL, and MATIC as unregistered securities. In other enforcement operations, SEC also deemed <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2020/comp-pr2020-338.pdf">XRP</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2019/comp-pr2019-212.pdf">TON</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2021/lr25060.htm">LBC</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-78.pdf">POWR</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-78.pdf">ALGO</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-78.pdf">OMG</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2020/33-10865.pdf">SALT</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-59">TRX</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-59">BTT</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-32">UST</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-32">LUNA</a>, and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2022/comp-pr2022-127.pdf">KROM</a> as securities, among several others.</p>
<p>During his CNBC appearance, Gensler criticized crypto trading platforms saying that they combined multiple functions. &#x201C;These trading platforms, they call themselves exchanges, are commingling a number of functions,&#x201D; the SEC chairman said. &#x201C;In traditional finance, we don&#x2019;t see the New York Stock Exchange also operating a hedge fund making markets.&#x201D;</p>

<h2>Coinbase Says SEC&#x2019;s Enforcement Approach &#x2018;Is Hurting America&#x2019;s Economic Competitiveness&#x2019;</h2>
<p>In contrast, Coinbase&#x2019;s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/06/06/bitcoin-and-ethereum-sag-as-sec-suit-against-coinbase-weighs-on-crypto-market/#">informed</a> Fortune that the SEC&#x2019;s enforcement measures negatively impact the United States. Grewal stated, &#x201C;The SEC&#x2019;s reliance on an enforcement-only approach in the absence of clear rules for the digital asset industry is hurting America&#x2019;s economic competitiveness and companies like Coinbase that have a demonstrated commitment to compliance.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Gensler maintained that SEC&#x2019;s actions serve the American public&#x2019;s interest. &#x201C;The investing public has the benefit of the U.S. securities laws. Crypto should be no different, and these platforms, these intermediaries need to come into compliance,&#x201D; Gensler firmly asserted during the interview.</p>

June 6th, 2023: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unigrid, a pioneering force in the development of a decentralized and anonymous Internet, is excited to announce a significant milestone, a new strategic partnership, and an ambitious market positioning. Unigrid has recently secured a $25 million investment commitment from GEM Digital Limited. Additionally, Unigrid has partnered with WeSendit, the world&#8217;s first file transfer service specializing in anonymous data transfer and decentralized storage solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unigrid is poised to become a formidable European alternative to dominant providers such as Amazon AWS and Google Cloud. Unigrid&#8217;s CTO, Adam Waldenberg, emphasizes the transformative power of blockchain technology in guaranteeing the permanence of information, thereby fundamentally reshaping the cloud industry. Businesses will be able to leverage Unigrid to deliver and store data at significantly lower costs compared to traditional cloud providers like Amazon AWS, resulting in substantial savings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unigrid&#8217;s innovation stems from the underutilized storage capacities found in numerous European data centers. By harnessing their blockchain node technology, Unigrid taps into this vast reservoir, which was previously seen as almost inexhaustible. Their intelligent blockchain application ensures secure data encryption and organization. Unigrid&#8217;s groundbreaking &#8220;plug-and-switch&#8221; approach allows businesses to effortlessly monetize their available storage capacity, particularly during non-peak hours. This approach not only optimizes the use of idle server capacity but also provides an additional revenue stream for businesses. Customers benefit from cost-effective cloud services, and Unigrid envisions significant growth opportunities ahead. Even with a modest 0.1% market share in the global cloud business, CEO Evan Green envisions a turnover potential in the hundreds of millions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The substantial commitment from GEM Digital Limited is a testament to Unigrid&#8217;s potential and the unwavering dedication of its team. It also signifies a strong vote of confidence from a group with a profound understanding of the digital asset space and a global reach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unigrid&#8217;s partnership with WeSendit marks a significant stride in its mission to revolutionize the Internet. WeSendit has been offering its file transfer service since 2014 and has since convinced more than 3 million customers, including global brands such as Nike, Facebook, Dreamworks, and Red Bull. The new platform WeSendit 3.0 and its central component, the $WSI token, mark the company’s transition from Web2 to Web3. WeSendit’s interdisciplinary team is developing a new generation of decentralized data processing tools that will encourage users to explore the benefits of the decentralized Internet. WeSendit&#8217;s decision to leverage Unigrid&#8217;s decentralized storage offering for its Web3 storage solution underscores the transformative power of Unigrid&#8217;s technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This commitment ensures a broad market launch for Unigrid this year, propelling its growth and market development. Unigrid remains open to additional seed commitments and private sales, with strategic guidance and expertise provided by Valuex AG, renowned specialists in strategy and blockchain technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unigrid is at the forefront of the next Internet revolution, providing a truly decentralized global network that is free from geographical limitations and centralized control.

The global cryptocurrency market lost nearly 4% of its value in today’s session. Solana was another notable mover, falling by 9% today. </strong></p>
<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) fell to a three-month low on Tuesday, as traders continued to react to news that the SEC had sued both  and Coinbase.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">Coinbase suit</a> alleges that the exchange has been operating as an unregistered broker, whilst Binance has been accused of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/">violating U.S. securities laws</a>.</p>
<p>DOGE/USD dropped to a low of $0.06483 on the news, which is its weakest point since March 10.</p>

<p>The sell-off comes a day after the meme coin was trading at a peak of $0.07163, but it has gone on to drop by over 7%.</p>
<p>From a technical point of view, the decline came as the relative strength index (RSI) moved below a floor of 33.00</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is deep in oversold territory, and is currently tracking at 29.33.</p>

<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>In addition to DOGE, solana (SOL) also fell big in today’s session, losing over 9% of its value.</p>
<p>After a high of $21.54 to start the week, SOL/USD slipped to an intraday low of $19.42 earlier today.</p>
<p>Following the plunge in price, solana fell to its lowest point since May 27, when it was last below $20.00.</p>

<p>Similar to dogecoin, today’s decline came as a result of a breakout which occurred on the RSI indicator.</p>
<p>Price Strength fell below a key point of support at 42.00, and is currently at a reading of 40.63.</p>
<p>In the event that bearish pressure intensifies, the next target could be a lower floor at $18.50.</p>

Furthermore, the ASC order discloses that the enforcement action saw participation from California, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.</strong></p>
<h2>Coinbase Has 28 Days to Show Cause</h2>
<p>The Alabama Securities Commission (ASC) sent a <a href="https://asc.alabama.gov/News/2023%20News/6-6-2023_Coinbase.pdf">show cause and cease and desist order</a> to the San Fransico-based crypto exchange Coinbase on Tuesday. The ASC order gives Coinbase 28 days to explain why they should not be ordered to stop selling unregistered securities in Alabama.</p>
<p>In addition to alleged securities violations, the Alabama regulator claims “that Coinbase violates the securities law by offering its staking rewards program accounts to Alabama residents without a registration to offer or sell these securities.” The ASC show cause follows the regulatory action against Coinbase on Tuesday when the SEC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">sued the exchange</a> for not registering as a brokerage and for allegedly selling unregistered securities.</p>
<p>ASC director Amanda Senn stressed that the enforcement order is meant to protect retail investors in Alabama. &#8220;The ASC is committed to protecting Alabama consumers and investors, including those who choose to invest in the decentralized finance space,” Senn explained. “This action is another step toward ensuring that investors in crypto asset products are offered the same protections under our laws and are fully aware of the risks involved in these investments.”</p>

<p>In addition to the ASC, the document further claims that nine other states in the country participated in a “multi-state task force.” The other states that joined Alabama’s securities regulator include Kentucky, South Carolina, Washington, Maryland, California, Vermont, Wisconsin, Illinois, and New Jersey. Currently, <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/COIN:NASDAQ">Coinbase shares</a> have been down more than 16% during the start of Tuesday’s trading sessions on Nasdaq.</p>

The SEC alleges that Coinbase breached multiple securities regulations and has been functioning as an unregistered broker since 2019.</strong></p>
<h2>SEC Alleges Coinbase Operated an Unregistered Brokerage and Committed Multiple Securities Offenses</h2>
<p>The SEC is clamping down on another digital currency platform, this time targeting Coinbase for <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908.1.0.pdf">purportedly operating</a> as an unregistered broker and infringing upon various securities laws. While Coinbase has examined specific crypto assets for compliance with the Howey test, the SEC claims that the company has listed several cryptocurrencies that fail the test or classify as investment contracts.</p>
<p>Regarding the classification of individual assets as securities, the regulatory body contends that coins like ICP, AXS, CHZ, FLOW, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DASH" target="_blank">DASH</a>, VGX, FIL, NEXO, NEAR, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>, SAND, SOL, and MATIC meet the criteria of being investment contracts. &#x201C;We allege that Coinbase, despite being subject to the securities laws, commingled and unlawfully offered exchange, broker-dealer, and clearinghouse functions,&#x201D; <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-102">stated</a> SEC chair Gary Gensler. He added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Furthermore, as we allege, Coinbase failed to register its staking-as-a-service program as required by securities laws; again depriving investors of crucial disclosure and other protections.</p></blockquote>
<p>The SEC&#x2019;s issue with Coinbase&#x2019;s staking platform claims that the firm never filed sufficient documentation with regulators to offer such services. As a result of this omission, Coinbase is charged with withholding significant information about the program from investors while infringing on the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. Following the news, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com">crypto markets</a> in general have taken a dip, with values decreasing by 4.4% over the last 24 hours, which presently settles the global market cap at approximately $1.13 trillion.</p>
<p class="p1"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/COIN:NASDAQ">Coinbase&#x2019;s stock</a> has plummeted nearly 16% since this development and fell to $58.71 per share during pre-market trading sessions. Nevertheless, shares have increased 1.04% over the past month and 38.42% over the past six months. Echoing the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/">Binance allegations</a>, the SEC emphasized that Coinbase operated multiple entities without proper registration and listed crypto assets that the regulator identifies as securities.</p>
