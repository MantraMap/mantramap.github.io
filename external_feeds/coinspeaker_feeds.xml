<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/nike-2023-q2-results-stock/">Nike Announces Fiscal 2023 Q2 Results, NKE Stock Surges</a></p>
<p>American sportswear company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/nike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nike Inc</a> (NYSE: NKE) struck the Q2 fiscal 2023 balance with great earnings, blowing Wall Street expectations away. Analysts believe that better-than-expected performance came as a result of inventory level growth that has been inflated for several months because of supply chain disruptions. Following the company&#8217;s <a href="https://s1.q4cdn.com/806093406/files/doc_financials/2023/q2/FY23-Q2-Combined-NIKE-Press-Release-Schedules-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a>, NKE stock went up.</p>
<h2>Nike&#8217;s Q2 Earnings Overview</h2>
<p>Yesterday, Nike shares closed the trading session at $103.21, or 0.16% up. After hours, NKE shares added another 12.77% to reach $116.39. With a market cap of $161.481 billion, Nike stock is still 38.08% down year-to-date.</p>
<p>The numbers for the fiscal 2023 second quarter reported by Nike are as follows:</p>
<div title="Page 1">
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The revenue reported for the quarter totaled $13.3 billion. Meanwhile, analysts predicted $12.57 billion. The revenue is as much as 17% up compared to last year and 27% up on a currency-neutral basis.</li>
<li>The net income for the quarter made up $1.33 billion, or 85 cents per share. The expected number was 64 cents per share. Last year, it was $1.34 billion and 83 cents per share.</li>
<li>NIKE Direct sales grew by 25%, led by 34% growth in NIKE Digital sales and 11% growth in NIKE stores.</li>
<li>Inventories were $9.3 billion, or 43% higher compared to the prior year period, driven by an increase in units from lapping prior year supply chain disruption, as well as higher input costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nike President and CEO John Donahoe commented:</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div title="Page 1">
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Nike’s results this quarter are a testament to our deep connection with consumers. Our growth was broad-based and was driven by our expanding digital leadership and brand strength. These results give us confidence in delivering the year as our competitive advantages continue to fuel our momentum.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<div title="Page 1">
<p>Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Matthew Friend added:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Consumer demand for NIKE&#8217;s portfolio of brands continues to drive strong business momentum in a dynamic environment. We remain focused on what we can control, and we are on track to deliver on our operational and financial goals — setting the foundation for sustainable, profitable growth.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>For the full fiscal 2023, the company&#8217;s leaders are expecting the revenue to grow &#8216;low teens on a currency-neutral basis.&#8217; According to Matthew Friend, Q3 revenue growth is likely to be higher than Q4 due to the timing of wholesale shipments.</p>
<h2>Nike&#8217;s Latest Initiatives</h2>
<p>Currently, the company is focused on expanding its portfolio. Last week, Nike announced the opening of its &#8220;Jordan World of Flight&#8221; store on Via Torino, Milan. The store is a 363-square-meter premium retail destination that carries Jordan Brand footwear and apparel for men, women, and kids. According to Nike, World of Flight Milan is the &#8220;future of Jordan retail.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, Nike recorded enormous success on the web 3.0 interface. In particular, it <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/nike-web3-wearable-platform-swoosh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developed</a> its own web 3.0 wearables platform called .Swoosh (pronounced “dot Swoosh”). Besides, it collaborated with a digital collectibles firm RTFKT to unveil its web 3.0 sneakers. As we have <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/nike-rtfkt-web-3-0-sneakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>, the Cryptokicks iRL sneakers feature auto-lacing, enhanced lighting, haptic feedback, gesture control, walk detection, app connectivity, AI/ML algorithms, and wireless charging via the RTFKT power deck.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blockfi-withdrawals-selected-customers/">BlockFi Seeks to Resume Withdrawals for Selected Customers</a></p>
<p>Crypto lender BlockFi, which <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blockfi-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed</a> for bankruptcy on the 28th of November, has filed a motion with a US court to resume withdrawals for customers with crypto locked in its wallet accounts. The bankrupt company filed the motion on the 19th of December with the US Bankruptcy Court in the District of New Jersey. If approved, BlockFi users will be able to withdraw the crypto that is locked up in the platform. The motion says that cryptos held in BlockFi wallets belong to customers, and the company does not have legal or equitable interest in friends from when it stopped operation on the 10th of November.</p>
<p>In addition to allowing withdrawals of funds in customers’ BlockFi wallets, the crypto lender is pushing to update the user interface to reflect transactions correctly. The company also seeks to conduct ordinary course reconciliation of accounts.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Simply put, the [clients] were unable to, and did not, effectuate any transaction on the BlockFi platform beginning the moment of the Platform Pause Time Stamp.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>BlockFi Pushes for Withdrawals of Certain Customers</h2>
<p>BlockFi intends to delete all “attempted” withdrawals after the platform pause from the user interface to sort out any confusion. The company also said in the filing that “for the avoidance of doubt, the Debtors do not seek to reverse any client deposits from outside the platform to Wallet Accounts which were received following the Platform Pause Time Stamp.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/TiffanyFong_/status/1604994112943374337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1604994112943374337%7Ctwgr%5Ee9d42b4167970655ff8ca4c0ccc32bd1b7282d29%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fblockfi-files-motion-to-return-frozen-crypto-to-wallet-users" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> on Twitter, BlockFi sent an email to users, announcing the latest filing with the court. It added that it believes that clients unambiguously own the digital assets in their BlockFi Wallet Accounts. The crypto lender added:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We will be seeking similar relief from the Supreme Court of Bermuda with respect to BlockFi Wallet Accounts held at BlockFi International Ltd. This motion does not impact withdrawals or transfers from BlockFi Interest Accounts, which remain paused at this time.”</p></blockquote>
<p>BlockFi was one of the first victims of the crash trend led by crypto exchange FTX in early November. The crypto lender brokered a $680 million deal with FTX.US and hence was impacted with FTX’s financial health escalated. BlockFi’s bankruptcy petition showed that the company claimed over 100,000 creditors and between $1 billion and $10 billion in assets and liabilities.</p>
<p>Celsius Network, which also filed for bankruptcy, submitted a similar motion as it restructured. The company provided a status update on the 8th of December, saying that the court has authorized it to return “pure custody accounts” that were never in Celsius’ earn or borrow programs.</p>

<p>The Central African Republic has pushed the anticipated listing of its national crypto to next year due to unfavorable parameters.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/central-african-republic-sango-crypto-2023/">Central African Republic Delays Sango Crypto Coin Listing Until 2023</a></p>
<p>The Central African Republic (CAR) recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/central-african-republic-delays-crypto-token-listing-cites-market-conditions-2022-12-20/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> a delay in listing its national crypto token due to prevailing market conditions. According to the landlocked country, its Sango Coin listing would not launch until the first quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>The Central African nation also delayed a &#8220;release,&#8221; which would grant coin holders the ability to sell up to 5% of their tokens. As it stands, these coins remain &#8220;locked&#8221; for a year and cannot be sold. The country had earlier promised investors that they would receive 5% of their stake at the point of listing.</p>
<p>The Central African Republic did not specify whether the delay in the 5%-coin reimbursement resulted from central bankers or legal hurdles. In addition, the targeted crypto exchange(s) for listing the CAR&#8217;s national crypto also remain unspecified.</p>
<h2>Central African Republic Plans to Leverage Crypto as Means of National Development</h2>
<p>The Central African Republic is <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/central-african-republic-bitcoin-legal-tender/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the second country in the world</a>, after <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-legal-tender-51k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">El Salvador</a>, to adopt crypto as a legal tender. In the first half of 2022, the CAR declared Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) as a legal currency alongside the CFA franc. At the time, President Faustin Archange Touadera&#8217;s chief of staff, Obed Namsio, described the move as putting the CAR on &#8220;the map of the world&#8217;s boldest and most visionary countries.&#8221; However, the nation&#8217;s most senior judges subsequently rebuffed an attempt to grant citizenship to crypto investors in exchange for acquiring $60,000 worth of Sango Coin. According to the CAR high court, the citizenship offer is unconstitutional as nationality has no market value. Following the court&#8217;s decision to deny the citizenship path, a CAR spokesperson said the government was exploring other avenues. Furthermore, an unidentified moderator recently promised more updates regarding foreign investor citizenship next month.</p>
<p>As the first African country to legally adopt crypto as legal tender, the CAR is actively looking to develop its impoverished economy. One primary goal is to become a digital currency hub for the entire Sub-Saharan African region. In addition, several CAR government stakeholders want the country to be one step ahead of new and emerging technology. The country currently has poor internet access and below optimal electricity supply.</p>
<h2>Sango Coin</h2>
<p>The war-torn Central African Republic <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/central-african-republic-launches-sango-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched the Sango Coin</a> back in July, with plans to generate $1 billion over the next year. This national agenda has held sway despite concerns about Sango&#8217;s transparency and a broader crypto decline. So far, the African country has managed sales of only $1.66 million worth of its Sango token. This underwhelming development comes after the CAR achieved around 7.9% of its first sales target and only 0.01% of its second.</p>
<p>Despite being on the back foot for much of the year, the crypto marketplace took a worse turn following the recent collapse of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a>. So far, the global crypto market cap is $2 trillion, down from its peak in November 2021.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/gleec-btc-blocktane-brazil/">Gleec BTC Exchange Acquires BlockTane to Move into Brazilian Market</a></p>
<p>Estonia&#8217;s crypto trading platform <a href="https://exchange.gleec.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Gleec BTC Exchange</a> has announced its acquisition of <a href="https://www.blocktane.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Blocktane</a>, a Brazilian digital currency exchange as it makes strategic plans to deepen its push into the Latin American market. According to a Press Release shared with Coinspeaker, Gleec BTC Exchange’s acquisition of Blocktane involves the trading firm’s legal entity, brand name, and online domains.</p>
<p>The deal will also see the management of the trading platform stay on but under the leadership of Gleec in order to bring the parent firm’s ideologies to life in Brazil and the environs. The Blocktane platform was founded in 2020 as a direct and easy avenue for users to buy cryptocurrencies in a regulated way.</p>
<p>While the platform has temporarily ceased operations, it has grown to become one of the trusted venues for crypto trading, amassing a good market share that Gleec is hoping it will build on. Besides the primary aspects of Blocktane’s operations that will now be under the control of Gleec, the company’s native token BKT as well as its treasury inventory will also be directly handled by the new acquiring firm.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to partner with Gleec to bring their tool and products to Blocktane’s users in Brazil, and their first entry into that domestic market,” said John Willock, former Executive Chairman of Blocktane.</p>
<h2>Gleec Purchased Blocktane to Ride the Brazil Crypto Trend</h2>
<p>Gleec has a primary expansionary drive to move into new jurisdictions with a penchant for crypto adoption. The exchange’s push into Brazil was born out of the country’s latest disposition toward crypto in which lawmakers have passed the bill to legalize crypto as a means of payment.</p>
<p>The recently passed Bill No. 4,401 came after years of discussion by the lawmakers. In a bid to deepen the influence of the new bill in transforming the payment landscape in Brazil, a new oversight body has been established by the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies to oversee crypto payments in the country.</p>
<p>With the bills already passed by the lawmakers, only the President’s assent is remaining, and once appended, the bill is bound to get implemented within six months.</p>
<p>Brazil remains the most renowned crypto hotspot in the Latin American region over the past year, and the country has seen impressive growth in the past year. It has recorded more users adopting digital currencies including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/tether/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USDT</a> amongst others as shown in tax filings published by the Brazilian Federal Reserve (RFB).</p>
<p>Gleec has also dived into El Salvador, the country that was ranked as the first in the world to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-legal-tender-51k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legalize Bitcoin</a> back in September 2021. The Gleec presence in El Salvador is through its local subsidiary, <a href="https://gleec.sv/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Gleec SV</a>. As it looks to push its foothold around the world, Gleec said in a statement that it will reopen the Blocktane platform within the next few weeks.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/south-korean-court-92m-terra/">South Korean Court Freezes $92M in Terra-Related Funds</a></p>
<p>Since Terra&#8217;s UST and LUNA coins collapsed, South Korean authorities have been investigating the case and scrutinizing the businesses whose activity was related to Terra. The latest action taken has been freezing as much as $92 million (120 billion won) in funds of former and incumbent CEOs of Terraform Labs’ affiliate firm Kernel Labs. As The Korea Economic Daily <a href="https://www.hankyung.com/finance/article/202212208809B" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a>, the Seoul Southern District Court decided to confiscate the property of seven people involved in generating profit from selling pre-issued LUNA coins.</p>
<p>As per the Seoul Southern District Court, one of those taking the biggest advantage of Terra and speculating on sales was Kernel Labs CEO Kim Hyun-Joong. According to the reports from the authorities, Kim has illegally gained at least 79 billion won ($61 million). He made a few real estate purchases in South Korea last year. In November, he acquired a building in Gangnam-gu, which is the most expensive area in Seoul, for as much as 35 billion won ($27 million). Further, in June, he bought an apartment in Seongdong-gu for about 9 billion won ($7 million). As the investigation was unfolding, he was prohibited from leaving the country.</p>
<p>Notably, while Kim Hyun-Joong is in South Korea, authorities are looking for Do Kwon, the controversial CEO and founder of Terraform Labs. A few months ago, he left Singapore. Back in September, the South Korean government nullified the validity of Do Kwon’s passport. Afterward, Interpol issued a &#8220;<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/interpol-terra-founder-do-kwon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Notice</a>&#8221; declaring Kwon and his five accomplices wanted worldwide by law enforcement. As per the latest reports, South Korean prosecutors believe that Terra&#8217;s former CEO is now staying as a crypto fugitive in Serbia. We also <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/south-korean-terra-boss-fugitive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that he wants to cooperate with the authorities from Serbia. However, it is unlikely that South Korea will be able to legally extradite Do Kwon from Serbia as the bilateral extradition agreement involved 31 countries, excluding Serbia.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Next?</h2>
<p>While South Korea’s Ministry of Justice keeps requesting investigative assistance from the Serbian government, Do Kwon states he is not on the run and is open to communicating with the authorities.</p>
<p>Notably, the exact cause of TerraUSD and LUNA’s collapse is still unclear. Therefore, it is hard to predict how long the investigation will take. The collapse has been the biggest contagion in the cryptocurrency market in 2022. A lot of people got involved, and South Korean authorities are trying their best to find out the reasons and punish those involved.</p>
<p>At the moment, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of collapsed crypto exchange FTX and its sister trading platform Alameda Research, is also being investigated. US prosecutors believe that the FTX crash that took place in November intermingled with Terra&#8217;s collapse.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/toss-405m-series-g-funding/">South Korean Mobile Financial Services Platform Toss Concludes $405M Series G Funding, Looks to Expand Operations</a></p>
<p>South Korean finance super app Toss has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/19/south-korean-financial-super-app-toss-closes-405m-series-g-as-valuation-rises-7/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">concluded</a> a Series G funding worth $405 million and is now reportedly worth 9.1 trillion won, or $7.1 billion. This development marks a substantial rise in company valuation from 8.5 trillion won in June last year when Toss’ operator Viva Republica raised $410 million in pre-Series G funding. Although the value of the won during June 2021’s funding exercise, at 8.5 trillion, is lower than the latest won figure at 9.1 trillion, last year’s dollar amount stands higher. This is due to the depreciated value of South Korea’s currency against the dollar this year.</p>
<p>Fintech-inclined investor Tonic Private Equity led the latest Toss funding round alongside many returning backers. These included Altos Ventures, Goodwater Capital, Korea Development Bank (KDB), Aspex Management, Greyhound Capital, DUMAC, and Bond Capital. Additionally, the Series G also saw participation from Seoul-based investment bank Korea Investment &amp; Securities.</p>
<p>According to Toss, it previously completed the first and second closes in the third quarter of this year. During this time, the Korean mobile financial services platform and aggregator generated close to $226 million, or 295.8 billion won, and $175.8 million, or 229.3 billion won, respectively. Furthermore, Toss said it concluded the third close of the latest funding in November 2022.</p>
<p>Chief operating officer of Viva Republica Hyunwoo Seo provided future projections for Toss following its most recent funding phase. Seo cited profitability and significant growth as instrumental for the Korean financial services app, especially in the current turbulent market conditions. Furthermore, profitability for Toss would also go a long way in aiding the company’s plans to ease into a publicly-traded company successfully.</p>
<h2>Toss to Expand Operations &amp; Services with Funding Proceeds</h2>
<p>With the new funds, Toss intends to invest in its products, which include digital lending and online payment services. The company looks to tailor these services to specifically cater to the requirements and needs of individuals and local merchants.</p>
<p>In addition, Toss seeks to channel some of the fresh capital toward growth acceleration for the challenger bank, Toss Bank. The platform was launched in 2021 by Viva Republica to grow the company’s portfolio of services.</p>
<p>Lastly, Toss would also accelerate growth for Toss Securities, which is its retail investment app akin to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/robinhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robinhood</a> (NASDAQ: HOOD). According to Seo, Toss Bank and Toss Securities are expected to become profitable in 2023.</p>
<h2>Funding Indicates Company Buoyancy amid Contracting Tech Space</h2>
<p>The latest Series G funding value signals that Toss is doing comparatively well so far despite the bleak economic outlook. In addition, the company boosted its valuation while its global contemporaries, including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/stripe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/klarna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Klarna</a>, experienced sizable drawdowns to their market cap this year.</p>
<p>Toss operator Viva Republica also spent significantly more than its global contemporaries in October. By contrast, several global fintech platforms, including tech startups, have drastically cut costs in 2022 amid the contracting tech space. Some of these cost-saving measures include slashing guidance and budgets and downsizing headcount.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/xiaomi-reduce-workforce-covid/">Xiaomi to Reduce Workforce by 10% amid China’s Prolonged COVID Battle</a></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While many companies are gradually rebounding from the adverse effects of the coronavirus pandemic, others like China Xiaomi are still battling with the COVID impact as it plans to lay off 10% of its workforce. According to the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3203870/chinese-smartphone-giant-xiaomi-said-cut-15-cent-its-workforce-amid-weak-consumer-spending" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">South China Morning Post</a>, the smartphone maker has started firing employees across multiple departments, including its smartphone and internet services units.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Speaking on the cut, a spokesperson said Xiaomi is conducting a “routine personnel optimization and organizational streamlining”  due to COVID with “less than 10 percent of the total workforce” affected. The company revealed in its Q3 financial results that it had 35,314 employees, with over 32,000 in mainland China. Notably, Chinese companies often conduct layoffs in the name of “business optimization.” This is done to avoid scrutiny from labor authorities because employee dismissals that affect over 20 jobs must be referred to the government under China’s labor law. Xiaomi stated that victims of the layoff had been compensated in compliance with local regulators. A report said the laid-off workers got redundancy packages from the company. </span></p>
<h2>Xiaomi Cuts Workforce as Covid Lingers</h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Chinese smartphone giant started to let go of some of its staff due to lower sales amid the lockdowns in China. Slower consumer spending also contributed to the jobs cut. Notably, most of the people that would be impacted during the layoff were just recruited in December last year. Major social media platforms in China, including Weibo, Maimai, and Xiaohongshu, have been buzzing with posts about the dismissal. Discussions on the platforms show that many are beginning to get concerned about the future of the tech industry in China. This is because other top tech companies in China, such as Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA) and Tencent Holdings, have also been laying off workers amid the prolonged Covid-19 battle in the country. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Xiaomi made the move to reduce headcount shortly after its founder unveiled the new flagship 13-series smartphones. The company, which plans to unseat the iPhone from the global top position by 2024, revealed that the Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset powers the new smartphones. This came as the Chinese economy struggled in the consumer electronics market. As a matter of fact, global smartphone shipments dropped 9% YoY to 297.8 million units. Market research firm Canalys confirmed that smartphone shipments in China declined 11% to 70 million units. As for Xiaomi, the 5th largest smartphone seller in China with a 13% market share as of last quarter, the company’s revenue <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/xiaomi-q3-2022-financial-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shed 9.7% YoY to 70.47 billion yuan</a>. Its net profit also reduced by 59.1% to 2.21 billion yuan during the same period. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/gate-io-licenses-us/">Gate.io Bags New Operational Licenses in US, Inches Close to Launching Nationwide Services</a></p>
<p>The United States arm of Gate.io, Gate US has received the &#8220;go-ahead&#8221; to start offering virtual asset services in some states within the country. According to the firm, this is a welcome development that brings it closer to launching its services fully, across the entire United States.</p>
<h2>Gate.io Reiterates Its Commitment to Regulatory Compliance</h2>
<p>Gate.io has always strived to be in compliance with regulatory requirements and the new approvals are a testament to that fact. According to Lin Han, founder and president of Gate US as well as Gate.io, the firm is still not done and will strive to obtain even more licenses as time progresses. The statement reads in part:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Gate US has proactively registered as a money services business with FinCEN and obtained some money transmission licenses or similar to operate, and is currently working to obtain more.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Going by Tuesday&#8217;s <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gate-us-obtained-licenses-for-digital-asset-trading-bringing-world-leading-crypto-exchange-services-to-the-us-301705929.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a>, there&#8217;s no official information regarding the states where Gate US may operate for now. However, it did mention categorically, that it is yet to accept US-based users at this stage, while its services will also not extend to residents in New York, Hawaii and the territory of Puerto Rico.</p>
<h2>U.S. Market Attraction and Its Stringent Regulations</h2>
<p>By virtue of its recent approvals, Gate US joins a number of other top exchanges to have expanded into the US. Most notable among such exchanges are Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, and Gemini. FTX was another popular exchange in the region whose US arm, FTX US, recently filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>However, it might be worth noting that the US is gradually stifling its regulatory requirements for exchanges. But this is not exactly unexpected. Especially seeing as the outgoing year saw several failures beginning with the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-crypto-market-terra-luna-crashes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crash of the Terra ecosystem</a>.</p>
<p>In a December 20 <a href="https://www.gate.io/de/blog_detail/1932/The-crypto-market-forecast-2023" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a>, Gate.io forecasted that 2023 will usher in a new regulatory era. According to the post, this is to curtail further failures as was seen with the several bankruptcies recorded in 2022.</p>
<p>Also, a US lawmaker recently proposed bills that will require exchanges to give full disclosure of their reserves. They will submit the proofs to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>). But that might prove to be a problem for Gate.io. At least, in the short term.</p>
<p>Recall that Armanino —the firm responsible for Gate&#8217;s proof of reserve attestation, ended its crypto auditing services on December 15. So, if the laws should be passed immediately, the likes of Gate.io will have challenges staying operational in the states.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/busan-city-drops-plans-crypto-exchanges/">FTX&#8217;s Key Partner Busan City Drops Its Plans of Global Crypto Exchanges</a></p>
<p>The contagion of the collapse of the crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> is widespread and has a widespread impact across the entire crypto space. South Korea&#8217;s blockchain city Busan has recently dropped its plans for establishing global crypto exchanges.</p>
<p>Crypto exchange FTX was one of the key partners for Busan city. But amid its dramatic collapse, Busan is now reconsidering its plans for onboarding any third-party exchanges. In its recent announcement, Busan&#8217;s steering committee comprising 18 members said that city doesn&#8217;t plan to move ahead with any of the five exchanges that had agreed earlier this year to assist them. These five exchanges include <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a>, Crypto.com, Gate.io, Huobi Global, and FTX.</p>
<p>The steering committee is a municipal advisory body in south Korea that looks after providing advice on the operation and establishment of the crypto exchange. They are also responsible for strengthening the system through external cooperation.</p>
<p>The recent development from Busan City comes amid the growing negative sentiment over centralized exchanges. The meltdown of the crypto exchange FTX last month has served as a catalyst for Busan city to arrive at this decision.</p>
<p>Now, the city administration is having second thoughts on the inclusion of such private exchanges in their plans. One of the panel members said the problems with “FTX and other major global exchanges seem to have influenced [the decision]”. Another panel member said that the exchanges were never an integral part of the city&#8217;s plan. They were only here to provide initial liquidity.</p>
<h2>Busan City&#8217;s Local Crypto Exchange</h2>
<p>Busan city is confident in moving ahead with its own blockchain goals without any third-party assistance. They want to build a local exchange that would divide digital assets into securities and non-securities.</p>
<p>The exchange would also function as a market management organization looking after listing and evaluation, market monitoring and supervision, as well as deposit and settlement. Speaking on it, Busan Mayor Park Hyung-joon <a href="https://www.busan.go.kr/resource/preview_skin/doc.html?fn=BBSTY3_ATTACH_1550740_1&amp;rs=/resource/preview_result/202212" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“As Busan grows into a digital financial center, fostering the blockchain industry and establishing a digital asset exchange are very important.”,“Based on the various experiences and expertise of the members of the promotion committee, I ask that you put your heads together and think about the establishment and policy direction of the Busan Exchange, the future food of Busan.”.</p></blockquote>
<p>Busan City is a regulatory-free zone for blockchain technologies. The city is planning to implement different blockchain applications such as finance, tourism, public safety, and logistics. Since then, the local government has been actively pursuing its blockchain plans.</p>

<p>Despite the stock slump and the cutback on the company’s staffing, Mark Zuckerberg has reiterated plans to maintain its metaverse drive.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Platforms Inc</a> (NASDAQ: META), the parent company of Facebook with a new ambition to pioneer innovation in the metaverse world is not relenting in its push into the emerging technology.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://decrypt.co/117638/meta-still-believes-in-metaverse-stock-down-64-percent-since-name-change" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> by Decrypt, citing Andrew Bosworth, the Chief Technical Officer of Reality Labs who wrote in a company post that despite the strain the company has experienced in the past year, it is not ready to give up the metaverse dream just yet.</p>
<p>“Meta began 2022 with a new name and a new vision for the future, and at Reality Labs it’s our job to bring that vision to life,” Bosworth <a href="https://tech.facebook.com/reality-labs/2022/12/boz-look-back-2023-look-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>, adding, “We never thought it would be easy or straightforward, but this year was even harder than we expected.”</p>
<p>Bosworth highlighted that the global economic challenge experienced this year, “combined with pressures on Meta’s core business, created a perfect storm of skepticism about the investments we’re making.”</p>
<p>Meta Platforms changed its name to what it currently bears from Facebook Inc back in October last year, and at the time, it gave a mandate to the Facebook Reality Labs which it founded in September 2020 to deepen its involvement in the metaverse. Bosworth revealed that the company was betting on the growth of this tech riding on its general adoption.</p>
<p>“The long-term value of these technologies will come from how they’re adopted by the ecosystem of developers, creators, and builders that has formed around these devices,” Bosworth said.</p>
<p>The expectations of the company per its metaverse division have been frustrated over the past year as it <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/meta-losses-q3-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> in October that the Reality Labs unit took on a loss of $3.6 billion. This loss was realized on the approximately 20% of all investment from Meta Platforms injected into the metaverse unit.</p>
<p>Despite the losses incurred, Bosworth said the funds show &#8220;..a level of investment we believe makes sense for a company committed to staying at the leading edge of one of the most competitive and innovative industries on earth.”</p>
<h2>Meta Platforms Will Not Cut Back on Its Metaverse Push</h2>
<p>The battery Meta Platforms&#8217; metaverse project has experienced over the past year is not enough to make it taper down on its investments and push in general. Since it changed its name, Meta stock has slumped by over 60% and from $323.57 per share at the time, it is now changing hands at $113.76 according to its price in the Pre-Market today.</p>
<p>Despite this share slump and the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/meta-mass-staff-layoff-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cutback on the company’s staffing</a>, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/mark-zuckerberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Zuckerberg</a> has reiterated plans to maintain its metaverse drive. According to Bosworth, the current happening is a sign that economic conditions are a test of the company’s beliefs for the future.</p>
<p>“During boom times, it’s easy to make big, ambitious investments in what’s coming next, but when economic conditions turn, it’s just as easy to turn the other way: cut back on your ambitions, stick to what’s safest and most profitable today, and squeeze as much as you can from it,” he said, adding that “These are the moments that truly test people’s belief in the future.&#8221;</p>
