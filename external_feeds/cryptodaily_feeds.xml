			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ripple executives and the broader crypto industry eagerly await the Hinman documents&rsquo; public release. </p>
Hinman Documents Expected to Be Unsealed by June 13
<p>The highly anticipated public release of the Hinman speech documents and emails is reportedly set for June 13, 2023. Before these documents can be unsealed, one of Ripple&rsquo;s most notable executives, Susan Friedman, Ripple&rsquo;s head of policy, is focusing on a crucial hearing linked to the crypto industry ahead of the public release of the Hinman documents.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">While the upcoming June 13 HFSC hearing is an important one for crypto, the one being held next week by @HouseAgGOP is equally so. @CongressmanGT has been a steadfast supporter of the call for clarity in this space. https://t.co/DLLUjDzhQr</p>
&mdash; Susan Friedman (@ss_friedman) June 1, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>The crypto industry and Ripple executives such as Susan Friedman eagerly await June 6 hearing that the House Committee on Agriculture is organizing. The hearing entitled &ldquo;The Future of Digital Assets: Providing Clarity for Digital Asset Spot Markets&rdquo; will delve into the nuances of crypto markets and provide some much-needed clarity for the crypto spot market.</p>
June 6 Hearing is Crucial Before The Hinman Documents Can Be Unsealed
<p>Key to note here is that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) falls under the jurisdiction of the House Agriculture Committee. The CFTC and the SEC have been the two leading agencies actively cracking down on the crypto industry and pushing regulatory charges around digital assets-linked firms.</p>
<p>The SEC, in particular, have been accused of not providing clear rules for the market. It was recently sued by crypto exchange Coinbase for allegedly ignoring its petition for clear crypto guidance.</p>
<p>The June 6 hearing by the House Committee on Agriculture comes as a crucial time, just a month before the highly anticipated release of the Hinman speech and emails.</p>
<p>The Hinman documents also include unredacted versions of cross-motions for summary judgement and accompanying exhibits in the XRP lawsuit, Coingape reports.</p>
The Hinman Documents &ndash; What do they entail?
<p>Ripple gained a small victory in October in its ongoing case with the SEC, when the latter was forced to give up the Hinman documents, which could help Ripple prove in its case that XRP is, in fact, not a security.</p>
<p>The documents include discovery material proving that the former Director of Corporation Finance, Willian Hinman, delivered a speech in which he clearly stated that neither Bitcoin (BTC) nor Ether (ETH) is securities.</p>
<p>Video evidence of Hinman claiming that neither tokens are a security emerged. In the recording, Hinman states:</p>

<p>Based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions.</p>

Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, Remains Confident - Market Reacted Well
<p>Ripple&rsquo;s chief executive Brad Garlinghouse told Forbes he predicts the case, dragging on since 2020, will conclude in &ldquo;weeks, not months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garlinghouse&rsquo;s statement shot XRP&rsquo;s price up by over 10% over last week, and it currently trades at $0.51, according to data by CoinMarketCap.</p>
<p>XRP has tested the critical resistance at $0.5, but many wonders if the rally will continue.</p>
<p>Technical analysis from news agency CryptoPotato indicates that XRP has shown a consistent upward trend after being rejected from its 200-day moving average at around $0.4. XRP also managed to surpass its 50-day moving average of approximately $0.45 and seems to target its resistance zone at $0.6 in the short term. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If XRP successfully breaks through the $0.6 level, it would likely spur a bullish phase, with prices potentially reaching highs of $0.9 mid-term.</p>
<p>Investors should, however, be cautious as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates we are in an overbought market, suggesting a pullback or a period of consolidation may be seen in the next few days.</p>
<p>Garlinghouse further told Tai Panich, the chief executive of SCB 10x, in a YouTube interview:</p>

<p>I feel very confident that we&rsquo;ll see a decision from the courts this year.</p>

<p>Adding:</p>

<p>In fact, I think I would guess that it will be in weeks, not months.</p>

<p>The Ripple CEO also commented on the decision for the Hinman documents to be made public.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Another win for transparency! Unredacted Hinman emails to be publicly available soon - stay tuned as the lawyers work through the mechanics to make that happen. https://t.co/o6puPypRHd https://t.co/qmaLVeQaP8</p>
&mdash; Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) May 16, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>He told Forbes:</p>

<p>The court just ruled last week that the notes in the emails associated with that are going to be made public, and should be public around June 13. So I think that&rsquo;s a huge win for transparency. But what it really calls out is, there really hasn&rsquo;t been clarity, despite calls and demands from leaders across the crypto industry.</p>

<p>Forbes further reports that while crypto exchange Kraken and crypto lenders such as BlockFi chose to settle with the SEC, Ripple decided to fight it and go to court.</p>
<p>Garlinghouse said:</p>

<p>Ripple decided to lean in and fight this fight, both for Ripple and the whole industry. We&rsquo;ve spent a lot of money defending it. And I think what we&rsquo;ve called out is the government in the United States, and the SEC particularly, is putting politics ahead of smart policy.</p>

Things Are Looking Up for Ripple
<p>A recent Messari report revealed that XRP surged by over 55% in Q1 2023, outperforming the overall crypto market. The report further shows that XRP&rsquo;s market cap increased from $17.4 billion on January 1 to an impressive $27.4 billion on March 31, representing a Q1 surge of 59.9%.</p>
<p>Ripple further announced it made a&nbsp;$250 million acquisition of Metaco&nbsp;&ndash; a well-known crypto custodian. Seen as a positive sign for the future of both Ripple and Metaco, the move sees Ripple take on sole responsibility at Metaco while still allowing current CEO Adrien Traccani to manage operations independently.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Today, we are proud to announce Ripple has acquired @metaco_sa, becoming the sole shareholder of the Swiss-based provider of digital asset custody and tokenization technology.Learn more: https://t.co/GrI3u13iDT</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Germany's Deutsche Telekom has joined Polygon as a validator, signaling its support for the Ethereum layer-2 scaling protocol and expanding its involvement in the blockchain technology space. Deutsche Telekom aims to explore new revenue streams and enhance network security through its participation as a validator.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The company's subsidiary, Deutsche Telekom MMS, will operate as a validator for Polygon, contributing to the security, governance, and decentralization of the platform. As a validator, Deutsche Telekom will run a full node, produce blocks, validate transactions, and participate in the consensus process. This move strengthens the overall integrity and interoperability of the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Dirk R&ouml;der, Head of the Blockchain Solutions Center at Deutsche Telekom, views the collaboration with Polygon as a significant milestone for the company's aspiration to become a key player in Web3 infrastructure. Deutsche Telekom aims to serve institutional clients as a reliable enterprise-grade staking provider and leverage the existing infrastructure to monetize the native token of the underlying blockchain network. This strategic move allows Deutsche Telekom to tap into the growing potential of blockchain technology and establish a foothold in the evolving digital economy.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The involvement of mainstream telecommunications companies like Deutsche Telekom in the Web3 space can contribute to the greater decentralization of proof-of-stake blockchains. R&ouml;der emphasizes the importance of having a diverse and reliable validator set in a decentralized ecosystem. Other telecommunications companies are also exploring opportunities in this domain, fostering a more robust network infrastructure for blockchain platforms.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Michael Blank, CEO of Polygon Labs, believes that collaborations between blockchain projects and mainstream businesses like Deutsche Telekom can pave the way for wider adoption of blockchain technology across various industries. The partnership not only strengthens Polygon's network security and governance but also showcases the practical applications of blockchain beyond cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Polygon's blockchain ecosystem offers a suite of protocols for developers to access major scaling solutions, including zero-knowledge rollups, sidechains, app-specific chains, and data availability protocols. As a validator, Deutsche Telekom MMS will contribute to the security and decentralization of Polygon's proof-of-stake sidechain and Supernets app-chains. Currently, Polygon's PoS chain hosts numerous decentralized applications, processing millions of daily transactions and locking over $1.2 billion in Total Value Locked.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Deutsche Telekom's participation as a validator on Polygon demonstrates the increasing recognition of the potential of blockchain technology by established companies in the telecommunications industry. This collaboration strengthens Polygon's network infrastructure while bridging the gap between traditional businesses and the blockchain ecosystem.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The partnership between Deutsche Telekom and Polygon highlights the continued growth and integration of blockchain technology into mainstream operations. Such collaborations between traditional industry firms and blockchain companies advance the possibilities for transformative applications and advancements in the digital landscape, merging new horizons to expand the use case and adoption of blockchain technologies beyond crypto.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In a market filled with thousands of tokens, Sparklo prides itself as one of the most sought-after tokens at the moment, with more investors looking to capitalize on the project's high potential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it has been a day of varying price actions for tokens like Uniswap (UNI) and Stellar (XLM) as both look to scale past their support level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More investors join the Sparklo (SPRK) project as the ongoing token presale gains more ground</p>
<p>The Sparklo project has caught the eye of investors as more numbers join the project amid an imminent positive price trajectory. Sparklo is an innovative investment opportunity on the blockchain which allows investors to invest in valuable solid treasures like Silver, Gold and Platinum. These timeless treasures can be traded using fractionalized NFTs that act as digital placeholders.</p>
<p>The SPRK token is looking to replicate the growth of Bitcoin as crypto experts suggest an over 2,000% growth in the price value of the SPRK token before the end of the year. Investors will get the SPRK token at the price of only $0.030 per token currently. Early investors will also get a 50% bonus offer which lasts until the 2nd of June 2023. This means you have unlimited time to join the project and benefit from this opportunity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Sparklo has passed its audit with Interfi Network. The BlockAudit Report Team has also approved the project's KYC. To prevent a rug pull and ensure the safety of investors' assets, the liquidity of the SPRK token will be locked for 100 years. This is the time to invest in this project that has the potential to become the next blue-chip crypto. As such, we recommend you join this opportunity now. You can click the link to invest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPRK TOKEN HERE &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Uniswap (UNI) sees a slight price slump</p>
<p>Uniswap (UNI) is a decentralized protocol that facilitates the automation of crypto trading while also solving liquidity issues on its network. Within the last 24 hours, Uniswap's (UNI) price has been stagnant, with the coin losing only&nbsp; 0.53% of its value. As a result, Uniswap (UNI) is currently trading at the price of $5.03. The trading volume of Uniswap (UNI) took a deep dive as it lost 23.32% in trading volume and is currently at $29,377,114.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uniswap (UNI) has shown stability in recent days, with the Uniswap (UNI) coin gaining 2% in the last 48 hours. Uniswap (UNI) is one of the few promising tokens in the crypto market at the moment. However, Uniswap (UNI) coin holders have joined the ongoing Sparklo presale, which crypto experts project will offer a better return on investment. Crypto experts already predict that the Sparklo token will rise exponentially in the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stellar (XLM) shines as it witnesses a significant price rally</p>
<p>Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized network that works on a peer-to-peer basis to connect financial systems with individuals in need of it for swift payment transactions. Stellar (XLM) is gearing up to become the base layer for the thrilling-dollar stablecoin market which will see it provide fast and secure payments in real time. This development was made known in a published article on the Stellar (XLM) official website, which also highlighted fundamental ideas that should be considered when backing a fiat-backed stablecoin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Stellar (XLM) has seen a 2.06% price increase in the last 24 hours. This has raised the price of Stellar (XLM) to $0.092 currently.&nbsp; However, the trading volume of Stellar (XLM) declined to 16.12% within the last 24 hours. The last 48 hours' price chart of Stellar (XLM) is also bullish. While Stellar (XLM) investors hope that the coin continues its bullish price movement, some have joined the ongoing Sparklo presale to make gains. Sparklo is presently offering a 50% bonus on token purchases which will end in a few hours. Investors are joining to benefit from it.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In the rapidly evolving Web3 space, the success of any blockchain platform hinges on the creativity and ingenuity of its dApp creators. Recognizing developers' pivotal role in driving adoption, the IoTeX community has voted massively in favor of IoTeX's Improvement Proposal 15 (IIP-15) for Sharing of Gas-Fee with dApps (SGD).</p>
<p>With its groundbreaking IIP-15, IoTeX aims to unlock a new era of high-level innovation, engagement, and sustainable growth. By sharing a portion of transaction gas fees with dApp developers, IoTeX sets the stage for an ecosystem where creativity thrives, users are captivated, and developers are incentivized like never before.</p>
<p>The IoTeX community has passed the groundbreaking IIP-15 with 98.5% in favor, and 1.5% against the proposal. A total of 224 wallets participated with nearly 157.4 million IOTX staked. The IoTeX Foundation will distribute 224 Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) to reward those who participated in the IIP-15 DAO governance vote.</p>
<p>Becoming the DePIN leader</p>

<p>&ldquo;The significance of IIP-15 cannot be overstated,&rdquo; said IoTeX CEO and Co-Founder Raullen Chai. &ldquo;For IoTeX, it represents another step toward becoming the leader within the burgeoning Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) space. It also represents a paradigm shift in how blockchain platforms value and compensate their development community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By proposing the revenue-sharing mechanism through SGD, IoTeX opens the doors for community members to actively participate in shaping the platform's future and fostering a vibrant ecosystem,&rdquo; Chai said.</p>

<p>Striking a fair balance</p>
<p>As users interact with dApps on the IoTeX blockchain, a portion of the transaction gas fees is automatically accrued in the SGD treasury. The proposal recommends that 30% of the gas fees be reallocated to the SGD treasury to strike a fair balance and incentivize sustainable growth. At the same time, the remaining portion continues to contribute to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) rewarding pool. The actual ratio may be subject to adjustment through governance voting.</p>
<p>DApp owners can withdraw their accumulated revenue by initiating a claim action. The SGD treasury verifies the eligibility criteria, including transaction volume and time deployed on the chain, through the SGD registry.</p>
<p>Once the criteria are met, the treasury issues the corresponding rewards. To maintain the integrity and quality of the ecosystem, the IoTeX Foundation implements a review process, approving dApps based on their performance and adherence to guidelines.</p>
<p>Transparency and efficiency</p>
<p>The SGD initiative comprises two main components to ensure transparency and efficient management: the SGD Treasury and the SGD Registry. The treasury module handles gas fee distribution, accounting, and the SGD rewards claims process.</p>
<p>The registry consists of a system contract and an indexer. dApp owners utilize the system contract to register their dApp contracts and reward addresses, while the indexer keeps track of SGD contract addresses, owners, and the number of contract calls.</p>
<p>Implementing this fee-sharing model requires careful consideration to prevent potential abuses. To address this concern, the IoTeX Foundation has set eligibility criteria to qualify for revenue sharing.</p>
<p>DApps must have completed at least 100,000 IoTeX Layer 1 blockchain transactions, have been deployed and running smoothly for at least one month, and receive approval from the IoTeX Foundation.</p>
<p>The Foundation reserves the right to disapprove dApps involved in spam transactions or illegitimate activities, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the SGD program and protecting users' interests.</p>
<p>Driving innovation</p>
<p>Implementing the SGD feature will be part of an upcoming hard fork, ensuring backward compatibility with existing applications and infrastructure. With this forward-thinking proposal, IoTeX joins a growing movement for blockchain platforms to actively reward their dApp creators, driving a virtuous cycle of innovation, user engagement, and overall ecosystem growth.</p>
<p>As IoTeX continues to expand its reach and influence, IIP-15 solidifies its position as a trailblazer in blockchain technology. Through this revenue-sharing model, IoTeX sets the stage for a new dApp development era that rewards creativity, nurtures innovation, and fosters a new and exciting design space for Web3 applications.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In an impressive milestone for the Avalanche (AVAX) ecosystem, the platform has successfully surpassed the coveted one million monthly active users (MAUs) mark.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avalanche's achievement not only solidifies its position as a major player in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape but also signifies the growing popularity and adoption of its innovative blockchain technology.</p>
Avalanche's Meteoric Rise
<p>Since its arrival on the scene, Avalanche has revolutionised the blockchain industry by addressing the scalability and speed limitations that have plagued other platforms. With a strong emphasis on decentralisation, scaling, and incredibly fast finality, Avalanche has managed to capture the attention of users and developers alike.</p>
Scalability
<p>One of the primary factors propelling Avalanche's success is its ability to handle a massive number of transactions per second (TPS). By utilising a unique consensus protocol called Avalanche Consensus, the platform achieves impressive TPS rates, ensuring smooth and efficient operation even during peak network activity.</p>
Interoperability&nbsp;
<p>Avalanche's interoperability capabilities have played a vital role in its growth. The platform enables seamless communication and asset transfers between different blockchains, unlocking cross-chain liquidity and expanding its potential use cases. This flexibility has garnered significant interest from developers and users looking for a comprehensive blockchain solution.</p>
User-Friendly&nbsp;
<p>Avalanche has prioritised user experience, making it accessible and intuitive for both crypto veterans and newcomers. The platform's user-friendly interfaces, robust development tools, and extensive documentation have lowered entry barriers, attracting a diverse user base and driving widespread adoption. However, a big issue still to be solved is the high cost of becoming a validator. Until this cost is lowered dramatically, smaller projects are being priced out.&nbsp;</p>
The Path Ahead
<p>With Avalanche crossing the one million MAU milestone, the platform's trajectory looks promising. Avalanche continues to foster innovation through ongoing partnerships, collaborations, and development initiatives. If the platform can resolve its issues of high costs if will climb to the next million users in a far shorter time scale.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, a report by independent journalist Colin Wu claimed Binance, the world&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, may have cut its staff by as much as 20%.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">SCOOP: According to multiple sources who confirmed to WuBlockchain, Binance has started layoffs, and the proportion is still uncertain.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">The AI tool built by Google, known as Bard, has made waves across the Web3 space as a lot of users are using it for price prediction. One of the most notable altcoins to get a significant level of attention due to the bullish outlook of Google Bard is Shiba Inu, and today, we will explore why it thinks that the crypto has high-growth potential.</p>
<p class="s5">The presale-stage project Tradecurve has increased by 25% in the past week, and it has its own AI system as well that can change the way investors make decisions when trading.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s8">Google Bard Makes Prediction Surrounding Shiba Inu&rsquo;s Future Value</p>
<p class="s5">Google Bard was consulted to get the price predictions for the Shiba Inu cryptocurrency, as users on a global scale are using AI to check the future value of their favorite cryptocurrencies. Note that the price predictions that are made by the Google Bard AI might not always be 100% accurate or correct. However, they will provide much-needed insights into the potential future direction a cryptocurrency's value might be headed to. When Shiba Inu was released in 2020, it was dubbed the "Dogecoin Killer" and experienced a massive 1,500% increase after it was released. This excessive increase resulted in the crypto community speculating on the different scenarios, and one of them predicted that SHIB could climb to $1.</p>
<p class="s5">However, according to Google Bard, $1 is highly unlikely at this point. Bard's projection for the future of Shiba Inu is still optimistic, however. As of May 29, 2023, Shiba Inu trades at $0.00000883. Bard predicts that the maximum value for the cryptocurrency in 2023 is at $0.0000259, an increase of 193.32%. Aside from Shiba Inu, one other cryptocurrency caught the attention of crypto traders as well, and that project is Tradecurve.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s8">Tradecurve Already Sees an Increase of 25% And Can Spike By 100x At Launch</p>
<p class="s5">Tradecurve has transitioned from Stage 2 of its presale, where one TCRV token was worth $0.012, to Stage 3, where its price increased by 25%, and now trades at $0.015. Analysts and investors are eyeing the Tradecurve platform as it also implements AI to make trades, users can access hundreds of algorithmic and AI-driven trading systems and create AI-oriented bots to optimize the performance of their portfolio.</p>
<p class="s5">This hybrid platform requires no KYC, features Proof of Reserves (PoR), and allows anyone to make trades just by depositing crypto and then using it as collateral when trading other cryptocurrencies or any other derivative.</p>
<p class="s5">According to the Tradecurve whitepaper, the platform will feature high leverage beginning at 500:1, a VIP account service, zero requirements for FIAT payments, exclusive deposit bonuses, a dedicated Trading academy, and negative balance protection.</p>
<p class="s5">The team estimates that they will make $20 million during the presale and that they can onboard 100,000 new users at launch. TCRV will also get listed on Tier-1 exchanges and on Uniswap, and as a result, Google Bard predicts that TCRV can climb 100x by the end of 2023.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong-based First Digital Group has announced the introduction of a new stablecoin that will be pegged to the United States Dollar but regulated in Asia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The announcement comes shortly after Hong Kong announced the introduction of a new regulatory framework for digital assets in its jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p>
The First Digital USD
<p>The new stablecoin christened the &ldquo;First Digital USD&rdquo; or FDUSD, is intended to be backed on a 1:1 basis with the USD or an asset of equivalent fair value. First Digital also added that the reserves backing the stablecoin would be held in segregated accounts at different institutions in Asia. This is to prevent the co-mingling of assets. The FDUSD stablecoin will be backed by &ldquo;high-quality reserves&rdquo; and issued by the First Digital Trust, a trust company registered under Hong Kong&rsquo;s Trust ordinance. The stablecoin has been issued on BNB and Ethereum, with the company in discussions with major exchanges for a listing. First Digital, in its statement, added,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First Digital Labs will work closely with local and overseas regulatory authorities to ensure full compliance with current and future applicable laws and regulations, and First Digital Labs will participate in the shaping of their evolution, including the shaping of any regulatory regimes that FDUSD and/or First Digital may fall under in the foreseeable future. Stablecoins provide increased stability, a form of remittance, a hedge against central bank policymakers who seek to influence their domestic currencies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The CEO of First Digital, Vincent Chok, stated that the launch represented a major stride forward in providing an efficient and secure digital currency integrated into transactions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The launch of this stablecoin represents a major stride forward in our mission to provide a secure and efficient digital currency that can be seamlessly integrated into everyday transactions.&rdquo;</p>

Hong Kong Enacts Guidelines&nbsp;
<p>The announcement comes at a time when Hong Kong&rsquo;s &ldquo;Guidelines for Virtual Asset Trading Platform Operators&rdquo; that are becoming effective on the 1st of June 2023. The new rules define clear standards for the safe custody of assets, avoidance of conflict of interest, segregation of client assets, and cybersecurity standards that are expected from licensed trading platforms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Providing clear regulatory expectations is the key to fostering responsible development. Hong Kong&rsquo;s comprehensive virtual assets regulatory framework follows the principle of &lsquo;same business, same risks, same rules&rsquo; and aims to provide robust investor protection and manage key risks. This will enable the industry to develop sustainably and support innovation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) will also provide additional guidance on the new regulatory requirements and other implementation details, such as license application procedures and information about transitional arrangements. Regulators in Hong Kong have stated that stablecoins should not be allowed for trading by investors until the proposed rules for the asset class are implemented in its jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p>
Regulatory Uncertainty In The US Continues&nbsp;
<p>Meanwhile, regulatory uncertainty in the United States is continuing and has pushed major players to warn regulators that it could lose its position as a leader in the sector. The warning comes as many firms in the country are weighing their options and looking to shift to friendlier jurisdictions. According to Brian Armstrong, Coinbase CEO, with the regulatory uncertainty in the US, it was not surprising that Hong Kong was positioning itself as a crypto hub.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>US-based crypto exchange Gemini announced it seeks a crypto license in the United Arab Emirates, citing &ldquo;hostility and [a] lack of clarity&rdquo; on US regulations. </p>
<p>Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange owned by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, announced on Wednesday that it will &ldquo;soon&rdquo; start the process of obtaining a crypto service license for customers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">1/ We&rsquo;re coming to the UAE! 🇦🇪We&rsquo;re thrilled to announce that Gemini will soon begin the process of acquiring a crypto license to serve customers based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). pic.twitter.com/Ycdj9RxMbE</p>
&mdash; Gemini (@Gemini) June 1, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>In a blog post, the exchange said the UAE, as a forward-thinking, global financial hub, is fast establishing itself as a crypto hub. The company said its team has met with stakeholders throughout the region to learn more about local regulatory requirements, further stating that it aims for the &ldquo;adoption of crypto globally across 20 countries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gemini said:</p>

<p>By applying for a license, we will be taking another step towards making Gemini a truly global company.</p>

<p>It is not yet clear where Gemini&rsquo;s base operations will be located, but Cointelegraph reports that the exchange has hinted at establishing headquarters in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>Gemini co-CEOs, the Winklevoss twins, also told media outlet Zaywa that its decision was prompted by &ldquo;hostility and a lack of clarity&rdquo; regarding crypto regulations in the US.</p>
<p>The exchange announced last week that it plans to establish its European operations out of Dublin, Ireland.</p>
UAE Residents Have Bought More Crypto Than US Residents
<p>In Gemini&rsquo;s Global State of Crypto Report for 2022, data revealed more than 35% of those surveyed in the UAE purchased crypto, compared to only 20% in the US.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">4/As part of Gemini&rsquo;s 2022 Global State of Crypto Report, we found that those in the UAE were rapidly acquiring crypto and putting it to use making in-person purchases. 🤝We also found high intent to purchase crypto among those who were not yet ownershttps://t.co/EIB1ji2uBP pic.twitter.com/Ay9pfzkJk4</p>
&mdash; Gemini (@Gemini) June 1, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>Data further revealed that almost 32% of those in the UAE who do not own crypto are likely to purchase some in the next year. Compared to just 19% of global crypto owners, 33% of holders in the UAE said they plan to use crypto to make in-person purchases at brick-and-mortar retailers.</p>
Gemini Launches Offshore Crypto Derivatives Exchange
<p>Gemini has rapidly expanded its offerings by launching Gemini Foundation, an offshore crypto derivatives platform. The platform launched in 30 countries but is not available to US, UK, or European Union users.</p>
<p>Gemini Foundation allows users to begin trading with Bitcoin perpetual contracts denominated in Gemini Dollars (GUSD) and offers 100x leverage.</p>

			  <guid isPermaLink="false">https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/l3-platform-orbs-introduces-dlimit-to-enhance-trading-on-dexs</guid>
			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized blockchain infrastructure Orbs announced the launch of dLIMIT, an innovative decentralized limit order solution for decentralized exchanges (DEXs), this Thursday. The dLIMIT platform is built atop Orbs&rsquo; unique Layer 3 infrastructure, which provides a separate decentralized execution layer between existing Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions and the application layer.</p>
<p>The new dLIMIT platform joins a chain of new products launched on Orbs to enhance decentralization, privacy, and security. Additionally, the platform will guarantee users an optimal and reliable execution layer for limit orders on decentralized exchanges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The Orbs dLIMIT smart contract offers DEX users an unprecedented ability to execute limit orders at optimal prices with fair fees," says Ran Hammer, Vice President of Business Development for Orbs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, the novel technology also provides a user interface template, &ldquo;designed for seamless integration and customization by any DEX&rdquo; building an intuitive, user-friendly and informative trading experience, Hammer added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>dLIMIT platform joins novel technologies built on Orbs infrastructure including the decentralized time-weighted average price platform (dTWAP) that provides a decentralized algorithmic TWAP order tool for DEXs. The latest innovation is built on Orbs&rsquo; dTWAP protocol and leverages the latter&rsquo;s price oracles, which have previously been used on several top DEXs such as Quickswap and Spookyswap.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"dLIMIT, backed by Orbs' robust network infrastructure and smart contract, offers DEXs an optimal limit order solution that ensures decentralization, redundancy, reliability, and user protection," a spokesperson from the Orbs&rsquo; team adds.</p>

<p>Orbs launched in 2017 intending to offer users a public, open, decentralized blockchain infrastructure powered by a network of permissionless validators (Guardians) using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. The Orbs L3 infrastructure is the backbone of the dLIMIT solution.&nbsp; It allows developers to design applications that extend the capabilities of their smart contracts without relying on traditional centralized server solutions.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Guardians on Orbs will validate and approve transactions on dLIMIT. Simply, the Guardians run a tailored function utilizing ORBS-Lambda that acts as the single honest bidder, or "taker", required for the dLIMIT protocol to run optimally. To enhance decentralization, the validators will monitor and validate the transactions on the dLIMIT smart contract and submit an honest bid when an order is open for bids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will enable traders and users to get minimal transaction and gas fees while the platform finds the DEXs with the best prices. This provides assurance that the limit order set will track spot market prices as closely as possible when being executed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, the statement confirms that the latest innovation from Orbs is gaining &ldquo;significant interest&rdquo; from leading DEXs with multiple integrations in progress</p>

<p>"The Orbs dLIMIT smart contract offers DEX users an unprecedented ability to execute limit orders at optimal prices with fair fees," says Ran Hammer, Vice President of Business Development for Orbs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, the novel technology also provides a user interface template, &ldquo;designed for seamless integration and customization by any DEX&rdquo; building an intuitive, user-friendly and informative trading experience, Hammer added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>dLIMIT platform joins novel technologies built on Orbs infrastructure including the decentralized time-weighted average price platform (dTWAP) that provides a decentralized algorithmic TWAP order tool for DEXs. The latest innovation is built on Orbs&rsquo; dTWAP protocol and leverages the latter&rsquo;s price oracles, which have previously been used on several top DEXs such as Quickswap and Spookyswap.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"dLIMIT, backed by Orbs' robust network infrastructure and smart contract, offers DEXs an optimal limit order solution that ensures decentralization, redundancy, reliability, and user protection," a spokesperson from the Orbs&rsquo; team adds.</p>

<p>Orbs launched in 2017 intending to offer users a public, open, decentralized blockchain infrastructure powered by a network of permissionless validators (Guardians) using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. The Orbs L3 infrastructure is the backbone of the dLIMIT solution.&nbsp; It allows developers to design applications that extend the capabilities of their smart contracts without relying on traditional centralized server solutions.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Guardians on Orbs will validate and approve transactions on dLIMIT. Simply, the Guardians run a tailored function utilizing ORBS-Lambda that acts as the single honest bidder, or "taker", required for the dLIMIT protocol to run optimally. To enhance decentralization, the validators will monitor and validate the transactions on the dLIMIT smart contract and submit an honest bid when an order is open for bids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will enable traders and users to get minimal transaction and gas fees while the platform finds the DEXs with the best prices. This provides assurance that the limit order set will track spot market prices as closely as possible when being executed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, the statement confirms that the latest innovation from Orbs is gaining &ldquo;significant interest&rdquo; from leading DEXs with multiple integrations in progress</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto bashing in the mainstream media continues unabated as Reuters writer bigs up AI at the expense of the crypto sector.</p>
A mainstream media narrative
<p>Mainstream media generally appears to back the narrative that crypto has no intrinsic value, and that it will go to zero much sooner than later. This is the narrative put out by governments, bank leaders, and global traditional financial agencies.</p>
<p>Everyone has their view of crypto, and both sides of the argument have prominent economists and financial experts with widely differing opinions. However, what is not in doubt is that the large mainstream media outlets are gunning for crypto, often with little fundamental sense behind their articles.</p>
<p>For example, an article published today by a Reuters columnist expounds the view that the current &ldquo;AI craze&rdquo; leaves crypto for dead, and states how AI is gathering momentum while crypto is gathering dust.</p>
<p>No one can deny that artificial intelligence (AI) is arguably the biggest technological breakthrough that the human race has ever seen. The potential for this technology is as breathtaking as it is alarming.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto and AI complement each other
<p>However, comparing it with crypto is quite ridiculous. It&rsquo;s like comparing apples and oranges. Both have their place, and the two of them complement each other, as can be seen with crypto projects such as Render, Ocean, SingularityNET, and others that are harnessing the power of AI.</p>
<p>Crypto is either extremely misunderstood, or there are malicious actors involved in trying to drive this anti-crypto narrative out to the masses. Of course, in calling a spade a spade, the vast majority of cryptocurrencies will probably eventually fail and go to zero, but some of these projects are revolutionary, and this space is coming up with financial innovations such as DeFi, NFTs, payments, and many other uses that can change our world for the better.</p>
Bitcoin is an exit from debasing fiat currencies
<p>Bitcoin is the preeminent cryptocurrency, and it serves as a hard money exit out of the failing fiat-based monetary system. Artificial intelligence with properly defined boundaries can complement this people&rsquo;s money and be used to make life easier for all.</p>
<p>Just throwing mud at a technology is never a good idea. Balanced arguments are always needed. Crypto is a technology that seems to threaten governments, banks, and central planners in general.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being able to have total control has become the raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre of governments instead of being a servant of the people. Crypto challenges this misuse of power, and it is to be hoped that AI will not be used to strengthen governmental oppression of freedoms.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The European Union (EU) has formally signed new legislation on crypto licensing and money laundering rules into law.&nbsp;</p>
MiCA Signed Into Law
<p>After months of discussions and negotiations, on May 31, 2023, the EU formally signed the landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) into law. The legislation introduces a comprehensive framework for licensing and regulating cryptocurrency businesses operating within the EU member states. The goal is to establish clear guidelines for crypto-related activities and strengthen the integrity of the digital asset ecosystem.</p>
<p>It marks the beginning of a new era of crypto regulation and is expected to enhance consumer protection, prevent money laundering, and foster a more transparent and secure crypto market. These developments signal a notable shift in the EU's stance towards digital currencies.</p>
AML Laws Also Enforced
<p>The European Parliament President, Roberta Metsola, and Swedish Rural Affairs Minister, Peter Kullgren, signed the MiCA law into action. They also formally enacted another law on anti-money laundering (AML), which mandates cryptocurrency providers to authenticate their customers' identities when conducting fund transfers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Swedish government, currently holding the EU presidency and overseeing legislative discussions, made the announcement on Twitter. A spokesperson from the parliament verified that the laws mentioned encompass MiCA, the transfer of funds regulations, and two additional regulations unrelated to trade with Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>
EU Regulating Exchanges And Wallets
<p>Crypto exchanges and wallet providers looking to operate across the 27-nation bloc will be able to do so with a license issued under MiCA, which will likely be truly enforced in June after being published in the official EU journal. The MiCA rules also mandate that stablecoin issuers must hold appropriate reserves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proposed by the European Commission in 2020, MiCA sparked controversy due to lawmakers considering environmentally focused provisions that could have effectively banned Bitcoin's proof-of-work technology. While the industry largely welcomed these provisions, there is now a growing focus on the next phase of EU crypto regulation. Future laws may include other elements of the industry, like staking, non-fungible tokens, and decentralized finance.</p>
Critics Question &ldquo;Excessive Regulation&rdquo;
<p>The EU's move to regulate cryptocurrencies reflects a growing recognition of the importance of digital assets and their potential impact on the global financial system. Other regulatory bodies like the SEC have already applauded MiCA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, critics argue that excessive regulations could stifle innovation and drive crypto businesses away from the EU. In addition, concerns have been raised about the potential burden of compliance costs and the impact on smaller crypto startups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Striking the right balance between regulation and innovation will be crucial in order to support the growth of the digital asset industry while addressing legitimate concerns regarding money laundering and consumer protection.</p>
