PEPE Coin Leaps Into The Big Leagues The recent listing on OKX is a significant milestone for PEPE, providing the coin with greater exposure and access to a larger pool of investors. OKX is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, and its listing requirements are rigorous, which speaks to the increased enthusiasm generated by the cryptocurrency. This move also bodes well for the coin&#8217;s future, as it may lead to additional listings on other major exchanges. Furthermore, there is speculation that Binance, another major player in the crypto space, may list PEPE if it meets their criteria. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao recently hinted at this possibility during an Ask-Me-Anything (AMA) session, further fueling excitement around the coin. In addition to the already thrilling news, there has been a surge of over 90% in the value of the meme coin since yesterday. This has resulted in a record-breaking market capitalization of over $435 million, making it the 101st most valuable coin in the cryptocurrency market, as reported by NewsBTC. Frogging Amazing, Meme Coin Takes The Crypto World by Storm According to Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics firm, three “SmartMoneys” have sold a portion of their PEPE holdings and made a profit of over $1 million. This impressive feat was achieved in just two weeks. Lookonchain has reported that an individual with the following wallet has significantly profited from investing in PEPE. According to Lookonchain, the wallet holder purchased 5.42 trillion PEPE tokens for the equivalent of 1 Ethereum, worth approximately $2,100. The wallet holder sold 3.42 trillion PEPE tokens for 929 Ethereum, worth around $1.77 million. Despite selling some holdings, the individual still holds 2 trillion PEPE tokens, worth approximately $2.37 million at current market prices.
