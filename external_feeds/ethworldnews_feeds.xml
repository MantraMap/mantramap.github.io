<p>Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin core developer who claims to be the longest contributor to the flagship cryptocurrency, fell victim to a hack earlier this week that led to a loss of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoins.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Lost basically all of his Bitcoin</strong></h2>



<p>Dashjr&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1609613748364509184" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">claimed</a>&nbsp;that he had lost &#8220;basically all&#8221; of his Bitcoin (BTC) holdings in a hack that occurred on New Year&#8217;s Day. In a Twitter thread, Dashjr revealed that he had traced some of the stolen funds to a wallet address that received almost 217 BTC. At the time of writing, the&nbsp;<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1YAR6opJCfDjBNdn5bV8b5Mcu84tv92fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stolen BTC</a>&nbsp;was worth $3.6 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Bitcoin dev stated that the hack was the result of a compromised PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) key, and added that the IP address of the attacker was traced to a ColoCrossing server. He was unable to explain how his cold wallets were breached but noted that he had last accessed them in September.</p>



<p>Users on Twitter responded by speculating that the hack may be connected to a security breach that Dashjr tweeted about in November. In the wake of the attack, Dashjr called out ColoCrossing for allegedly &#8220;dropping the ball on abuse investigation last time&#8221; and vowed to change server providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He also warned people not to use Bitcoin Knots, a Bitcoin wallet signed with his now-compromised PGP key. Dashjr reached out to the FBI for help but has not yet received a response.</p>



<p>Binance CEO <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/changpeng-zhao-takes-a-dig-kraken-kucoin/">Changpeng Zhao</a> was among those who responded to Dashjr’s plight. CZ&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1609663902610034691" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reassured</a>&nbsp;him that he had asked his security team to monitor the situation. The Binance chief further offered to freeze the stolen funds, should they find their way to Binance.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Sorry to see you lose so much. Informed our security team to monitor… We deal with these often, and have Law Enforcement (LE) relationships worldwide,&#8221; &nbsp;</p><cite>CZ told Dashjr</cite></blockquote>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Lawyers representing Bankman-Fried in the criminal trial asked Judge Lewis Kaplan to redact the names of two sureties who co-signed Sam&#8217;s bail bond.</li><li>SBF was released in December 2022 after posting bail for $250 million, per reports.</li><li>U.S. Federal prosecutors charged the FTX founder with eight counts from fraud to money laundering. </li></ul>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried’s lawyers filed a motion to redact the name of two co-signers for SBF’s massive $250 million bail. Bankman-Fried posted bail in December after appearing before a Manhattan court.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Sam’s Request</h2>



<p>Bankman-Fried’s court representatives submitted a letter motion in a bid to keep two of Sam’s bail co-signers a secret. Bankman-Fried’s lawyers requested a “limited modification to one portion of the bail conditions”, said the letter sent to U.S. Judge Lewis Kaplan and the criminal court.</p>



<p>In December 2022, authorities released the disgraced FTX Founder after Bankman-Fried posted bail for $250 million. The court included house arrest, location monitoring, and an international travel ban as part of SBF’s bail conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried’s lawyers asked the court to redact the two remaining names of the bail bond co-signers. SBF’s legal counsel also requested that the U.S. government keep the names of the individuals private as well.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Specifically, we request an order from the Court directing that the names and other identifying information of Mr. Bankman-Fried’s two remaining bail sureties (1) be redacted on the bond they will sign, and (2) not be publicly disclosed by the Government.</p></blockquote>



<p>The letter <a href="https://twitter.com/tier10k/status/1610265485706240001?s=20&amp;t=bunj9iJUBGfJ25wvfnaDew" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a> that the U.S. government “takes no position on the request”, suggesting that the decision is entirely up to Judge Kaplan and the court.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried Extradited To America</h2>



<p>Former crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried was extradited to the United States in December after waiving his right to contest extradition in a Bahamian court. Following the court order, SBF as he’s known was flown to Manhattan, New York.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried faces multiple criminal charges from fraud to campaign finance violations. The CFTC, Department of Justice, and the SEC all filed charges against SBF over FTX’s collapse in November 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX Co-Founder Gary Wang signed plea deals, admitting to stealing customer funds, and supposedly flipping on Sam Bankman-Fried. The FBI also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/u-s-doj-launches-probe-into-372-million-ftx-hack-following-bankruptcy-filing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opened</a> investigations on a $400 million hack <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2022/11/21/ftx-hacker-moved-nearly-200-million-of-ether-to-different-wallets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suffered</a> by FTX shortly after Chapter 11 bankruptcy was filed. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The Securities Commission of The Bahamas addressed “material misstatements”  made by FTX CEO John Ray III after the crypto exchange collapsed in November.</li><li>The Commission accused Ray of making unfounded claims based on incomplete information.</li><li>Friction between both parties crossed into a new year amid ongoing bankruptcy proceedings and investigations into FTX&#8217;s billion-dollar crash.</li></ul>



<p>Tensions between the FTX’s bankruptcy administration and the Securities Commission of The Bahamas escalated on Tuesday as the watchdog fired back over claims made by CEO John Ray III</p>



<p>On January 3, the SCB published an announcement in a bid to dispel misinformation that emerged from the new FTX boss. Ray was hired to lead the fallen crypto exchange through bankruptcy shortly after Sam Bankman-Fried unwillingly filed for Chapter 11 protection.</p>



<p>According to the court documents, Ray’s team claimed that the Bahamas watchdog instructed Bankman-Fried’s exchange to mint roughly $300 million in fresh FTT tokens, the native token of the crippled platform. The SCB <a href="https://twitter.com/SCBgov_bs/status/1610084773472485380?s=20&amp;t=NZwY4oxkIRTTZhyLjhSx2w" rel="nofollow noopener">countered</a> this claim, calling the allegations “unfounded” and based on incomplete reporting.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The US Debtors’ continued lack of diligence when making public statements concerning the Commission is disappointing, and reflects a cavalier attitude towards the truth and towards The Bahamas that has been displayed by the current officers of the Chapter 11 Debtors from the date of their appointment by Sam Bankman-Fried.</p></blockquote>



<p>Back in later 2022, the SCB also addressed claims that Bahamas authorities gave FTX permission to open local withdrawals.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>FTX Embroiled In Tussle With Bahamas Authorities</h2>



<p>Indeed, friction between the two entities sparked in November after FTX accused Bahamas regulators of stealing cryptocurrencies from the crypto exchange. The SCB countered that Ray publicly disclosed the claims without liaising with Bahamas regulators or responding to communication attempts.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Mr. Ray has not once reached out to the Commission to discuss any of his concerns before airing them publicly, The Commission has still not received a response to its 7 December 2022 letter to Mr. Ray offering cooperation with Chapter 11 Debtors.</p></blockquote>



<p>The SCB reportedly <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/3-5-billion-ftx-customer-crypto-bahamas/">secured</a> around $3.5 billion in FTX customer crypto after a hacker stole roughly $400 million in digital assets from the platform. Ray’s team asked the court for control over the digital assets as bankruptcy proceedings seek to settle creditors and debtors alike. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The Bahamian Securities Commission took control of the assets on November 12 due to concerns that FTX was vulnerable to cyberattacks.</li><li>Hackers stole nearly $400 million in digital assets hours after Founder Sam Bankman-Fried filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on November 11.</li><li>Notably, the tokens secured from FTX Digital Markets Ltd were worth $3.5 billion in November.</li></ul>



<p>Digital currencies belonging to FTX customers are held by the Securities Commission of the Bahamas, said a press statement published by the regulator on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Commission secured customer assets from FTX Digital Markets Ltd on November 12 following an exploit on the sunken crypto exchange a day before. An unknown hacker attacked the platform and stole nearly $400 million in crypto tokens. The FBI <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/u-s-doj-launches-probe-into-372-million-ftx-hack-following-bankruptcy-filing/">announced</a> investigations into the hack, per reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Founder Sam Bankman-Fried, Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, and Co-Founder Gary Wang were also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2022/12/14/ftx-founder-and-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-arrested-in-the-bahamas/" rel="noopener">charged</a> with fraud and money laundering by the Department of Justice, CFTC, and SEC.</p>



<p>Notably, the $3.5 billion held by the Bahamian regulator was valued using November 12 market prices. Crypto Twitter participants also speculated that a piece of the holding could be in FTT and Serum (SRM) tokens. The Commission has not responded to questions about the specific tokens held.</p>



<p>Thursday’s announcement also addressed claims that the Bahamas regulator told Bankman-Fried’s to open local withdrawals, denying such a request.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>FTX Customer Assets Await Court Order</h2>



<p>The Bahamian Securities Commission said the assets will remain under custody until a Supreme Court issues an order. Per the official statement, the SCB will hold the assets in “digital wallets controlled by the Commission, for safekeeping”. The current market value of the tokens held by the watchdog is unclear at press time. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The digital assets transferred on 12 November 2022 to digital wallets under the exclusive control the Commission are being held by the Commission on a temporary basis, until such time as The Bahamas Supreme Court directs the Commission to deliver them to the customers and creditors who own them, or to the JPLs to be administered under rules governing the insolvency estate for the benefit of the customers and creditors of FTXDM</p></blockquote>



<p>Customers in Turkey and Japan could be the first to access their cryptocurrencies from the bankruptcy exchange. Per reports, Liquid announced a plan to return customer assets by mid-February 2023. Disgraced crypto tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried bought Liquid crypto exchange after the Japanese crypto exchange was hacked for $100 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the filing, Michael Saylor’s company scooped 2.395 BTC between November 1 and December 21, 2022. The massive buy was deployed via MacroStrategy, a subsidiary of Saylor’s technology giant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Saylor used MacroStrategy to secure a $205 million loan for further Bitcoin investments, as <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/?s=macrostrategy">reported</a> by EthereumWorldNews in March 2022. The company bagged 4,167 BTC shortly after securing the loan from Silvergate.</p>

<p>Bitcoin traded at $16,656 on Wednesday after the leading crypto <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2022/11/09/crypto-crash-deepens-bitcoin-hits-2-year-low-after-ftx-implosion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped</a> over 60% from its all-time high in November 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>The Department of Justice charged Eisenberg with market manipulation of the MNGO token.</li><li>Eisenberg exploited Mango Markets for $110 million in cryptocurrencies back in October 2022.</li><li>The Solana-based decentralized exchange offered Eisenberg and the other hackers $47 million as a bug bounty if the group returned $67 million in digital assets.</li></ul>



<p>Avraham Eisenberg was arrested on Tuesday after the U.S. Department of Justice charged Eisenberg with market manipulation over an October hack on the decentralized exchange Mango Markets. The platform allows users on Solana to buy, sell, lend and trade cryptocurrencies on Solana’s blockchain network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) comprised of MNGO token holders govern the exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The Charges</h2>



<p>Indeed, the DOJ charged and arrested Eisenberg for “market manipulation offenses”, per an official statement from U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday. Eisenberg also stands accused of commodities fraud and commodities manipulation, as revealed by a second filing.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Eisenberg engaged in a scheme involving the intentional and artificial manipulation of the price of perpetual futures contracts on a cryptocurrency exchange called Mango Markets.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Mango Markets $110 Million Hack</h2>



<p>Mango Markets was exploited for around $110 million in cryptocurrencies on October 11, 2022. The hacker leveraged a loophole in Mango’s price oracle to trigger massive withdrawals from the DEX.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On October 15, 2022, Eisenberg said he “was involved with a team that operated a highly profitable trading strategy” on Mango. The DOJ’s indictment said Eisenberg and his team generated illicit wealth by trading MNGO perpetual tokens between several counts.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Statement on recent events:<br><br>I was involved with a team that operated a highly profitable trading strategy last week.</p>&mdash; Avraham Eisenberg (@avi_eisen) <a href="https://twitter.com/avi_eisen/status/1581326197241180160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">October 15, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>According to the court filing, the hacker group then manipulated Mango’s token price and created an artificial asset price pump by purchasing MNGO in vast amounts. Eisenberg allegedly leveraged the assets as collateral to borrow a myriad of digital currencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Afterward, Eisenberg drained liquidity from the DEX and withdrew $110 million in several cryptos. The trader claimed the process aligned with “legal open market actions” and the exploit was the consequence of Mango Markets’ lack of anticipation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mango offered Eisenberg and his team $47 million as a bug bounty. In exchange, the platform asked the hackers to return $67 million in tokens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The controversial FTX hack last month, which led to a loss of more than $370 million, has once again been brought into the limelight. The United States Department of Justice has launched a criminal probe into this matter. According to a report by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-27/us-probes-how-372-million-vanished-in-hack-after-ftx-bankruptcy" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, this probe is separate from the fraud case that former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is currently facing in Manhattan.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Funds exploited from FTX have been frozen by authorities</strong></h2>



<p>The investigation into the hack is being headed by the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team of the Department of Justice. This team consists of a network of prosecutors who specialize in digital asset investigation. A person familiar with the matter has revealed that a portion of the exploited funds has been frozen by authorities. This investigation is separate from the fraud charges that have been brought against&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-to-be-released-after-posting-250-million-bail/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>. The former CEO had previously indicated that the exploit may have been an inside job.</p>



<p>The hack was initially&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/0xfoobar/status/1591261359152705538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a>&nbsp;by the crypto Twitter community.

The initial figure was close to $650 million since FTX employees had started transferring assets into cold wallets as a&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/_Ryne_Miller/status/1591326796305530880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1591326796305530880%7Ctwgr%5E5804e9a63837a114a4351ef76deb5e6f21c40948%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fftx-reportedly-hacked-as-officials-flag-abnormal-wallet-activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">precaution</a>. </p>

<p>The exploit was later acknowledged by current CEO John Ray III who stated that there had been “unauthorized access” within hours of filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy on 11 November.&nbsp;&nbsp;The days following the hack saw the perpetrator swapping the exploited tokens for ETH. These funds were then bridged to Bitcoin using the RenBridge service. The perpetrator also employed mixer services to obscure the money trail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Bankman-Fried affirmed that 56 million Robinhood shares were bought with loans from Alameda Research between April and May 2022.</li><li>The loans were issued in several amounts to Sam and his co-founder Gary Wang, per a court affidavit.</li><li>FTX lawyers asked a judge to freeze the assets after BlockFi claimed ownership of SBF&#8217;s stake in Robinhood.</li></ul>



<p>Disgraced crypto tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried told an Antiguan court that loans from Alameda Research were used to acquire a 7.6% stake in stock broker and crypto exchange Robinhood. Bankman-Fried affirmed the source of capital for his Robinhood stock scoop in a court affidavit shortly before his arrest in December.</p>



<p>As previously reported, troubled crypto lender BlockFi filed for ownership of Sam’s Robinhood. Lawyers for the bankrupt exchange asked a judge to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-blockfi-tussle-sbfs-robinhood-stock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freeze</a> the assets for the benefit of creditors, debtors, and claimants. </p>



<p>According to the affidavit, SBF acquired the shares along with FTX and Alameda co-founder Gary Wang. The pair domiciled Emergent Fidelity Technologies in Antigua to manage the investment in Robinhood. Bankman-Fried controlled 90% of Emergent while Gary assumed 10% control of the company, per court filing.</p>



<p>Gary and SBF then bootstrapped Emergent with loans from Alameda, securing tens of millions in loans. Alameda issued four promissory notes lending roughly $491 million to Bankman-Fried and $54 million to Gary, said SBF. Bankman-Fried added that extra capital to complete the massive $600 million purchase was probably also borrowed by the pair.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In order to capitalize Emergent so that it could make the investment into Robinhood, Gary and I agreed to borrow funds from Alameda Research Ltd. Those funds were capitalized into Emergent and it used those funds to acquire the shares in Robinhood.</p></blockquote>



<h2>FTX Customer Funds Stolen?</h2>



<p>The affidavit supposedly confirmed allegations from the CFTC and SEC that Alameda issued loans to individual and top executives within Bankman-Fried’s sunken crypto empire. Also, the CFTC’s complaint alleged that Alameda siphoned customer funds from FTX before the trading giant edged insolvency in May 2022.</p>



<p>Indeed, the filing from the U.S. regulator and SBF’s affidavit echoed concerns that the 56 million Robinhood shares were bought with stolen customer funds from FTX.  Individual creditor Yonatan Ben Shimon argued a similar claim to the Antiguan court. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8230;Emergent acquired a 7/6% shareholding in Robinhood for about US$650 million possibly using funds improperly diverted from those invested by me and others with FTX. I know nothing regarding the source of the funds used to acquire the 7/6% interest in Robinhood beyond the fact that it was allegedly “working capital”.</p><cite>&#8211; Yonatan Ben Shimon, indivudal creditor.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Bankman-Fried refuted allegations of criminal negligence prior to his arrest in the Bahamas and extradition to the United States. However, Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/12/23/caroline-ellison-admits-she-and-bankman-fried-conspired-to-steal-from-ftx-customers-and-mislead-investors-reports-say/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">testified</a> to diverting user funds from SBF’s crypto exchange to his trading giant in a plea deal. </p>

<ul><li>Fantom co-founder Andre Cronje has laid out the protocol’s roadmap for 2023.</li><li>The protocol will focus on expanding its dApp ecosystem through gas monetization and subsidies.&nbsp;</li><li>Cronje has been appointed to the Board of Directors for Fantom Foundation Ltd.</li><li>The protocol previously pledged to bring down its token burn rate to incentivize dApp developers.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/fantom-up-20-andre-cronje-return/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andre Cronje</a>, the popular DeFi architect who co-founded the Fantom Foundation, has laid out the 2023 roadmap for the layer 1 blockchain. Cronje, who refers to himself as the “Vice President of Memes” at Fantom Foundation, has stated that the foundation will focus on the expansion of its decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem next year.</p>



<h2><strong>Fantom to incentivize builders with gas monetization and subsidies</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://andrecronje.medium.com/letter-to-fantom-foundation-team-eb3d870c6be8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">letter</a> from Cronje to the foundation team, the objective for next year is to provide the highest throughput blockchain available in order to create a single, secure settlement layer for all decentralized activity. This goal is to be achieved by improving the tools, integration, and ease of use for developers, rather than catering to specific user verticals like DeFi, NFT, gameFi, and exchanges.</p>



<p>Cronje has outlined several core focus areas for the next 12 months. These include gas monetization, which will allow dApps to share revenue based on the gas used in transactions, similar to how YouTube and Twitch creators earn income. The foundation also plans to implement gas subsidies, which will allow dApps to interact without requiring users to pay gas fees themselves, making onboarding easier and more seamless.</p>



<p>Another key focus for the Fantom Foundation is account abstraction, which will eliminate the distinction between contract and EOA accounts. Under this system, contracts will be able to initiate transactions and pay for gas, and EOAs will simply serve as authorities authorized to instruct wallets to take certain actions. This will allow for a more user-friendly dApp experience and enable social recovery options such as email and password authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An economic abstraction for gas fees is also in the pipeline, which will allow fees to be paid in tokens other than FTM, and is developing a new middleware layer to improve smart contract processing and unlock the full potential of hardware. Other focus areas include performance engineering, documentation and training, and business development.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje also informed the team that he has formally been appointed as a member of the Board of Directors for both Fantom Foundation Ltd and Fantom Operations Ltd.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Caroline Ellison testified that Sam Bankman-Fried received billions from Alameda Research.</li><li>Ellison and SBF conspired to hide the commingling of funds from FTX investors and customers.&nbsp;</li><li>The former Alameda Chief prepared false balance sheets to mislead stakeholders.&nbsp;</li><li>Ellison has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with prosecutors.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Sam Bankman-Fried’s quantitative trading firm Alameda Research, made sensational claims during her plea hearing on 19 December. A transcript of the said hearing was unsealed earlier today. According to a report by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/alamedas-ex-ceo-tells-judge-she-hid-billions-loans-ftx-execs-2022-12-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, Ellison has confessed that FTX executives including former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, received secret loans worth billions of dollars from Alameda.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Caroline Ellison prepared fake balance sheets to mislead investors</strong></h2>



<p>The former Alameda chief revealed that the trading firm could borrow unlimited funds from the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX. The transcript further revealed that Ellison and Bankman-Fried conspired to hide this crucial information from FTX’s investors, customers, and creditors.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We prepared certain quarterly balance sheets that concealed the extent of Alameda&#8217;s borrowing and the billions of dollars in loans that Alameda had made to FTX executives and to related parties,&#8221; </p><cite>Ellison told U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams.</cite></blockquote>



<p>The United States Department of Justice put out a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/united-states-attorney-announces-extradition-ftx-founder-samuel-bankman-fried-united" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a>&nbsp;yesterday which revealed that Caroline Ellison had reached a plea deal and will be cooperating with prosecutors in the investigation. FTX co-founder Gary Wang also pleaded guilty and secured a similar deal with the prosecutors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wang revealed during his plea hearing, which was also held on 19 December, that he was directed to alter FTX’s code to give Alameda exclusive access to the exchange. At the time, investors and customers of the exchange were being told that Alameda had no such privileges. Wang did not name the people who issued these directions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both Ellison and Wang will likely be called upon to testify against former associate Sam Bankman-Fried whose next hearing is scheduled for 3 January 2023. SBF was&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-to-be-released-after-posting-250-million-bail/" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a>&nbsp;into the custody of his parents in Palo Alto, California yesterday after he posted a bail bond of $250 million.&nbsp;</p>
