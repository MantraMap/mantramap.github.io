<p>Speculative investors in the cryptocurrency market are putting in long hours trying to predict which coins will have the greatest price appreciation in 2023 and beyond. </p>
<p>Analysts, however, anticipate that Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), and Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) will all see tremendous price increases in the near futureand are hence excellent long-term investments. </p>
<p>For instance, the presale for Orbeon Protocol is still in phase 3 but industry experts project a 60x&nbsp;increase in value within the next few weeks. Let&rsquo;s see why these cryptos are good long-term investments. </p>

<p>Polygon (MATIC) Seeing Even More Mainstream Acceptance</p>
<p>The Polygon ecosystem, including its native coin MATIC, appears to be a promising investment option at the present time. </p>
<p>Meta, Instagram's parent company, has even&nbsp;named Polygon (MATIC) as its inaugural partner for NFT tools, letting its users mint, display, and trade NFTs&nbsp;on&nbsp;Instagram. These partnerships have boosted the Polygon (MATIC) system&rsquo;s popularity over the past few years.</p>
<p>On top of that, JPMorgan used Polygon to execute a $70,000+ live deal on the public blockchain. This is a monumental development on the road to the mainstream acceptance of the cryptocurrency. Polygon (MATIC), therefore, appears to be a promising future technology, and if Polygon (MATIC) continues along this trajectory, it is bound for significant positive price movement. As such, analysts predict Polygon (MATIC) could surpass its ATH this &nbsp;year.</p>

<p>Solana (SOL) Still Surviving the Odds</p>
<p>Solana (SOL) gives out such a solid vibe in the cryptocurrency market. Despite facing challenges that might have derailed less resilient tokens, Solana (SOL) has managed to keep moving ahead. </p>
<p>Since its 2020 launch, Solana (SOL) has been plagued by outages and even become the target of hacking assaults that have resulted in the loss of millions of dollars&rsquo; worth of cryptocurrency. Moreover, there are talks of filing a class action lawsuit against the platform.</p>
<p>Solana (SOL), though, is unmoved by the odds stacked against it. They respond by continually developing cutting-edge innovations. As a result, Solana (SOL) overcame all odds to become one of the most promising crypto assets on the market, and the Solana (SOL) blockchain remains a vibrant and active marketplace for NFTs and dApps.</p>
<p>Polkadot (DOT): The Future of Web 3</p>
<p>When compared to Charles Hoskinson's Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT) is sometimes seen as a more formidable rival. </p>
<p>Polkadot (DOT) &nbsp;is built on a network of parachains which are specialized blockchains that prioritize multichain capabilities. The Polkadot (DOT) group considers their setup to be Web3's inevitable future. </p>
<p>The price of Polkadot (DOT) has dropped from its all-time high of $55 to less than $6 now. In other words, investors stand to gain from the price differential. </p>
<p>But like Solana (SOL), Polkadot's price is very volatile and subject to market forces. However, Polkadot (DOT)&nbsp;is still a good option to hold on to for&nbsp;long-term gains - analysts forecast Polkadot (DOT) to increase further as time goes on, with many suggesting it will increase past its all-time high in 2023.</p>
