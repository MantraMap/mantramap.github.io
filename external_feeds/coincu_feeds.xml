<p>The former FTX CEO is accused of utilizing clients&#8217; money while also committing fraud, money laundering, and providing a false financial image of his company. He might be deported to the United States.</p>



<p><strong>ProPublica</strong>, a nonprofit journalism organization, announced on <strong>Tuesday</strong> that it would refund the <strong>$1.6 million</strong> it had received from <strong>Building a Stronger Future</strong>, SBF&#8217;s family foundation. </p>



<p>The donation was a portion of a <strong>$5 million</strong>, three-year grant to support public health, biosecurity, and coronavirus reporting. The nonprofit said it would find alternative means to pay for the remaining award.</p>



<p>ProPublica co-chief executives<strong> Robin Sparkman</strong> and <strong>Stephen Engelberg</strong> wrote in a memo obtained by <em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2022/12/20/sbf-journalism-grants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Washington Post:</a></em></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“In light of more recent allegations that some of Bankman-Fried’s gains may have come from fraudulent activities, it does not seem appropriate to keep these funds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Early in November, when SBF&#8217;s exchange, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/154082-ftx-ceo-discovers-1b-in-cash-in-custody/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a>, filed for bankruptcy on allegations that he misappropriated billions of dollars in client assets, <strong>ProPublica</strong> <strong>had already terminated the grant.</strong></p>



<p>The SBF family foundation gave <em>Vox Media</em> <strong>$200,000</strong>, and the firm has likewise chosen to refund the entire sum. According to a <em>Vox</em> representative, in the month of August, they have already spent <strong>$14,000 on</strong> difficulties facing society, such as combating global poverty and climate change. It&#8217;s yet unknown how <em>Vox</em> will locate a new financing source or get their money back.</p>



<p>The <strong>$500,000</strong> award provided to the news outlet Intercept as a portion of a <strong>$4 million</strong> grant is being re-examined. On Tuesday, spokesman <strong>Rodrigo Brandao</strong> stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“At this time, we are still gathering the information we need to make a principled decision in accordance with our mission and values,”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The business previously claimed that this had caused a financial gap.</p>



<p><strong>Semafor</strong>, a startup, obtained the money from <a href="https://news.coincu.com/154005-sbf-signed-extradition-to-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SBF</a> in <strong>May</strong> of this year with the hopes of being able to publish independent journalism. They are, however, rethinking their position and waiting for a decision from the authorities.</p>



<p><strong>SBF</strong> supported newsrooms financially and generously with investments and gifts as part of a bigger trend that includes about<strong> $40 million</strong> in political donations this cycle. To Democratic-aligned groups, this was significant. Before the public disclosure of fraud claims, <strong>FTX</strong> was widely considered one of the most ethical companies operating in the crypto industry.</p>

<p><strong>For 2021</strong>, the company, led by former Optiver trader Evgeny Gaevoy, <strong>reported a profit of $582 million</strong>. That includes $400 million in equity and $720 million in assets, Gaevoy told the magazine. The CEO received $12 million in dividends last year.</p>

<p>This year, there has been a huge difference. The sharp decline in the company&#8217;s results <strong>was attributed to the widespread credit crisis that forced some competitors to declare bankruptcy or pull out of trading and lending activities</strong>. Accompanied by a sharp drop in trading volume, the mainstay of companies like Wintermute to make profits.</p>



<p>The market has not yet recovered from the bomb of LUNA-UST, the recent crash of FTX has brought the market development to a halt and it could be the main cause of the prolongation of the crypto winter.</p>

<p>When Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s exchange FTX declared bankruptcy last month, <strong>Wintermute had $59 million locked up</strong>, and Gaevoy and Gurevich erased the money for good. They have consolidated most of the funds they hold on exchanges into three single places: Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance. <strong>And they are currently only trading $1 billion a day while the industry is in crisis mode, down from $3 to $5 billion earlier this year.</strong></p>



<p>Besides that, some of their risk-taking activities in DeFi also come at a heavy price: <a href="https://news.coincu.com/126340-wintermute-ceo-full-update-160m-dollar-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wintermute was hacked for $160 million</a> after a human error in securing one of its digital wallets. <strong>Gaevoy says it won&#8217;t be profitable this year</strong>.</p>

<p>Starting on<strong> December 21, 2022</strong>, the new team will take over the management of <strong>Pawoo.net</strong> with no interruption to current users.</p>



<p><strong>Pawoo</strong>, the second-largest instance of <strong>Mastodon</strong>, has been running since <strong>2017</strong> from <strong>Japan</strong>. Since its launch, it has attracted people from all around the world, including artists, fans of anime, writers of novels, and music lovers. With its <strong>800,000 users</strong>, <strong>Pawoo</strong> has established itself as a <strong>“place to enjoy creative activity and unfettered communication.”</strong></p>



<p>Since <strong>Elon Musk</strong> took over Twitter in <strong>October</strong>, Mastodon&#8217;s popularity has grown quickly. During a Wednesday Twitter space, Musk acknowledged that his contentious move to ban users who promoted <strong>Mastodon</strong> and other social media platforms<strong> &#8220;was a mistake.&#8221;</strong> He <a href="https://news.coincu.com/154102-elon-musk-resigns-at-twitter-doge-drops-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wondered</a> about stepping down as head of <strong>Twitter</strong>.</p>



<p>Despite having features similar to Twitter, <strong>Mastodon</strong> lets individuals create their own social networks and control how they run and what their users may publish. <strong>Mask</strong> team produced the first official app for <strong>Mastodon</strong> in collaboration with the Mastodon core building team and NYC-based design studio <strong>Lickability</strong>. Mask team also maintains two of the most popular instances of <strong>Mastodon</strong>, <strong>mstdn.jp, </strong>and <strong>mastodon.cloud</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Pawoo</strong>, a significant Mastodon instance, will have lots of room to expand. The new operating team is hoping to be a major force behind the company&#8217;s future expansion. The group thinks that the decentralized infrastructure and apps are progressing quickly toward a free and open Internet. Future decentralized social networks, such as <strong>Pawoo</strong>, will be crucial in this effort to create a new, open internet.</p>



<p>According to Coincu, <a href="https://coincu.com/currencies/mask-mask-network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MASK</a>, the native token of the <strong>Mask Network,</strong> is presently trading at <strong>$2.27</strong> after falling by <strong>1.3%</strong> over the previous 24 hours.</p>

<li><em>Alexander Vinnik applied for bail due to the adjournment of the trial.</em></li>



<li><em>Vinnik is known to be the operator of BTC-e and is accused of laundering $4-9 billion.</em></li>



<li><em>A US court said he could receive a sentence of 55 years in prison.</em></li>

<h5><strong>The alleged operator of crypto exchange BTC-e, Alexander Vinnik, has requested bail due to delays in court proceedings.

<p>According to information posted in the federal court papers website for the Northern District of California on Friday, Vinnik&#8217;s defense team is requesting that<strong> all trial-related documents be submitted within 60 days.</strong></p>



<p>The U.S. government has failed to uphold its commitments after pledging to give evidence in this case, according to Alexander Vinnik, <strong>who feels that he should be released on bond or let to exercise his right to a quick trial, the daily Izvestia reported in a report citing the appeal.</strong></p>



<p>On August 5, Alexander Vinnik appeared in federal court in San Francisco and maintained his innocence. Later that month, according to Russian media, who cited his record on the Santa Rita Jail in California, where he was being held, he had been rejected for release on bail.</p>



<p>In September, Vinnik&#8217;s French attorney Frederic Belot pleaded with the Russian government to take him into account for a potential prisoner exchange with the United States, noting that.</p>

<p>The French judicial system also requested his extradition, thus Greek officials chose to deliver him to France first in 2019. <strong>He was deported back to Greece this past summer and immediately extradited to the US after serving his sentence there</strong>. Authorities in France and Greece have disregarded demands from Russia for extradition.</p>



<p>As mentioned in an earlier Coincu News article, the alleged moderator of BTC-e <a href="https://news.coincu.com/1901-french-court-sentenced-btc-e-exchange-operator-alexander-vinnik-to-5-years-in-prison/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was arrested </a>in July 2017, while on vacation in Greece with his family. He has been detained by order of US authorities, who have accused him, among other charges, of laundering between $4 billion and $9 billion through a cryptocurrency exchange.</p>

<p>As was updated in a previous Coincu News article, Loans by Genesis Creditor Groups, one of DCG&#8217;s subsidiaries, <strong>amounted to $1.8 billion and are continuing to grow</strong>. One of its biggest creditors is the Winklevoss brothers&#8217; crypto company <strong>Gemini, which took in $900 million after Genesis&#8217; lender halted customer withdrawals on November 16.</strong></p>



<p>Genesis said it has begun discussions with its largest potential investors, creditors and borrowers, including Gemini and DCG, to agree on a solution to support the company&#8217;s lending business in terms of overall liquidity and meeting customer needs.</p>



<p>On December 6, <strong>Cameron Winklevoss said Gemini and other creditors have formed a creditor committee to work together to resolve the issue</strong>. Returning money to customers is the company&#8217;s top priority.</p>



<p>The plans are still in the early stages of being implemented, <strong>all information will be updated in detail on the <a href="https://www.gemini.com/earn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a></strong> that has been created to update the situation in the most transparent way for the solution finding process for all users Earn Money in exchange for their property.</p>



<p>It can be said that DCG is one of the leading investment funds in the crypto industry. As of November 2021, they have made over 200 investments in various crypto companies. However, the fallout from FTX&#8217;s collapse took its toll on the Genesis subsidiary because of its large exposure. This is the name that is receiving the most attention because it is on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em><em>Binance</em> is being accused of deceiving the public and advertising its services before it was permitted to do so by law by a group of French cryptocurrency investors who have launched a criminal complaint against t<em>he largest crypto exchange in the world</em></em>.</li>



<li><em>According to the lawsuit, unregistered providers of digital financial services are prohibited from advertising their services in France under a regulation that took effect in France in December 2020.</em></li>



<li><em>Following a significant industry slump and a spike in consumer withdrawals, the exchange is working to restore confidence.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>According to the <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/french-clients-file-complaint-against-binance-over-social-media-marketing-2022-12-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a></em> report, Binance has been charged with a crime by a group of French cryptocurrency investors.</strong></h5>

<p>According to attorneys <strong>Etienne de Dreuille</strong> and <strong>Baptiste Bonhomme</strong>, a case was filed with allegations of <strong>&#8220;misleading commercial practice&#8221;.</strong></p>



<p>They claim that <a href="https://news.coincu.com/153882-binance-joined-committee-us-lobbying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> misled the public and advertised its services before it was permitted to do so by law in the nation.</p>



<p>In <strong>May</strong> of this year, the exchange finished the registration process with the French market regulator <strong>AMF</strong>.</p>



<p>According to the lawsuit, unregistered providers of digital financial services are prohibited from advertising their services in France under a regulation that took effect in <strong>France</strong> in<strong> December 2020.</strong></p>



<p>Due to privacy laws, the attorneys refrained from disclosing the identities of the Binance users who filed the case.</p>

<p>According to the complaint, which <em>Reuters</em> was able to view, <strong>Binance ran marketing activities on social media sites like Instagram and Telegram while its legal registration as a digital financial business with French authorities was still waiting.</strong></p>



<p>The group, which used the site and was a client, has complained to the <strong>Paris</strong> prosecutor&#8217;s office. However, neither <strong>Binance</strong> nor the prosecution office have responded.</p>



<p>A formal inquiry may not necessarily be opened by the <strong>French</strong> <strong>Prosecutor</strong> as a result of this complaint, either.</p>



<p>The CEO of Binance, <strong>Changpeng Zhao</strong>, has frequently complimented France for its <strong>&#8220;pro-crypto&#8221;</strong> legislation and has stated that <strong>Binance intended to establish a regional headquarters there for the European market.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Zhao</strong> was quoted by the news outlet <strong>Mediapart</strong> as claiming that<strong> &#8220;Binance has not been promoting its offers in France before it was allowed to,&#8221; </strong>which was the first to report on the French complaint.</p>



<p>Due to a recent sharp increase in client withdrawals from <strong>Binance</strong>, the crypto community is concerned about another devastating catastrophe.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Elon Musk Will Resign as CEO at Twitter after voting results.</em></li>



<li><em>Twitter boss will leave as soon as he finds the right CEO.</em></li>



<li><em>DOGE price drops more than 10% after this news.</em></li>

<h5><strong>The results of the vote generated by Elon Musk himself made it possible for him to step down as CEO of Twitter. Immediately after Dogecoin supporters confirmed the information, the price of this coin meme suddenly dropped by nearly 10%.</strong></h5>

<p>Earlier on December 19, Billionaire Elon Musk and the owner of Twitter posted a public vote for users to vote on whether he should give up the top position of Twitter and said to follow the results of the vote.</p>



<p>Notably, the vote ended on the evening of December 19 with <strong>more than 17.5 million votes, 57.5% of which said &#8220;Yes&#8221; to Mr. Elon Musk&#8217;s proposal to resign.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that, I will just run the software &amp; servers teams.</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1605372724800393216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 21, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>This result also seems to reflect users&#8217; outrage at <strong>Twitter&#8217;s new policy of not allowing users to link to other social networks in their profiles</strong>. According to users, it is a clear violation of each person&#8217;s right to freedom of speech, which Elon Musk has vowed to put first after taking over Twitter.</p>



<p>After the results of the vote, Mr. Elon Musk officially said that he is ready to leave the CEO position of Twitter and move on to manage the software &amp; servers teams, but only if he has found a suitable replacement candidate.</p>



<p>As soon as the vote was posted, the price of <strong>DOGE immediately dropped by nearly 10%</strong>. This is seen as a reaction of the meme coin to its loyal supporters. Currently, the price of <strong>DOGE is still down 2.81% in the last 24 hours. It is currently trading at $0.07269.</strong></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/20/ftx-has-over-1b-in-cash-creditor-meeting-told/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coindesk</a>, the company&#8217;s new management, who took over when FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried stepped down on November 11, said in a due process hearing on Tuesday that<strong> it has determined assets worth more than $1 billion</strong>. The company has placed approximately <strong>$720 million in cash assets</strong>, which the exchange has yet to consolidate, at US financial institutions authorized by the US Department of Justice to hold the funds. <strong>Nearly another $500 million</strong> was held in US institutions.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We are reaching out to all of those banks and changing the signatories on the accounts so that we can get access to the accounts and move the cash as much as we can to authorized depository institutions,”</p>
<cite>FTX&#8217;s new chief financial officer, Mary Cilia said during part of bankruptcy proceedings.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Mary Cilia, FTX&#8217;s new chief financial officer, said <strong>they are contacting the banks and changing the signers on the accounts</strong>, so that they <strong>can access the account and transfer </strong>as much cash as possible to authorized depository institutions.</p>

<p>Of that, another $485 million was deposited in authorized U.S. depository institutions. Meanwhile, about<strong> $130 million in cash has been frozen in Japan</strong>. Additionally, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/153263-insurance-companies-deny-customers-ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX </a>has identified a $6 million deposit for operating expenses such as salaries.</p>



<p>Of the $423 million deposited into unauthorized entities in the United States, the majority was held by a broker Cilia declined to identify.</p>



<p>Steve Coverick, senior director of financial advisors at FTX, Alvarez &amp; Marsal, said at the hearing that they are working to define FTX&#8217;s international crypto assets and <strong>move them to cold wallets through custodial providers like Bitgo</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="999" height="666" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1564.png" alt="FTX CEO

<p>The Chapter 11 bankruptcy hearings were intended to close the exchange, but were complicated by perceived mismanagement and poor recordkeeping under Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s reign.</p>



<p>Cilia said the company has yet to file the declaration of assets or financial position required by US bankruptcy law and now estimates it will be able to do so by April 2023.</p>



<p>The company is still trying to determine how many employees worldwide and how much was withdrawn resulting in bankruptcy.</p>

<p>On <strong>December 20</strong>, the <strong>HNS Blake2B+SHA3 air-cooling miners</strong> went on sale, and they were quickly purchased. According to the Bitmain website, <strong>each buyer may only purchase five units.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bitmain Technologies Ltd. </strong>is a privately owned company headquartered in <strong>Beijing</strong>, <strong>China</strong>, that designs<strong> application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) </strong>chips for Bitcoin mining. In <strong>June 2021</strong>, suspended spot delivery of sales of machines globally, aiming to support local prices following Beijing’s crackdown.</p>



<p>However, the market leader for <a href="https://news.coincu.com/153333-the-bitcoin-whales-market-slashed-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> mining equipment continues to be the Chinese mining behemoth <strong>Bitmain</strong>. The <strong>Antminer S19 XP</strong>, the company&#8217;s sole flagship model, has a hash rate of <strong>134 TH/s</strong> and uses just<strong> 21.5 joules per terahash</strong>. At <strong>$6,164 per unit</strong>, it is <strong>three times as expensive.</strong></p>

<p>Additionally, according to the business website, its <strong>100 TH/s S19 Pro Antmine</strong>r has also run out of stock. Additionally unavailable was the <strong>Bitmain Antminer S19 XP Hydro</strong>, which has hash rates of over<strong> 200 TH/s</strong>.</p>



<p>While this shows that mining is still being actively deployed by miners, the current market conditions are undeniably difficult. The <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/hash-rate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin network hash rate </a>has <strong>dropped</strong> <strong>11%</strong> from its all-time high in early <strong>November</strong> to<strong> 243.8 TH/s</strong> today. However, it is still too high for many miners to make a profit.</p>
