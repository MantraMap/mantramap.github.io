The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will also restrict lending and staking activities facilitated by crypto service providers for their retail customers.</strong></p>
<h2>Singapore Has New Crypto Rules</h2>
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced on Monday “new requirements for Digital Payment Token (DPT) service providers to safekeep customer assets under a statutory trust before the end of the year.” Singapore’s central bank detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>This will mitigate the risk of loss or misuse of customers’ assets, and facilitate the recovery of customers’ assets in the event of a DPT service provider’s insolvency.</p></blockquote>
<p>The central bank noted that these measures were introduced following a public consultation in October last year &#8220;on regulatory measures to enhance investor protection and market integrity in DPT services.” The monetary authority is now seeking public feedback on the draft legislative amendments to the Payment Services Regulations to put these requirements into effect.</p>
<p>MAS started the consultation just before the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November last year. Temasek Holdings, a Singaporean government investment company, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/singapore-governments-temasek-writes-down-275m-investment-in-collapsed-crypto-exchange-ftx/">invested $275 million</a> in FTX and wrote down the entire value of its investment after the crypto firm filed for bankruptcy.</p>

<p>In addition, the Singapore central bank stated Monday that it will also impose restrictions on crypto lending and staking activities. According to the announcement:</p>
<blockquote><p>MAS will also restrict DPT service providers from facilitating lending and staking of DPT tokens by their retail customers.</p></blockquote>
<p>The regulator emphasized that “these activities are generally not suitable for retail public.” However, MAS clarified that DPT service providers can continue to facilitate such activities for their institutional and accredited investors.</p>
<p>MAS further cautioned investors that &#8220;while the segregation and custody requirements will minimize the risk of loss of customers’ assets, consumers may still face significant delays in recovering their assets in the event of insolvency of the service providers.&#8221; The central bank stressed: &#8220;Consumers must also remain vigilant and not deal with unregulated entities, including those based overseas, as they risk losing all their assets.&#8221;</p>

The analysts assert that higher oil revenues and a liberalized import regime will likely see Nigeria record current account surpluses in the medium term. </strong></p>
<h2>Freely Floating Naira</h2>
<p>Just under a month after Nigerian monetary authorities abandoned the fixed exchange rate regime, analysts at Bank of America recently <a href="https://leadership.ng/naira-now-undervalued-after-free-float-bank-of-america/">now</a> argue that the local currency — the naira — is presently undervalued. However, according to analysts, the naira, which is hovering above NGN700 per US dollar, will likely end the year trading at around NGN680 per U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>The latest forecast by Bank of America analysts came more than nine months after an economist with the financial institution <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-bank-of-america-economist-predicts-20-devaluation-of-the-nigerian-currency-in-2023/">predicted</a> a 20% devaluation of the naira which would translate to an exchange rate of NGN520:USD1.</p>
<p>However, as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nigerian-currency-falls-by-more-than-30-after-central-bank-announced-new-forex-market-rules/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News in mid-June, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)’s decision to allow the naira to freely float initially saw the currency tumble from just under NGN470 per dollar to NGN634 per dollar. Since then the currency has continued to lose ground versus the dollar.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-596001 size-full" title="Nigeria Currency Presently Undervalued Says Bank of America Analysts" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/naira-exchange-rate.png" alt="Nigeria Currency Presently Undervalued Says Bank of America Analysts" width="749" height="589" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/naira-exchange-rate-300x236.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/naira-exchange-rate.png 749w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /></p>
<p>As shown by the CBN’s June 26 <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/rates/exchratebycurrency.asp">data</a>, the naira to dollar exchange rate stood at NGN753:USD1. Meanwhile, on the parallel market, one U.S. dollar was buying NGN768 on July 1, 2023.</p>

<h2>Nigeria&#8217;s High Debt Burden</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, in their latest note on Nigeria, the analysts shared some of the reasons which made them conclude that the naira will start 2024 trading at around 680 per dollar. They said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The caution is transition time, aligning rates and still to unlock more USD into the formal market will take some time. When the dust has settled, the value of the naira should be stronger and appreciating.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, in their latest note on Nigeria, the analysts also stated that higher oil revenues ($12 billion more) and a liberalized import regime could still see the West African country recording consistent current account surpluses.</p>
<p>The note also urged Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to consider tackling oil theft because doing this could easily result in the country earning more from hydrocarbons. Doing this will in turn ease Nigeria’s high debt service burden.</p>

Similar to Cboe&#x2019;s refiling of registrations from Fidelity, Vaneck, Invesco, and Wisdomtree, Nasdaq amended the Blackrock spot bitcoin ETF filing, by incorporating Coinbase as a surveillance-sharing agreement (SSA) partner.</strong></p>
<h2>Nasdaq Amends Blackrock Spot Bitcoin ETF Application Alongside Industry Competitors</h2>
<p>Last week, a report from The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/insiders-say-sec-deems-blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-and-other-applications-as-inadequate/">revealed</a> that individuals with knowledge of the situation said the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) expressed dissatisfaction with the numerous spot bitcoin ETF filings submitted in the past two weeks.</p>
<p>The leading U.S. options exchange, Cboe, informed the WSJ that it intended to revise its filings. Subsequently, Cboe <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cboe-resubmits-spot-bitcoin-etf-filings-with-coinbase-as-surveillance-sharing-partner-amid-sec-dissatisfaction/">updated</a> the spot bitcoin ETF filings for Wisdomtree, Vaneck, Invesco, and Fidelity.</p>
<p>At that time, it remained undisclosed whether Blackrock had updated its registration for its spot bitcoin ETF. However, on June 29, 2023, records indicate that Nasdaq revised the Blackrock spot bitcoin <a href="https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/assets/rulebook/NASDAQ/filings/SR-NASDAQ-2023-016_Resubmission.pdf">19b-4 filing</a>. Like the other ETF resubmissions, Blackrock and Nasdaq designated Coinbase as the fund&#x2019;s surveillance-sharing agreement (SSA) partner.</p>
<p>In essence, an SSA partner is an organization that has consented to share surveillance information with another entity. Regarding an exchange-traded fund, an SSA cooperates with the manager to exchange surveillance information aimed at enhancing security and ensuring public safety.</p>
<p>One of the primary concerns regarding a spot bitcoin ETF, as stated in the SEC&#x2019;s numerous denials of spot bitcoin ETFs over the years, is market manipulation and insufficient investor protection.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Blackrock, being the world&#x2019;s largest asset manager, carries significant credibility, leading some to speculate that the financial powerhouse&#x2019;s credentials could facilitate the approval of Blackrock&#x2019;s spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The Spot <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> SSA is expected to be a bilateral surveillance-sharing agreement between Nasdaq and Coinbase that is intended to supplement the exchange&#x2019;s market surveillance program,&#x201D; according to details in Blackrock&#x2019;s filing.</p>
<p>In the ETF filing <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">submitted for approval</a> to the U.S. securities regulator, Coinbase is also designated as Blackrock&#x2019;s custodian. Blackrock&#x2019;s filing elaborates that there is an agreement and term sheet between Coinbase and Nasdaq, which took effect on June 16, 2023.</p>
<p>Some market observers suggest that this could give Blackrock an advantage, as opposed to stating that the funds are simply &#x201C;expecting to enter into an SSA,&#x201D; as <a href="https://twitter.com/NateGeraci/status/1675929147795709957?s=20">explained</a> by Nate Geraci, co-founder of the ETF Institute.</p>

As indicated by Fed policymakers, they estimate the benchmark bank rate to fall within the range of 5.5% to 5.75% by the end of this year. While there are those who predict the possibility of the Fed raising the rate to as high as 6% in 2023, not all market observers share the same level of certainty regarding the central bank&#8217;s decision to raise interest rates before the year concludes.</strong></p>
<h2>Some Doubt Fed&#8217;s Rate Hike Plans, While Others Brace for 6% Ceiling</h2>
<p>For the next 23 days, the market will await the Federal Reserve&#8217;s next rate hike decision. On July 2, 2023, at 7:18 p.m. ET, the CME Fedwatch tool <a href="https://archive.ph/MCT7A#selection-2451.0-2513.4">indicates</a> an 84.3% probability that the central bank will raise the benchmark rate by 25 basis points (bps) to approximately 5.25% to 5.5%.</p>
<p>There is a 15.7% chance that the Fed will pause again at the July 26, 2023, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, according to the Fedwatch tool. Although the Fedwatch tool is generally accurate, its projections are based on market sentiment and are subject to change due to economic conditions and other factors.</p>

<p>Some believe the Federal Reserve policymakers&#8217; current projection of ending the year with the federal funds rate at 5.5% to 5.75% will be realized. Last week, Mary Daly, the president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/san-francisco-fed-president-deems-2-rate-hikes-in-2023-reasonable-urges-caution-in-monetary-policy/">said</a> she considers two more rate hikes this year to be &#8220;reasonable,&#8221; but she also cautioned that the Fed should balance the risks of both &#8220;under- or over-tightening.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are still those who believe that the U.S. central bank will not raise rates further this year. For instance, Ryan Sweet, chief economist at Oxford Economics, <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/banking/federal-reserve/how-much-will-fed-raise-rates-in-2023/">stated</a> to bankrate.com that he does not anticipate any additional hikes this year.</p>
<p>Economist Tuan Nguyen from RSM informed bankrate.com that there is the possibility of one more rate hike. “It’s important for the Fed at the moment to have all the options on the table,” Nguyen explained. “Whether it’s the July meeting or the September meeting, all of those meetings will be live, meaning the Fed will have the options of whether to pause or hike.”</p>
<p>In late May, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-boss-warns-everyone-should-be-prepared-for-interest-rates-going-higher-from-here/">informed</a> analysts and reporters that individuals “should be prepared for rates going higher from here.” At the time, Dimon mentioned the federal funds rate could potentially reach 6% or 7%.</p>
<h2>Study Says 6.5% Bank Rate is Needed to Tame Inflation, Expert Insists &#8216;We&#8217;ll Wind Up Somewhere Around 6%&#8217; This Year</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-24/fed-may-need-to-hike-to-6-5-to-cool-prices-new-study-says">research paper</a> written by Kermit Schoenholtz, a professor emeritus at New York University, Stephen Cecchetti from Brandeis University, Michael Feroli of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Frederic Mishkin from Columbia University, and Peter Hooper of Deutsche Bank AG suggests that the U.S. central bank might have to increase the federal funds rate to 6.5% in order to address inflation.</p>
<p>“Our analysis casts doubt on the ability of the Fed to engineer a soft landing in which inflation returns to the 2% target by the end of 2025 without a mild recession,” the paper details.</p>

<p>Tom Luongo, the publisher of “Gold, Goats &#8216;n Guns” told Kitco’s lead anchor and editor-in-chief Michelle Makori that he believes the rate will end up at 6% this year. &#8220;I think [Powell] will raise again, and possibly even raise multiple times before the end of the year,” Luongo <a href="https://youtu.be/B4dsDLrBZZ0">said in an interview</a>. “We&#8217;ll wind up somewhere around 6 percent by the end of the year,” he added.</p>
<p>Luongo also said that he believes more bank failures are coming. After the three largest bank failures in the U.S. in 2023, more banks are due to fail he said. &#8220;I just see the entire banking system imploding, detonating like a nuclear bomb,&#8221; Luongo told Makori.</p>

<h2>Revolut Joins Bakkt, Robinhood, and Etoro in Delisting Specific Crypto Assets</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.revolut.com/en-US/">Revolut</a> is joining the ranks of Bakkt, Robinhood, and Etoro as it plans to delist <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/MATIC/">polygon (MATIC)</a>, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/SOL/">solana (SOL)</a>, and <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA/">cardano (ADA)</a>, according to a <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/237499/revolut-polygon-solana-cardano-crypto-tokens?utm_source=telegram2&utm_medium=social">report</a> by Yogita Khatri from The Block. The report reveals that Revolut sent an email to its U.S. customers, stating that the decision was prompted by &#x201C;changing laws and regulations around cryptocurrency in the [United States].&#x201D;</p>
<p>Revolut, based in London, United Kingdom, was founded on July 1, 2015, by Nikolay Storonsky and Vlad Yatsenko. Over the past eight years, the company&#x2019;s neobanking business has grown significantly, with a presence in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. As per Khatri&#x2019;s report, Revolut informed the publication that one of the reasons for delisting the coins is the decision by Revolut&#x2019;s partner, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bakkt-takes-proactive-measures-delists-polygon-solana-and-cardano-amid-regulatory-crackdowns/">Bakkt</a>, to delist the tokens.</p>
<p>Since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) crackdown on exchanges such as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bittrex-requests-dismissal-of-sec-lawsuit-arguing-for-congressional-approval-in-crypto-regulation/">Bittrex</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">Coinbase</a>, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-faces-legal-action-by-sec-for-violating-us-securities-laws/">Binance</a>, numerous crypto assets have been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-sec-identifies-12-crypto-tokens-as-securities-in-binance-lawsuit/">categorized</a> as unregistered securities by the regulatory agency. MATIC, SOL, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a> have been implicated in the SEC lawsuits and have been designated as investment contracts. In response to the lawsuits, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robinhood-to-delist-cardano-solana-and-polygon-amidst-sec-regulatory-pressure/">Robinhood</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/etoro-to-delist-algo-mana-dash-and-matic-for-us-customers-amid-evolving-regulatory-landscape/">Etoro</a>, and Bakkt have all removed multiple crypto assets from their platforms, citing U.S. regulations as the reason for the decision.</p>

<p>The report also states that Revolut customers in the U.S. are now unable to purchase these tokens, and they have until September 18th to trade them. According to the email reviewed by Khatri, if the delisted crypto assets are not sold by that deadline, they will be liquidated at the prevailing exchange rate on that day, converting them into U.S. dollars.</p>

<h2>Monero (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a>)</h2>
<p>Monero (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a>) was one of Monday&#x2019;s notable gainer&#x2019;s, as the cryptocurrency climbed to a five-month high.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a>/USD hit an intraday peak of $172.11, which comes a day after trading at a bottom of $163.37.</p>
<p>As a result of the rally, monero peaked at its strongest point since February 4 last year, when price reached a top at $174.95.</p>

<p>Overall, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a> has now traded in the green for sixteen of the last nineteen sessions, climbing by over $40.00 in that time.</p>
<p>Earlier gains have now eased, as bulls failed to sustain the breakout ceiling at the $172.00 level, with price now trading at $170.73.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for this was the relative strength index (RSI), which has hit a resistance of its own at 73.00.</p>

<h2>Cosmos (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" target="_blank">ATOM</a>)</h2>
<p>Another notable gainer on Monday was cosmos (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" target="_blank">ATOM</a>), which climbed to a four-week high to start the week.</p>
<p>Following a low of $9.40 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" target="_blank">ATOM</a>/USD raced to a high at $9.93 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>The move saw cosmos climb to its highest level since June 7, which is the last time it was above $10.00.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, this level also appears to be a resistance level, with bulls so far struggling to break this zone.</p>
<p>This will likely occur once price strength, which is currently tracking at 59.33, moves past a ceiling at 60.00.</p>
<p>Should this take place, the next target for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" target="_blank">ATOM</a> bulls could possibly be a higher ceiling at $11.00.</p>

Additionally, Litecoin is on the verge of a reward halving, with only 30 days remaining until its block reward subsidy decreases from 12.5 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> to 6.25 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>.</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Litecoin Climbs Over 40% in 2 Weeks &#x2014; Network Hashrate Taps an All-Time High</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Thirteen days ago, the crypto exchange EDX, with backing from Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, and Fidelity Digital Assets, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-backed-by-fidelity-schwab-citadel-launches-with-trading-of-4-cryptocurrencies/">revealed</a> its plans to list four different cryptocurrencies: <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>. Since the exchange&#x2019;s launch, both <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> have experienced significant price increases over the past fortnight, outshining many other digital assets. In the span of 30 days, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> has risen by 13.7%, and in the last two weeks alone, it has surged over 40% against the U.S. dollar. Year-to-date, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> has gained 119.7%, propelling the digital currency into the top ten ranks of the crypto economy.</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to coingecko.com, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> is currently ranked 10th, while coinmarketcap.com (CMC) places <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> in the ninth position. The discrepancy arises because coingecko.com includes lido&#x2019;s staked ether (STETH) in the top ten, whereas CMC does not. As of 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) on July 3, 2023, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> is being traded between $110 and $114 per unit, with a market valuation slightly exceeding $8 billion. Among nearly 10,000 crypto assets, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> ranks seventh in terms of global trade volume on Monday, with $1.274 billion traded within a 24-hour period. Coinbase emerges as the most active exchange for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> trades on Monday, with the most popular <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> trading pair being tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>).</p>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Litecoin&#x2019;s hashrate has also witnessed a significant increase, with approximately 100 terahash per second (TH/s) of hashpower added to the chain since June 19. At that time, the chain had a dedicated hashrate of 660 TH/s, while presently it stands at 760 TH/s. The surge in hashrate has propelled Litecoin&#x2019;s hashpower to reach an all-time high this year. On June 28, 2023, specifically at block height 2,499,942, Litecoin&#x2019;s hashrate reached a <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/litecoin/hashrate-chart">record-breaking 958.36 TH/s</a>. Around 22 mining pools are involved in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> mining, with Viabtc taking the lead by contributing a total hashrate of 254.91 TH/s over the past 24 hours.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">30 Days Remain Until the Next Litecoin Halving</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In the meantime, the Litecoin network is preparing for a <a href="https://explorer.viawallet.com/halving">reward halving</a> expected to occur in 30 days, around August 3, 2023. During this event, the subsidy will be reduced by 50%, from 12.5 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> to 6.25 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>. With just over 17,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> blocks left until the next halving, blocks are mined on average every 2.5 minutes. Presently, there are approximately 73,280,183 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> in circulation, with 10,717,762 blocks remaining until the block subsidy ceases. Statistics indicate that there are 7,145,978 unique addresses holding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> today, with the top ten wallets accounting for 13.58% of the total supply. Moreover, the top 100 holders control approximately 38.58% of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>&#x2019;s entire supply, as per the current rich list data.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Similar to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-cash-hashrate-gains-momentum-miners-flock-to-bch-as-profitability-surges/">bitcoin cash (BCH)</a>, only time will tell whether the price, hashrate, and overall activity of the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> network will be sustained beyond the EDX announcement and the upcoming halving. Just like bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> has historically experienced a price surge leading up to each block reward halving. It has been quite some time since <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> held a position in the top ten largest market caps, although it was once a prominent contender for many years in its early days. Despite <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>&#x2019;s year-to-date increase of 119.7%, its current value remains 73% lower than its all-time high on May 10, 2021, when <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> reached $410 per unit.</p>

This is due to the fourth of July Independence Day celebrations, which will see some markets in the United States closed. Once reopened, the FOMC minutes, and non-farm payrolls report will be some of the key fundamentals released. Bitcoin largely consolidated today.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) was once again in consolidation, as the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency remained below a key resistance level for a third straight day.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD moved to a peak at $30,789.11 earlier in the day, less than 24-hours after nearing a drop below $30,000.</p>
<p>Despite the marginal gain, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> remained below a key level of resistance at the $30,800 for the third straight session.</p>

<p><!-- TradingView Widget END --></p>
<p>One of the reasons for this was due to the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) hovering below a ceiling of its own at 69.00.</p>
<p>The index is now tracking at 66.64, which is near a point where it has flat lined for the past few days.</p>
<p>There is a strong chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> may continue this trend until U.S. markets return from the Independence Day break.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) on the other hand, made steady gains to start the week, moving towards the $2,000 mark in the process.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD jumped to an intraday high at $1,973.64 on Monday, a day after the price fell to a bottom at $1,895.91.</p>
<p>As a result of this rally, the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency once again reached its strongest point since May 6.</p>

The card, available in both virtual and physical forms, allows users to make any consumer payments directly with cryptocurrency through LBank&#8217;s credit, and also supports local cash withdrawals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LBank&#8217;s nearly 9 million users are expected to begin using this card in Q3 2023, and the exchange&#8217;s VIP users will be granted the exclusive right to early access. The credit card will connect to LBank users&#8217; digital assets and can be used on various payment platforms like Google Pay. Upon acquiring the card, the app allows detailed viewing of each recharge and consumption record, enabling users to stay on top of their financial status at all times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using this card, LBank users can consume their assets within the exchange or withdraw assets in the form of fiat currency. The card does not have the quota limitations of ordinary credit cards; both consumption and withdrawals are unlimited. LBank&#8217;s technical team indicated that more detailed information about payment options, such as fee tiers, will be announced as the card&#8217;s launch date approaches. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users who wish to obtain the LBank credit card can order it from the exchange&#8217;s website. The card comes in different options, including a metal version. Certain users can also acquire a specially offered VIP version that provides up to 2% cashback when used. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For us, an important point is that users from all over the world can order and use our credit card. Our vision is to make crypto assets safer and circulation freer. Launching our own credit card is a significant step towards achieving this goal,&#8221; stated Eric He, the founder of LBank.</span></p>

The partnership entails Okx, which previously sponsored the club&#8217;s training kit, becoming the sleeve sponsor for both the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s teams. Haider Rafique, the company&#8217;s CMO, expressed hopes that the deal will enhance visibility and generate interest in the broader blockchain industry.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In recent years, a host of crypto companies have partnered with sports brands on similar ventures.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Notable mentions include Crypto.com <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ufc-partners-with-crypto-com-sources-say-175-million-deal-is-mma-firms-largest-sponsorship/">teaming up</a> with the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), and also Binance who partnered with football teams like FC Shakhtar, Lazio from Italy, and Porto from Portugal.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What Will Okx Get From the Partnership?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">For Okx, chief marketing officer Hiader Rafique hopes that the deal will help rally the company&#8217;s workforce, as well as the wider blockchain community.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaking on Friday at the launch event, Rafique stated that, “Typically when you do these deals the perception is that it is designed to boost exposure and growth. For us, it was a way to bring employees together and get the team excited. So there is quantitative success, but also qualitative success.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">He added that, “Two years ago, we were a brand recognized in Asia, but not in the Western world, so with the success (Manchester City) has had over the years, we have become visible on a global stage. So, the amplification this partnership brings is not just Okx, but the entire industry.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Man City Is Digitizing Its Fan Base</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Manchester City currently has around 600 million global fans, with only 3-4% based in the United Kingdom, according to CEO Ferran Soriano.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Soriano hopes the partnership will help grow the team&#8217;s digital assets, giving more fans access to engage with the football club and its players.</p>
<p>The team completed an unprecedented “treble” this past year, winning the Champions League, Premier League, and FA Cup, which has helped make Manchester City one of the biggest names in the sport.</p>
<p>Soriano believes that Okx’s commitment to winning is a perfect fit for the ethos at Manchester City.</p>
