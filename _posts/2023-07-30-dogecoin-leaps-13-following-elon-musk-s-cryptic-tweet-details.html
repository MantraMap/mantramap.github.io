This time around, Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and the world&#8217;s largest manufacturer of electric vehicles, Tesla, is creating a flurry of excitement around cryptocurrencies, maybe with a particular focus on Dogecoin, the well-known parody cryptocurrency. The crypto community has taken note of Musk&#8217;s recent acts since they continue to demonstrate his influence in altering the market dynamics of digital currency. The billionaire Musk, who is also the owner of the X app (formerly known as Twitter), posted on Sunday that &#8220;something special is coming soon.&#8221; Related Reading: CryptoPunks Toughness Tested As NFT Succumbs To 60% Drop In 1 Week Elon Musk Tweet Does It Again This tweet received a lot of positive feedback from the cryptocurrency community, especially from accounts with a Dogecoin theme. Something special coming soon — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 29, 2023 Based on Musk&#8217;s repeated references to this development in the past, many people, including the influencer David Gokhstein, anticipate that X will add DOGE &#8211; the largest meme coin &#8211; as a payment option. This anticipation arises from the fact that Elon Musk has previously made a number of very quiet signals that a similar action may be planned. Dogecoin (DOGE) saw a stunning price increase on Friday, garnering a lot of attention in the cryptocurrency community. On that particular day, DOGE&#8217;s price noticedably increased by over 10%, breaking past the $0.07 barrier mark.

However, the meme coin really proved its worth on a weekly basis, rising in value by about 13% in response to Musk&#8217;s post.
