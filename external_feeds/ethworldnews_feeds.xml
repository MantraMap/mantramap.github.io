<ul><li>Gemini has launched its offshore crypto derivatives trading platform in thirty countries.&nbsp;</li><li>The Gemini Foundation is now offering BTC perpetual contracts to customers in qualified jurisdictions.</li><li>The new exchange is not available to customers in the United States, the United Kingdom, or the European Union.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>U.S-based crypto exchange Gemini’s offshore crypto derivatives trading platform has been launched less than two weeks after initially announced last month. The Gemini Foundation is now live in over two dozen countries including Singapore, Hong Kong, India, Switzerland, Bermuda, Turkey, Brazil, and Vietnam.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Gemini Foundation Not Available In US, UK, And EU</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini/status/1653391869395767297" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter thread</a> posted by the Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange earlier today, the Gemini Foundation is open for trading to customers in all available jurisdictions. Users from the 30 available jurisdictions can now trade BTC perpetual contracts denominated in the exchange’s GUSD stablecoin using up to 100x leverage. The new crypto derivatives exchange plans to launch an ETH/GUSD perpetual contract in the coming weeks. </p>



<p>The offshore trading platform will not be available to customers in the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union. In the available jurisdictions, both retail and institutional traders can access the platform. Gemini revealed that it will be expanding its derivatives offerings with additional perpetual contracts, dated futures, and options in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Gemini Foundation offers customers a capital-efficient, highly available, and trusted venue to trade derivatives. Purpose-built for both individuals and institutions, Gemini Foundation combines powerful trading tools with an elegant user experience.”</p></blockquote>



<p>A report from <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/05/02/gemini-launches-offshore-crypto-derivatives-platform/" rel="nofollow noopener">Fortune</a> revealed that the new derivatives exchange is based in Singapore. As <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-non-us-crypto-derivatives-platform/">reported</a> earlier, the platform will introduce spot products as well. Customers will have to convert their USD and USD Coins to GUSD on a 1:1 basis in order to fund their trading account. Perpetual funding payments will have to be made exclusively in GUSD.</p>



<p>News of the derivatives trading platform’s launch comes on the same day that Coinbase announced the launch of its Bermuda-based crypto derivatives exchange, Coinbase International Exchange. The American exchanges’ global push is partly due to the lack of regulatory clarity in the US and the hostile stance of regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Coinbase has launched an offshore crypto derivatives exchange based in Bermuda.&nbsp;</li><li>Coinbase International Exchange will allow non-U.S. customers to trade perpetual futures.&nbsp;</li><li>The Bermuda Monetary Authority recently granted a regulatory license to the American crypto giant.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In a significant push for global expansion, American crypto giant Coinbase has announced the launch of Coinbase International Exchange, its offshore crypto derivatives trading platform. The new derivatives exchange is based in the Caribbean nation of Bermuda. The launch of the offshore exchange comes in light of intensifying scrutiny of crypto firms in the United States.  </p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase International Exchange Will Settle All Trades In USDC</strong></h2>



<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/introducing-coinbase-international-exchange" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> by Coinbase, its new crypto derivatives exchange will allow users based in eligible jurisdictions outside the United States, to trade perpetual futures. The new Bermuda-based trading venture aims to tap into the perpetual futures trading space, which reportedly accounted for almost 75% of the global crypto trading volume in 2022. </p>



<p>Coinbase International Exchange listed BTC and ETH perpetual futures contracts earlier today. These contracts will initially allow institutional clients to trade with up to 5x leverage. The new platform will not require any fiat on-ramps as all trading will be settled in USD Coin (USDC). It is important to note that the platform is not available for retail clients at this time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The announcement of the new exchange comes less than two weeks after Coinbase <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-launch-offshore-exchange-soon/">revealed</a> that the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) had granted it a regulatory license to operate in the British Overseas Territory. The crypto exchange lauded Bermuda’s favorable regulatory landscape and highlighted its high level of transparency, compliance, and cooperation. The exchange assured that it&#8217;s still committed to the American market, but highlighted the countries around the world that are setting up responsible regulatory frameworks for crypto.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We would like to see the US take a similar approach instead of regulation by enforcement which has led to a disappointing trend for crypto development in the US.” </p></blockquote>



<p>The launch of the overseas exchange comes amid the crackdown on crypto businesses in the United States. Regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) have booked several crypto firms since the beginning of the year in what industry players have described as a campaign against the crypto industry. The SEC issued a Wells notice to Coinbase last month, stating the regulator’s intention to initiate enforcement actions against the exchange.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The plaintiff&#8217;s complaint alleges that Coinbase broke biometric privacy laws in Illinois.</li><li>A user named Michael Massel damages on the grounds that the crypto exchange violated state laws when carrying out know-your-customer checks and unlawfully stored sensitive user data.</li><li>The California District Court case is the latest battle faced by crypto exchange Coinbase on U.S. soil as the company explores offshore jurisdictions.</li></ul>



<p>Coinbase crypto exchange has been <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67306707/1/massel-v-coinbase-inc/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67306707/1/massel-v-coinbase-inc/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sued in a California District Court</a> for allegedly violating Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA and using sensitive customer identification data unlawfully. </p>



<p>The suit alleges that the crypto company&#8217;s biometric data collection through its know-your-customer (KYC) practices was unlawfully obtained and stored without implementing providing the necessary details on this verification policy. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s a common requirement among some crypto exchanges, especially those operating in the U.S. and other strict jurisdictions, for users to confirm their identity and upload a photo for verification. Regulators make KYC mandatory as an anti-money laundering tactic and a way to fight illicit finance. </p>



<p>According to BIPA rules, a company that collects biometric data must inform the user in writing of the data collection including the specific purpose and length of term for which the data will be stored.</p>



<p>Written consent is also required from the customer and the company has to publish publicly‐available written retention schedules and guidelines for permanently destroying biometric identifiers and biometric information.</p>



<p>The suit claims that the crypto company does not comply with these rules and instead “wrongfully profits” from the data by collecting biometric data to “further enhance Coinbase and its online ‘app-based’ platform.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the suit alleges that Coinbase “disclosed, redisclosed, or otherwise disseminated Plaintiff’s biometric information to numerous third parties including, but not limited to, Jumio Corporation, Onfido, Inc., Au10tix LTD, Solaris AG, and Liquid Co. Ltd.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Plaintiff, Michael Massel, a user of the exchange, is seeking $5,000 in damages for every “intentional and reckless violation” of Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) and a further $1,000 for each other violation his legal team can find.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Coinbase, Crypto Companies Spar With US Regulators</h2>



<p>Coinbase, like a host of crypto businesses, is also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-preparing-legal-battle-u-s-sec/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-preparing-legal-battle-u-s-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taking heat from U.S. regulators</a> pursuing what the industry describes as a “regulation-by-enforcement strategy,” where federal agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) prefer to serve up lawsuits and legal threats rather than draft new guidelines for the still-nascent industry. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, the SEC alleged that the staking services offered by exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase were unregistered securities and began a crackdown against them, issuing the former with a $30mn fine and the latter with a Wells Notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hostile climate appears to be <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-launch-offshore-exchange-soon/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-launch-offshore-exchange-soon/" rel="noreferrer noopener">driving Coinbase further offshore</a>. Last month the exchange announced it received a license to operate in Bermuda, and is in talks with the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FRSA), a regulator of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM)—a crypto-friendly free economic zone in the territory of UAE—about the potential of opening a regulated exchange there.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the company is locked in a <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-responds-to-secs-wells-notice/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-responds-to-secs-wells-notice/" rel="noreferrer noopener">legal bottleneck</a> with U.S. regulators over securities laws and clearer crypto laws. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>VARA said OPNX solicited Dubai customers through marketing campaigns and social media without the appropriate regulatory approval.</li><li>Dubai’s regulator said they were assessing whether further action might be needed against the latest crypto venture from Su Zhu and Kyle Davies.</li><li>OPNX CEO Leslie Lamb rebutted that the exchange isn’t available to Dubai residents. </li><li>At the same time, Zhu and Kyle claim no influence over the platform’s operations after contributing the initial ideas for OPNX.</li></ul>



<p>Crypto claims trading exchange OPNX must navigate more controversy after its lackluster launch in early April this year. </p>



<p>The Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) lambasted the crypto venture started by Su Zhu and Kyle Davies for marketing an unregistered digital asset business to Dubai residents and customers, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-02/dubai-reprimands-three-arrows-founders-over-new-crypto-project?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-02/dubai-reprimands-three-arrows-founders-over-new-crypto-project?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a> Tuesday.</p>



<p>OPNX is a crypto exchange that allows users to trade claims from defunct entities like FTX and Three Arrows Capital, the very same bankrupt hedge fund previously led by Zhu and Davies. The platform hosts executives from other troubled crypto businesses like CoinFLEX’s Mark Lamb and Sudhu Arumugam. Leslie Lamb currently spearheads the venture as CEO.</p>



<p>On February 27, Dubai’s VARA issued a “cease and desist” order to OPNX. A second cautionary notice was published shortly after on March 10 to both the founder and the crypto platform itself. </p>



<p>The platform later <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/opnx-crypto-exchange-3ac-coinflex-live/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/opnx-crypto-exchange-3ac-coinflex-live/" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> in April, recording unimpressive trading volumes at launch, and continued to leverage social media for marketing campaigns. VARA claims this move was also targeted at onboarding Dubai users. </p>



<p>Following its first two notices to OPNX and its founders before the platform launched, VARA published a written reprimand to all four co-founders for attempting to run an unregistered crypto business in the Emirates. </p>



<p>The notice echoed regulatory concerns cited in February, and March, and an “Investor and Marketplace Alert” published about OPNX shortly before the exchange launched in April.</p>



<p>OPNX CEO Leslie Lamb, another subject of VARA’s regulatory torch, rebutted the claims and said the company had not violated any of the Emirati’s policies. OPNX and VARA are working together to investigate the matter, CEO Lamb suggested in a WhatsApp text cited in Tuesday’s report. </p>



<p>3AC co-founder Su Zhu also claimed that he and Kyle were not involved in daily administrative duties at OPNX despite ideating the original concept for the crypto claims exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CEO Lamb also said that “at no point in time have UAE customers been able to open an account on OPNX”.</p>



<h2>Dubai’s Burgeoning Crypto-Hub Plans&nbsp;</h2>



<p>VARA’s regulatory move against OPNX comes as Dubai works to develop its jurisdiction as a <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/dubais-crypto-regulator-vara-to-make-its-metaverse-debut-in-the-sandbox-metaverse/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/dubais-crypto-regulator-vara-to-make-its-metaverse-debut-in-the-sandbox-metaverse/" rel="noreferrer noopener">global hub for crypto innovation </a>and digital asset businesses. Several crypto businesses like Binance and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/kraken-crypto-license-uae/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/kraken-crypto-license-uae/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kraken</a> have received regulatory nods from UAE watchdogs. </p>



<p>Apart from publishing a licensing regime through its crypto watchdog VARA, the Emirate state has also reportedly made joint efforts with other members of the UAE to exit the FATF’s “gray list”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Financial Action Task Force maintains a list of jurisdictions that supposedly need to beef up measures that combat money laundering and illicit wealth.</p>

<ul><li>Poloniex has agreed to pay $7.6 million as part of a settlement agreement with the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control.&nbsp;</li><li>The multi-million dollar fee will settle charges related to the alleged violation of multiple sanctions programs.</li><li>The crypto exchange was accused of 66,000 violations of multiple sanctions programs between 2014 and 2019.</li></ul>



<p>Crypto exchange Poloniex is set to shell out a significant chunk of cash after reaching a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Treasury. The California-based exchange has agreed to pay a whopping $7.59 million to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in order to settle allegations related to violation of <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/huobi-kucoin-russian-banks-evade-sacntion/">sanctions</a>. </p>



<h2><strong>Poloniex Accused Of Over 65,000 Violations In 5 Years</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20230501_33" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from the Department of Treasury’s OFAC, Poloniex has agreed to remit $7,591,630 to settle its potential civil liability for apparent violations of sanctions enforced by the agency against Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria. The agency alleged that between January 2014 and November 2019, Poloniex allowed customers from sanctioned jurisdictions to initiate transactions on its trading platform. These included trades, deposits, and withdrawals with a combined value exceeding $15 million. The agency highlighted the lapse by the exchange in enforcing appropriate KYC norms. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This enforcement action, similar to other recent cases involving online digital asset companies, emphasizes the importance for new companies and those involved in emerging technologies to incorporate sanctions compliance into their business functions at the outset, especially when the companies seek to offer financial services to a global customer base.</p><cite>Office of Foreign Assets Control</cite></blockquote>



<p>OFAC acknowledged that while the alleged violations were not voluntarily self-disclosed they were non-egregious. OFAC agency stated that under its Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines, the penalty imposed on the crypto exchange would be over $99 million and that the final settlement amount was indicative of the agency’s consideration of the general factors under the enforcement guidelines. The agency also took into consideration the fact that Poloniex was a small startup at the time of the alleged violations.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Justin Sun transferred 56 million TUSD to Binance earlier today.&nbsp;</li><li>The transaction was flagged by the crypto community who accused Sun of farming today’s SUI airdrop.&nbsp;</li><li>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao warned Sun against using the whale transfer to farm SUI by staking the TUSD.&nbsp;</li><li>The Tron founder has issued an apology to Zhao for the misunderstanding over the whale transaction.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Tron founder Justin Sun has issued an apology to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-us-ends-1-billion-voyager-deal/">Binance</a> CEO Changpeng Zhao after getting called out for attempting to participate in the <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/introducing-sui-sui-on-binance-launchpool-farm-sui-by-staking-bnb-and-tusd-f76980d5d5e54d80b1348fd446e8f5d3" rel="nofollow noopener">Binance Launchpool</a> for SUI, the native token of the layer 1 blockchain Sui using a whale transaction.</p>



<h2><strong>Justin Sun Claims Whale Transaction Was To Stabilize TUSD</strong></h2>



<p>The controversy started earlier today after Justin Sun transferred 56 million TUSD to Binance. Whale watchers on Twitter flagged the transfer as a whale transaction, leading to considerable speculation among the crypto community. Crypto Twitter concluded that Sun was attempting to farm SUI’s airdrop by staking millions of TUSD, brewing further controversy. </p>



<p>Sun defended his actions by claiming that the transfer was part of Tron DAO Venture’s efforts as TUSD’s cooperative market maker to stabilize the price of the stablecoin. He clarified that the purpose was not to participate in Binance’s activities including the launchpool for SUI. </p>



<p>The Tron founder acknowledged that some of his colleagues had used part of the funds to participate in the launchpool and farm SUI tokens because they “did not understand the purpose of the funds.” This was followed by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1652949031524376579" rel="nofollow noopener">issuing</a> a public warning to Justin Sun regarding his participation in the airdrop. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Our team told Justin, if he uses any of these to grab the LaunchPool Sui token, we will &#8220;take action against it&#8221;. SMH. Binance LaunchPool are meant as air drops for our retail users, not just for a few whales.” </p><cite>Changpeng Zhao, Founder and CEO of Binance</cite></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We sincerely apologize for this oversight <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">@cz_binance</a>!</p>&mdash; H.E.

</div></figure>



<p>Justin Sun responded and stated that the TUSD deposit was meant for facilitating market-making between leading TUSD exchanges and not participating in the airdrop. However, he again acknowledged that some members of his team “inadvertently” used some of the funds to farm the SUI airdrop. “We sincerely apologize for this oversight,” Sun <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1652955224032829440" rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a>.</p>

<p>CoinMarketCap, the crypto data aggregator site owned by the world’s largest crypto exchange, is venturing into the entertainment space with the launch of its very own reality TV show called Killer Whales. The show is inspired by Shark Tank, the popular investing show featuring billionaire investor Mark Cuban and former <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/?s=kevin">FTX</a> spokesperson Kevin O’Leary.</p>



<h2><strong>Altcoin Daily Will Co-Produce Killer Whales With CoinMarketCap</strong></h2>



<p>Dubbed the Shark Tank of crypto, Killer Whales will feature a panel of judges or “whales”, who will hear pitches from crypto entrepreneurs and decide if they wish to invest in them and provide mentorship. A recent update posted by Hello Labs on CoinMarketCap&#8217;s <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/644cf3db4bebb711c962723e" rel="nofollow noopener">blog</a> revealed that crypto influencer duo Aaron Arnold and Austin Arnold, better known as Altcoin Daily, will produce and star in the reality show. Other judges include Cordell Broadus, AKA Champ Medici.</p>



<p>Sander Gortjes, the CEO of Hello Labs, recently took to Twitter to announce that the hunt for Web3 projects to feature in Killer Whales will begin on May 2, 2023. Starting tomorrow, crypto projects and entrepreneurs will be able to apply to enter and stand a chance to win the show. Killer Whale will begin filming in June 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“2022 was not a great year for crypto’s reputation, dragged through the mud and branded as the wild west by the mainstream media. Killer Whales takes strides to rebuild trust and shine a light on the founders that are innovating.” </p><cite>Paul Caslin, Founder, HELLO Labs</cite></blockquote>



<p>To coincide with Killer Whale’s release, CoinMarketCap, and Hello Labs will also launch an exclusive Show Producer NFT collection. Holders of these NFTs will be able to influence key show decisions and be a part of the production. Hello Labs’ <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/hello-labs/" rel="nofollow noopener">HELLO</a> token as much as 16% over the past 24 hours thanks to the hype around the upcoming crypto reality show. At the time of writing, HELLO was trading at $0.060, with a market capitalization of $32.2 million. </p>

<p>Crypto exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-non-us-crypto-derivatives-platform/">Gemini</a> has come one step closer to recovering the funds stuck at Barry Silbert’s struggling crypto firm Genesis. Gemini has announced that it is set to enter a mediation period with Genesis, the Digital Currency Group (DCG), Genesis’ Unsecured Creditors Committee, and an ad hoc Creditor Committee led by the Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange. </p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>Gemini Expresses Frustration With Genesis’ Restructuring Pace</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini took to <a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini/status/1652779387970899969" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today to give its customers an update regarding the situation with Genesis and associated debtors. According to the Twitter thread, the crypto exchange has reached an agreement with Genesis and the Digital Currency Group to start a 30-day mediation process in order to come up with a final resolution regarding the outstanding payment as soon as possible. The parties that will participate in the mediation process include the Unsecured Creditors Committee (UCC) and the ad hoc Creditors Committee led by Gemini. </p>



<p>Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane is expected to issue an order directing the mediation as early as May 1, 2023. The mediation process will be focused on the economic contribution of DCG to Genesis’ bankruptcy estate in order to bring resolution to its bankruptcy plan and benefit all creditors, including the Earn users of Gemini. While the mediation provides for a 30-day period, all parties are expected to work expeditiously as soon as the mediation process begins, given the upcoming maturing of a $630 million loan owed to Genesis by its parent firm DCG.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If DCG is unable to pay and/or restructure its debt, DCG risks defaulting on its obligations. So while the mediation is scheduled for up to 30 days, the parties are expected to work expeditiously towards agreement in the immediate window.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Gemini has clarified that it is supportive of the mediation process and looks forward to working with all parties to reach a resolution as soon as possible. The crypto exchange also expressed its frustration on record before Judge Lane regarding the pace of progress among the parties involved in Genesis’ restructuring efforts and emphasized the need for urgency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/silvergate-si-stock-down-11-with-u-s-fdic/">FDIC</a>) has reportedly issued a consent order to New Jersey-based Cross River Bank. The bank is widely regarded as a crypto-friendly institution that caters to several businesses operating in the crypto space including crypto exchange Coinbase and USD Coin issuer Circle. </p>



<h2><strong>Cross River Bank: Consent Order Will Have No Impact On Growth</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-28/cross-river-bank-receives-fdic-enforcement-order-over-lending" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the FDIC issued a cease and desist order to Cross River Bank over alleged “unsafe and unsound” banking practices related to fair-lending laws. The consent order was issued on March 8, 2023, but was made public on Friday. The FDIC alleged that the crypto-friendly bank failed to maintain internal controls, information systems, and prudent credit underwriting practices. A spokesperson for the bank clarified that the order was the result of a standard review and had nothing to do with its crypto-related business. </p>



<p>As per the order, Cross River Bank has agreed to address the concerns related to its practices and improve internal controls. However, the bank did not admit or deny any wrongdoing. A spokesperson for the bank stated that the order will have no “meaningful impact” on its growth. Several enhancements laid out by the FDIC in the order have already been completed by the bank. The bank’s board has agreed to increase supervision and oversight of controls and ensure that corrective actions are taken.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Importantly, the order does not identify discriminatory practices or anything that would require Cross River to compensate consumers for harm. Further, it places no limitations on our extensive existing Fintech Partnerships or the credit products we presently offer in partnership with them.” </p><cite>Cross River Bank spokesperson.</cite></blockquote>

<ul><li>The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued a cease and desist order to Coinme in relation to UpToken.</li><li>The securities regulator also imposed a fine of almost $4 million on the crypto firm and associated parties.&nbsp;</li><li>Coinme and Up Global were booked by the regulator for the unregistered and misleading offering of their UpToken.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-bittrex-violation-federal-laws/">SEC</a>) has imposed a multi-million dollar fine on the Seattle-based crypto giant Coinme and Up Global Inc. The fine settled an ongoing case related to the initial coin offering (ICO) of the crypto firm’s Ethereum-based UpToken back in 2017. </p>



<h2><strong>Coinme Fined For Unregistered ICO</strong></h2>



<p>According to an SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2023/33-11179.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">document</a>, the cease and desist order was imposed as per the U.S. Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. The case dates back to 2017 when Coinme and its Up Global unit conducted a misleading ICO of their UpToken and raised more than $3.6 million. The funds were used by the crypto firm to expand its Bitcoin ATM network. The proceeds of the ICO were reportedly also for several other corporate purposes. </p>



<p>The SEC found that the UpToken issued by Coinme were sold as investment contracts and therefore securities as per the controversial Howey Test. The regulator cited the additional benefits that were made available to UpToken investors to strengthen its case against the firm. The firm was also accused of selling securities without registration and limiting the supply of its token to artificially inflate its demand. The firm’s Chief Executive Officer Neil Bergquist was also named in the complaint. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>An UpToken investor would have had a reasonable expectation of obtaining a future profit from the rise in value of UpToken based upon Respondents’ efforts.” </p><cite>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</cite></blockquote>



<p>Coinme reportedly submitted an offer of settlement in anticipation of enforcement actions from the securities regulator. As part of the settlement, a $3.52 million penalty was imposed on Up Global along with a $250,000 fine on Coinme. Ceo Neil Bergquist has also been ordered to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, bringing the total settlement to almost $4 million.&nbsp;</p>
