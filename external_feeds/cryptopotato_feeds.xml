            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The recently-launched cryptocurrency exchange EDX Markets will reportedly not rely on Paxos to serve as a custodian. According to rumors, the entity is in final talks with Anchorage Digital, which could fit that role. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">EDX Markets went live last week and received financial backing from multiple finance leaders, such as Fidelity Digital Assets, Citadel Securities, Charles Schwab, Paradigm, Sequoia Capital, and more.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/citadel-securities-backed-crypto-exchange-edx-drops-paxos-for-anchorage-1.1938596" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by Bloomberg, EDX Markets has terminated its collaboration with the blockchain infrastructure firm Paxos. Should they have remained associates, the latter would have served as a crypto custodian, whereas its customers would have had direct access to the recently introduced exchange. Despite the ceased partnership, a Paxos spokesperson said:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;EDX shifted to focus on a non-custodial offering at launch. We are very excited about what EDX is building, and we hope to support EDX customers with our regulated custody when banks and brokers onboard to the platform.&#8221; </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">EDX Markets&#8217; is expected to replace Paxos with Anchorage Digital. However, the entities have not yet commented on the deal. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Picking a suitable custodian seems like the main goal for the exchange, which said that customer assets will be held at a third-party company.

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Shaken Condition of Paxos and Anchorage Digital </span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth noting that both custodial options of EDX Markets have gone through some severe turbulence lately.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Paxos &#8211; the entity that issues the stablecoins BUSD and USDP &#8211; was reportedly </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/paxos-under-investigation-by-us-authorities-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">under investigation</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) in February this year.

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin is fighting to remain above $30K, while the rest of the market is slowly bleeding out.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency market has slowed down significantly over the past few days, with most of the coins being completely unable to break out. Throughout the past 24 hours, specifically, the major cryptocurrencies are mostly trading slightly in the red.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Fights For $30K</h2>
<p>The major cryptocurrency seems to have given up on the idea of breaking above $31K, and now the major issue seems to be whether $30K will hold or not.</p>
<p>$30K is touted by many as a pivotal level, and it&#8217;s important to see whether Bitcoin will manage to remain above it.</p>
<figure id="attachment_257459" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-257459" style="width: 1349px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTCUSDT_2023-06-28_11-47-19.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-257459" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTCUSDT_2023-06-28_11-47-19.png" alt="BTCUSDT_2023-06-28_11-47-19" width="1349" height="873" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTCUSDT_2023-06-28_11-47-19.png 1349w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTCUSDT_2023-06-28_11-47-19-300x194.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTCUSDT_2023-06-28_11-47-19-1024x663.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTCUSDT_2023-06-28_11-47-19-768x497.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BTCUSDT_2023-06-28_11-47-19-50x32.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1349px) 100vw, 1349px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-257459" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>As seen in the chart above, the slow, choppy price action continues, and the consolidation is evident. This type of PA usually results in a massive move in either direction, and it&#8217;s interesting to see whether a continuation of the rally will take place or if a serious correction is looming.</p>
<h2>Altcoins Bleeding Out</h2>
<p>The altcoin market is mainly in the red today, with most of them charting slight declines. From the major coins, BNB lost about 2.7%, the same as ADA, SOL, LINK, and others.</p>
<figure id="attachment_257460" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-257460" style="width: 1672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cryptocurrency_heatmap_2806231.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-257460" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cryptocurrency_heatmap_2806231.jpg" alt="cryptocurrency_heatmap_2806231" width="1672" height="1135" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cryptocurrency_heatmap_2806231.jpg 1672w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cryptocurrency_heatmap_2806231-300x204.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cryptocurrency_heatmap_2806231-1024x695.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cryptocurrency_heatmap_2806231-768x521.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cryptocurrency_heatmap_2806231-1536x1043.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cryptocurrency_heatmap_2806231-50x34.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1672px) 100vw, 1672px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-257460" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Quantify Crypto</figcaption></figure>
<p>Radix (XRD) is today&#8217;s worst performer. The cryptocurrency crashed by a whopping 13% in the past day, charting most of the losses in the last hour. Optimism (OP) is also down 8.2%.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, Stellar (XLM) gained around 10%, followed by Kaspa&#8217;s KAS, which is up 6.5%. That&#8217;s pretty much the only good news, as the rest of the cryptocurrencies are trading in the red.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Embattled crypto exchange FTX has frozen the sale of one of its most desirable assets, a stake in artificial intelligence (AI) startup Anthropic.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On June 28, it was reported that the investment bank acting as an adviser to FTX, informed bidders this month about the sale suspension.</p>
<p>Multiple interested buyers have requested and assessed private information about the Anthropic stake over the past couple of months. However, Perella Weinberg Partners reportedly asked potential bidders to sign non-disclosure agreements, reported <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-27/bankman-fried-s-ftx-said-to-halt-sale-of-its-stake-in-ai-startup-anthropic?sref=3REHEaVI" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Bloomberg</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Selling losers first is crucial.</p>
<p>Anthropic tokenisation might also synergise well with FTX 2.0, as an exclusive listing. <a href="https://t.co/WJd900JBYw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/WJd900JBYw</a></p>
<p>— FTX 2.0 Coalition (@AFTXcreditor) <a href="https://twitter.com/AFTXcreditor/status/1673821314287644676?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">June 27, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>FTX Still Keen on AI Firm</h2>
<p>FTX was reportedly seeking “nine figures” for a share of the startup amid all of the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/amazon-doubles-down-on-ai-by-investing-100-million/" data-wpel-link="internal">current hype</a> surrounding the tech world’s latest big thing – artificial intelligence. It appears now that the firm sees greater potential for the AI startup.</p>
<p>The privately-held AI firm Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former OpenAI employees. It was valued at $4.6 billion in June by Semafor following a $450 million funding round in May to support the development of its AI bot, dubbed Claude.</p>
<p>FTX and Alameda made a $500 million investment in Anthropic, but the embattled crypto company still has a $1.7 billion shortfall in its balance sheet.</p>
<p>FTX’s stake in Anthropic was one of its largest holdings at the time of its bankruptcy. Its largest was the $1.1 billion investment in crypto miner Genesis Digital Assets.</p>
<p>The sale would have provided a significant amount of capital to go towards recovery and recompense for creditors.</p>
<p>The Anthropic sale freeze comes just a day after FTX debtors <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-misused-customer-funds-since-the-beginning-new-ceo-claims/" data-wpel-link="internal">released</a> their second investigative report.</p>
<p>The FTX Debtors noted that the FTX exchange owed customers approximately $8.7 billion as of the petition date. However, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Restructuring Officer John Ray III said that the  &#8220;remain committed to recovering as much value as possible for creditors.”</p>
<p>The new management claims to have made substantial progress in recovering around $7 billion in liquid assets so far.</p>
<h2>Crypto Market Outlook</h2>
<p>Crypto markets have remained sideways for another day with total capitalization where it was this time yesterday at $1.22 trillion.</p>
<p>Bitcoin was up half a percent at $30,456 but it remains stuck at heavy resistance. In mid-April, it reached similar price levels but failed to break out above them. The second run up to $30K is leading to a double top chart formation which could potentially spell another pull pack.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[Press Release &#8211; Hong Kong, China, June 28th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>DWF Labs, the global digital asset market maker, and multi-stage Web3 investment firm, has further strengthened its commitment to support the growth of Conflux, the tree-graph consensus algorithm Layer-1 blockchain. Conflux has been gaining significant traction since February 2023 on the back of some key partnerships, including the signature collaboration with China Telecom announced on February 15th, with the goal of developing a blockchain SIM (BSIM) card that was first unveiled in May.</p>
<p>DWF Labs recently purchased $18M in CFX token, cementing the long-term relationship between the investment firm and Conflux. This follows DFW Labs buying $10M worth of CFX tokens in March 2023.</p>
<p>More recently, Conflux joined Hong Kong’s Web3 Institute, participated in the Singapore Digital Economy Roundtable organized by the Singaporean Government, and led the drafting of IEEE P3217, an international blockchain standard by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. In addition, Conflux announced key partnerships including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supremacy &#8211; Web3 security platform</li>
<li>dappOS &#8211; an operating protocol that manages crypto infrastructures for users</li>
<li>NuLink &#8211; a privacy-preserving technology that provides APIs for decentralized applications</li>
<li>Smooth Labs &#8211; developing the Layer 2 solution that supports parallel execution</li>
<li>Opside &#8211; a decentralized ZK-RaaS network featuring PoW of ZKP mining</li>
</ul>
<p>DWF Labs has made significant contributions to placing Conflux on the global stage. Since then, Conflux has established ecosystem partnerships with Floki, Worldcoin, Blockbank, Luganodes, AirDAO, Mask, and OpenEden, with a growing list of ongoing partnerships being discussed. Conflux and DWF Labs have also co-hosted multiple events, including those organized in Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Paris.</p>
<p>Fan Long, Conflux Network’s Co-Founder, stated: “Conflux Network has experienced exponential growth since the start of 2023, pioneering advances in the Chinese NFT market and establishing fresh Web3 access through the BSIM card project with China Telecom. DWF Lab is one of the key supporters of Conflux. This infusion of capital not only strengthens our bond, but also acts as a catalyst for our shared ambition to expand the Conflux ecosystem. Conflux plans to leverage the raised funds to further fuel its ecosystem growth in Asia and Hong Kong, empower burgeoning developer communities, and bring an increasing number of real-world assets onto the Conflux chain.”</p>
<blockquote><p>The Managing Partner of DWF Labs, Andrei Grachev stated: &#8220;We take great pride in our role as supporters of Conflux throughout its remarkable growth trajectory. It exemplifies our commitment to backing projects with immense potential and providing the necessary support to fill in the missing pieces of the Web3 puzzle. Our deep understanding of the crypto market has served as a compass for Conflux, allowing it to fully express its potential on the global stage. We are delighted to have played a part in Conflux&#8217;s journey towards success.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[Press Release &#8211; Eden Island, Republic of Seychelles, June 27th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>A new PEPE memecoin is launching, following hot on the heels of its Ethereum namesake. Issued as a BEP20 on BNB Chain, PEPE is a novel memecoin with a number of unique mechanisms programmed into its tokenomics.</p>
<p>Like the original PEPE token, which has proven a runaway success in 2023, the BEP20 PEPE draws its cues from the mischievous frog of the same name, whose design was derived from the webcomic &#8220;Boy&#8217;s Club.&#8221;</p>
<p>The market capitalization of the original PEPE token, which debuted on Ethereum in April, exceeded $1 billion on May 5th, prompting a new wave of memecoins, including a number of frog-themed efforts. Unlike subsequent memecoins, the PEPE (BEP20) has several unusual features programmed in including a syndication system designed to support price stabilization.</p>
<p>The team behind the BNB Chain PEPE aren’t settling for just one memecoin either: they plan to launch multiple PEPE projects, all based on the loveable frog. 13 such launches have been cued up for 2023 alone.</p>
<p>Although each PEPE project will operate independently, the introduction of a &#8220;Burn &amp; Drop&#8221; system will govern the consortium. Burn &amp; Drop is a first-of-its-kind system in which burning one token leads to the airdrop of another.</p>
<p>To initiate a Burn &amp; Drop, two types of tokens are required. For example, this could involve a scenario in which Token A is priced at $1 and PEPE (BEP20) is also priced at $1. However, if the price of Token A were to drop to $0.8, Token A holders would have the option to burn their tokens on the Burn &amp; Drop platform, automatically receiving PEPE (BEP20) through an airdrop, and with Token A having been burned, its total supply would decrease.</p>
<p><img src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2_1687895654gGffTWpnZh.jpg" /></p>
<p>By initiating the Burn &amp; Drop process between tokens, excess volatility can be reduced while possibly providing trading opportunities for arbitrage and intra-token trading. This logic is a fundamental component of PEPE (BEP20), and one which users can engage with directly within the platform.</p>
<p><img src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/3_1687895715ru06UoZ1YN.jpg" /></p>
<p>In addition, PEPE (BEP20) has plans to introduce numerous services that will further extend the token’s utility. To further increase interest in the project, PEPE (BEP20) is currently running an airdrop campaign on Twitter that’s open to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>About PEPEBEP20</strong></p>
<p>PEPE is a project launched on the Binance Smart Chain, taking the form of a BEP20 token. The Pepe Syndicate and the unique &#8220;Burn&amp;Drop&#8221; mechanism of Pepe are designed to manage the token&#8217;s price volatility. This is not a guarantee of price stability, but a mechanism to potentially mitigate price fluctuations. Furthermore, various projects that participate in the &#8220;Burn&amp;Drop&#8221; system collaborate with each other, fostering a robust Pepe Syndicate network.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Riot also has the option to potentially purchase an additional 66,000 machines.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the world&#8217;s largest Bitcoin mining firms &#8211; Riot Blockchain &#8211; has announced securing an initial order of 33,280 next-generation Bitcoin miners after entering into a long-term purchase agreement with China-based Bitcoin miner manufacturer MicroBT.</p>
<p>Riot said that the deal will boost the Colorado-based company&#8217;s self-mining capacity to 20.1 EH/s once the machines are installed in the first quarter of 2024.</p>
<h2>Riot&#8217;s Boost its Hashrate Capacity</h2>
<p>Announcing Riot&#8217;s first order of Bitcoin miners for its Corsicana Facility, the company&#8217;s CEO Jason Les <a href="https://www.riotplatforms.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/155/riot-purchases-7-6-ehs-of-next-generation-miners-from" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">explained</a> that the new additions are among the most powerful and efficient miners ever made for Bitcoin mining. The exec further added that these new models are designed and produced specifically for immersion cooling systems, such as those that will be used at Riot&#8217;s Texas facility.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;These new miners will contribute an additional 7.6 EH/s to Riot’s self-mining capacity when fully deployed and will further enhance our already strong fleet efficiency in advance of the upcoming Bitcoin halving.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As per the official statement, the initial order for the agreement clocks in at 33,280 machines costing approximately $163 million, or $21.50 per terahash (TH). Riot has the option to purchase an additional 66,560 machines before the end of 2024 at the same terms.</p>
<p>The new partnership between the two companies is expected to secure a &#8220;robust&#8221; domestic supply chain in the United States. Besides, MicroBT will be tasked with manufacturing these miners at a Pittsburgh facility resulting in the creation of new jobs in the region.</p>
<p>MicroBT&#8217;s COO Jordan Chen also said all machines that will be manufactured will help in expanding the former&#8217;s operations in the country, thereby enabling them to boost their market share in the US. The M56S+ and M56S++ models bought by Riot are reportedly the most powerful machines developed by MicroBT.</p>
<h2>Riot Mined 740 BTC in January</h2>
<p>The recent winter storms in Texas damaged the Rockdale Facility, which slashed the hash rate capacity of Riot. Despite this, the company <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/riot-mined-an-all-time-high-of-740-btc-in-january/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">generated</a> a 740 BTC in January a 62% increase compared to January 2022 and a new monthly all-time high.</p>
<p>During the same period, Riot also announced plans to onboard with new members even as it rival Core Scientific laid off a chunk of their employees.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin-based social app Damus has been banned from Apple’s app store – and Jack Dorsey is not pleased.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Block CEO Jack Dorsey is putting Apple CEO Tim Cook on blast for seemingly not supporting Bitcoin payments, per the app store’s policies.</p>
<p>His comments follow Apple’s recent confirmation that it would be pulling the Bitcoin-based social app, Damus, from its marketplace.</p>
<h2>Apple’s Crackdown On Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Damus is a decentralized social media app for interacting with Nostr – a Bitcoin-based protocol for exchanging information and messages in a censorship-resistant manner.</p>
<p>The app includes a tipping feature called “zaps” which let users tip one another in Bitcoin over the lightning network. The value exchange is totally peer-to-peer, and Damus takes no cut from such transactions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the feature <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/jack-dorsey-backed-damus-faces-explusion-from-apples-app-store-over-bitcoin-tipping-feature/" data-wpel-link="internal">ran afoul</a> of Apple’s terms of service two weeks ago. The company said that it could allow for optional tips and donations, but not for payments that were required in exchange for digital content. “They must use in-app purchase in accordance with guideline 3.1.1,” said the company.</p>
<p>Damus refused to remove this functionality from its app, and tried to explain that zaps did not “unlock” any digital content for users. However, it <a href="https://twitter.com/damusapp/status/1673326463297392640" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">received</a> the same message from Apple again on Monday, and accepted that its removal from the app store was imminent.</p>
<p>“Their suggested fix is to use apple pay,” tweeted Damus on Tuesday. “Sure, I&#8217;ll use apple pay when it supports censorship-resistant, peer-to-peer payments to anyone in the world. Maybe start with peer-to-peer first?”</p>
<h2>Jack Dorsey Responds</h2>
<p>Jack Dorsey was quick to defend Damus on Monday upon hearing the news. “Tips aren’t unlocking content,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1673364469068578822" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">said</a>, rehashing the company’s own arguments.</p>
<p>He followed up on Tuesday by calling out Apple’s CEO specifically:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why doesn’t Apple Pay support bitcoin <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@tim_cook</a>? <a href="https://t.co/2TfqzgXUP1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://t.co/2TfqzgXUP1</a></p>
<p>&mdash; jack (@jack) <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1673634767403712514?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">June 27, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>“Removed from the App Store for enabling tipping to everyone in the world without the need for a bank, payment card, or government permission,” he added.</p>
<p>Dorsey has previously praised Nostr for being one of two “truly censorship resistant technologies at scale” – alongside Bitcoin itself. While still the CEO of Twitter, Dorsey helped enable a tipping feature on the platform that incorporated Bitcoin lightning tips similar to those used by Nostr.</p>
<p>Tim Cook hasn’t shown interest in putting Bitcoin on Apple’s balance sheet but has <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/apple-ceo-tim-cook-confirms-owning-bitcoin-or-ethereum/" data-wpel-link="internal">confirmed</a> that he personally owns some coins.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The company behind the world’s largest Bitcoin fund has a 70% chance of overcoming the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a major crypto industry lawsuit, according to Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Legal Analyst Elliot Z. Stein.</p>
<p>Given the circumstances, the firm’s analysts assign a 50% likelihood to a Bitcoin spot ETF being approved in the United States this year.</p>
<h2>Grayscale, BlackRock, and the SEC</h2>
<p>According to Stein, the optimistic outlook for Grayscale’s lawsuit may actually serve to benefit BlackRock – which <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrock-files-bitcoin-spot-etf-application-taps-coinbase/" data-wpel-link="internal">filed</a> for a spot ETF product last week – rather than Grayscale’s own filing.</p>
<p>“The SEC and Chair Gary Gensler may be bracing for a loss and looking to preemptively soften it or make it meaningless by approving spot Bitcoin ETF application before or around the same time as a court decision,” <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1673685658538323968" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">wrote</a> the analyst in a Tuesday note.</p>
<p>Grayscale’s lawsuit <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-rejects-grayscale-spot-bitcoin-etf-sparking-lawsuit/" data-wpel-link="internal">accused</a> the SEC of violating the Administrative Procedure Act and Securities Exchange Act by arbitrarily denying its Bitcoin spot ETF application last year, despite choosing to approve many similar futures ETF products.</p>
<p>The SEC has rejected every spot ETF application to date, citing failures from their prospective issuers to provide sufficient protections and oversight against market manipulation.</p>
<p>During the first round of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/judges-scrutinize-sec-during-oral-arguments-in-grayscale-lawsuit/" data-wpel-link="internal">oral arguments</a> in March, all three judges overseeing the case expressed skepticism of the SEC’s case, stating that the agency “has not offered any explanation that the petitioners are wrong.” For Stein, this skepticism boosted Grayscale’s odds of victory from 40% to 70%.</p>
<h2>BlackRock’s Approval Odds</h2>
<p>Bitcoin rallied above $31,000 this week on optimism that a Bitcoin spot ETF could be approved after BlackRock’s filing. Prior submissions from the $10 trillion asset manager have a historical <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrocks-etf-success-rate-with-the-sec-is-575-to-1-what-about-its-bitcoin-application/" data-wpel-link="internal">approval rate</a> of 575:1.</p>
<p>The SEC even <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/27/the-first-leveraged-bitcoin-futures-etf-is-hitting-the-market-as-crypto-gains-new-momentum.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">approved</a> a leveraged Bitcoin Futures ETF last week. Bloomberg’s ETF analyst James Seyffart interpreted this as a sign that the SEC’s attitude toward Bitcoin products could be “lightening up,” per a <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1672275688458539009" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">tweet</a> on Friday.</p>
<p>That said, there’s one aspect of BlackRock’s ETF filing that Seyffart thinks could undermine its application: its partnership with Coinbase for custody – an exchange that the SEC just filed a major lawsuit against.</p>
<p>“You have to take that as a risk,” he said during an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILy-74GVxV8&amp;ab_channel=UnchainedPodcast" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">interview</a> on the Unchained podcast on Friday. “We don’t think the odds of this thing getting approved are like 70% like we think the Grayscale lawsuit. The odds are still stacked against BlackRock.”</p>
