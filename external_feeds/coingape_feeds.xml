<p><strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/tokenization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tokenization</a></strong> is the process of converting sensitive data into anonymous, nonsensitive &#8220;<strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tokens</a></strong>&#8221; that can be accessed by a database or internal system without putting it at risk of exposure. Although the tokens have unrelated values, they still preserve some characteristics of the original data, most often in length or format, allowing for uninterrupted business operations. After that, the original sensitive data is securely stored somewhere other than the company&#8217;s internal systems.</p>
<p>Tokenized data is irreversible and unbreakable in contrast to encrypted data. This point is crucial because there is no mathematical connection between a token and its original number, meaning that tokens cannot be transformed back into their original forms without the help of additional, separately stored information. As a result, the original sensitive data will not be compromised in a tokenized environment breach.</p>
<p><iframe title="What Is Tokenization?" width="678" height="381" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iVeenkfa-0s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Where Did Tokenization Originate?</b></h3>
<p>In order to assist a client in safeguarding customer credit card information, TrustCommerce invented digital tokenization in 2001. Customer&#8217;s credit card numbers were being stored by merchants on their own servers, making it possible for anyone with access to those servers to view or abuse those data.</p>
<p>A system created by TrustCommerce uses tokens in place of primary account numbers (PANs). As a result, businesses could store and use tokens as references when taking payments. To process the payments, TrustCommerce used the original PANs after converting the tokens back to PANs. Since merchants no longer had any real PANs stored in their systems, this reduced the risk to TrustCommerce.</p>

<h3><b>What are tokens?</b></h3>
<p>As previously mentioned, a token is a piece of data that substitutes for a different, more valuable part of data. <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tokens</a></strong> are only helpful because they stand in for something valuable, such as a primary account number (PAN) for a credit card or a Social Security number (SSN).</p>
<p>A poker chip makes a good comparison. Players use chips as stand-ins for cash instead of covering a table with it since cash can be lost or stolen easily. Even if the chips are stolen, they cannot be used as currency. They need to be traded for their representative value first.</p>
<h2><b>What is the process of tokenization?</b></h2>
<p>The issuer, acquirer, customer, merchant, card networks, and token requestor are just a few of the parties involved in the tokenization process. In the tokenization process, an algorithm substitutes alphanumeric codes or tokens for the real credit card information of the customer. It is not possible to access the original data using the generated code.</p>
<p>From the time the credit card purchase is made until the payment is completed, the flow includes the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The customer uses the credit card information to make a card purchase.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The tokenization system receives private card information.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Where the actual card information is substituted for the generated tokens.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The correlation is securely kept in a different data vault in the cloud.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The payments are processed while the generated tokens serve as a representation of the actual card in the system. These tokens are also employed for recurring transactions in the future.</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>What is the Purpose of Tokenization?</b></h3>
<p>Tokenization is used to safeguard sensitive data and keep it useful for business purposes. Contrasted with encryption, which modifies and stores <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/self-custody-can-help-consumers-maintain-control-of-their-data-in-a-secure-accessible-manner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sensitive data</a></strong> in a way that prevents its continued use for commercial purposes, is this. In comparison to encryption, tokenization is like a poker chip.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the right key can be used to decrypt encrypted numbers. But tokens cannot be turned around because there is no right mathematical connection between the token and its original number.</p>
<h2><b>Benefits of Tokenization</b></h2>
<p>The security of the payment processing, its easy accessibility, and the resulting client satisfaction are the main advantages that the tokenization process offers. The benefits listed include safeguards against data breaches, useful for cutting red tape, gaining customer confidence, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The tokenized and secure customer data is sensitive. This is because hackers cannot use the tokens.</li>
<li aria-level="1">This sensitive data does not need to be managed by the merchant. This lowers the price and lessens the chance of a data breach.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Customers who frequently shop do not need to enter their card information. His tokenized card information can be used the following time without risk thanks to tokenization. The streamlined payment process will increase customer satisfaction and the resulting conversion rate.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The enhanced customer satisfaction and improved customer experience will be boosted by effective security.</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Tokenization vs Encryption</b></h3>
<p>The encrypted data is coded in the same way that tokenized data is. The distinction is that encryption employs the equation.</p>
<p>In contrast, when data is tokenized, it is completely transformed into meaningless, random tokens. Only those meaningless strings of characters would be given to the hackers, ensuring total security.</p>

<h2><b>Tokenization and PCI DSS</b></h2>
<p>After a transaction, credit card numbers cannot be kept on a retailer&#8217;s POS terminal or in its databases due to <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/best-crypto-debit-and-credit-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Payment Card Industry</a></strong> (PCI) regulations. Merchants must either invest in pricey end-to-end encryption systems or outsource their payment processing to a company that offers tokenization in order to be PCI compliant. The token&#8217;s value is issued by the service provider, who is also in charge of maintaining the security of the cardholder data.</p>
<p>A driver for the POS system that transforms credit card numbers into randomly generated values is provided to the retailer in this case by the service provider (tokens). The token cannot be used outside of a specific transaction with a particular merchant because it is not a primary account number (PAN). Alphanumeric characters that represent cardholder data and transaction-specific information make up the remaining characters on the token.</p>
<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p>The purpose of this article is to define tokenization and explain how it operates. It describes its main advantages and how it aids in PCI DSS compliance. The secure processing of sensitive card information while processing payments, provides customer benefits. As a result, it reduces the possibility of fraud and data breaches. Tokenization, however, is a helpful strategy to enable high security and customer convenience in a variety of industries, including banking, eCommerce, etc.</p>

The world&#8217;s second-largest crypto has seen a strong surge gaining more than 15% since the beginning of 2023.</p>
<p>As of press time, ETH is trading 5.4% up at a price of $1402 and a market cap of $171.6 billion. Despite the selling pressure in Ethereum over the last two months, shark addresses have been accumulating heavily. On-chain data provider Santiment <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1613359474710048768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ethereum <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">has jumped above $1,400 for the first time since November 7th. Over the past 10 weeks, ~3,000 new shark addresses (holding 100 to 10,000 </span><span class="r-18u37iz">$ETH</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">) have shown up on the network. 48,556 shark addresses is the highest level recorded since Feb, 2021.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Besides, the Ethereum network activity has also been on the uptick since the Ethereum gas fee remains under $2 over the last two months. The average gas fee on the Ethereum blockchain currently sits at just $1.64. As per the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/new-bullish-pattern-emerged-in-ethereum-coin-technical-chart-is-1500-within-reach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new bullish pattern</a> on technical charts, ETH could rally up to $1,500 further.</p>
<h3>These Altcoins Compete With Ethereum</h3>
<p>Along with Ethereum, some other altcoins have been performing extremely well recently. Over the last few weeks, Cardano and Litecoin have emerged as traders&#8217; favorites. Other altcoins which have recently seen a strong surge in address activity are XRP and Chainlink. On-chain data provider Santiment <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1613225318076264450" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>:</p>

At press time, BTC is trading 4.55% up at a price of $18,224 and a market cap of $350 billion.</p>
<p>This is the ninth-successive day of gains for Bitcoin registering its largest winning streak since 2020. It&#8217;s been a great start to the year 2023 with the BTC price up by more than 10$ in the first 12 days.</p>
<p>The recent momentum in the crypto space has been supported by <a href="https://coingape.com/us-cpi-data-bitcoin-btc-price-break-key-resistance/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimism on Wall Street</a>. Analysts are betting that the inflation will cool down and the Fed will slow down the rate of interest-rate hikes has built positive investor sentiment for risk-ON assets.</p>
<p>This is certainly a fresh start for Bitcoin and the rest of crypto after undergoing brutal corrections in 2022. Speaking to Bloomberg, Michael Purves, founder of Tallbacken Capital Advisors <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/bitcoin-eight-day-win-streak-is-longest-since-dark-pandemic-days-1.1868937" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Risk assets have been rallying, I think, for the reason that the terminal rate is coming slowly but surely into the foreground and positioning has been bearish and transitioning, which means bullish near-term price action&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>The regulatory issues surrounding the crypto market still continue to be an overhang and institutions are likely to wait further until the market clears up. Noelle Acheson, author of the “Crypto Is Macro Now” newsletter said: “There is little doubt that large players will come back into the market when the outlook is less murky, pushing up transactions and also price&#8221;.</p>
<h3>Will Bitcoin Climb to $20,000?</h3>
<p>Amid the recent rally in the BTC price, market optimists believe that it will go to touch the $20,000 level once. However, on-chain data suggests that traders are seizing the profit opportunities here. Thus, it could be followed by a correction in the future. On-chain data provider Santiment <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1612851786397937665" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">The small profit opportunities for </span><span class="r-18u37iz">$BTC</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> have been seized by traders, &amp; yesterday was the 2nd largest profit vs. loss ratio of the past year. The top profit take spike resulted in a -18% the following month. </span></p></blockquote>

The CPI reading could very well play a role in determining the magnitude of the next <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/interest-rate/">interest rate</a> increase that the Federal Reserve decides to implement. It is anticipated that the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/consumer-price-index-cpi/">Consumer Price Index (CPI)</a> reading, which will be released on January 12, would lend credence to the argument that inflation is fading, hence providing a potential opening for riskier assets, like <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<h2>CPI Data Of 6.5% Expected</h2>
<p>According to prominent industry experts, the CPI for December is anticipated to show annual inflation at 6.5-6.6%, which would be a decrease from November&#8217;s reading of 7.1%. This data is seen as a significant marker for investors attempting to figure out the next market movements. In a telecasted interview on CNBC, Gilman Hill&#8217;s Jenny Harrington predicts a CPI of 6.6% which she thinks to &#8220;make sense&#8221; considering the broader market overview.</p>
<p>Harrington was further quoted as saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t think that kind of reading triggers a spark that drives the market way up from here.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, the CEO of Gilman Hill Asset Management pointed out that the earnings are likely not going to be particularly good, but the most important takeaway was that the 6.6% reading would set &#8220;a floor&#8221; in the market. This would give market participants the impression that the marketplace is most likely not going to further lows or highs, but that it would be just &#8220;okay.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC) price</a> made a fleeting but encouraging return to $17,500 overnight on January 11 as the newly found strength from the beginning of 2023 persisted. However, if Bitcoin&#8217;s change in price can be extracted from the most recent six CPI readings, it provides us with a clearer picture of how the market has reacted to the global macroeconomic data.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135009" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/12024759/Screenshot-2023-01-12-024735.png" alt="" width="807" height="276" />The price of Bitcoin has, more often than not, strongly reacted to the CPI readings; with the strongest reaction being a drop of over 10% reported on the CPI announcement made in September. Despite this, throughout the course of the past three months, BTC has displayed a generally bullish momentum on latest CPI readings.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin (BTC) Price Reaction</h2>
<p>The release of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) on January 12 could make matters more difficult, particularly in the event that inflation exceeds expectations in a positive direction. Since the beginning of 2023, BTC&#8217;s price has been benefiting from a weaker U.S. Dollar. This is due to the fact that the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/">U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)</a> is leaning toward a smaller interest rate hike of 25 basis points at its upcoming monetary policy meeting on February 1.</p>
<p>However, the flagship <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> is presently trading at a major resistance level, and the next CPI data is expected to play a significant part in determining the direction of the coin&#8217;s price in near future. According to crypto trading expert Credible Crypto, Bitcoin has reached a break-even point and has warned investors and traders alike to exercise caution in the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>Complementing this, another popular Bitcoin evangelist &amp; digital asset trader Johnny, who goes by the alias CryptoGodJohn on Twitter, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CryptoGodJohn/status/1612957250951200769" rel="nofollow">cautioned</a> on witnessing massive “bull tweeting as BTC sits under higher time frame resistance at $17,600&#8243;. He further argued that the CPI data could whipsaw the prices back to &#8220;where they were last week,”.</p>

<p>As things stand, the Bitcoin (BTC) price is currently being traded at $17,555. This represents an increase of 0.43% on the day, in contrast to a gain of 4.31% during the week, as per CoinGape’s crypto market tracker.</p>

This bullish breakout offers a higher footing for buyers to bolster further price recovery. Moreover, the low volume retest to the breached resistance gives an additional confirmation for price sustainability above the $15 support. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lower price rejection candles at the $15 level indicate the buyers are defending the newly obtained support</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the reclaimed 20-and-50-day EMAs provide an extra edge in the buyer&#8217;s favor.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Solana coin is $59.1 Million, indicating a 33% loss</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/h/H3Dr9U9y.png" alt="Solana coin" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Solana coin price walking a sideway trend for the last two months shows the formation of an <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/how-far-may-solana-coin-price-rise-after-escaping-ongoing-consolidation/">inverted descending triangle pattern.</a> During this pattern formation, the price action faces stiff resistance from a horizontal level and a downsloping support trendline which leads the lower swing laws. Moreover, the prices expanding within this pattern reflect a sense of high volatility in the crypto market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This pattern may not be commonly observed in technical charts, but it can provide a significant bullish rally upon the Breakout of its neckline resistance. Amid the recent recovery in the market and support from the downsloping trendline, the SOL price has recently bounced back from the $8 mark.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also read- <a href="https://coingape.com/education/explained-what-is-physical-nft-and-how-to-sell-physical-items-as-nft/">Explained: What is Physical NFT? and How to Sell Physical Items as NFT</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This bullish reversal doubled the coin’s market value within a fortnight and provided an upward breakout from the $15 neckline. The long bullish candle pierced the mentioned barrier with sufficient volume, indicating the buyer&#8217;s commitment to potential recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in the last two days, the SOL price showed a minor pullback to retest the breached resistance as potential support. Moreover, this retest phase back by decreasing volume indicates less interest of traders in selling activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, if the coin buyers manage to sustain about the $15 flip support, the resulting rally may push the prices to $18.8, followed by the $22 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a daily candle closing below the $15 level will weaken the bullish thesis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI:</strong> The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily RSI slope</a> high above in bullish territory indicates the market participants feel positive about price recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bollinger band:</strong> the Solana coin price hitting the upper band of the indicator suggests a rapid bullish rally in the relatively short period. Thus, the coin price is likely to consolidate above $15 support until the prices stabilize enough to resume its rally.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pot price: $16.02</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential bearish reversal from the channel pattern resistance may tumble the CRV price by 12-22%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 100-day EMA aligned with the downsloping trendline gives additional resistance against sellers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the CRV token is $629.5 Million, indicating a 1000.5% gain.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A f<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/parallel-channel-pattern/">alling parallel channel pattern</a> is currently governing the ongoing downfall of the Curve Dao coin. Under the influence of this pattern, the coin price has been wobbling between two falling trendlines for the past six months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with the new year recovery in the crypto market, the CRV price had recently bounced back from the $0.5 mark. The U-shaped recovery indicated a sustained rally of 30% and pushed the prices to the resistance trendline of the channel pattern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By press time, the CRV price traded at $0.654 and showed higher price rejection candles over the last three days. These rejection candles indicate the sellers continue to defend this resistance and could trigger a new bear cycle within the pattern.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read:  <a href="https://coingape.com/defi-lending-platforms/">Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms In 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A daily candle closing below the immediate support of $0.635 will offer additional confirmation for a downfall and plunge the prices below the $0.5 support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in theory, the falling channel is a bullish continuation pattern that provides a significant bull run upon the breakout of its resistance trendline. Thus, the trades looking for long entry opportunities should wait for a bullish breakout from the overhead trendline. </span></p>

If this divergence indicator sustained its bullish stance, the CRV might soon break the overhead trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the recently reclaimed 20-and-50-day EMA now stands as significant support trying to bolster price recovery. However, a breakout from these EMAs will backfire with additional confirmation for sellers.</span></p>

GALA&#8217;s token price increased by almost 70% on Monday, reaching its highest level since September 13 at approximately $0.05. However, because of the new development, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> dropped by more than 12% in the past 24  hours.</p>
<h2>Why Gala Price Is Falling?</h2>
<p>The tweet, which was published on January 9, included a screengrab from Gala Games&#8217; Discord channel. It stated that the firm was working on two films with the actors Dwayne Johnson and Mark Wahlberg, referring to them as &#8220;huge forces in the entertainment industry.&#8221; The tweet went on to explain that as part of the agreement, users who were already a member of the Gala network would be able to scan a QR code in order to win digital prizes from Netflix and purchase movie tickets for The Rock&#8217;s films.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/defi-lending-platforms/">Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms In 2023</a></em></p>
<p>Furthermore, the now-deleted tweet stated, &#8220;You’ve seen their work on screen, but I think their presence might be even more powerful off the screen and we are so happy to get the chance to work with them,&#8221;.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-134999" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/11230140/MEMH2RRGUBFIRAYLXZXHYQJXWY.jpeg" alt="" width="764" height="942" /></p>
<h2>Crypto Community Questions</h2>
<p>The lack of response from the crypto startup has infuriated crypto aficionados on Twitter, where a number of accounts have called into question the authenticity of the initial announcement. One community member even went ahead to publicly state that he was ousted from the Discord server for asking questions regarding the tweet. He was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Why would GALA boot me from the server for simply asking a legitimate question about a public article? I was asking if the team had any update?”</p></blockquote>
<p>Few even went ahead to advocate shorting the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a>, by taking investment positions that gamble on the value of the cryptocurrency going down. On the other hand, a few loyalists in the Gala Games Discord have levelled accusations against those who have asked for proof, saying that they are spreading <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fud/">FUD</a>, a crypto jargon used to refer &#8220;Fear, Uncertainty &amp; Doubt&#8221;; while also accusing competing businesses of employing Twitter bots to run a smear campaign on Gala Games.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135000" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/11233853/Screenshot-2023-01-11-231517.png" alt="" width="1182" height="561" /></p>
<p>All these have badly affected the token price and as things stand, the GALA price is currently being traded at $0.037. This represents a decrease of 12% on the day, in contrast to the massive gain of 105% during the last week, as per <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> tracker CoinMarketCap.</p>

However, during this consolidation, the price rebounded from the $0.76 support multiple times, validating this level as a high accumulation zone. Therefore, using the aforementioned level as a base support, the MATIC price shows the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/double-bottom-pattern/">double bottom pattern</a>. This pattern formation accentuates the price sustainability above a specific horizontal level and replenishes the bullish momentum for potential price recovery.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $0.87 breakout could drive the MATIC price 12.5% higher to reach $0.953</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 200-day EMA wavering near the $0.888 mark will try to stall the potential price rally.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the MATIC is $1.35 Billion, indicating a 36.2% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/b/bbP20Qz2.png" alt="MATIC Price" width="1946" height="1104" /></strong>Source- &#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amidst the recent new year recovery in the crypto market, the MATIC price rebounded from the $0.76 support and surged 14.6% higher. By press time, this altcoin traded at the $0.85 mark and showed a power struggle to break the $0.87 barrier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, a possible post-rally pullback may tumble the prices by 4% down to $0.816 local support. However, under the influence of a bullish reversal pattern, the  MATIC price should witness a sustained rally to the $0.95 mark.</span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/top-7-crypto-marketing-firms-of-the-year/">Top Crypto Marketing Firms / Agencies 2023; Here’s Best Picks</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $0.95 is the neckline of the mentioned pattern, and its breakout will intensify the bullish momentum. As per the technical setup, the post-breakout rally travels the same distance as the length between the base support and neckline, shot from the breakout points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, a breakout from the $0.95 barrier will drive the MATIC price 35% higher to reach the $1.15 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a breakdown from the $0.816 support invalidates the bullish thesis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicators</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bollinger Band:</strong> the MATIC price hitting the upper band of this indicator suggests aggressive buying activity in a relatively short period. Thus, the indicator encourages a possible pullback before the price resume the bullish pattern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MACD:</strong> The increasing gap between the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a> and a signal line in bullish alignment indicates improving market sentiments.</span></p>

This measurement helps to assess the transaction speed of a network. TPS also measures transaction speed for other traditional networks.</p>
<h2>Transactions Per Seconds In Crypto</h2>
<p>TPS in crypto is the speed at which a blockchain network processes transactions. The higher the number, the more advanced a network is. A higher TPS is an indicator of the network’s speed and scalability. Usually, decentralized networks have a lower TPS rate than traditional centralized networks.</p>
<p>The famous online payments system PayPal&#8217;s TPS is around 193 TPS and VISA can process up to 1,700 TPS.</p>
<h2>Which network has the highest TPS?</h2>
<p>As of now, among all the blockchain networks, Solana network has the maximum TPS done in the world of crypto &#8211; 50,000 TPS. <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, the original cryptocurrency, only has the TPS rate of 7. One of the main criticisms of the OG cryptocurrency Bitcoin is that it is not scalable and its TPS is low. Bitcoin’s low TPS is also cited as why it can never achieve mass adoption.</p>
<p>Currently, Ethereum has a TPS rate of 27, while <a href="https://coingape.com/what-what-is-polygon-blockchain-how-does-matic-works-and-why-it-matters-explained/">Polygon</a> can process 7,000 TPS. However, Ethereum’s TPS is will scale significantly to around 100,000 after it completes its much-anticipated sharding upgrade. Known for enabling easy cross-border transactions, Ripple network handles over 1,500 TPS.</p>
<h2>What constitutes a network’s TPS?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Block Time</strong> &#8211; Average time needed to mine a new block is Block Time of a network. Different blockchain networks have different block times. The leading cryptocurrency bitcoin has a block time of 10 minutes. Compared to bitcoin, Ethereum has significantly less average block time of 10-20 seconds.</li>
<li><strong>Transaction Size</strong> &#8211; Data transmitted with each transaction varies on which blockchain network the transaction is done. A transaction in bitcoin can be as small as under 300 bytes or as large as 500 bytes. The higher the transaction size is, the more time it will take to execute a transaction.</li>
<li><strong>Block Size</strong> &#8211; Block size is the amount of data about transactions a block carries in a blockchain. Higher the block size means more people are needed to run a full node. It&#8217; block size is limited to mere 1 MB, but this small amount of data is enough to store over 2000 transactions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Transaction Per Second is calculated?</h2>
<p>To calculate the TPS on a blockchain, your require information of its block size, transaction size, and block time.</p>
<p><strong>TPS = (block size/ transaction size) / block time.</strong></p>
<h2>Is TPS alone enough to scale a network?</h2>
<p>Blockchain networks having a higher TPS rate is not enough to make a network successful or even compete with the likes of Ethereum and Bitcoin. To truly make a network stand out, it needs to focus on security and other important aspects and not just its TPS rate. Bitcoin uses<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/hash-rate/"> hash rate </a>to measure the security and health of its network.</p>
<p>Although, the importance of a network’s TPS can not be denied as it measures the blockchain’s capacity to process transactions. Furthermore, it is also an indicator of a network&#8217;s potential to scale to accommodate new and better use cases in future. If a blockchain network has a high TPS rate, it usually lacks in other aspects &#8211; decentralization and security. For a blockchain network to achieve all three &#8211; high TPS, security, decentralization- is not easy and that is why blockchain networks are in competition to beat each other in all three aspects and not just TPS.</p>

Despite this, the exchange is &#8220;working to rebuild transaction history&#8221;. This comes excluding the additional $425 million worth of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> that is being held by the Securities Commission of the Bahamas.</p>
<h2>FTX Recovers $5 Billion</h2>
<p>As previously reported by CoinGape, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX&#8217;s</a> total liabilities amount to $8.8 billion. The exchange was said to have limited cash and liquid digital assets at the time, which equated to an estimated $8 billion gap in its balance sheet, according to FTX&#8217;s newly appointed CEO <a href="https://coingape.com/sbf-resigns-john-ray-iii-joins-as-new-ftx-ceo/">John J. Ray III.</a></p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/sam-bankman-fried-hiding-ftx-client-names/">Why Is Sam Bankman-Fried Hiding FTX’s Client Names?</a></em></p>
<p>At the outset of Wednesday&#8217;s hearing, FTX&#8217;s attorney Andy Dietderich informed a U.S. bankruptcy judge in Delaware that:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have located over $5 billion of cash, liquid cryptocurrency and liquid investment securities measured at petition date value. Our holdings are so large relative to the total supply that our positions cannot be sold without substantially affecting the market for the token.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although the company&#8217;s finances have been labeled as inaccurate, Dietderich states that the organization has plans to liquidate non-strategic holdings that have a valuation of $4.6 billion. On the other hand, while speaking about seized assets by the Bahamian authorities, the FTX attorney estimated the assets to be worth as little as $170 million; which the government body touted to be as high as $3.5 billion. According to Dietderich, the majority of the confiscated assets are made up of FTX&#8217;s proprietary and illiquid FTT <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-tokens/">crypto token</a>, the value of which is subject to extreme price swings.</p>
<h2>The FTX Fiasco</h2>
<p>In November, the company submitted its petition for bankruptcy, and in December, prosecutors in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a> accused Bankman-Fried of masterminding an &#8220;epic&#8221; fraud that may have cost investors, consumers, and lenders billions of dollars. Currently, the insolvent firm&#8217;s advisers and attorneys are attempting to recoup funds in order to pay back creditors.</p>
<p>The discredited FTX founder <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sam-bankman-fried/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> recently entered a not-guilty plea to all charges stemming from the exchange&#8217;s failures. An &#8220;FTX Task Force&#8221; has been established by the Southern District of New York Office to track &amp; recover lost customer assets and also to manage legal actions connected to the collapse of the exchange.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="800" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/29114352/XRP-token-price.jpeg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="XRP price News" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent bullish reversal from the $0.33 support revealed the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/double-bottom-pattern/">double bottom pattern</a> in the daily time frame chart. Over the past six days, the XRP price has soared 10.1% and is currently trading at the $0.365 mark. Under the influence of this bullish pattern, the coin price is likely to break the $0.374 resistance, bolstering further growth potential for XRP.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The XRP price potential breakout from $0.374 will prolong the recovery rally to $0.42</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent price jump reclaimed the 20-day EMA, providing the coin holders additional support.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP is $1.16 Billion, indicating a 14.2% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/v/VyMM8rv3.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a majority of major altcoins were rising higher with the new year recovery in the crypto market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-news-ripple-sec-opposing-to-seal-in-latest-motion/">XRP price</a> was struggling to break the local resistance of $0.356. Over the past ten days, this altcoin was wobbling between $0.356 and $0.35, creating a narrow range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the daily candles resonating between the aforementioned range showed several long-wick rejections on either side, accentuating the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market. However, today, the XRP coin witnessed a significant inflow and rose 4% on the intraday level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long bullish candle with sufficient volume breaks the $0.359 resistance, releasing this altcoin from stagnant market sentiment. If the daily candle closes above the breached resistance, the buyers get a higher footing to continue to rally in the price chart.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also read: <a href="https://coingape.com/best-telegram-crypto-channels-list/">CRYPTO TELEGRAM CHANNELS LIST 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, with sustained buying, the XRP price may break the $0.374 neckline resistance of the double bottom pattern. In theory, this pattern in this technical setup is one of the most frequently observed patterns which encourages directional bull run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, a bullish breakout from $ 0.374 will intensify the buying pressure in the market and prolong the bullish growth to $0.396 or $0.42, registering a 10-15% hike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, a less likely yet possible reversal from the $0.374 barrier will undermine the bullish thesis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the downsloping 50-day EMA is currently working in the seller&#8217;s favor trying to stall rising prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative Strength Index:</strong> conversely to the sideways <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">XRP price</a>, the daily RSI slope is sharply rising, reflecting the growth in bullish momentum. Thus, this bullish divergence increases the possibility of a $0.374 breakout.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">XRP intraday price levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.39</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Low</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.374 and $0.396</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.355 and 0.</span></li>

<h2>Client Names Under Wraps</h2>
<p>In response to objections raised by leading media organizations, FTX has requested that its customer names be kept confidential for a period of at least six months. The now-defunct exchange has indicated that it may seek additional extensions, although this will be subject to assessment by the court.</p>

<p>The business has contended that standard bankruptcy regulations, which call for disclosing information about creditors — among them, as many as 9.5 million clients — could expose them to fraud, breach their privacy, and give competitors access, eroding FTX&#8217;s worth as it looks for potential buyers.</p>
<h2>FTX Seeks Auctioning Assets</h2>
<p>In addition, according to court records made by FTX, the four firms that FTX seeks to sell are relatively independent of the larger FTX conglomerate. Furthermore, each entity has its own distinct customer accounts as well as management teams, devoid of any connections or links to the Bankman-Fried led core team.</p>
<p>The Bahamas-based <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/centralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges-cex/">centralized exchange</a> has received scores of unsolicited proposals, but it has not committed to selling any of the companies. Since FTX has plans for scheduling auctions for the months of February and March, they anticipate a rise in bids during that time. However, the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a> Trustee, which is a bankruptcy watchdog under the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/u-s-department-of-justice/">Department of Justice</a>, is opposed to selling the affiliates before a comprehensive investigation can be conducted.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sam-bankman-fried/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, the 30-year-old crypto mogul, was indicted on two counts of wire fraud and six counts of conspiracy in a Manhattan federal court last month. The accusations allege that Bankman-Fried stole customer deposits to pay debts from <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/alameda-research/">Alameda Research</a>. Currently, he is maintaining his innocence at the federal court by pleading not guilty.</p>

While the community has officially passed the two-part proposals, core developer Edward Kim warned of its impact on the community pool. The move comes amid the ongoing effort to increase the LUNC burn rate.</p>
<h2>Two-Part Proposal Passed by the Terra Classic Community</h2>
<p>The proposal aims to stop the re-minting of Terra Classic (LUNC) tokens from burns by setting the seigniorage reward policy to zero and increasing gas fees by 5x to fund the community pool. The proposal was divided into two parts in order to implement the change to the Terra Classic chain.</p>
<p>Proposal 11242 will set the seigniorage reward policy to zero, effectively stopping LUNC re-minting from burns. Currently, the 10% LUNC is re-minted from the 0.2% burn tax after each epoch and added to the community pool.</p>
<p>The proposal has received 95.98% votes in favor from the community. Moreover, 51 validators have voted &#8220;Yes&#8221; and 2 validators have voted &#8220;No&#8221; on the proposal. Top validators such as Allnodes, Orion.Money, Classy&#8217;s Sphere, and others have approved the proposal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Proposal 11243 will increase gas fees by 5 times and 50% of the transaction fee will go to the community pool for developer funding.</p>
<p>The proposal has received 90% of votes in favor and 11% of votes against the proposal. Moreover, 42 validators have voted &#8220;Yes&#8221; and 7 validators have voted &#8220;No&#8221; on the proposal. While validators approved the proposal, new details from Terra Classic core developer Edward Kim led validators to change their vote.</p>
<p>Terra Classic core developer Edward Kim <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/edk208/status/1612177684578050050" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">warns</a> the community that the proposals could severely impact funding for the community pool as data shared in the proposal has a miscalculation. Thus, it shows extra fees being distributed. However, a fix could later witness much less going to the community pool.</p>

<h2>LUNC Price Awaits Rally to $0.00020</h2>
<p>Terra Classic (LUNC) price fell nearly 2% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $0.0001633. The 24-hour low and high are $0.0001623 and $0.0001689, respectively.</p>
<p>As per CoinGape analysis, a <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/emerging-bullish-pattern-sets-lunc-price-to-surpass-0-0002-buy-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potential breakout from $0.000185</a> will intensify the buying momentum and drive the prices 40% higher to hit $0.000285.</p>

<p>Charles Gasparino, FOX Business Journalist in a<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1612911302090887168" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> tweet</a> mentioned that the Coinbase crypto exchange is developing a strategy to survive SEC regulatory crackdown over the digital asset industry. This includes brokers-dealer trading coins registered as securities.</p>
<p>However, this move comes as a much anticipated Summary Judgment in the <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-news-ripple-sec-opposing-to-seal-in-latest-motion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP lawsuit looms in</a>. This suggests that the SEC win in the Ripple lawsuit might force coins aside from Bitcoin (BTC) to register.</p>
<p>He added that the crypto community seeks another bloodbath if the US SEC registers a win against Ripple in the XRP lawsuit. This will motivate the commission to push tougher rules.</p>
<p>FOX Business Journalist highlighted that the SEC oversight will impact nearly every sector including the crypto exchanges. However, this will fulfill Gary Gensler, SEC Chair’s desire to force regulations on every crypto.</p>
<h2>XRP lawyer highlights SEC&#8217;s most important argument</h2>
<p>John Deaton, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/amicus-curiae/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amicus Curiae</a> in the Ripple lawsuit stated this deserves to be covered widely. As the XRP case is one of the most important non-fraud enforcement actions since 1946.</p>
<p>However, he mentioned that SEC has produced one of the strongest general arguments in the case. It has mentioned software sales compared to XRP sales to fund the business and more.</p>

This accounts for approximately 24% of the total <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tokens</a> in supply.</p>
<p>WOO Network website had earlier claimed that the network will work towards the betterment of the token. Citing the reason of the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx-crash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crash of FTX</a> and Terra Sisters in 2022, WOO Network will be working to create an environment that will not be harshly impacted by the adverse market situation.</p>
<p>Hence, they decided to burn a total of 705 million WOO tokens. WOO Token, WOO DAO, and WOO insurance were the fund tokens that were burned. However, the procedure is supposed to stop now.</p>
<h2>WOO takes a step toward transparency</h2>
<p>The network stated that they are working towards the transparency of token distribution as the first step, which will be their “recipe for success”. They also addressed the concerns being raised by the customers and members about the large supply of tokens which eventually led to an increase in inflation.</p>

<p>There has been a wide gap in the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market cap</a> and the fully diluted value of the token. To solve this issue, WOO Network has decided to transfer approximately 545 million WOO reward tokens to a time locked smart contract for vesting. On being vested, they will be in custody until required.</p>
<h2>WOO trading vol spikes by 532%</h2>
<p>The price of the token has surged by 29.56% in the last 7 days. In the last 24 hours, the price of the token hiked by 6.43%. Each WOO token is costing 0.1644 USD. The market cap has gone upwards and stands at 269.094 million USD. The trading volume is seeing a boost of 532.39% as compared to the previous day. <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-134974" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/11182407/WOO_7D_graph_coinmarketcap.jpeg" alt="WOO Price" width="1858" height="800" />Source: coinmarketcap</p>
