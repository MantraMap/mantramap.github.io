The Australian Financial Crimes Exchange said as much as 47% of all fraud and financial scam proceeds in the country are washed on crypto exchange platforms. </strong></p>
<h2>Crypto a &#8216;Getaway Vehicle for Scam Money&#8217;</h2>
<p>According to Anna Bligh, the CEO of the Australian Banking Association (ABA), an &#8220;alarming&#8221; portion of scam money often gets laundered via cryptocurrency exchange platforms. The CEO added that Australian authorities must also do more to &#8220;ensure cryptocurrency is not used as the getaway vehicle for scam money.&#8221; This would be in addition to stopping scams from reaching Australians via mobile phones, emails and social media, a <a href="https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/crypto-platforms-a-getaway-for-half-of-scam-proceeds-20230810-p5dvhc">report</a> said.</p>
<p>The remarks by Bligh are seemingly backed by the latest data from the Australian Financial Crimes Exchange (AFCX). The data reportedly shows that as much as 47% of all proceeds from fraud and financial scams in the country are processed by cryptocurrency exchanges. David Pegley, the managing director of AFCX, added that once the funds are on a crypto platform &#8220;it is extremely difficult to recover them.&#8221;</p>
<p>To combat this problem, a report by the Australian Financial Review said many banks are now restricting the amount of funds sent to crypto exchanges.</p>
<p>&#8220;To protect customers, several banks have responded by imposing limitations on transfers to these exchanges,&#8221; the CEO reportedly said.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<h2>Burdening Users With Undue Restrictions</h2>
<p>Commonwealth Bank, ANZ, National Australia Bank, Westpac, and Bendigo &amp; Adelaide Bank are among the Australian financial institutions which have imposed limits on the amount of funds that customers can transfer to crypto exchanges.</p>
<p>Commenting on banks’ decision to target crypto entities, Blockchain Australia said it favors a more balanced approach, noting:</p>
<blockquote><p>The protection of consumers is paramount, both in protection from scams and not burdening consumers with undue restrictions in who they choose to do business with, which must be evidence-based to ensure they bring genuine benefits without undue costs.</p></blockquote>

The talks in Johannesburg next week will also focus on the expansion of the bloc of emerging economies and the diplomat doesn’t see this as a challenge to any other organization. </strong></p>
<h2>De-Dollarization Not on BRICS Summit’s Agenda, According to South African Representative</h2>
<p>Increasing trade in local currencies will be a subject of the talks between the member states of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BRICS</a> (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) at their meeting in Johannesburg on Aug. 22–24, South Africa’s top diplomat in charge of relations with the organization, Anil Sooklal, told Bloomberg.</p>
<p>While the bloc will consider the establishment of a common payments system and is likely to form a technical committee to explore the issuing of a joint currency, it does not intend to discuss replacing the U.S. dollar as the world’s de facto global currency, he also said, and elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Trading in local currencies is firmly on the agenda. There is no agenda item of de-dollarization on the BRICS agenda. BRICS is not calling for de-dollarization. The dollar will continue to be a major global currency — that’s a reality.</p></blockquote>
<p>BRICS has been looking to deepen trade in the national currencies of its members as part of efforts to increase its influence in the world as it already represents over 42% of the planet’s population and accounts for 23% of the global gross domestic product (GDP) and 18% of international trade.</p>
<p>The group’s New Development Bank (NDB) aims to bring the share of domestic currencies to a third of its lending in the next couple of years, the report noted. Last month, NDB’s Chief Financial Officer, Leslie Maasdorp, pointed out that creating a common currency to challenge the dollar is a medium- to long-term ambition for BRICS.</p>

<p>During the upcoming summit, however, BRICS will mainly focus on whether to induct more countries. Besides the leaders of the current five members, with Russian President Vladimir Putin <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/putin-and-ramaphosa-discuss-brics-summit-trade-and-cooperation-russian-president-to-join-via-video-link/">joining via video link</a>, the heads of state and government of 40 other nations have confirmed their attendance, a number that could rise even further, Sooklal said and added:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think there is a general consensus that BRICS has to expand. We have worked out some rules of procedure and criteria.</p></blockquote>
<p>An earlier report by Bloomberg in July revealed that China’s push for rapid enlargement of the bloc is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-faces-opposition-to-rapid-brics-expansion-from-india-and-brazil-report/">facing opposition</a> from India and Brazil. In early August, the Kremlin’s Press Secretary, Dmitry Peskov, admitted that “certain <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nuances-exist-among-brics-members-regarding-blocs-expansion-kremlin-admits/">nuances exist</a> among members on the subject of expansion.”</p>
<p>In his interview, Anil Sooklal also emphasized that BRICS is not in competition with any other grouping but aims to promote the interests of the developing world.</p>
<p>“There’s an unfortunate narrative being developed that BRICS is anti-West, that BRICS was created as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-is-no-joke-bloc-could-become-g7-counterpart-experts-say/">competition to the G7</a> or the Global North,&#8221; Sooklal noted. &#8220;What we do seek is to advance the agenda of the Global South and to build a more inclusive, representative, just, fair global architecture,” the South African diplomat explained.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you think BRICS members will approve the organization’s expansion and eventually agree to issue a common currency? Tell us in the comments section below. </strong></em></p>

<h2>Ledger Enables Paypal Payments for US Customers to Streamline Crypto Purchases Within App</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, Ledger <a href="https://www.ledger.com/ledger-and-paypal-team-up-to-simplify-entry-into-the-world-of-cryptocurrency">revealed</a> Ledger Live users can now purchase <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> using Paypal. The company believes this offers a &#x201C;convenient, simple and secure way&#x201D; to buy digital currencies through its companion application. Users can select Paypal as their payment method in the app&#x2019;s &#x201C;buy&#x201D; section.</p>
<p>However, this is available only to users who have previously used Paypal to buy crypto assets. Ledger Live users new to Paypal for crypto &#x201C;will be required to create a Paypal account or undergo a KYC verification,&#x201D; according to Ledger. The company directed users to its Help Center for guidance on using Paypal for digital currency purchases.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Both Paypal and Ledger are focused on creating secure, seamless, and fast transactions no matter where you are in the world. Paypal has remained at the forefront of the digital payment revolution for more than 20 years, and we are thrilled to come together in this next period of asset innovation with our integration,&#x201D; said Pascal Gauthier, Ledger&#x2019;s chairman and CEO.</p>

<p>This development comes after Paypal <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/payments-giant-paypal-launches-dollar-backed-stablecoin-pyusd/">introduced</a> its own stablecoin tied to the U.S. dollar, named PYUSD. Though announced, PYUSD hasn&#x2019;t yet been made available to the general public. Over the past two years, Paypal expanded its crypto services. However, this week, the payment giant <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paypal-pauses-uk-crypto-purchases-amid-regulatory-changes-assures-resumption-in-early-2024/">paused</a> crypto purchases in the U.K., citing regulatory shifts. The company stated that crypto buying in the United Kingdom would resume in early 2024.</p>

In addition, the lawmakers stressed that the company has ties to the Chinese government.</strong></p>
<h2>SEC, FINRA Probed Over &#8216;Shady Approval&#8217; of Prometheum</h2>
<p>The U.S. House Financial Services Committee announced Tuesday that the committee&#8217;s chairman, Patrick McHenry (R-NC), has led Republican committee members in probing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) regarding the &#8220;shady approval&#8221; of Prometheum.</p>
<p>Referencing the letters dated Aug. 9 that the lawmakers sent to SEC Chair Gary Gensler and FINRA President and CEO Robert Cook, the Twitter account for Financial Services GOP wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Chairman Patrick McHenry led Republicans on the Financial Services Committee in letters to FINRA and SEC regarding the shady approval of Prometheum as the only special purpose broker-dealer for digital assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Congressman Scott Fitzgerald (R-WI), who also signed the letter, tweeted: &#8220;It’s concerning that SEC Chair Gensler’s first and only approval of a special purpose broker-dealer for digital assets was done for a company with strong ties to the CCP [Chinese Communist Party]. I joined [the Financial Services Committee] in demanding transparency around this decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>In their letter to the SEC, the lawmakers asked the regulator to &#8220;provide all documents and communications, between and among SEC employees, related or referring to Prometheum’s application to become a special purpose broker-dealer, as soon as possible but no later than 5:00 pm, August 22, 2023.&#8221;</p>
<p>The SEC created a new class of broker-dealers called special purpose brokers-dealers (SPBDs) in 2020 to allow for the custody of digital asset securities. FINRA approved the first SPBD, Prometheum Ember Capital LLC, in May 2023. Several other firms have applied for SPBD approval, but FINRA has not yet approved them. The lawmakers stressed: &#8220;The timing and circumstances surrounding the approval of Prometheum as the first SPBD raise serious questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>They added: “The approval comes as the Committee is considering addressing gaps in the regulation of digital assets … The legislation was ultimately released on June 2, 2023. The timing of the approval raises concerns that it was aimed at demonstrating that legislation is not needed because there is a workable regulatory framework for the custody of digital asset securities.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lawmakers detailed that Prometheum “has not yet served a single customer,” emphasizing: “It has also refused to make public the digital asset securities that Prometheum ATS would support on its platform … Furthermore, Prometheum is not currently able to perform clearing or settlement services, which would be required to operate as an alternative trading system.” They stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is unclear why FINRA would have chosen to approve a firm with no operating history and no track record of serving customers over all the applications that it has received.</p></blockquote>
<p>Moreover, the lawmakers raised concerns that Prometheum “has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-expresses-concern-over-prometheum-co-ceos-congressional-testimony/">ties to the Chinese government</a>,” which they view as serious national security and data privacy concerns. U.S. Congressman Ritchie Torres has previously called for an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-representative-ritchie-torres-calls-for-investigation-of-sec-over-prometheums-license/">investigation</a> into the special purpose broker-dealer license given to Prometheum by the SEC.</p>

Emphasizing that the national debt is &#x201C;too high,&#x201D; he cautioned that holders of the U.S. dollar will be in trouble.</strong></p>
<h2>Robert Kiyosaki&#x2019;s Gold, Silver, Bitcoin Predictions</h2>
<p>The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, has shared his predictions about the price of gold, silver, and bitcoin. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.</p>
<p>In a tweet Monday, Kiyosaki explained that while he expects the price of bitcoin to reach $100K in the near term, he believes that it could soar to $1 million while gold will rise to $75K and silver will trade at $60K if the world economy crashes. Noting that he has been saying for years that gold and silver are God&#x2019;s money while bitcoin is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-he-likes-bitcoin-calls-btc-peoples-money/">people&#x2019;s money</a>, the famous author wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bad news: If stock & bond markets crash, gold & silver skyrocket. Worse news: If world economy crashes, bitcoin [will rise to] $1 million, gold $75K, [and] silver to $60K.</p></blockquote>
<p>He added that savers who hold the U.S. dollar, which he called &#x201C;fake&#x201D; money, will be in serious trouble, noting that the U.S. national debt is &#x201C;too high.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Kiyosaki often said that gold, silver, and bitcoin are his preferred investments, emphasizing that they are the best for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-about-stocks-bonds-mutual-funds-says-bitcoin-best-for-unstable-times/">unstable times</a>. Following his warning about a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-we-are-in-global-recession-warns-of-soaring-bankruptcies-unemployment-homelessness/">global recession</a>, he cautioned in May that the world economy is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-world-economy-on-the-verge-of-collapse-warns-of-bank-runs-frozen-savings-bail-ins/">on the verge of collapse</a>.</p>
<p>The renowned author predicted in February that the price of bitcoin will hit <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-predicts-bitcoin-hitting-500k-by-2025-and-gold-soaring-to-5k/">$500,000 by 2025</a> while gold will soar to $5K and silver will hit $500 during that time period. He recently started saying that the price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will hit $100K this year, and $120K next year, which is the same prediction made by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/standard-chartered-raises-bitcoin-price-forecast-now-expects-btc-to-reach-50000-this-year-120000-next-year/">Standard Chartered Bank</a>. This week, he urged investors to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-recommends-buying-silver-before-its-gone/">buy silver</a> before it&#x2019;s gone, noting that it is more affordable than gold.</p>
<p>Kiyosaki has also been warning that the U.S. economy is headed for a &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-of-crash-landing-after-us-rating-downgrade/">crash landing</a>.&#x201D; He previously said America is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rich-dad-poor-dad-author-robert-kiyosaki-says-america-is-bankrupt-amid-us-debt-crisis/">bankrupt</a> and warned of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-america-is-dying-warns-of-hyperinflation-death-of-us-dollar/">hyperinflation</a>. The Rich Dad Poor Dad author has been cautioning that a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosakis-warnings-giant-crash-incoming-end-of-us-dollar-approaching/">giant crash</a> is coming for quite some time. Moreover, he warned that the U.S. dollar will &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-insists-us-dollar-will-die-as-brics-summit-nears-41-nations-to-de-dollarize-the-world/">die</a>&#x201D; as the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) plan to launch a common currency.</p>

<h2>Coinbase Reaches &#8216;Critical Milestone&#8217;</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) announced Wednesday that it has reached &#8220;a critical milestone&#8221; by securing regulatory approval to offer crypto futures to eligible U.S. users. The announcement details:</p>
<blockquote><p>Coinbase Financial Markets Inc. has secured regulatory approval from the National Futures Association (NFA), a CFTC-designated self-regulatory organization, to operate a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) and offer eligible U.S. customers access to crypto futures from our platforms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Coinbase filed an application with the NFA in September 2021 to register an FCM. The exchange stated Wednesday that the “approval has been secured.”</p>
<p>Noting that “This is a critical milestone that reaffirms our commitment to operate a regulated and compliant business and be the most trusted and secure crypto-native platform for our customers,” the announcement states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Coinbase will now be the first crypto-native leader to directly offer traditional spot crypto trading alongside regulated and leveraged crypto futures, on an integrated trading solution for our verified customers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, Coinbase is broadening its global presence. The exchange announced its official <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-launches-in-canada-executive-says-canada-well-positioned-to-be-a-global-leader-in-crypto-economy/">launch in Canada</a> earlier this week.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq-listed crypto trading platform is also currently engaged in a legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The regulator <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed charges</a> against Coinbase in June accusing the company of operating an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. Nonetheless, Coinbase <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-disputes-secs-allegation-that-the-exchange-lists-9-crypto-securities/">maintains</a> that the tokens it lists on its platforms are not securities. In contrast, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler views <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chairman-explains-why-he-views-all-crypto-tokens-other-than-bitcoin-as-securities/">all crypto tokens</a>, with the exception of bitcoin, as securities. Coinbase has appealed to the court to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-urges-court-to-dismiss-sec-case-claiming-regulator-overstepped-its-statutory-authority/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dismiss</a> the SEC lawsuit, arguing that the regulatory body has exceeded its statutory authority.</p>

On Monday, U.S. federal prosecutors also alleged that he used two FTX executives as “straw donors” to evade contribution limits.</strong></p>
<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried Gave Money to Both Democrats and Republicans to Ensure FTX Continues to Grow</h2>
<p>The founder and CEO of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a>, Sam Bankman-Fried, used money stolen from customers of the trading platform to make over $100 million in contributions for political campaigns ahead of the 2022 midterm elections in the U.S., prosecutors said.</p>
<p>The government is also accusing SBF of directing two FTX executives to donate to candidates from both the Democratic and the Republican Party in order to evade contribution limits and conceal the origin of the funds, Reuters reported, quoting the indictment against him which also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>He leveraged this influence, in turn, to lobby Congress and regulatory agencies to support legislation and regulation he believed would make it easier for FTX to continue to accept customer deposits and grow.</p></blockquote>
<p>The new indictment does not provide the names of the two executives that Bankman-Fried allegedly used as “straw donors,” but other court documents show they are FTX’s former Engineering Director Nishad Singh and Ryan Salame, former co-CEO of FTX’s unit in the Bahamas.</p>
<p>Singh, who donated $9.7 million to Democrats and their causes, pleaded guilty to fraud and campaign finance violations in February, while Salame gave more than $24 million to Republicans in 2022, but has not been charged with a crime. The numbers come from the Federal Elections Commission.</p>

<p>Bankman-Fried was arrested and extradited from the Bahamas, where he resided and FTX was headquartered, in December 2022, about a month after his crypto exchange <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed</a> for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. He has previously pleaded not guilty to stealing customer funds.</p>
<p>The former crypto billionaire now faces seven counts of conspiracy and fraud over the collapse of FTX, which was one of the world’s largest trading platforms for digital assets. The U.S. had to drop a charge of conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws because the Bahamian government had not agreed to extradite him on that count.</p>
<p>However, U.S. prosecutors <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-to-face-campaign-finance-charge-prosecutors-say/">said</a> last week it will nevertheless be incorporated into other counts in a superseding indictment that would “make clear that Mr. Bankman-Fried remains charged with conducting an illegal campaign finance scheme as part of the fraud and money laundering schemes originally charged.”</p>
<p>Last Friday, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-boss-sam-bankman-fried-in-custody-bail-revoked-remanded-to-jail/">jailed</a> SBF based on accusations of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sam-bankman-fried-seeks-to-avoid-jail-denies-witness-tampering-in-ftx-case/">witness tampering</a> ahead of his trial scheduled to begin on Oct. 2. Bankman-Fried had been living under house arrest at his parent’s home in California on a $250 million bond.</p>

Notably, even amidst this hiatus, users can continue to hold their crypto within the Paypal ecosystem and are free to liquidate their digital holdings whenever they wish.</strong></p>
<h2>Paypal Temporarily Halts UK Cryptocurrency Buys</h2>
<p>British Paypal users will find their ability to acquire digital currencies curtailed post-October 1, 2023. This temporary measure, as highlighted in an <a href="https://twitter.com/Crypto_Crib_/status/1691661748359614481?s=20">email</a> to U.K. customers, is set to last until sometime in the early part of 2024, with the company assuring, &#8220;We expect to re-enable crypto purchases in early 2024.&#8221;</p>
<p>This development trails Paypal&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/payments-giant-paypal-launches-dollar-backed-stablecoin-pyusd/">introduction</a> of a stablecoin, PYUSD, anchored to the U.S. dollar&#8217;s value. To reflect on the timeline, Paypal had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paypal-launches-cryptocurrency-services-in-uk/">unveiled</a> its crypto services in the U.K. in August 2021, with a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paypal-completes-rollout-crypto-offering-uk-first-international-expansion-outside-us/">full-fledged deployment</a> by September. From that juncture, users could transact in four diverse digital currencies.</p>

<p>The catalyst behind this interim cessation? Paypal cites the “new rules enacted by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) that require crypto firms to implement additional steps before customers can purchase crypto.” The digital payment juggernaut elaborated, “While we work to satisfy these new regulations, you won&#8217;t be able to buy crypto using Paypal.”</p>
<p>Emphasizing its stringent adherence to regulatory frameworks, Paypal added:</p>
<blockquote><p>We remain deeply committed to our compliance obligations and Paypal consistently works closely with regulators around the world to adhere to applicable rules and regulations in the markets in which we operate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Though the email remains non-committal on a specific restart date, Paypal expressed its regret for the potential inconvenience. The company reassured its U.K. customer base, promising to alert them once the service is back in action, enabling them to dive back into crypto acquisitions.</p>

While the company remains tight-lipped about the participants in this financial endeavor, this fresh infusion of capital catapults the firm&#8217;s post-valuation to $1.75 billion.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitgo Raises $100 Million From Undisclosed Investors</h2>
<p>Bitgo has successfully bagged $100 million in a Series C funding round, with the investors&#8217; names under wraps, as per a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-16/bitgo-bucks-crypto-downturn-to-raise-funding-at-1-75-billion-valuation">report</a>. Bitgo’s top executive, Mike Belshe, acknowledged the challenging market landscape. Yet, he emphasized the company’s commitment to licensing and regulatory measures, noting, “Regulatory safety is top-of-mind for everyone,” in a conversation with Bloomberg&#8217;s Hannah Miller.</p>
<p>This update comes on the heels of Galaxy Digital <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/galaxy-digital-terminates-1-2-billion-bitgo-acquisition-deal-crypto-firm-still-plans-for-nasdaq-listing/">scrapping</a> its intentions to snap up Bitgo for a cool $1.2 billion in August 2022. Earlier, in June, Bitgo had its eyes on the beleaguered crypto custodian, Prime Trust, with <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/digital-asset-trust-firm-bitgo-sets-sights-on-prime-trust-acquisition/">acquisition plans</a>. However, the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitgo-abandons-acquisition-of-prime-trust-amidst-nevada-based-custodians-ongoing-uncertainty/">deal fell through</a>. Prime Trust soon found itself <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-crypto-custodian-to-court-prime-trust-files-for-bankruptcy-protection/">filing</a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection the following month.</p>

<p>Though the Prime Trust deal went south, Belshe indicated to Miller that a portion of this fresh capital would fuel future acquisitions. He alluded to two potential buyouts already in the pipeline, as cited by Miller. While Bitgo remains mum on this round&#8217;s backers, past investors have featured big names like Pantera Capital, Digital Currency Group, Redpoint, Goldman Sachs, and DRW Holdings.</p>

Bearish sentiment remained high as the session progressed, with the global market cap falling by nearly 2% today. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> also plunged in today&#x2019;s session.</strong></p>
<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) fell for a fourth straight session, as bears continue to regain momentum, following last week&#x2019;s gains.</p>
<p>After peaking at $0.07407 on Tuesday, DOGE/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.06893 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>As a result of this fall in price, dogecoin slipped to its lowest level since July 19, when price was at a bottom of $0.0682.</p>

<p>The decline comes following a downward crossover of the moving averages, which is also known as a death cross.</p>
<p>This week&#x2019;s bearish momentum intensified after DOGE moved below a support point at $0.0730.</p>
<p>Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) also edged lower, dropping to a reading of 39.10, its lowest in four weeks.</p>

<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, formerly ripple, also remained in the red on Wednesday, dropping to a multi-week low in the process.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD bottomed out at $0.5918 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes following Tuesday&#x2019;s high at $0.6275.</p>
<p>Similar to dogecoin above, today&#x2019;s drop in price saw <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> move to its lowest point since mid-July.</p>

<p>One of the catalysts for the sell-off was a breakout of a support point at the 40.00 mark on the RSI indicator.</p>
<p>The index is now tracking at 36.76, which is its weakest point since May, a point when the price was hovering around $0.4600.</p>
<p>Bulls will hope to reject further drops in price, however will first need to drop below an upcoming floor at the 32.00 zone.</p>
