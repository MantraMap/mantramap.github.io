<p>XRP adherents remain confident that Ripple will trump the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the ongoing legal brawl. Attorney John Deaton, moderator of over 75,000 XRP holders participating as amici curiae in the case, recently reiterated this sentiment.</p>



<p>In a Twitter thread, the Crypto Law founder wrote that Ripple&#8217;s victory is certain thanks in part to the SEC stretching its arguments &#8220;too far.&#8221; He explains that the SEC claims the disputed XRP token &#8220;was, is, and always will be a security.&#8221;</p>



<p>The regulator also maintains that XRP sales make Ripple, exchanges, and XRP holders participants in a common enterprise. According to Deaton, this argument means that XRP satisfies all three prongs of the Howey test.</p>



<p>However, the attorney notes that the SEC has not presented evidence to back its later claims. Instead, Ripple has forced the regulator to admit that owning XRP does not give holders any rights in the company. XRP holders have also proven that they majorly purchased XRP without knowledge of Ripple&#8217;s involvement and for non-investment purposes.</p>



<p>Similarly, Deaton states that the SEC&#8217;s stance on XRP satisfying Howey is impossible to define in space or time. Based on this, Deaton asserts that those predicting XRP is doomed are overstating the SEC&#8217;s chances.</p>



<h2 id="h-ripple-coasting-to-victory-after-the-last-day-of-filing"><strong>Ripple coasting to victory after the last day of filing? </strong></h2>



<p>Deaton&#8217;s analysis comes after he opined that the SEC&#8217;s strongest argument would be to establish that Ripple sold XRP to fund itself. However, he notes that this path, too, will fail the securities watchdog. This is because it will lead to convincing the judge that the entire XRP ecosystem is the common enterprise.</p>



<p>He also pointed out that the SEC has attempted the argument through an expert witness. But it abandoned the witness following rebuff from Ripple and XRP holders.</p>



<p>Notably, the case has dragged on since December 2020 and finally reached the summary judgment stage. Experts in the XRP community speculate that this ruling may come <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-sec-suit-did-xrp-sales-violate-securities-laws-judge-could-declare-verdict-as-soon-as-june/">before June 2023</a>.</p>



<p>The general market sentiment is also anticipating the case&#8217;s outcome. The consensus is that a ruling in <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripples-win-in-xrp-lawsuit-against-sec-proves-pivotal-what-to-expect-from-the-market-this-year/">favour of Ripple</a> will cause the price of XRP to explode. XRP trades at around $0.41 at press time, up 3.62% in the daily chart.</p>



<p>However, there is also some concern as a ruling in favour of the SEC is expected to give the regulator more impetus to go after other crypto projects massively.</p>

<p>Cardano’s ADA is one of the major cryptocurrencies that led gains this week, rising 9% to an intraday high of $0.377 with weekly gains of 22%, per data provided by CoinMarketCap. The upsurge has driven ADA’s market capitalization to more than $13 billion, with the daily trading volume topping $700M.</p>



<p>Although there is not one specific reason behind ADA’s bull run, increasing decentralized finance (DeFi) activity could be one of them. Onchain data by Defillama shows a rise in transaction volumes across most NFT, lending, gaming, and DEXs built on Cardano.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides, Cardano&#8217;s enthusiasts <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ada-leads-weekend-gains-as-cardano-eyes-super-bullish-milestones-for-2023-bitcoin-ether-little-changed/">are optimistic</a> about the ongoing developments in the blockchain, including lace wallet and Hoskinson Health &amp; Wellness Clinic based in Wyoming. Lace is a Web 3 wallet platform on Cardano, released as a testnet for managing digital assets, NFTs, and DeFi services.</p>



<h2 id="h-cardano-is-pushing-ada-adoption-in-healthcare-and-entertainment-joints"><strong>Cardano Is Pushing ADA Adoption in Healthcare and Entertainment Joints</strong></h2>



<p>Hoskinson Health &amp; Wellness Clinic is a healthcare centre that is perceived as one of the ways Cardano is pushing for the adoption of its native token, ADA. The platform’s co-founder, Charles Hoskinson, recently announced that the new facility would accept ADA as payment. The centre offers medical services, including mental health care, health screening, nutrition, and women’s health. Last year, Cardano also announced the launch of Nessie’s restaurant and a whiskey lounge in Wyoming, also accepting ADA.</p>



<p>The surge can also be related to the activities around non-fungible tokens in the cryptocurrency space. The recent debut of the Shiba Inu-themed token <a href="https://zycrypto.com/explosive-moves-in-the-offing-for-shiba-inu-bonk-and-dogecoin-as-trading-volume-tops-25-billion/">BONK</a> equally caused a pump in the value of Solana’s SOL token. The macroeconomic factors also show that the inflation rate could be easing, and investors could jump in and drive crypto prices higher sooner than later.</p>



<p>Cardano’s positive sentiment happens amid an uptick in cryptocurrency market capitalization, up 6% to $1.05 trillion at press time. Bitcoin has reclaimed the $23k level, while ETH is also on the green, hovering above $1,650.</p>

<p>“I didn’t realise it would ask for contributions”, Sam Bankman-Fried responded as a Twitter user (@Compound248) pointed out the paywall to the embattled FTX founder’s newly opened Substack. Over the past few weeks, Sam has taken time to reiterate his innocence, pointing accusing fingers at rival Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao for the fall of FTX and claiming his company would have survived if it was allowed to live a few weeks longer.</p>



<p>“I am not aware” was another famous response to many questions prodded at the Bahamas-based founder as regards fraudulent operations between FTX and its money laundering sister arm, Alameda. Caroline Ellis, the now-defunct manager of Alameda who turned on Sam by pleading guilty, had disclosed to the government that Sam had knowledge of and in most cases, was in control of the multiple decisions to syphon user&#8217;s deposit. Sam and co-founder Gary Wang together owned Alameda.</p>



<p>Now broke and under house arrest with a pile of legal fees stacking higher than the empire state, poor Sam has turned to Substack to journal his own side of the story—or another swathe of implicative evidence. His lawyers are fighting hard to reclaim Sam’s $450 million Robinhood shares, which currently remain under government forfeiture, citing the need for their client to foot his legal defence as a necessary right.</p>



<p>In what looks like an interesting tell-all narrative on Substack, Sam declared to offer his total Robinhood shares towards settling aggrieved customers in turn for recognition of his directors and officers (D&amp;O) liability insurance. The ex-Forbes billionaire goes on to declare that FTX had approximately “$350 million in cash in excess of customer funds” when filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy. He further explained that potential funding offers to the tune of $4 billion were already in the pipes and could have injected more health into the ailing exchange, providing enough financial covering for customers—had it been allowed to stay a little longer.</p>



<p>What seemed puzzling to readers is that Alameda magically wiped off 80% of its $100 billion valuation in less than 48 months, per Sam’s calculations.</p>



<p>Sam has hired five lawyers and a spokesperson for the legal tussle ahead. Chief among them is Ira Sorkin, who represented the late Bernie Madoff—a popular American Ponzi conman who fleeced nearly $68 billion victims—in 2009. The number is oddly well-justified for a case of bankruptcy in two countries, multiple civil lawsuits from private and government institutions and a potential jail time in multiple decades. </p>

<li>Cybersecurity firm CertiK warns that malicious actors may continue to exploit decentralized applications in 2023.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The firm has also cautioned users to guard their private keys as the success rate of bad actors could be due to poor user security.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Wallet developers and crypto executives to intensify user education efforts this year to avoid losses.</li>
</ul>



<p>Digital asset fraud was over $4 billion last year, with the 10 largest grossing $2.1 billion as the industry recorded massive rug pull schemes and flash loan hacks.</p>



<p>Cybersecurity firm CertiK has told users not to expect a respite from bad actors this year but to protect their private keys as hackers may focus on that front this year. The firm stated that the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-scammers-stole-3-5-billion-from-investors-in-2022-report/">frequent</a> hacks of last year show that bad actors may not slow down in 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>We saw a large number of incidents last year despite the crypto bear market, so we do not anticipate a respite in exploits, flash loans, or exit scams.”</em></p>



<p>The firm places more emphasis on bridge exploits because malicious actors within the crypto space ran riot last year, stealing over $1.4 on the largest six bridge exploits alone. </p>



<p>On wallet security, the company foresees fewer attacks on digital asset wallets because users have gotten a good grasp of the Profanity tool vulnerability which bad actors used to defraud users in the past. The tool allows users to create ‘vanity addresses’ which can be exploited by malicious players. </p>



<p>According to the firm, wallet hacks this year will be largely caused by poor user security.</p>



<p><em>“It’s possible that funds lost to private key compromises in 2023 will be due to poor management of private keys, bar any future vulnerability found in wallet generators,” </em>the company added.</p>



<h2 id="h-bad-actors-will-cripple-the-market">Bad actors will cripple the market&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Amidst digital assets&#8217; turmoil in 2022, frequent scams put the market in a bad situation. Last year, over $2.1 billion was lost in the ten largest incidents alone, most being attacks on DApps, while in 2021, over $10 billion was lost from DApps. </p>



<p>With several <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-based-defi-platform-loses-100-million-in-gruesome-hack-as-network-woes-continue/">reported</a> flash loan attacks, bridge attacks, and wallet scams, wrong signals were sent to investors and authorities on digital assets. More attacks and scams will lead to stricter regulations which may have a negative undertone in the long run.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year comes with many prospects for digital assets as key areas look to get more adoption, as suggested by Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin last month. Still, the growth in wallets and DApps can be hindered by the activities of bad actors.</p>

<p>A Deloitte report, “The Metaverse in Asia- Strategies for Accelerating Economic Impact”, estimates that the impact of the metaverse on GDP in Asia could be between US$0.8-1.4 trillion per year, roughly 1.3-2.4% of overall GDP per year by 2035. </p>



<p>Whilst there is no universally agreed definition, the metaverse is envisaged as a highly immersive virtual world where people gather to socialize, play and work. The metaverse development is underpinned by several underlying technologies, including hardware devices, computing and communication networks, 3D real-time technology, Artificial Intelligence, and blockchain distributed ledger technologies.</p>



<p>According to the Deloitte report, the metaverse has the potential to transform economies in various ways. These include the expansion of access to information, digital content and digital infrastructure; the creation of new employment opportunities, including jobs that have yet to exist; improvement in ways of working between geographies, businesses, and organisations, including the facilitation of remote working, training and collaboration across different locations, and the creation of new marketplaces and types of businesses particularly to exchange digital goods and services. </p>



<p>As per the report, the potential economic impact of the metaverse on Mainland China is projected to be US$ 456-862 billion per year by 2035. The automobile and healthcare are among the sectors in China that are to be greatly influenced by developments in the metaverse.</p>



<p>The automobile industry is to be impacted in the areas of manufacturing, product customisation, marketing and brand loyalty. The report further states that the BMW Group’s Plant Lydia in Shenyang, China, is set to be one of the world’s first plants designed in the metaverse. In the near future, customers are expected to test-drive their vehicle within the metaverse on the day of any vehicle launch. </p>



<p>The metaverse is also projected to provide significant benefits to the healthcare sector. The efficient management of health data, including security and storage, on the blockchain and the provision of telemedicine consultations at separate locations through Virtual Reality (VR) technology are among the possibilities within the metaverse.</p>



<p>In the healthcare sector, the report cites the Chinese haptic robotics startup, Intelligent Haptronic Solutions, which is developing VR-based digestive endoscopy simulators and training robots to enhance surgical training.</p>



<p>According to the Deloitte report, the successful future of the metaverse calls for collective responsibility by all ecosystem actors, including government, telecom operators and the technology sector, businesses and start-ups, researchers and academics, metaverse users and the general public. The report notes that Asian economies are employing different strategies to accelerate the economic benefits of the metaverse. </p>



<p>The metaverse is expected to disrupt many sectors ranging from entertainment to retail, real estate, education, fashion, gaming, sports, advertising, cybersecurity and financial services.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Bitcoin and Ether, the two biggest crypto assets by market capitalization, saw additional gains as the broader crypto industry kept on its unforeseen surge this year.</p>



<p>At press time, Bitcoin was holding steady at about $22,821 after growing over 10% in the past 24 hours. <a href="https://zycrypto.com/market-manipulation-former-sec-official-reveals-factors-propelling-bitcoins-latest-price-ascent/">Bitcoin’s epic surge</a> comes after it encountered minor resistance at around $21,500 on Jan 17, recoiling back to $20,480 mid-week. On the other hand, Ether was trading at $1,670 after posting over 7% gains in the same period.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-6-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-77362" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-6-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-6-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-6-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-6-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-6-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Other cryptos followed suit, with Solana posting the most gains among the top ten categories of coins by market cap. At press time, SOL was trading at $25.16, up over 18% over the past day, as seen on CoinMarketCap. Cardano, DOGE, XRP and BNB followed closely, gaining about 9%, 7.63%, 5.28% and 5.68% in the same period.</p>



<p>The overnight surge in crypto prices led to&nbsp;66,850&nbsp;short traders being liquidated. At press time, the total number of liquidations in the past 24 hours stood at&nbsp;$299.48 million, according to data from Coinglass. Notably, the global crypto market cap grew over 6% overnight to tap $1.04T after losing the $1 trillion threshold last November.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The surge comes despite fears that a raft of evidence that conditions are still not ready to settle down will deter crypto investors. This week, Genesis Trading became the latest casualty of the industry’s woes, filing for bankruptcy protection after suffering crippling losses following the collapse of FTX and hedge fund Three Arrows capital. Genesis is part of Digital Currency Group, a conglomerate helmed by Barry Silbert, which has been fighting to keep its head up in recent months amid <a href="https://zycrypto.com/gemini-accuses-dcg-of-being-behind-genesis-woes/">fraud allegations</a> by Gemini.</p>



<p>Despite the bad news, onchain metrics suggest investors are moving past bad narratives and have started positioning themselves for the next bull rally.</p>



<p>Earlier today, crypto analytics platform Santiment attributed Bitcoin’s overnight spike to a wall of money put into purchasing the asset by whales.</p>



<p><em>“Bitcoin </em><em>has now surpassed $22.7k for the first time since August 18, 2022. The price rise has come as the large whale tier group of addresses holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC has collectively accumulated 64,638 ($1.46 billion) BTC in the past 15 days,”</em> the firm tweeted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pierre Rochard, Vice President of Research at Riot Platforms, noted that Bitcoin’s value was likely to keep increasing towards $25,000 as fundamentals keep improving, especially on a relative basis.</p>



<p><em>“Bullish scenario: we&#8217;re exiting disillusionment, getting ready for next year&#8217;s halving, bitcoin doing its own thing regardless of macro,”</em> he said. He states, “<em>given the impossibility of predicting BTC&#8217;s volatile exchange rate, steady long-term accumulation is the way.”</em></p>

<ul>
<li>An easing macroeconomic environment is giving bitcoin a bullish sentiment.</li>



<li>But some market analysts believe the worst is yet to come.</li>
</ul>



<p>Leading cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was hard-hit last year, trading as low as $15k in November after the epic collapse of FTX. That has since changed, and the price has climbed to $23,010 at press time, representing a 35% gain per data from CoinMarketCap. The uptrend, also reflected in other digital assets, has driven the global market cap to over a trillion dollars.</p>



<p>However, crypto enthusiasts are questioning whether bitcoin could sustain the positive momentum, coming amid an easing inflation rate and increasing job numbers, or whether a trend reversal is imminent. The US Labor Department recently issued data showing that inflation was moderating, and consumer prices were up by 6.5% in December. The question mostly asked is whether bitcoin has bottomed in yet.</p>



<p>Sean Farrell, the head of the digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, shared his thoughts with Bloomberg, lauding the positive sentiment amid the troubles facing Genesis Capital’s parent company DCG. ‘‘This week’s follow-through in price action is certainly encouraging’’ and defying any forced liquidations from the beleaguered crypto firm DCG, ‘‘there is a high probability that the absolute bottom in for crypto prices.’’</p>



<h2 id="h-others-believe-we-could-see-the-lowest-btc-price-in-2023"><strong>Others Believe We Could See the Lowest BTC Price in 2023</strong></h2>



<p>Not so is the case among the other online crypto community members, who believe the worst is yet to come. Rekt Capital, a crypto trader with more than 300k followers on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1614060922896613379">said</a> that BTC could bottom in 2023 based on the technical aspects. ‘‘This current BTC Weekly Candle is looking very similar to the April 2019 Weekly Candle that confirmed a new Bull Market.’’</p>



<p>Still, some market analysts think the price could have reached the overbought territory, and the rally may not be sustainable. According to Katie Stockton of Fairland Strategies, $21,500 is at a Fibonacci retracement level – horizontal lines showing levels price can reverse direction. ‘‘Deeply overbought short-term readings challenge positive momentum, so we could not chase the rally at these levels,’’ she noted.</p>



<p>Says Hayden Hughes, the chief executive officer of Alpha Impact, a social trading firm: ‘‘Declining CPI coupled with the announcement that the FTX liquidators have recovered $5 billion in liquid assets have given crypto markets plenty of factors to forget the macro picture.’’ He added that the ‘‘markets have plenty of positive momentum heading into the next FOMC meeting next month.</p>

<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s recent 20% pump from a price of $16,000 to $21,425 signifies that investors are, once again, renewing their interest and confidence in cryptocurrencies, and comes after the latest inflation data showed a fall of 0.1% in the consumer price index during December 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the CEO of the Bitcoins-rewards app Lolli Alex Adelman, the cryptocurrency is about to see better days in the coming weeks and months.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;This new downward trend &#8220;for inflation suggests that FED may ease off of increased interest rates and loosen monetary policy in the coming months, which will continue to boost investor confidence and interest in Bitcoin,&#8221; he said. </em></p>



<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s recent sustained price rally, which started on the 8th of this month and touched a 4-month high of $21,425 is far from stalling. Before then, the cryptocurrency industry had a tough 2022, with the price of one Bitcoin falling to as low as $16,291 in November 2022. The collapse of FTX increased FED interest rates, and sustained inflation worsened crypto markets as investors stayed away. </p>



<p>Adelman said last week&#8217;s rally also signifies that the markets were recovering from the anxieties caused by the FTX collapse in which thousands of investors lost their money.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are likely to see Bitcoin continue to trade higher in the first part of 2023, particularly as the FTX debacle has highlighted the fundamental differences between Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies that are not secure stores of value,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The adoption of Bitcoin by leading firms like Blackrock that we saw in 2022 showed us that mainstream interest in Bitcoin is here to stay. As Bitcoin&#8217;s increased price holds, we will see new levels of adoption among retail and institutional investors this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He is optimistic that Bitcoin will remain strong moving into next month as more investors turn to it as a more secure and digital-age-relevant store of value.</p>



<p>However, many other experts have expressed an opposing view that the price rally could only be short-lived. CakeDEFI CEO Dr Julian Hosp, for instance, said last week that there currently is a lack of substance for a real uptrend in crypto prices.</p>



<p>Hosp said the current crypto price uptrend may only be a result of short-term factors and is characterized by, among others, thin trading volumes, many bankrupt trading desks, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/market-manipulation-former-sec-official-reveals-factors-propelling-bitcoins-latest-price-ascent/">market manipulation</a> by some crypto firms, market hopium, pent-up liquidity from holidays, and short-selling, which could pull down the prices in due course.</p>

<p>Genesis Global Holding Corporation has officially filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy. The trading and lending subsidiary of Digital Currency Group submitted filings late Thursday night at the New York Southern District Bankruptcy Court, bringing the toll of top-tier bankrupt crypto companies to 10.</p>



<p>The company first disclosed plans to declare insolvency after news of FTX&#8217;s collapse hit the mainstream late last year. It had been badly affected to the tune of $175 million.</p>



<p>Combined losses from investments in FTX and the now-defunct Three Arrow’s Capital, which went down last year, hit $1.3 billion, forcing the trading desk to fold up. In the weeks before the announcement, the Barry Silbert-owned exchange had tried to stay afloat by cutting back 30% of its workforce, even as pressures mounted from the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its industry partner, Gemini.</p>



<p>The SEC accused Genesis and Gemini of creating and trading unauthorised crypto assets. The partner program designed to reward depositors a 7.4% interest went awry as Genesis battled to account for over $900 million of deposited customer assets from Gemini. </p>



<p>Genesis will have to settle over $9 billion in debts, with a third going to the top 50 creditors.</p>



<h2 id="h-another-one-bites-the-dust"><strong>Another One Bites The Dust</strong></h2>



<p>Genesis is the latest in a growing list of crypto companies going bankrupt. Voyager, Celsius, Terraform, BlockFi, Babel Finance, FTX, Zipmex, and Hodlnaut have all thrown in the towel over the last year in what many described as the coldest crypto winter ever. The ripple effect of these moribund companies is yet to be fully determined, as many other crypto companies are believed to be affected by the contagion, just like Genesis.</p>



<p>However, crypto communities remain optimistic about the possible survival of other DCG subsidiaries. Established in 2015, Genesis is the oldest of seven major DCG sub-divisions, CoinDesk, Grayscale, Foundry, Luno, HQ and Tradeblock.</p>



<h2 id="h-bankruptcy-without-delay"><strong>Bankruptcy Without Delay</strong></h2>



<p>In a written statement following the filing, Genesis Interim CEO Islim Derar remarked that the company’s “goal is to move through the Chapter 11 process as quickly and efficiently as possible while reaching the best outcome and emerging well-positioned for the future.</p>



<p>Over the years, time-to-settlement for bankruptcy proceedings in the crypto sector and traditional finance has increased, leaving creditors confused and in limbo. The failed founders of the defunct Three Arrows Capital recently sought to solve this problem by creating a claim-based crypto exchange, GTX, for bankruptcy victims. However, there is still a lot of scepticism given their failure records.</p>

<li>BONK took the market by storm, making meteoric gains as it looks to displace DOGE and SHIB.</li>



<li>DOGE and SHIB communities to get more user use cases and technical upgrades this year.</li>
</ul>



<p>The cryptocurrency market has had a fair share of meme coins since Dogecoin (DOGE) broke into the scene in 2019, but it seems that three-dog-themed assets have established dominance.</p>



<p>The past 30 days have digital asset prices plunged to lows towards the end of last year and making a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-and-cardano-set-new-monthly-highs-after-scoring-double-digit-gains/">rebound</a> in the first two weeks of 2023. DOGE and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have both recorded double-figure gains as the market flipped green with weekly highs of over 20%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As gains keep trickling in, the one-month trading volume of DOGE, SHIB, and Bonk coin (BONK) has surpassed $25 billion through BONK launched on Dec 25. DOGE trading volume amounts to $17.5 billion, while SHIB records $7.2 billion, leaving BONK with $885 million.</p>



<p>The top three meme coins still fall way short when compared with Bitcoin (BTC) and other top assets in terms of trading volume. BTC’s trading volume in the last 30 days stands at $618.8 billion.</p>



<p>According to data from CoinGecko, there are about 169 digital assets with variations of DOGE in the names and have a combined trading volume of $324 million.</p>



<p>DOGE sits at No 9 on the list of cryptocurrencies by market cap, currently trading at $0.08, still shy of its all-time high of $0.73 before Elon Musk Saturday Night Live appearance in 2021. SHIB is also down from its all-time high by over 60%, but its recent gains, along with proposed improvements, are giant leaps.</p>



<h2 id="h-shib-inspire-new-devs-in-2023"><strong>SHIB inspire new devs in 2023</strong></h2>



<p>The team behind SHIB has constantly promised new use cases in the coming months, along with technical upgrades. The Shiba Inu layer 2 network, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-renews-bullish-momentum-for-0-001-shib-as-massive-token-burn-expected/">Shibarium</a>, is an upgrade lauded in digital asset circles as the move to make SHIB more than a meme coin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shibarium is a layer 2 network that would run on Ethereum’s mainnet allowing developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) with lower transaction fees and added network scalability. The team behind SHIB <a href="https://zycrypto.com/new-shibarium-update-ignites-super-bullish-expectations-for-0-001-shib-price-among-the-community/">teased</a> its community on the launch on Jan 16, and its price is up by 25%, with bulls waiting in glee for the official launch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has once again expressed concerns over the growing digital asset ecosystem. In particular, it cited the recent turmoil in the cryptocurrency sector as one of the global micro financial risks.</p>



<p>In its latest Financial Stability Report, the Indian central bank says a common approach is necessary to ensure consumer and investor protection and address future financial stability risks.</p>



<p><em>“In this context, various options are being considered internationally. One option is to apply the same-risk-same-regulatory-outcome principle and then to the same regulation applicable to traditional financial intermediaries and exchanges. Another option is to prohibit crypto assets since their real life use cases are next to negligible.”</em></p>



<p>The RBI’s report discusses several recent incidents from the broader crypto market to highlight volatility and risks for investors. It cites the recent brief pause in withdrawals of stablecoins at Binance, the implosion of the Terra/Luna ecosystem, and the collapse of Celsius and Three Arrows Capital to stress the point that crypto assets are “highly volatile.”</p>



<p>It says crypto assets have shown a correlation with equities. The claim that cryptocurrencies are a hedge against inflation stands exposed as crypto prices are also down at a time when inflation is high, the report said.</p>



<p>The Indian central bank, however, stated in its report that crypto market volatility had not affected the formal financial system.</p>



<p>“Although the crypto assets market remains volatile, there have not yet been any spillovers onto the stability of the formal financial system. The accumulated experience suggests that they form an unstable ecosystem, and there is growing evidence that they remain highly concentrated and interconnected,” it said. </p>



<p>RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has been a known and vocal critic of cryptocurrencies. Recently, he grabbed media headlines stating that if cryptocurrencies are allowed to grow, it can cause the next global financial crisis. He argues that cryptocurrencies have no underlying value, making them a purely speculative activity.</p>



<p>But despite RBI’s opposition and the government’s indecision about regulating the digital assets sector, various studies suggest that at least 7% of the Indian population holds digital assets. In the 2022 Chainalysis grassroots crypto adoption index, India stands among the top 10 countries.</p>



<p>The RBI launched a CBDC pilot for the wholesale segment on November 1 and for the retail segment on December 1.</p>



<p>Early this year, the Indian government introduced 1% TDS as the transaction tax on crypto trading. The industry decried the moving terming it exorbitant. However, the government did not relent. As a consequence, crypto trading on Indian exchanges became unattractive and complicated, driving away investors and bringing down trading volume sharply.</p>

<ul>
<li>The investment company has termed FTX’s case as outright fraud.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Before the collapse, SkyBridge had acquired $10 million worth of FTT tokens.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Skybridge Capital, the company founded by Anthony Scaramucci, has disclosed plans to repurchase a 30% stake it sold to FTX in the coming months. Scaramucci &#8211; who served as White House Director of Communications – told CNBC that Sam Bankman-Fried and his collapsed exchange may have committed fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>&#8216;I think it&#8217;s very clear now that there was a fraud. We will, of course, have to let the legal system determine all of those things.</em> &#8220;<em>We are waiting for the clearance from the bankruptcy people, the lawyers, and the investment bankers to figure out exactly what we will be buying back and when</em>,&#8221; Scaramucci said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September, SkyBridge invested $10 million in FTT as part of the deal that would see the exchange acquire 30% of the investment firm. Two months later, FTX filed for bankruptcy, going down with an estimated loss of $10 million in investor’s funds. Amid the chaotic collapse of the exchange, Scaramucci – who flew to the Bahamas on a rescue mission – said then he was distressed but did not want to call it a fraud yet.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-skybridge-invested-10m-in-ftx-before-the-bankruptcy-per-reports"><strong>SkyBridge Invested $10M in FTX Before the Bankruptcy, per Reports&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Describing the situation, he remarked: &#8220;<em>…when I got to the Bahamas, it became clear, at least from some of the people that worked on the legal and compliance team, that perhaps there was more going on than it being a rescue situation. Therefore, when I left the Bahamas in the afternoon, I was actually distressed</em>.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recovery efforts for the alleged stolen funds that moved from FTX to its trading arm Alameda are ongoing, although the exact amount of losses and the creditors owed remains unclear. This month, bankruptcy attorney Adam Landis told the court that FTX had recovered over $5 billion besides $425 million held by the Bahamian Securities Commission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Landis added that evidence pointed to the misappropriation of funds in parties, purchase of planes, houses, and political donations. Part of the funds also went to sport sponsorship deals, including FTX Arena naming rights in Miami, recounts the attorney. Judge John Dorsey has set until March to estimate recoveries and reorganize how the victims could get back their funds.</p>

<p>Thursday, January 12, 2023, saw the release of December 2022 US inflation figures by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) dropped by 0.1% in December 2022 largely due to declines in both the gasoline and energy indices. Annual Headline CPI rose by 6.5% and the December 2022 unemployment rate was down to 3.5% from 3.6% reported in November 2022.</p>



<p>The start of 2023 has been marked with minimal price movements across most of the cryptocurrencies. However, on January 13, 2023, major cryptocurrencies rallied to the US inflation data, with Bitcoin testing the US$19,000 mark, Ether at US$1,400, and XRP and Cardano at $0.38 and $0.33, respectively, according to CoinGecko data. </p>



<p>The crypto rally continued on January 14, 2023, with Bitcoin trading at US$21,000, Ether trading above US$1,500 and XRP trading at US$0.40 The recent rally has seen the global cryptocurrency market cap reach the US$ 1 trillion mark, a rise of about 25%  since the beginning of 2023.  </p>



<h2 id="h-is-bitcoin-heading-to-25-000"><strong>Is Bitcoin heading to $25,000?</strong></h2>



<p>Several events may impact crypto prices within Q1 of 2023. The next Fed interest rate announcement is scheduled for February 1, 2023. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has a scheduled release of its minutes on February 22, 2023. The FOMC minutes have provided investors with some of the rationales behind the Fed’s latest policy decisions.</p>



<p>Another Fed interest rate announcement is scheduled for March 22, 2023. Investors and traders will closely watch how regulators respond to the latest inflation data.</p>



<p>Some of the crypto challenges seen in 2022 are already spilling over into 2023. Crypto companies announcing more job cuts in 2023 include Crypto.com, Huobi, Coinbase, SuperRare, and Blockchain.com.</p>



<p>The contagion from the collapse of FTX carries over with the former CEO of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) set to go on trial in October 2023. Two of SBF’s former associates, co-founder Gary Wang and the former chief executive of Alameda Research Caroline Ellison have already pleaded guilty to fraud charges. Other former executives are reportedly cooperating with federal prosecutors and investigators on the dealings within FTX.</p>



<p>Global Crypto regulation is, in general still fragmented and some way from implementation. During Q1 of 2023, the European Parliament is expected to vote on the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation that will take effect in 2024. MiCA is aimed at creating a harmonised crypto legal framework across the European Union (EU) and closing gaps in the existing EU financial services regulation.</p>



<p>The above events are likely to shape crypto price movements in 2023. It is not clear how long this crypto rally may last but the crypto markets are in much need of positive news following the challenges of 2022.</p>

<p>Bitcoin continued to trade upwards Friday, after growing over 21% in the past seven days and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/market-manipulation-former-sec-official-reveals-factors-propelling-bitcoins-latest-price-ascent/">reaching levels</a> not seen since the fall of FTX. At press time, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency was trading at $21,919, up 3.88% in the past 24 hours. </p>



<p>Likewise, nothing seemed to have changed for Ether (ETH), with the crypto asset barely adding or losing $50 in the past four days. In the past 24 hours, ETH grew by 4.71% and was exchanging hands at around $1,609 mid-day.</p>



<p>Other cryptos also remained hushed for most of the day, with BNB, XRP and Solana moving by a percentage point. Dogecoin, however, grew by over 4% in the past day to tap $0.088 before recoiling to $0.0857 at the time of this report.</p>



<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been the biggest gainer among the top 15 cryptos by market cap, surging over 20% early Wednesday to tap $0.00001290. The so-called “Doge-Killer” spiked after Upbit, the largest crypto exchange in South Korea, announced that it had listed the meme token. According to a statement by the exchange, users will now be able to trade SHIB for the Korean Won. At press time, SHIB was trading at $0.00001290.</p>



<p>Overall, despite Wednesday’s gloom, last week’s surge helped boost most crypto prices, signalling investors have moved past the Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ongoing-market-fud-to-result-in-more-altcoin-rebound/">created by the FTX fallout</a> and subsequent contagion.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt that what&#8217;s gone on the last month has been a reputational killer for the industry,&#8221;</em> said Jeffrey Howard, Head of North America business development and Institutional Sales at OSL, a Hong Kong-based digital assets trading platform. According to Howards, while the FTX collapse may have spooked many, institutional investors were <em>“continuing to make new investments into their systems and into the market.”</em></p>



<p>Since Jan 1, the global crypto market cap has grown from $795.5B to $990.3B, marking a 24.4978% increase. On-chain, things also seem to be improving, suggesting that cryptocurrencies may push higher. Today, on-chain and social metrics platform Santiment noted that the top six crypto exchanges saw a substantial amount of bitcoin leaving to self-custody.</p>



<p><em>“The overall supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has dropped from 11.85% to 6.65% over the past year, a historic drop that illustrates the rise in interest in self-custody. Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Kucoin, and Bitstamp all reflect this $BTC exodus.” </em>Wrote Santiment.</p>



<p>Yesterday, Cryptoquant stated that there has been a significant increase in $ETH smart contracts in the last four months, adding that &#8220;this can be considered fundamental good news for Ethereum and the future of this blockchain.&#8221; Most investors look out for behavioural change in the two top cryptocurrencies to make decisions on the movement of the general crypto market.</p>
