Going by the name Cooper Morgenthau, the former chief financial officer on Tuesday pleaded guilty to wire fraud charges in the U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan federal court Former Finance Exec Allegedly Committed Crimes  According to Authorities, Morgenthau had embezzled over $1.2 million between June 2021 and August 2022 from African Gold Acquisition Corp, a blank check company, and underhanded the crime by forging its account statements, and spent or lost all of it in crypto and meme stock trading.
