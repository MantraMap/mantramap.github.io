<p>In light of the recent Ledger controversy, Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Cardano, has shared his perspective on the matter, emphasizing the importance of open-source software, simplicity in design, and honouring security promises.</p>



<p>Ledger is a France-based security firm that specializes in manufacturing crypto storage devices. For most of this week, the firm has come under fire from the crypto community after it deleted a May 17 tweet stating that it was “possible” for Ledger to write firmware that could extract users’ private keys.</p>



<p>The controversy surrounding the matter began on May 16 when the company introduced its latest service, &#8220;Ledger Recover.&#8221; The following day, the firm&#8217;s customer support tweeted, acknowledging that it was “possible” for Ledger to develop firmware capable of extracting users&#8217; private keys. However, the tweet was subsequently <a href="https://twitter.com/Ledger_Support/status/1659218986314366976">deleted,</a> amplifying the ongoing debate surrounding the topic, particularly because it directly addressed the introduction of the new feature.</p>



<p>The firm team, however, attempted to clarify the situation with Ledger chief technology officer Charles Guillemet emphasizing in a May 18 tweet that Ledger&#8217;s operating system (OS) mandates user consent whenever the OS interacts with a private key. This means that the OS cannot copy the device&#8217;s private key without the explicit consent of the user.</p>



<p>That said, despite the assurances, most people still seem unconvinced, with other observers now offering what they perceive will be a lasting solution to Ledger’s woes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hoskinson-s-advice-to-ledger"><strong>Hoskinson&#8217;s Advice to Ledger</strong></h2>



<p>Late Friday, May 19, Hoskinson weighed in on the situation, highlighting key considerations for individuals seeking secure cryptocurrency storage solutions.</p>



<p>Firstly, Hoskinson encouraged the adoption of open-source software that has undergone regular audits by multiple sources. According to him, by choosing such software, users can benefit from enhanced transparency and the collective efforts of the developer community to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>He also emphasized the principle that security often stems from simplicity, asking developers of hardware wallets to “Design the smallest possible footprint” in a bid to minimize attack vectors and potential points of weakness.</p>



<p>Addressing the issue of firmware updates, Hoskinson emphasized the significance of non-updateable firmware in cases where a company explicitly promises a specific security model. While he acknowledges the difficulty of replicating this concept in cryptocurrencies, he suggested that decentralizing the update process could significantly bolster security measures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, Hoskinson emphasized the importance of not breaking social contracts within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This serves as a reminder for developers and service providers to uphold their promises to users, fostering trust and accountability within the community.</p>



<p>That said, as the Ledger controversy unfolds, the ultimate redemption of the firm&#8217;s reputation hangs in the balance. Nevertheless, on Friday, Éric Larchevêque, Ledger co-founder and CEO, apologized, terming the events as “a total PR failure.” He further requested users to be patient, stating <em>that the meltdown was “absolutely not a technical one.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Some amount of trust must be placed into Ledger to use their product. If you don&#8217;t trust Ledger, meaning you treat your HW manufacturer as an adversary, that can&#8217;t work at all,”</em> he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/13ldgcl/my_personal_view_on_the_pr_disaster_from_a_ledger/">wrote</a> on Reddit.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dogecoin and Litecoin recorded surging daily transaction volumes for the third consecutive week after marking their Ordinal debuts.&nbsp;</li>



<li>DOGE hit a daily volume of 1.2 million transactions, while LTC hit 584,000, setting a new all-time high for both networks.</li>



<li>Dogecoin bulls are speculating a stellar finish to the year at $0.1, but that remains a long shot even with the integration of Ordinals.</li>
</ul>



<p>Popular among Bitcoin (BTC) users as Ordinals, Dogecoin (DOGE) users have copied the architecture to create Doginals, which has the community all excited with few dissenting voices.</p>



<p>The introduction of Ordinals to Dogecoin and Litecoin has led to surging daily volumes for the third consecutive week. On May 18, transaction volumes on Dogecoin hit a new daily record of 1.2 million, according to <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-ltc-doge-dogecoin.html#3m">data</a> from BitinfoCharts.</p>



<p>Litecoin, on the other hand, has also recorded a volume pump to 584,000 transactions across a 24-hour time frame. Ordinals debuted on Litecoin after Twitter user Indigo Nakamoto promised 5 LTC to anyone who ports the Ordinals to the Litecoin network.</p>



<p>On Feb 19, developer Anthony Guerrero successfully created the Litecoin protocol; similarly, Dogecoin followed suit. Increased network activity began after both networks introduced LRC 20 and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/drc-20-is-it-time-for-dogecoin-to-shine-again-amidst-the-latest-meme-coin-wave/">DRC-20 standard tokens</a>, respectively, enabling users to create meme coins and other “<em>assets” </em>on both networks.</p>



<p>DOGE derived inspiration from Ordinals to create what they term Doginals, driving up network activity just as it did on Bitcoin. Due to surging network activity, gas fees on Bitcoin hit highs not recorded in years, leading to congestion of the mempool.</p>



<p>Before now, daily DOGE transactions averaged between 20,000-25,000 before spiking to 700,000 and now setting a new record above 1 million transactions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-doge-bulls-are-ready-to-pounce">DOGE bulls are ready to pounce</h2>



<p>The meme coin started the year recovering from losses recorded in 2022 and is still shy from its all-time high of 2021. Currently exchanging hands at $0.0736, the coin has gained 6.69% this year and is down by 13% from its price in May last year. Despite this slow growth, the community has moved around Doginals with bulls looking to ignite a run hinged on the Ordinal copycat.</p>



<p>Though the majority of users seem united in favor of Doginals, a core developer remains sceptical. Dogecoin developer Patrick Lodder shared his views on Doginals becoming short-lived.</p>



<p>“<em>Something like this cannot become a real ‘feature’ because it has not had enough thought given to it. The sustained and growing pressure on Dogecoin will cause this to die off quickly,” </em>he noted. He further added that the main issue is engineering, and he is yet to “<em>haven’t discovered a good way to program these tokens and give it actual function in a trustless way like you can on an ERC-20 token.”</em></p>

<p>A former executive at Ripple believes that despite the odds tilting in the blockchain payments firm’s favor, the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could still win the legal battle. This comes after Judge Analisa Torres <a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">ruled </a>that William Hinman&#8217;s documents are “judicial documents” subject to a strong presumption of public access and denied the SEC’s motion to keep them hidden.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-sec-could-win"><strong>Why The SEC Could Win</strong></h2>



<p>Recent developments in the XRP lawsuit have made investors and observers confident of Ripple’s victory over SEC.</p>



<p>Ripple has been tied up <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">in a lawsuit</a> with the SEC for over two years after the regulator accused the firm of illegally selling XRP — the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with a total market cap of over $23 billion as of Monday — without registering it as a security.</p>



<p>The former Director of Developer Relations at Ripple, Matt Hamilton, remarked that the potential unsealing of the Hinman docs for public access could tip the balance. Hamilton noted that the whole situation “looks pretty bad” for the SEC’s case against Ripple.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In our hearts we all knew this, but alas that doesn’t reflect the vagaries of the US regulatory and legal system. We could still be right, but the SEC could still win the case.</p>&mdash; Matt Hamilton (@HammerToe) <a href="https://twitter.com/HammerToe/status/1660101387567366144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>However, the ex-Ripple official believes the outcome of the lawsuit might not align with many people&#8217;s expectations because of the complexities of the U.S. regulatory and legal system. Hamilton stressed that Ripple might still be right, but there&#8217;s a chance the SEC could emerge victorious.</p>



<p>The Hinman documents pertain to a controversial speech given in June 2018 by the former director of the SEC’s corporation finance division William Hinman. During the speech, Hinman declared that Ether is not a security. These docs contain the SEC’s internal discussions and deliberations encompassing the speech in question.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Could The Lawsuit Finally Be Reaching Its Conclusion?</strong></h2>



<p>While it’s still too early to tell what the ultimate outcome of the case will be, recent findings in court filings cast doubt on whether XRP passes the infamous Howey Test. This means the unsealing of the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-good-chance-sec-will-settle-with-ripple-to-avoid-exposing-hinman-documents-says-legal-expert/">Hinman emails</a> could have a major legal impact on Ripple and its long-standing dispute with the SEC.</p>



<p>As the case unfolds, well-known pro-crypto attorney Fred Rispoli suggested that the summary judgment verdict is already written and could be given “any day now”. Rispoli thinks an outright win for either Ripple or the SEC remains low, but the Hinman emails ruling&#8217;s tone appears favourable to the crypto firm.</p>



<p>Echoing Rispoli&#8217;s opinion, XRP holders&#8217; representative John Deaton said during a recent Twitter Space that a pivotal court decision in the XRP suit could come down at any time, but he added that it could take another month or longer.</p>



<p>That being said, if the presiding judge does decide that XRP qualifies as a security, the scope could go beyond XRP to other crypto assets, as it would further establish a precedent for future rulings over other tokens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As budget negotiations in the US progress, President Joe Biden has made it clear that crypto can wait.</p>



<p>On Sunday, the POTUS did not mince words when addressing budget negotiations during his speech at the G7 summit stating he will not protect wealthy tax cheats and crypto traders. According to the president, he had already met with all four congressional leaders and stressed the need for bipartisan cooperation to move forward prior to departing for the summit.</p>



<p>President Biden had put forth a proposal that exceeds 2 trillion dollars in spending cuts and new revenues in early March before proposing to cut a further $1 trillion in his pursuit of fiscal responsibility. However, he expressed dissatisfaction with various other proposals, such as excess payments to pharmaceutical companies as well as hefty tax breaks for the oil industry and crypto traders, deeming them unacceptable.</p>



<p><em>“Now its time for the other side to move from their extreme positions because much of what they’ve already proposed is simply, quite frankly unacceptable…. I’m not going to agree to a deal that protects wealthy tax cheats and crypto traders while putting food assistants at risk for nearly 1 million Americans,”</em> Biden <a href="https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/1660225824262434816">said</a> on Sunday.</p>



<p>This statement comes at a time when US regulators are intensifying their scrutiny of the cryptocurrency realm and clearly indicates that the forthcoming debt deal will not safeguard crypto investors within the country. Notably, Biden’s assertions also have the ability to undermine his administration’s efforts to pursue crypto regulations, as he directed in his March 2022 <a href="https://zycrypto.com/heres-the-whole-bushel-of-bidens-groundbreaking-executive-order-for-cryptocurrencies/">executive order</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, while Biden’s proposal underscores his commitment to prioritizing the well-being of ordinary Americans, the crypto community have perceived it as a way of gaining political mileage, given he is seeking re-election next year.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, various US presidential candidates seem to be taking his administration’s outright hostility towards crypto to their advantage, vowing to champion pro-crypto reforms when elected. Earlier this week, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, a Democratic presidential candidate, noted that he is committed to upholding people’s right to hold Bitcoin.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Everybody is so passionate about Bitcoin, not just because it’s a currency but because it’s an exercise in democracy,&#8221;</em> Kennedy said at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami Saturday. <em>“As president, I will make sure that you got your own wallet that the government can’t interfere with. Nobody is going to be taxing your electricity 30% and that we can nature this product in America where it’s going to create wealth for Americans.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vivek Ramaswamy, another presidential candidate, announced at the same event that they had officially started accepting Bitcoin donations for his campaign, saying <em>“Let’s make the 2024 election a referendum on fiat currency.”</em></p>

<p>Cardano is set to experience significant growth following notable developments within its network. Several key advancements were highlighted in the latest weekly development report released Friday, May 19.</p>



<p>According to the report, in scaling efforts, the Hydra team achieved significant milestones with the release of the first mainnet-compatible <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-releases-first-mainnet-compatible-version-of-hydra-node-ada-looks-to-ride-the-wave-to-major-gains/">Hydra</a> node version. These advancements address critical issues that need resolution before integrating Hydra Head with real ADA, ensuring users&#8217; smooth and secure experience.</p>



<p>Voltaire workshops also commenced, providing opportunities for collaboration and networking among local Cardano communities. Voltaire is a big upgrade for Cardano in the future. As per the Cardano website, the Voltaire era&nbsp;of Cardano “will provide the final pieces required for the Cardano network to become a self-sustaining system.”</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the team responsible for making decisions worked with the research and networking teams to improve the Ouroboros Genesis design. They improved how they select the starting point, how they choose candidates, and how they use important connections. These changes were made to make the whole system work better and be more stable.</p>



<p>Notably, the Daedalus team completed work on the proxy server, guaranteeing ADA conversion rates from the CoinGecko API are dependable. As per the report, this team is preparing to release an updated version of Daedalus that will smoothly switch to this new endpoint.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, amid the developments, Cardano continued to witness significant progress, with various teams actively working on <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-impressive-fundamentals-fuel-speculation-for-ada-reaching-1-price-milestone/">numerous projects</a>, all contributing to the platform&#8217;s overall advancement.</p>



<p>The latest report reveals some impressive numbers for Cardano. So far, 127 projects have been launched on the platform, creating over 8.28 million native tokens. Additionally, there have been 8,277 Plutus scripts executed, showcasing the versatility and functionality of Cardano.</p>



<p>Notably, Cardano is now home to a whopping 1,242 active projects in various development stages. These projects collectively process a remarkable 66.7 million transactions, highlighting the platform&#8217;s growing popularity and widespread use.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="572" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-22-1024x572.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81179" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-22-1024x572.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-22-300x168.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-22-768x429.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-22.png 1431w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This substantial increase in activity demonstrates the growing interest and adoption of Cardano as a preferred blockchain platform. The Cardano team has also been championing more decentralization, as evidenced by an upcoming Stake Pool Operators (SPO) vote, enabling SPOs to vote on important decisions about the network&#8217;s future.</p>



<p>With these notable developments and ongoing initiatives, Cardano is set to offer a robust infrastructure and foster innovation in the decentralized ecosystem, which is bullish for the entire ecosystem amid price watchtower to $1.</p>



<p>Proponents of the network’s native token ADA could also enjoy massive returns on their assets soon as the network continues to attract more users. The cryptocurrency was trading at $0.36 at press time, down 1.31% in the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bryan Lee, an executive associated with crypto exchange CoinDeal, has been charged in connection with a cryptocurrency investment fraud scheme that defrauded more than 10,000 victims and resulted in losses exceeding $45 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a Friday statement by the US Department of Justice (DOJ), Lee is accused of collaborating with Neil Chandran and others to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1584496/download">deceive</a> investors in companies controlled by Chandran, collectively known as &#8220;ViRSE.&#8221;</p>



<p>These companies allegedly claimed to be developing virtual-world technologies and their cryptocurrency for use in a metaverse. To entice potential investors, the fraudulent operation promised substantial returns upon the acquisition of these companies by wealthy individuals. </p>



<p>The firms even propagated false assertions that two billionaires, one affiliated with a well-known online retail company and the other with an electric car company, were supporting the ventures in a bid to substantiate their claims. However, the DOJ alleged that these claims were entirely fabricated, designed solely to deceive unsuspecting individuals.</p>



<p>Lee,57, as the nominee owner and director of ViMarket, allegedly followed Chandran&#8217;s instructions in handling investor funds deposited into ViMarket&#8217;s bank accounts. CoinDeal was the primary vehicle through which the fraudulent investment opportunity was marketed to potential victims. Lee and Chandran then proceeded to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ohio-man-who-stole-713-bitcoins-from-us-authorities-is-set-to-plead-guilty-of-theft/">misappropriate</a> millions of dollars by purchasing luxury cars and real estate.</p>



<p>According to the DOJ, Lee faces multiple charges, including conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud, and engaging in monetary transactions involving unlawfully obtained assets. If convicted, he could face over 60 years in prison.</p>



<p>Notably, Chandran was arrested in June 2022 and charged accordingly. Michael Glaspie, another individual involved with the scheme, pleaded guilty to wire fraud for his role in marketing the investment under the name &#8220;CoinDeal&#8221; and is scheduled to be sentenced on June 16.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, while Lee made his initial appearance in federal court on Friday, May 19, Chandran is scheduled for a status conference on June 14.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That said, as the legal process unfolds, it is anticipated that further revelations regarding the extent of the alleged fraudulent activities will come to light, with the DOJ calling on victims to present themselves.</p>

<ul>
<li>New data shows that over 53% of Bitcoin has not moved in the last two years despite price swings in recent months.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The activities of sophisticated investors and whales, coupled with increased lost assets, are significant for the figure.</li>
</ul>



<p>The hodling culture is deeply rooted in digital assets and current indicators show growth across multiple cryptocurrencies amid recent bear markets.</p>



<p>Recent data released by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode shows that holders have not moved more than half the number of Bitcoin (BTC) in circulation in two years. The figure, which stands at 53.14% is at an all-time high which points to the growing desire by investors to hold assets on a long-term basis.</p>



<p>While 19.3 million BTC has been mined since 2009, the report shows that 10.2 million BTC are still sitting in wallets. The factors responsible for over $300 billion worth of BTC going dormant are the trading patterns of whales and, unfortunately, lost assets.</p>



<p>The CEO of Arkham Intelligence, commenting on the report, stated that dormant coins will eventually come back in circulation over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Coins have organically transferred from those with high-time and liquidity preference to those with low-time and liquidity preference. Through all the shake-ups, for every seller, there’s a buyer.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>This data comes up as the price of the market leader <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-pierces-30000-for-first-time-since-june-as-bernstein-calls-btc-faster-horse-compared-to-gold/">moves</a> past the $30,000 mark for the first time in eight months after a positive start in Q1 2023. An increase in the price of BTC can lead dormant assets to come back into the scene as long-term holders will look to trade for profits.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-hodling-continue">Will hodling continue?</h2>



<p>In the last decade, several whales resurfaced huge crypto holdings making shocking returns by moving assets to new wallets. Glassnode indicated investors are less likely to spend coins after 155 days and will hold those assets for a long time.</p>



<p>Records also show long-term ‘sophisticated investors’ make more money than retail investors. Morel also stated that some assets will never return to circulation because they have simply been lost. This is a major problem attributed to amateur investors who forget their wallet’s private keys.</p>

<p>Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have jointly requested additional time to disclose the Hinman documents, raising speculation about a potential settlement in their ongoing legal battle.</p>



<p>In a Friday, May 19 letter to District Judge Analisa Torres, both parties argued that the voluminous nature of the materials and the necessary redactions necessitate more time. Notably, while the original deadline had been set for June 6 2023, by the court, the parties sought a one-week extension to June 13.</p>



<p>This development follows a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">recent decision</a> by Judge Torres to deny the SEC&#8217;s motion to seal the Hinman documents earlier this week. On May 16, Judge Torres ruled that the documents were judicial and subject to a strong presumption of public access. The decision was welcomed by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who called it “another win for transparency.”</p>



<p>The documents in question are tied to a controversial 2018 speech by Bill Hinman, a former SEC director, where he stated that he did not consider Bitcoin or Ethereum as securities. Ripple has sought access to these documents, believing they support their argument that XRP should not be classified as a security.</p>



<p>The SEC had previously claimed that Hinman&#8217;s speech represented his personal views rather than the Commission&#8217;s policy, and thus the documents should be withheld from public scrutiny. However, the recent ruling by Judge Torres has brought them into the public domain. This decision marks another setback for the SEC&#8217;s attempt to seal these documents, as a judge had previously ruled against their efforts last year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-settlement-in-the-horizon"><strong>A Settlement in the Horizon?</strong></h2>



<p>Meanwhile, following this week’s events, the possibility of public access to these documents has added fuel to the speculation about a potential settlement between Ripple and the SEC.</p>



<p><em>“Whiff of settlement talks &#8211; since this is a joint filing. The SEC does not want the Kraken released here… Still feels most like a mutually beneficial delay to work on settlement,”</em> tweeted long-term Ripple supporter Hugh Breslin.</p>



<p><em>“</em><em>My thoughts exactly</em>!” another Ripple proponent wrote, replying to Breslin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That said, it is important to note that the outcome of this <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-eyes-monster-move-as-new-lawsuit-outcomes-set-ripple-on-path-to-gigantic-win-against-the-sec/">high-profile lawsuit</a> holds significant implications for the regulation of digital assets, not only in the United States but also globally. This is because it has the potential to provide clarity on the classification of cryptocurrencies and shape future regulatory frameworks.</p>



<p>That said, as the Parties await a decision from Judge Torres regarding the requested extension, the Ripple adherents await eagerly as the decision may provide crucial insights into the SEC&#8217;s stance on digital assets and the future of Ripple&#8217;s XRP.</p>

<ul>
<li>A former executive of Signature Bank has made several attempts to heap blame for the bank’s failure on digital assets.&nbsp;</li>



<li>After implementing reckless management policies, Senator Cynthia Lummis criticized the position as a deflationary approach.</li>



<li>The NYDFS continues to reveal events resulting in the collapse of the bank months after taking over to “<em>protect the US economy.”&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>



<p>As investigations into Silvergate Banks ramp up, discoveries alongside the blame game from different sources come to light.</p>



<p>At a Senate Banking Committee <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/majority/brown-holds-failed-bank-executives-accountable-mismanagement">hearing</a> on May 16, Scott Shay, a former executive of Silvergate Bank, gave his statement on the facts leading to the bank&#8217;s collapse. From his testimony, he leaned towards putting most of the blame on the bank’s readiness to deal with web3 start-ups rather than on the management team.</p>



<p>He stated that the bank started accepting deposits from digital asset firms in 2018, although the number dropped over the years due to the industry’s high volatility, especially in mid-2022. He further noted that the bank was affected by the fall of “<em>a bank with strong ties to the digital asset sector.”</em></p>



<p>The authorities asked clients to withdraw their funds leading to a massive $16 billion withdrawal from Signature Bank. After his testimony, Senators evaluated his testimony, with many lashing out at him for the complete failure of the bank.</p>



<p>Senator Cynthia Lummis knocked Shay out for trying to shift responsibility away from his team.</p>



<p>“<em>It looks like there has been a lot of deflection of blame onto those particular depositors that deal in digital assets and onto regulators, but you haven’t accepted any blame yourself,” </em>she said.</p>



<p>Despite referring to digital assets ten times during his testimony, he denied pointing fingers at web3 firms for the bank&#8217;s collapse. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-accused-of-keeping-millions">Accused of keeping millions</h2>



<p>At the hearing, Senator Elizabeth Warren further <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/at-hearing-warren-blasts-former-svb-and-signature-bank-ceos-for-keeping-millions-after-recklessly-crashing-banks">criticized</a> Shay and Silicon Valley’s CEO Gregory Pecker who are accused of “<em>keeping millions after recklessly crashing banks.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Right now, the law says that people like Mr. Becker and Mr. Shay can pay themselves tens of millions of dollars in bonuses and stock options, and when the banks blow up, Mr. Becker and Mr. Shay get to keep all the money. And that is just plain wrong. If we don&#8217;t fix it, every CEO for these multibillion-dollar banks will keep right on loading up on risks and blowing up banks, and everybody else is going to have to pay for it.”</em></p>



<p>Senator Warren also noted that she will work on a bill to curtail the powers of bank executives to receive these “<em>crazy paychecks.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Recall that in April, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) said it would be wrong to blame virtual assets for the bank’s collapse but rather on “a <em>new-fashioned bank run.”</em></p>

<p>Since last week, the Bitcoin network has remained congested with more than 420,000 unconfirmed transactions, raising suspicions of a possible malicious attack.</p>



<p>According to several developers and cryptocurrency community enthusiasts, the Bitcoin network is<a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoins-surging-transaction-fees-viewed-as-direct-attack-by-a-cross-section-of-the-community/"> being attacked</a> by persons who are willing to lose millions of dollars to render the network unusable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-community-expresses-concern"><strong>Bitcoin community expresses concern</strong></h2>



<p>Developer iris.to/jogi (@proofofjogi) stated over the weekend that Bitcoin is under a DoS attack, one of the many tools hackers use to overwhelm a website by flooding the network with access requests.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Bitcoin is under DoS attack. High transaction fees are the chosen pain point by the attacker, probably to make Bitcoin unusable for smaller players.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>In addition, he explained that this could have been planned for several months, as network congestion has been increasing since the implementation of the Ordinals protocol, which allows the issuance of NFT tokens on the Bitcoin network.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">From ordinals to DoS attack didn&#39;t take that much time. 3ish months, give or take couple days.<br><br>We&#39;re in the then-they-fight-you-stage</p>&mdash; iris.to/jogi (@proofofjogi) <a href="https://twitter.com/proofofjogi/status/1655157040753385472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Furthermore, user Chad Pleb pointed out that the Bitcoin network&#8217;s congestion is maliciously caused by hackers or groups willing to spend up to $9 million in losses from the minting of Ordinals tokens.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If these stats are correct, that&#39;s ~300 BTC(~$9M in USD) for &quot;transacting&quot; json and links to jpegs? JFC <a href="https://t.co/JToc9zErzw">pic.twitter.com/JToc9zErzw</a></p>&mdash; Chad Pleb (@chad_pleb) <a href="https://twitter.com/chad_pleb/status/1654948345364766725?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 6, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>This argument was supported by Francis Pouliot, CEO and co-founder of Bull Bitcoin, who showed an image of a conversation in which a person indicated that anyone with a large amount of money could make the Bitcoin network unusable by increasing transaction costs through excessive minting of Ordinals.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Average Bitcoin transaction costs rise to 2021 levels</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the fact that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoins-price-outlook-uncertain-as-key-support-level-faces-crucial-test/">BTC price</a> is far from the bullish rally it experienced during 2021, where transaction costs reached an all-time high of $70, the actual cost for verifying transactions has remained relatively high, ranging between $8 and $20.</p>



<p>Although some analysts indicate that this is a momentary issue as average fees have been decreasing, network congestion is not improving, according to Bitcoin&#8217;s blockchain explorer and mempool, Mempool Space.</p>



<p>At the time of writing this note, there are more than 300,000 pending transactions, with an average cost of medium priority of approximately $7. This proves that the latest Bitcoin update sacrificed network stability for unnecessary innovation.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency, is facing a challenging outlook as selling pressure from miners increases.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrency’s price has been consolidating in a tight, sideways pattern in the past week after facing a significant pullback in early May. On several occasions this week, the price attempted to push and stay above $27,000 but failed towards the weekend, with various fundamentals suggesting the cryptocurrency could face a further drop.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-20-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81144" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-20-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-20-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-20-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-20-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-20-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-miners-sell-their-coins"><strong>Miners Sell their coins</strong></h2>



<p>Apart from dwindling trading volumes, potentially reflecting investors&#8217; lack of interest in a low-volatility market, there are indications that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-miners-are-feeling-the-pinch-of-high-energy-prices-and-slump-in-crypto-prices/">Bitcoin miners</a> may have played a role in the recent decline in price.</p>



<p>Earlier today, onchain analytics firm CryptoQuant took to Twitter to share these observations, stating that there is a high probability that 1,750 BTC has ultimately made its way to Binance, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges. CryptoQuant&#8217;s assertions came after a thorough examination of various wallets linked to Bitcoin miners by “IT Tech”, an author and analyst at the firm, who tracked the movement of the coins to the exchange.</p>



<p><em>“There is a high probability that 1750 BTC ultimately went to Binance. Miners&#8217; reserves are decreasing, indicating a selling pressure from the miners&#8217; side,</em>” wrote IT Tech.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="645" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-19-1024x645.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81143" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-19-1024x645.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-19-300x189.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-19-768x484.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-19.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Notably, amid declining prices, Bitcoin&#8217;s hashrate has also experienced a minor decline in recent days. This decrease indicates a migration of miners away from the Bitcoin ecosystem. As of the current writing, Bitcoin Network Hash Rate was 344.77M, down from 440M on May 2.</p>



<p>These developments raise concerns among market participants, which explains the stagnation of Bitcoin&#8217;s price. Bitcoin&#8217;s price has been experiencing volatility in recent weeks, with several factors, including regulatory inflation concerns impacting its trajectory. The increasing selling pressure from miners, combined with whale transactions, thus adds another layer of complexity to the market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Miners’ Sales to Subside Soon</strong></h2>



<p>Nevertheless, despite these developments, CryptoQuant’s analyst “BaroVirtual” notes that the unloading of bags may <a href="https://zycrypto.com/are-fears-of-bitcoin-miners-selling-pressure-overblown-this-expert-thinks-so/">slow down</a> soon. </p>



<p><em>“From May 5, 2023, Bitcoin miners began to reduce their Bitcoin holdings drastically, and on May 9, 2023, the miner&#8217;s net position moved into negative territory, indicating intense pressure from miners. Currently, the miner net position values are in the zone where Bitcoin bounced off in previous times, and the local uptrend continued,”</em> the pundit recently wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to him, miners could significantly slow down sales when Bitcoin hits the $24,000 target.</p>



<p>Bitcoin traded at $26,853 at press time, down 1.14% in the past 24 hours. In the past week, the price has only managed to gain by 1.73%, as per data from CoinMarketCap.</p>

<p>Renowned Bitcoin advocate Max Keiser insists that all cryptocurrencies, except for Bitcoin, should be classified as securities.</p>



<p>In a recent tweet, Max Keiser, an advisor to the El Salvadorian government on Bitcoin, boldly proclaimed that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-eyes-monster-move-as-new-lawsuit-outcomes-set-ripple-on-path-to-gigantic-win-against-the-sec/">XRP</a> and all other cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities except for Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Keiser&#8217;s tweet was in response to recent statements by Gary Gensler, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman, regarding the regulatory classification of digital assets. During a question-and-answer session at the 27th annual Financial Markets Conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on May 15, Gensler referred to crypto markets as “generally non-compliant”, adding that they were based on the “false narrative of decentralization”.</p>



<p>In response to Gensler’s statement, Keiser tweeted on May 16; &#8211;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Gary&#8217;s right. Everything not Bitcoin, is a security (including ETH &amp; XRP). We already put this into law in El Salvador. We&#8217;re Bitcoin Country and we&#8217;re thriving. I invite Gary Gensler to El Salvador to come and see how we became the leading BTC country in the world.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>But Keiser&#8217;s criticism of XRP did not end there. On Wednesday, May 17, the self-proclaimed Bitcoin maximalist continued his tirade, labelling Ripple as &#8220;crooks&#8221; and supporting the SEC&#8217;s decision to shut them down.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Ripple are crooks. Their business model is selling unregistered securities. The SEC is right to shut them down,&#8221;</em> Keiser stated, commenting on an article highlighting Ripple’s $250 million acquisition of Swiss custody firm Metaco.</p>



<p>Keiser&#8217;s recent rants have triggered intense discussions within the cryptocurrency community, with some members of the XRP community engaging the Bitcoiner in heated conversations. One notable XRP enthusiast, Mr Huber, referred to Judge Analisa Torres&#8217; recent ruling. Recently, the judge ordered the sealing of documents related to Ripple&#8217;s XRP sales to On-Demand Liquidity clients, citing the need to protect sensitive information concerning Ripple&#8217;s primary business line.</p>



<p><em>“A judge calling to protect Ripple&#8217;s sales of XRP because it&#8217;s their main line of business also doesn&#8217;t sound the slightest like a judge who is going to shut it down,” </em>Huber wrote in a Thursday, May 18 tweet tagging Keiser.</p>



<p>That said, the assertions by Keiser, who has long been an ardent supporter of Bitcoin, highlight a growing debate on the regulatory status of various cryptocurrencies. Keiser implies that these digital assets should be subjected to stricter regulations to safeguard investors&#8217; interests by categorising cryptocurrencies as securities. On various occasions, chair Gensler reiterated that all cryptocurrencies apart from Bitcoin are securities and should be regulated under existing laws.</p>



<p>That said, amidst the ongoing debate surrounding cryptocurrency regulation, industry participants, investors, and regulators eagerly anticipate <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripples-brad-garlinghouse-blames-confusing-u-s-crypto-rules-for-flow-of-investment-to-europe-and-asia/">clearer guidelines</a> from the SEC or lawmakers. It will also be interesting to see what the court finally decides in the ongoing SEC vs Ripple Lawsuit with judgement day drawing near.</p>

<p>Despite a recent lacklustre performance, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/3-catalysts-renewing-bullish-drive-for-0-001-shib-price-as-meme-coins-see-sudden-resurgence/">Shiba Inu</a>, the cryptocurrency that gained popularity in late 2021, still has a dedicated community of supporters who remain optimistic about its future trajectory and price breakout to the highly-coveted $0.001 price. While there are concerns about its high supply and lack of utility, the Shiba Inu team is actively working on initiatives to address these issues, such as developing Shibarium, an upcoming layer-2 (L2) blockchain network.</p>



<p>2022 saw favourable conditions for the 2nd most popular meme coin as growing adoption and integration continued. More exchanges and merchants began to accept Shiba Inu as a form of payment. In addition, burn events and supply reduction permanently reduced some of Shiba Inu&#8217;s supply from circulation. If this continues, it could help reduce the supply and increase the value of the cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Shiba Inu has one of the most loyal communities in Crypto, and the launch of Shiboshis, Shiba Inu&#8217;s own NFT project, and other NFT projects built on the Shiba Inu network could add utility and value to the Shiba Inu ecosystem. However, according to a recent interview in the international business times, the Shibarium Layer 2 blockchain project is still in development, according to Project Leader Shytoshi Kusama.</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/shibarium-the-project-set-to-propel-shiba-inu-beyond-predictions-of-a-0-001-shib-price/">Shibarium</a> is currently in beta test mode, and as Kusama had previously stated numerous times, all tokens on the testnet Puppynet are not real and are merely for testing. However, he once more cautioned the Shiba Inu community about this, noting that thus far, no actual tokens have been singed.</p>



<p>On the other hand, some general factors may influence the price of SHIB. First, the state of the market as a whole is probably going to have an impact on Shiba Inu&#8217;s price. For example, Shiba Inu&#8217;s price is more likely to increase if the cryptocurrency market, in general, is bullish. On the other hand, Shiba Inu&#8217;s price is more likely to diminish if the market is bearish.</p>



<p>Shiba Inu prices can also be impacted by news and events. For instance, the price will likely increase if there is good news regarding Shiba Inu, such as a new alliance or a significant advancement. In contrast, the price will probably decrease if there is bad news, like a security breach or scandal.</p>



<p>As with all meme coins, there is, of course, speculation. Shiba Inu buyers engage in speculation when they purchase SHIB in anticipation of a price increase. Speculation can cause prices to rise quickly, but it can also cause prices to fall quickly.</p>



<p>As with all meme coins, investors should proceed cautiously and only invest what they can afford to lose.</p>

<p>According to a May 8, 2023 press release, the Bank of Canada has launched online public consultations to understand the features that could be included in a digital Canadian dollar.</p>



<p>The consultation seeks to understand how Canadians would likely use a Canadian digital dollar, what security features are important, and accessibility and privacy concerns. The public consultation runs until June 19, 2023.</p>



<p>The Bank of Canada has stated that a digital Canadian dollar is not needed at this time, and any decision to issue one rests with Parliament and the Government of Canada.</p>



<p>In November 2022, the Canadian government launched a consultation on digital currencies, including stablecoins and central bank digital currency (CBDC). The Bank of Canada continues to actively research, prepare and consult on the case of a potential CBDC. The Bank of Canada will publish a report summarizing this consultation later this year.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), Philip Lowe, said that the RBA had issued a small amount of digital currency to explore possible use cases of new forms of digital money, including a CBDC, as part of a research project with the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lowe made these remarks at the Reserve Bank Board Dinner in Perth on May 2, 2023. Lowe further said that the RBA was very interested in this project&#8217;s results.</p>



<p>In an August 2022 joint media release, the RBA and the DFCRC announced a collaboration on a research project to explore use cases for a CBDC in Australia. The report on the project’s findings is expected in mid-2023.</p>



<p>According to the PwC Global Crypto Regulation Report 2023, Australia does not have a bespoke regulatory framework for digital assets unless the assets are caught through existing rules which apply to financial products and general consumer law.</p>



<p>In December 2021, the Australian Government agreed to establish regulatory regimes for digital assets, including a licensing and custody regime, decentralized autonomous organizations structures, reviewing the policy framework for digital assets taxation, token mapping and research on potential CBDC viability.</p>



<p>In May 2022, the Australian Government undertook to consult on custody obligations for third-party custodians of crypto assets and provide additional consumer safeguards. In September 2022, a draft bill, the Digital Assets (Market Regulation) Bill, was published for parliamentary debate and public consultation on digital assets, including stablecoins.</p>



<p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) continues to support the development of a regulatory framework with a focus on consumer protection and market integrity.</p>
