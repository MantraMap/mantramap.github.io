			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Road Town, BVI, 27th December, 2022, Chainwire</p><p>Santa Browser has announced the Version 1 launch of its web3 browser today. Built for an emerging crypto world, the browser claims to bring in the next generation of web3 users by developing tools that allow anyone to leverage the power of blockchain technologies. Due to the extreme volatility of the market, Santa is dedicated to building a &ldquo;Trustable Technology Stack&rdquo; that users can firmly rely upon while browsing the web. With the Christmas release of Santa Browser, users can now earn crypto rewards simply by browsing.</p>
"We believe that browsers need to evolve a lot more to keep up with the pace at which the internet is evolving." said Alekh B, CEO of Santa Browser. "Our approach to Santa Browser is deeply influenced by the principles of web3 &mdash; Anti Monopoly, Transparency, Democracy, Data Privacy, Security &amp; Fair Distribution Of Wealth."
Why Santa Browser?
<p>Browse-2-Earn 
On a mission to reimagine the web, the browser starts with the relationship between users &amp; advertising. With Santa&rsquo;s Browse2Earn, users can earn crypto rewards for their regular activities online (rewards include but are not limited to ad monetization, search monetization, discounted shopping, etc.) while maintaining control over their privacy.</p>
<p>Geared For Privacy
Santa Browser hosts many features to protect user privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Integrated ad blocker &mdash; to stop all invasive ads.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Tracker blocker &mdash; &nbsp;to stop all online trackers &amp; browser fingerprinting practices.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Ungoogling &mdash; while forked from chromium, the browser has been cleansed of all Google trackers, host detectors (tools that identify your IP address) &amp; other privacy-harming features.</li>
  <li>Santa also disables other features inherent in the base Chromium build that inhibit control and transparency, while adding/modifying features that promote them. This is an ongoing process.</li>
  <li>Santa&rsquo;s partnership with Eyeo ensures that only Acceptable Ads that abide by the criteria specially developed for and by ad-filtering users, and are non-intrusive are allowed to interact with you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Military Grade Security
Santa Browser's code has been reviewed and tested for vulnerabilities by Veracode, a programme that validates a company's secure software development processes. Veracode Secure code review certification echoes Santa Browser's mature practices for creating secure software.</p>
<p>Planned Features
Updates in the next few weeks will see the phased release of interesting features such as free single-tab VPN, an immersive dApp store and the browser&rsquo;s very own decentralized &ldquo;Santa Wallet&rdquo; where users can easily collect their rewards.&nbsp;</p>


<p>About Santa Browser
A unique Web3 browser exclusively catering to the emerging crypto world - Santa will give users everything they need to kickstart their crypto journey with safety, ease &amp; convenience. Santa browser does not just resolutely protect the data &amp; privacy of its users, it also generously rewards them.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Japanese regulators are reconsidering lifting the ban on cryptocurrency restrictions related to foreign stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) in 2023 according to reports by local news agencies. </p>
<p>According to reports by local news agency Nikkei, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) of Japan is to reconsider major cryptocurrency strictions related to the distribution of foreign issued stablecoins in 2023. The report indicates that the new stablecoin regulations in the country will allow local exchanges to handle stablecoin trading under the condition of asset preservation by deposits and an upper limit of remittance. The report notes:</p>

<p>If payment using stablecoins spreads, international remittances may become faster and cheaper.</p>

<p>In June 2022, Japan&rsquo;s parliament passed a bill to ban stablecoin issuance by non-banking institutions. The FSA said that by now allowing stablecoin distribution in Japan will also necessitate additional regulations related to Anti-Money Laundering controls. The FSA&rsquo;s most recent announcement will have a major impact on crypto trading services offered in the country as currently no local exchanges are permitted to provide trading in stablecoins such as USDT and USDC. None of the 31 Japanese exchanges registered with the FSA were handling stablecoin trading as of November 30, 2022, according to official data.</p>
Japan Eases Corporate Tax Rates for Token Issuers
<p>Japan&rsquo;s news on the lift of the ban on stablecoin issuance comes not long after it passed other very bullish news on cryptocurrencies. Earlier in the month, Japan&rsquo;s ruling Liberal Democratic Party approved a proposal that would exempt companies issuing cryptocurrencies from taxes on unrealised capital gains for tokens they retain on their books. The proposal aims to improve business conditions for companies issuing crypto as they are currently required to a pay a set 30% corporate tax rate on their holdings, regardless if they have realised a profit through a sale or not.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Gains Minor Traction:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 27 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) found a minor bid early in the Asian session as the pair climbed as high as the 16887.96 area after being lifted from the 16720 area in a continuation of the recent tight trading range around the 16880.44 area, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460.&nbsp;&nbsp; A recent rebound saw BTC/USD test the 18469.40 area, a level it could not sustain as elevated risk aversion resulted in more downward pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp; Selling pressure recently intensified around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels and BTC/USD tested downside price objectives related to these levels, including the 16375.18 area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD has depreciated approximately 63% year-to-date, and is off more than 1% month-to-date.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16846.69 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16826.77.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bearishly below MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrencies are gaining ground as the popularity of digital asset transactions as a means of payments is growing. With the total user base of cryptocurrencies spilling over the 290 million mark, it is easy to fathom that with such turbulence on the crypto market, users will be concerned with the safety of their assets. Online search engine queries are brimming with requests for the &ldquo;best crypto wallet&rdquo;, but in light of the collapse of the FTX exchange, users have started searching for non-custodial wallets en masse.</p>
<p>Indeed, the need for a free of custody wallet is becoming acute as cryptocurrencies are entering the financial and commercial mainstream markets. And with the abundance of decentralized wallet options available on the market, the mind boggles of the possibilities. As such, we have compiled a list of the best non-custodial crypto wallets to answer the question of which crypto wallet is best for beginners.</p>
NOW Wallet&nbsp;
<p>When it comes to crypto wallet app choices, few representatives of the non-custodial ilk can match the offering provided by NOW Wallet. This convenient and versatile product was released by the popular ChangeNOW exchange ChangeNOW, combining the best of its technological solutions and security measures that have been perfected by years of market operation.</p>
<p>The NOW Wallet has both a desktop crypto wallet and mobile versions suited for iOS and Android, making it ideal for both businesses and users with on-the-go attitudes. In fact, the features borrowed from the parent exchange make NOW Wallet ideal for business needs thanks to its dedicated portfolio formation options that can be suited for both personal and enterprise application.</p>
<p>Most importantly, NOW Wallet allows users to conduct operations right inside the application thanks to the built-in exchange service from ChangeNOW, which facilitates cryptocurrency purchases for fiat via a convenient on-ramp. This means that users no longer need to export their assets from the wallet to external trading venues and are thus freed from the burden of having to pay extra commissions.</p>
<p>With its round-the-clock support service that provides prompt troubleshooting, NOW Wallet is truly user-oriented, especially taking into consideration the fact that its internal crypto exchange rate is always in favor of the user. Weekly updates and a robust user interface that is both streamlined and easy to navigate give NOW Wallet a considerable edge in the UI and UX departments. NOW Wallet also supports over 500 cryptocurrencies and 70,000 trading pairs across more than 40 blockchain networks.</p>
<p>Security</p>
<p>With security being in top focus on the part of users, NOW Wallet has the given aspect covered, in large part thanks to its legacy of the ChangeNow exchange, which has perfected its security measures. KYC and identity verification are not mandatory for accessing funds stored on NOW Wallet, but it does allow users to retain control of their private keys and includes the standard lineup of security features like 2-Factor Authentication. A recently included function is protection from dust attacks, since NOW Wallet hides spam transactions from the history feed and thus safeguards users from unnecessary information flows.</p>
<p>Special Functions</p>
<p>NOW Wallet comes equipped with a long list of special functions and features that place it rightfully at the top of the given lineup of candidates for the title of best crypto wallet:</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Pendulum, a leading player in the decentralized finance (Defi) space, has set a new record for the fastest parachain crowdloan on the Polkadot blockchain. The loan, which was fully funded in just 90 minutes, marks a major milestone for the Defi platform and underscores its growing popularity among users.</p>
What is a Parachain Crowdloan?
<p>A parachain crowdloan is a fundraising mechanism that allows a project to secure the necessary funding to build and operate a parachain on the Polkadot blockchain. Parachains are independent blockchains that are connected to the main Polkadot network, allowing them to share resources and security while maintaining their own unique features and functionality.</p>
<p>To secure a parachain crowdloan, a project must first submit a proposal to the Polkadot community, outlining its vision and goals for the parachain. If the proposal is approved, the project can then begin the process of raising the necessary funds through a crowdloan campaign.</p>
<p>In the case of Pendulum, the project was able to secure full funding for its parachain in just 90 minutes, setting a new record for the fastest parachain crowdloan on Polkadot.</p>
Pendulum's Success Attributed to Strong Community Support
<p>Pendulum's success in securing its parachain crowdloan can be attributed to its strong community support and the growing demand for Defi platforms. Pendulum has built a reputation for offering high-quality, innovative Defi solutions and has garnered a dedicated following among users.</p>
<p>In addition to its fast-growing user base, Pendulum has also received significant backing from prominent investors and industry leaders. This support, combined with the platform's strong reputation and user-friendly interface, likely contributed to the rapid funding of its parachain crowdloan.</p>
What's Next for Pendulum?
<p>With its parachain crowdloan fully funded, Pendulum is now well-positioned to continue expanding and improving its Defi platform. The project plans to use the funds to develop new features and services, as well as to continue growing its user base.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A technical integration with the Stellar Foundation could be arriving very soon. The two sides have been working together on the much-awaited Spacewalk bridge. The achievement would see the first ever technical branch between Polkadot and Stellar&rsquo;s chains. Once the trust-minimized bridge is live, Pendulum will gain the ability to start interacting with an array of fiat stable tokens.</p>
<p>Pendulum's success in securing its parachain crowdloan is a testament to the growing demand for Defi solutions and the potential of the Polkadot blockchain. As the Defi space continues to evolve, Pendulum seems well-positioned to play a leading role in shaping the future of decentralized finance.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Liquidity Remains Muted:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 26 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) extended its multi-session extremely tight trading range early in the Asian session as the pair was unable to trade too far away from the 16880.44 area, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460.&nbsp;&nbsp; A recent rebound saw BTC/USD test the 18469.40 area, a level it could not sustain as elevated risk aversion resulted in more downward pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp; Selling pressure recently intensified around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels and BTC/USD tested downside price objectives related to these levels, including the 16375.18 area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD has depreciated approximately 63% year-to-date, and is off more than 1% month-to-date.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16841.43 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16815.27.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>2022 and the ongoing bear market have seen a wave of unprecedented losses, bankruptcies, and liquidations. According to a recent report by Forbes, crypto billionaires lost a total of $116 billion during the year. </p>
<p>According to investigations and a report compiled by Forbes, the bear market has seen $116 billion drained from the pockets of investors in the past nine months. Forbes indicates that the loss represents the combined personal equity of 17 persons in the space, with over 15 of those persons losing more than half their fortunes since March 2022, and 10 names were consequently removed from the cryptocurrency billionaires list.

<p>Major losses can also be attributed to the CEOs of other cryptocurrency exchanges.

Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen has reduced by more than half, dropping from $4.3 billion in March to $2.1 billion as it stands. The Winklevoss twins of Gemini were valued at $4 billion each earlier in the year but are now each only worth around $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest losses seen in 2022, were seen by FTX co-founders Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang. Their fortunes stood at $24 billion and $5.9 billion respectively but stood at $0 as of December.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">American multinational investment bank and financial services holding firm JPMorgan Chase has published the results of a research project it has engaged in. The report highlights how trends have emerged in the demographic they sampled, reflecting a shift in preferences among U.S. crypto users.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The report, titled "The Dynamics and Demographics of U.S. Household Crypto-Asset Use" was co-authored by the company's President, Chris Wheat, and George Eckerd, the firm's Financial Markets Research Lead. According to the authors, their methodology went through "de-identified data covering a sample of nearly 5 million active checking account customers, over 600 thousand of which have conducted transfers to crypto accounts."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The research details how most crypto users based or registered from the U.S. increasingly made first-time transactions during the height of crypto-asset price surges. The report also points to how crypto usage is skewed towards "men, Asian individuals, and younger individuals with higher incomes."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The report also found that holdings for each wallet tend to be "relatively small" given how median flows are equal to less than a week's worth of earnings. However, this is counteracted by the results that show how roughly 15% of users have net transfers that are over the average monthly income per individual. This points to how cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular among U.S. households, but their use has been relatively small in comparison to other investing options such as stocks and bonds.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite this relative lack of exposure, a small subset of crypto users may have financial risk if the crypto market declines further. About 15 percent of crypto users have transferred over one month's worth of take-home pay into crypto accounts, making them more vulnerable to future price drops, compared than non-crypto investors; this percentage increases as the price of cryptocurrencies drops.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The trend also points to how most of these holders transferred crypto when prices "were significantly higher than recent levels" while the lower-income bracket of the demographic often made purchases at higher levels, compared to holders who had access to more income.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">When the price of a security rises quickly, households typically react by transferring money into that asset. The researchers from JPMorganChase thus concluded that this implies that the "timing" of these transfers is characteristic of "herd behavior". To add, the researchers note that American households tended to make large investments in cryptocurrencies during the period when their value was rising sharply.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Using data on the time of transfers to cryptocurrency accounts as a proxy for investment price, JPMorgan Chase's research found that households with lower incomes tended to purchase cryptoassets at substantially higher prices than other groups. According to the financial firm, this would also mean that at the rates that cryptocurrencies were trading at in late-2022, the majority of U.S. households would have been losing money overall if they had owned any cryptocurrency for more than a few months.Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to the authors, their methodology went through "de-identified data covering a sample of nearly 5 million active checking account customers, over 600 thousand of which have conducted transfers to crypto accounts."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The research details how most crypto users based or registered from the U.S. increasingly made first-time transactions during the height of crypto-asset price surges. The report also points to how crypto usage is skewed towards "men, Asian individuals, and younger individuals with higher incomes."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The report also found that holdings for each wallet tend to be "relatively small" given how median flows are equal to less than a week's worth of earnings. However, this is counteracted by the results that show how roughly 15% of users have net transfers that are over the average monthly income per individual. This points to how cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular among U.S. households, but their use has been relatively small in comparison to other investing options such as stocks and bonds.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite this relative lack of exposure, a small subset of crypto users may have financial risk if the crypto market declines further. About 15 percent of crypto users have transferred over one month's worth of take-home pay into crypto accounts, making them more vulnerable to future price drops, compared than non-crypto investors; this percentage increases as the price of cryptocurrencies drops.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The trend also points to how most of these holders transferred crypto when prices "were significantly higher than recent levels" while the lower-income bracket of the demographic often made purchases at higher levels, compared to holders who had access to more income.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">When the price of a security rises quickly, households typically react by transferring money into that asset. The researchers from JPMorganChase thus concluded that this implies that the "timing" of these transfers is characteristic of "herd behavior". To add, the researchers note that American households tended to make large investments in cryptocurrencies during the period when their value was rising sharply.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Using data on the time of transfers to cryptocurrency accounts as a proxy for investment price, JPMorgan Chase's research found that households with lower incomes tended to purchase cryptoassets at substantially higher prices than other groups. According to the financial firm, this would also mean that at the rates that cryptocurrencies were trading at in late-2022, the majority of U.S. households would have been losing money overall if they had owned any cryptocurrency for more than a few months.Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>When the cryptocurrency market becomes volatile, traders switch from spot platforms where they can buy and hold to derivatives platforms where they can hedge the market, trade long and short, and rely on powerful tactics such as adding leverage to positions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The demand for derivatives has led to an explosion of competition throughout the cryptocurrency industry, making it much more challenging to find a platform with unique differentiators and quality throughout all products and services. The list below represents the top ten best crypto derivatives platforms for 2023, helping you start the year on the right foot and immediately begin making serious profits in the new year.</p>
<p>The Best Crypto Derivatives Platforms By Rank</p>
<p>#10) Bitget</p>
<p>Bitget is among the less popular cryptocurrency derivatives trading platforms on the list but deserves mention among the list due to being ranked in the top five platforms by trading volume globally by CoinGecko. It&rsquo;s been around since 2018, which is a positive sign. Bitget futures are settled in USDT, USDC, or via specific coins for up to 125x leverage.</p>
<p>In addition to cryptocurrency futures, Bitget has spot trading, copy trading, and a launchpad program. Recent coin launches include Revoland, an esports game based on blockchain technology; Kyoko, a DAO-to-DAO credit provider; and Bot Planet, a multichain ecosystem with Play-To-Earn and NFT elements.</p>
<p>#9) Phemex</p>
<p>Phemex is currently celebrating its third anniversary, priding itself in being &ldquo;safe, super, and simple,&rdquo; as well as one of the &ldquo;fastest&rdquo; crypto exchanges around. The company&rsquo;s founders in the past served as senior executives at Morgan Stanley but left the traditional banking system seeking to spread universal financial access globally.</p>
<p>Phemex doesn&rsquo;t offer much more than our number ten pick but does have more prominence in the trading community. Phemex also has a launchpad, spot trading, and of course, derivatives contracts. Derivatives include copy trading and perpetual swaps with up to 100x leverage.</p>
<p>#8) MEXC Global</p>
<p>Another platform launched in 2018, MEXC Global, boasts of its &ldquo;mega transaction matching technology,&rdquo; capable of 1.4 million transactions per second. In 2021, it was awarded the Best Crypto Exchange Asia by Crypto Expo Dubai.</p>
<p>MEXC Global lets users buy crypto with a debit or credit card and trade spot crypto and leveraged EFTs, in addition to a wide range of futures with up to 200x leverage, settled in stablecoins or top crypto assets. MEXC also has a futures leaderboard and copy trading.</p>
<p>#7) ByBit</p>
<p>While Phemex was on its third anniversary, ByBit is now celebrating its fourth year in operation. It has since grown to include a Web3 wallet, high LTV crypto loans, a varied earn program with liquidity mining, crypto savings accounts, and a launchpool for staking new tokens. There&rsquo;s also a launchpad, much like others on the list.</p>
<p>We will start to see a trend among some of the platforms listed. For example, top platforms will each offer the ability to buy crypto. ByBit is known best for its derivatives, with copy trading, options, and perpetual swaps with up to 100x leverage.</p>
<p>#6) Deribit</p>
<p>Although other platforms on the list are much more significant in terms of market share in futures and perpetual swaps, Deribit is the leader in cryptocurrency options. For many, options are the derivative contract of choice, while others prefer futures and perpetual swaps. Deribit offers BTC, ETH, and SOL options.</p>
<p>Because Deribit has the highest open interest out of all options platforms, it utilizes its unique market data through its insights blog, which traders can use to predict cryptocurrency market volatility or possible price movements. For example, when puts are at a record high, higher prices are possible if a contrarian move unfolds.</p>
<p>#5) OKX</p>
<p>OKX recently saw a rebrand that removed the &ldquo;E&rdquo; from its name to diminish the influence of the word exchange on its products and services lineup. OKX seeks to be viewed as a decentralized platform at the center of Web3. The platform offers solutions for developers, and a set of official decentralized applications users can take advantage of.</p>
<p>OKX has it all in terms of derivatives, with futures, options, perpetual swaps, and margin trading at up to 125x leverage. There are also trading bots, a learn program, crypto loans, and a jumpstart program offering access to new projects from around the world.</p>
<p>#4) Huobi Global</p>
<p>Huobi Global is one of the longest-running platforms on the list, with a shocking zero security incidents in the past nine years of operation &ndash; a true testament to the platform&rsquo;s top-tier security and risk management protocols. It commands a massive amount of crypto derivatives trading volume but has lost market share in recent years.</p>
<p>Huobi&rsquo;s longevity has given it time to develop a wide range of products and services, which include crypto loans, passive income, spot trading, and trading bots. In terms of derivatives, there&rsquo;s once again a lot to offer, with futures, copy trading, and both American and European-style options to choose from. Supported leverage reaches 100x at maximum.</p>
<p>#3) KuCoin</p>
<p>KuCoin does everything it can to compete with Binance, complete with biting its logo and feature set. Others have also sought to go toe-to-toe with Binance regarding products and services, but the carbon copy is less blatant elsewhere. But being on par with Binance isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing &ndash; and market leaders are often copied.</p>
<p>What KuCoin does offer is reliable and proven, with the ability to buy crypto, earn interest on crypto, trade spot, and access a web3 wallet. It also includes an NFT platform. Leveraged tokens are offered in addition to crypto futures at up to 100x leverage.</p>
<p>#2) Binance</p>
<p>You might be surprised to find that Binance is no longer the number one cryptocurrency derivative platform in the market. The ongoing drama and close distance to the FTX fallout have tarnished the cryptocurrency platform&rsquo;s reputation and made it a target of the US SEC and Department of Justice. World-renowned financial analysts call the platform and its CEO a &ldquo;ticking time bomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There has recently been a mass exodus of withdrawals of BTC &ndash; the largest ever recorded &ndash; due to fear over Binance potentially having similar issues as FTX. Fears include the BNB token being worthless in the event of a collapse, much like what occurred with the FTT token. Others believe Binance is too big to fail.</p>
<p>Binance still dominates the cryptocurrency market in terms of overall trading volume, making it a mandatory inclusion in this list. It also has one of the most extensive ranges of products and services, including an NFT marketplace, an earn program, loans, a Binance card, spot trading, and derivatives. Futures, options, and leveraged tokens all max out at 125x leverage.</p>
<p>#1) PrimeXBT</p>
<p>PrimeXBT has become the quintessential platform in the cryptocurrency market because it is the only one on the list to provide access to traditional asset classes like stock indices, commodities, metals, and forex currencies, in addition to a wide variety of popular cryptocurrencies. Using BTC, ETH, USDT, or USDC as collateral, traders can open long and short positions on more than 100 different trading instruments simultaneously.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are becoming an increasingly important asset class, highly sensitive to macro factors such as recessions, inflation, pandemics, and interest rates. This makes the inclusion of assets like gold, the S&amp;P 500, oil, and others more important to consider when trading crypto. With PrimeXBT, you don&rsquo;t need to sell your crypto and can instead use it to margin trade with up to 200x leverage on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other top cryptocurrencies. Leverage on traditional assets runs even higher, up to 500x.</p>
<p>PrimeXBT was also a pioneer in copy trading, making its Covesting service among the most battle-tested, with the largest communities of top traders from around the globe. As of the time of this writing, the leaderboards have traders in the top five ranging from 1,000 to 4,000% ROI. Followers can, with a click, start automatically copying the trades of highly successful traders with proven performance metrics.</p>
<p>Other bells and whistles include an award-winning crypto trading app for Android and iOS, the PrimeXBT Trading Academy educational website, PrimeXBT Contests, interest-bearing yield accounts, the best referral program in finance, and much more. What really put the platform over the edge was the recent award from Crypto Expo Dubai for the Most Trusted Crypto-Asset Trading Platform. Trust in 2023 will be more critical than ever before, giving the platform an advantage with the broader crypto community.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>While you can&rsquo;t go wrong with any of the platforms on this list, PrimeXBT was picked as number one for a reason. For serious profits in 2023, the best crypto derivatives platform is PrimeXBT.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Before filing for bankruptcy, FTX paid its lead lawyers over $12 million to oversee the earliest parts of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. </p>
<p>According to court filings, the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTC paid its lead lawyers, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP a retainer of over $12 million shortly before the firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Sullivan &amp; Cromwell indicated that it had drawn only a little more than $3 million of that, and that was for services rendered in the days leading up to the rushed bankruptcy filing according to reports by Bloomberg Law.</p>
<p>Sullivan &amp; Cromwell is a firm headquartered in New York City that received this retainer from West Realm Shires Service Inc. on behalf of FTX for legal services the firm required.</p>
<p>Available information indicated that FTX paid at least $15.5 million to avail and retain the firm&rsquo;s services. The court filing further revealed that the law firm currently holds $9 million of the retainer.</p>
Developments in the FTX Case
<p>FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 11 the same day that its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried resigned. Following the shutdown of the exchange, FTX investors lost access to the funds they stored on the exchange. Most recently, the judge overseeing the SBF-FTX case, District Judge Ronnie Abrams recused herself from the case after she revealed that a law firm employing her husband as a partner had previously advised FTX in 2021. Abrams further explained that the reason for her recusal was informed by the fact that the law firm represented parties that may be adverse to FTX and its former CEO, SBF, in other legal proceedings.</p>
<p>SBF was also released on a $250 million bail bond secured by his parents who offered up their home in Palo Alto, California as collateral. The conditions of SBF&rsquo;s bail also include a written promise that he appears for future court appearances and he does not engage in any illegal activities. SBF also had to hand over his passport, must wear an ankle monitor, and be confined to his parent&rsquo;s home in Palo Alto.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>INTERNET CITY, DUBAI, 24th December, 2022, Chainwire</p><p>Nigeria has put forward a significant legislation design that will further facilitate cryptocurrency adoption in the country with over 200 million inhabitants.</p>
<p>Why this matters
If the Investments and Securities Act, 2007 (Amendment) Bill passes, the Nigerian securities and exchange commission (SEC) will recognize cryptocurrencies and other digital assets as capital for investment.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Babangida Ibrahim, Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee, shared in an interview with local media outlet Punch, that the proposed bill will specify the roles of the Central Bank of Nigeria and the country's SEC in regard to cryptocurrencies.</li>
  <li>Ibrahim stated that the bill is not a complete shift away from restrictive laws in place, only a review of what could be done within the current legal framework. However, he does believe that Nigeria must keep up with global economic innovations.</li>
  <li>Notably, the Nigerian Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA) stated in a press release in September that it considered partnering with crypto exchange Binance to create a virtual free zone to promote economic growth.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Go Deeper
The legal blueprint comes at a time when Nigeria has spent almost 2 years under a cryptocurrency ban for financial institutes, and the country&rsquo;s CBDC, the eNaira, has failed to reach widespread adoption.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Since the launch of the CBDC in October 2021, it currently sits at an adoption rate of only 0.5% among the population.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Further endorsement of the eNaira could be hampered by the legal blueprint. &ldquo;This bill is basically going to create more adoption of cryptocurrencies. Through regulation of this asset class, we might start to see taxing and legal registration if you want to build something in the blockchain space,&rdquo; says Anointing Aha, Community Manager for Nigeria at global crypto exchange LBank.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>For now, Nigeria seems to be moving towards further adoption, but nothing is set in stone. &ldquo;Nigeria&rsquo;s presidential election is coming up early next year, and a lot will depend on the new president,&rdquo; Aha adds.</li>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s4">Cardano (ADA) has faced another staggering decline in the past few days, even experiencing a loss of 13.00% in the 24-hour timeline.</p>
<p class="s4">But when ADA and other leading tokens plummeted, The Hideaways (HDWY) managed to withstand the adverse effect of the bearish market, making it the center of attention.</p>
<p class="s7">Cardano (ADA) Prints Two-Year Low</p>
<p class="s8">Cardano (ADA) has hit another plunge after imprinting the lowest lows in almost two years as traders run to the exit. Subsequently, ADA skidded 16.40% to $0.26 in the past seven days, issuing distress signals to the markets.</p>
<p class="s8">The red turn of the cryptocurrencies came as investors expect the US Federal Reserve to retain its aggressive monetary policy in 2023, despite the recent modest rate increase.</p>
<p class="s8">The downturn of major coins like Cardano (ADA) has led traders to look at alternatives with more potential in the short term. The Hideaways (HDWY) is the trending presale star who has navigated its way to the headlines, winning bullish analysts' predictions for next year.</p>
<p class="s8">Meanwhile, investors are starting to grasp the harsh reality that a soft landing is not in the cards for Cardano. Otherwise, a snowball recession and price avalanche are in sight.</p>
<p class="s7">Where Is Cardano (ADA) Headed Next?</p>
<p class="s8">Recent efforts to push Cardano (ADA) have been unsuccessful as ADA approached the lower boundary support of a falling channel.</p>
<p class="s8">At press time, Cardano&rsquo;s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator cites a selling signal. Thus, the overhead pressure will likely intensify, predicting more losses for the token.</p>
<p class="s8">Moreover, ADA&rsquo;s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has touched the oversold barrier. Analysts have cited that Cardano could continue the extreme bearish sentiment and slump into $0.20 next year.</p>
<p class="s8">On the other hand, The Hideaways (HDWY) is about to wrap its presale this month, offering massive rewards of up to 100% bonus on all investments.</p>
<p>The Hideaways (HDWY) On The Road To Surpass Cardano(ADA)</p>
<p class="s8">Anyone currently looking for a reward-giving cryptocurrency investment must go forward with The Hideaways (HDWY).</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors are now tired of the extreme price declines triggered by the broader bearish market, causing them to leave the meme token and place their bets on The Hideaways (HDWY), which ensures profits like no other.</p>
<p class="s6">On the brilliant success of HDWY, the project is set to close its presale at the end of this month, with an offered price of $0.10 per token.</p>
<p class="s8">Shiba Inu (SHIB) Falls Out of Market&rsquo;s Favor</p>
<p class="s6">Shiba Inu (SHIB) has suffered one of the worst slumps this week, leading Ethereum whales to move away from the dog-themed meme coin.</p>
<p class="s6">Accordingly, Shiba Inu has skidded 11.70% to $0.00000815 in the 7-day timeline, resulting in a 75.20% decline from its year-ago level. SHIB&rsquo;s steady decline has caused the whales to exit a good portion of their positions.</p>
<p class="s6">As Shiba Inu (SHIB) loses market favor, The Hideaways (HDWY) marks its name as the current crypto crowd favorite. Experts projected the brand new token to bloom in considerable returns of up to 40X in the next year.</p>
<p class="s9">Can Shiba Inu (SHIB) Hit $1 in 2023?</p>
<p class="s6">Most crypto experts believe that Shiba Inu (SHIB) will unlikely reach the $1 mark next year. A piece of more unfortunate news for SHIB investors is that the meme coin is only set to run around $0.0000134987.</p>
<p class="s6">Analysts explained that Shiba (SHIB) would need to grow its market cap from $4 trillion to $590 trillion, an impossible case for the token. In addition, investors are disappointed with the long-due utility of the Elon Musk-backed crypto.</p>
<p class="s6">Meanwhile, investors believed that The Hideaways (HDWY) could have a higher chance of breaching the dollar mark as the presale superstar is set to produce 40x ROI in 2023.</p>
<p class="s11">The Hideaways (HDWY) Powers Up Over Shiba Inu (SHIB)</p>
<p class="s6">The cryptocurrency market remains in a bearish cycle, and it's best to seek secure yet profitable projects like The Hideaways (HDWY).</p>
<p class="s6">Accordingly, investors' sentiment towards Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains sideways as the utility of the meme token is still on the long way. On the other hand, HDWY has gained media attention thanks to its unique utility.</p>
<p class="s6">The Hideaways (HDWY) unlocks the potential of the high-tier real-estate market by minting non-fungible tokens, a more secure functionality than SHIB.</p>
<p class="s6">This is the best time to join The Hideaways, as the project delivers up to a 100% bonus to all investments. Furthermore, a $100,000 prize draw also awaits you! Never waste a second and join HDWY now!</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cardano (ADA) may be the most underwhelming performer among all crypto majors this year. ADA had just fallen back to base after declining from $0.30, making us question where it heads next.</p>
<p>Due to the recent panic, The Hideaways (HDWY) welcomes an expected influx in demand for its $100,000 prize draw to celebrate the success of its presale event ending on December 31.</p>
<p class="s7">Cardano (ADA) Buying Sentiment Falls</p>
<p>It looks like we will not be seeing a tangible recovery from Cardano (ADA) this year - a disappointment for many analysts who put the token at the top of their buy recommendation list for 2022.</p>
<p>Cardano (ADA)&rsquo;s relative strength index bottomed at $26.72, an oversold territory. This is a level it had not visited since October, which explains why there it caused panic among investors.</p>
<p>Unlike The Hideaways (HDWY) which received a positive long-term forecast from analysts, experts are encouraging holders to dump their remaining ADA. The price continues to record lower lows, bottoming at $0.26 in the latest charts.</p>
<p>Cardano (ADA) fell from the $0.30 zone on December 16. The token continued to trade sideways from there as the buying sentiment declined due to a lack of fundamental strength and weak crypto market performance in the backdrop.</p>
<p class="s7">Cardano (ADA) Price Forecast and Updates</p>
<p>Cardano (ADA) buyers have to double down on their defense to protect the $0.25 level. Failure to gain momentum at this zone could send the price to $0.20 or lower.</p>
<p>This is the weakest ADA has ever been this year. The tokens started the year strong at $1.30 apiece.</p>
<p>Aside from the extended crypto winter, Cardano (ADA) is also facing tough competition for investor attention against newer and better projects like The Hideaways (HDWY).</p>
<p>Amid the recent retracement, the network's founder Charles Hoskinson addressed his ongoing fallout against the Ripple community. Hoskinson said he will never comment on any Ripple-related issues again.</p>
<p class="s7">The Hideaways (HDWY): The Bear Market Saver</p>
<p>The Hideaways (HDWY) will be Cardano (ADA)'s savior in this challenging bear market.</p>
<p>The Hideaways (HDWY) has stability like no other, thanks to its real estate backing. It is the first to see the underlying potential in the trillion-dollar luxury real estate project.</p>
<p>Through selling NFTs backed by real-world assets, investors are guaranteed their money is stable regardless of what happens in the broader crypto landscape. Sudden crashes like Terra Luna and FTX taught us we could only rely on utility-based cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Due to its strong real estate ties, The Hideaways (HDWY) is forecasted to hit $1 by the first quarter of 2023. If you buy it at a current price of $0.10, you will be up with gains you can only imagine throughout your investing career.</p>

<p>Cardano (ADA)&rsquo;s relative strength index bottomed at $26.72, an oversold territory. This is a level it had not visited since October, which explains why there it caused panic among investors.</p>
<p>Unlike The Hideaways (HDWY) which received a positive long-term forecast from analysts, experts are encouraging holders to dump their remaining ADA. The price continues to record lower lows, bottoming at $0.26 in the latest charts.</p>
<p>Cardano (ADA) fell from the $0.30 zone on December 16. The token continued to trade sideways from there as the buying sentiment declined due to a lack of fundamental strength and weak crypto market performance in the backdrop.</p>
<p class="s7">Cardano (ADA) Price Forecast and Updates</p>
<p>Cardano (ADA) buyers have to double down on their defense to protect the $0.25 level. Failure to gain momentum at this zone could send the price to $0.20 or lower.</p>
<p>This is the weakest ADA has ever been this year. The tokens started the year strong at $1.30 apiece.</p>
<p>Aside from the extended crypto winter, Cardano (ADA) is also facing tough competition for investor attention against newer and better projects like The Hideaways (HDWY).</p>
<p>Amid the recent retracement, the network's founder Charles Hoskinson addressed his ongoing fallout against the Ripple community. Hoskinson said he will never comment on any Ripple-related issues again.</p>
<p class="s7">The Hideaways (HDWY): The Bear Market Saver</p>
<p>The Hideaways (HDWY) will be Cardano (ADA)'s savior in this challenging bear market.</p>
<p>The Hideaways (HDWY) has stability like no other, thanks to its real estate backing. It is the first to see the underlying potential in the trillion-dollar luxury real estate project.</p>
<p>Through selling NFTs backed by real-world assets, investors are guaranteed their money is stable regardless of what happens in the broader crypto landscape. Sudden crashes like Terra Luna and FTX taught us we could only rely on utility-based cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Due to its strong real estate ties, The Hideaways (HDWY) is forecasted to hit $1 by the first quarter of 2023. If you buy it at a current price of $0.10, you will be up with gains you can only imagine throughout your investing career.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) on Friday approved investment funds to hold crypto assets. </p>
<p>On December 23, the Brazilian CVM approved the ability for investment funds to hold cryptocurrency assets. According to the regulator, funds will be allowed to operate in the crypto sector while paying attention to controls related to integrity and ownership of the assets. The approval is however subject to a set of criteria established by a new regulatory framework that was enacted into law by outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro.</p>
Brazil Signs Crypto Regulation into Law
<p>On Thursday, the Brazilian president approved a crypto regulation bill that established a crime of fraud involving virtual assets that will come with a penalty of between four to six years in prison along with a fine. The bill further established a &ldquo;virtual service provider&rdquo; license, which will be required by digital asset firms, including exchanges and trading intermediaries. The bill does not allow Brazilians to use crypto such as Bitcoin as legal tender but does include various digital currencies under the definition of legal payment methods within the country.</p>
Guidelines for Investment Funds to Include Crypto
<p>Investment funds will be allowed to hold crypto assets but will be subject to a set of criteria established by Bolsonaro&rsquo;s newly enacted law. Per this new law, crypto assets may be included in a fund if they are traded entities authorized by the CVM, Brazil&rsquo;s central bank, or by a local supervisor in the case of operations in another country. Under the criteria, supervisory bodies must be legally competent to supervise and inspect the operations carried out, including ensuring that anti-money laundering (AML) guidelines are implemented, and counter-financial terrorism guidelines are adhered to.</p>
<p>Although there was a delay in approving the new regulatory framework, the CVM in October already published a guidance opinion for the market on the crypto sector. According to this guideline, even though crypto assets are not expressly included among securities, market agents must analyze the characteristics of each crypto asset, to determine whether it is a security.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The legal proceedings surrounding former FTX CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, have taken an interesting turn as District Judge Ronnie Abrams had to recuse herself from the case. </p>
<p>Judge Ronnie Abrams, United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, had to withdraw her participation from the case against former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. Abrams revealed that a law firm employing her husband as a partner had previously advised FTX in 2021.</p>
Abram&rsquo;s Decision Removes Conflict of Interest
<p>It was revealed in a filing that Abram&rsquo;s husband, Greg Andres, currently serves as a partner at Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell and has been employed there since June 2019. The filing also indicated that the firm offered legal services to the fallen cryptocurrency exchange in 2021. Abrams further explained that the reason for her recusal was informed by the fact that the law firm represented parties that may be adverse to FTX and its former CEO in other legal proceedings. Judge Abrams said:</p>
<p>My husband has had no involvement in any of these representations. Nonetheless, to avoid any possible conflict, or the appearance of one, the Court hereby recuses itself from this action.</p>
<p>The judge&rsquo;s decision to recuse herself from the case means that no conflict of interest in the FTX case exists as her husband continues to serve as a partner at Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell.</p>
SBF Released on $250 Million Bail
<p>On December 22, the former FTX CEO was released on a $250 million bail bond secured by his parents who offered up their home in Palo Alto, California as collateral. Should SBF decide to flee, his parent would be liable for $250 million. SBF&rsquo;s bail was also based on a written promise that he appear for future court appearances and not engage in any illegal activity. As a further part of his bail conditions, SBF has had to hand over his passport and will be confined to his parent's residence in Palo Alto.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Locked in Tight Range:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 25 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained locked in a tight range early in the Asian session as the pair continued to hug the 16880.44 area, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460.&nbsp;&nbsp; A recent rebound saw BTC/USD test the 18469.40 area, a level it could not sustain as elevated risk aversion resulted in more downward pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp; Selling pressure recently intensified around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels and BTC/USD tested downside price objectives related to these levels, including the 16375.18 area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD has depreciated approximately 63% year-to-date, and is off more than 1% month-to-date.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (hourly) and above the 100-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16838.55 and the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16820.97.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bearishly below MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>TheStandard.io allows investors to unlock liquidity from their assets without handing over custody.</p>
Crypto is disrupting traditional finance
<p>Traditional banking has failed badly. Those who leave their savings in bank accounts are losing their purchasing power at an ever-increasing rate. Depending on which country you live in, you can be losing from 7% to 70%+ a year through inflation, and these are just the government-manipulated figures.</p>
<p>Along came cryptocurrencies, and the innovations that came with them, such as decentralised finance, NFTs, smart contracts etc., and these have disrupted the world of finance in a big way.</p>
<p>However, with all such incredibly disruptive innovations, there have been many ups and downs, just as there were back in the dotcom revolution. Many hacks have taken place and many investors have lost funds in a pretty much unregulated sector.</p>
<p>Be this as it may, plenty of the smartest minds are concentrated in the cryptocurrency space and many more are on the way - regulation permitting.&nbsp;</p>
Standard.io is a leading project in the DeFi space
<p>One of the smartest projects in the DeFi space right now is Standard.io, a lending platform that enables users to lock up traditional, as well as crypto assets such as BTC and ETH, which can then generate fiat-pegged stablecoins.</p>
<p>Users lock up these assets in smart vaults, and then they can use the assets as collateral to mint sEURO, a euro-pegged stablecoin. Many other fiat-pegged stablecoins will be introduced in time.</p>
<p>When a user locks up an asset into their smart vault, that user is the only individual that has the keys to open it. No financial entity, government or any other third party is involved. The user then has a call on up to 85% of the value of the collateral in the smart vault in the form of a stablecoin pegged to fiat currency.</p>
<p>Even a traditional asset such as gold (and eventually silver) can be locked up in a smart vault. Such a thing has never been known in the financial world as gold has generally preserved your wealth but has never earned yield.</p>
Users retain control of their assets and can access liquidity&nbsp;
<p>The system Standard.io has developed offers a host of advantages to prospective users. One such advantage is the avoidance of taxable events. By depositing assets and receiving minted sEUROs there is no sale that takes place. Another advantage is to put minted sEUROs into liquidity pools and earn the fees that arise from this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, probably one of the biggest advantages is the ability to safely keep one's assets and to unlock the liquidity therein. In essence, a user is borrowing from themselves when they take liquidity out of their own assets. The money you needed for a house deposit, or that new car now becomes your money (at 0% interest) and as long as you pay it back, you get to keep your original assets as well.</p>
