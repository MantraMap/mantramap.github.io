<p class="s3">With the market downturn, investors are out searching for cryptocurrency projects they can invest in and hopefully use to increase their portfolios. But, most times, emotions and fear can blind an investor to making a panic decision.</p>
<p class="s3">This is why investors must make intelligent decisions, as those with assets in Fantom (FTM) and Mina Protocol (MINA) are currently watching as their assets are dropping due to market struggle. Consequently, it leads investors to alternatives like Sparklo, which is currently performing well in its presale.</p>
<p class="s3">Fantom (FTM) Investors Searching For Alternatives</p>
<p class="s3">The price movement of Fantom (FTM) hasn't been outstanding recently, as it shows no sign or little sign of its price changing from its downtrend position. With Bitcoin (BTC) dropping below $16,500, this indicates an inflation increase affecting the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and other altcoins. </p>
<p class="s3">Looking at the charts, over the past seven days, Fantom (FTM) has had a price decline of -26.01%, and even in the past month, it has continued to decline, as seen in its -1.7% price decrease. </p>
<p class="s3">Fantom currently trades at $0.20, and though Fantom (FTM) is one of the top cryptocurrency projects, it is still presently struggling in the market, and analysts predict that it might not have a reversal in the short term. As a result, investors will have to look at other alternatives if they need to boost their portfolios. </p>
<p class="s3">Mina Protocol (MINA) Price Fluctuates As The Market Downturn Continues</p>
<p class="s3">Mina Protocol (MINA) was launched in early 2021, and by June 1st, 2021, it was worth $9.90. After the launch, the market thought the price was overvalued, and it soon fell to a low of $2.76 before it recovered to trade at $3.24. By 2022, analysts valued Mina Protocol (MINA) at $3.59, and just like most cryptocurrencies, Mina Protocol (MINA) was no exception as it struggled with the crypto winter. </p>
<p class="s3">By January's end, Mina Protocol (MINA) was trading at $2.21, and this downtrend continued till it hit an all-time low of $1.76 on February 24th. After the general market crash, Mina Protocol (MINA) also hit an all-time low by May 12th and was pegged at $0.83. </p>
<p class="s3">Though the market recovered slightly, the other market crash, which saw the total value of the entire crypto market dip below $1trn, also affected the Mina Protocol (MINA). Nevertheless, Mina Protocol (MINA) has witnessed some recovery of 7.72% in the past 30 days. Analysts predict that since there are no solid fundamentals to back it up, it might only last for a while. </p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo (Sprk) Presale Records Success</p>
<p class="s3">With the success of Sparklo&rsquo;s presale, investors have recognized the high growth potential of the token. Fantom (FTM) and Mina Protocol (MINA) are struggling amidst market uncertainty. </p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo will be the first alternative investment that would allow investors to invest in fractionalized NFTs, backed by real-world assets in the form of gold, silver, or platinum. Sparklo passed its audit from Interfi Network, and to ensure that the project remains safe, the developers will lock its liquidity for 100 years. </p>
<p class="s3">Additionally, the team&rsquo;s token will be locked for 1,000 days. Sparklo currently goes for a price of $0.013, and analysts predict that the price will increase by more than 100x in the coming months. Investing early in a project ensures that investors get maximum gains. So this might be the best time to get in on Sparklo.</p>
