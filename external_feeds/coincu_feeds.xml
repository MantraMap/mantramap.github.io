										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Fake tokens flood networks following PayPal&#8217;s stablecoin debut, raising caution.</em></li>



<li><em>Legitimate PYUSD is only for verified PayPal wallets, users warned of imitations on decentralized exchanges.</em></li>



<li><em>PayPal pioneers major stablecoin issuance, enabling secure transfers amidst scam attempts.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In the wake of PayPal&#8217;s recent debut of its dollar-pegged PYUSD stablecoin, fraudulent actors are attempting to take advantage of the situation by circulating counterfeit tokens across various networks.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-424.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-424-1024x683.png" alt="Over 60 Fake PayPal Stablecoins Trading On Blockchains" class="wp-image-208991" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-424-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-424-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-424-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-424-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-424-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-424.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Over 60 Fake PayPal Stablecoins Trading On Blockchains 5"></a></figure></div>


<p>The influx of opportunists, speculators, and potential scammers has given rise to a surge in look-alike tokens, each sporting the &#8220;PYUSD&#8221; ticker.</p>



<p>Decentralized exchange scanner DEX Screener has identified more than 60 newly spawned token pairs under the &#8220;PYUSD&#8221; label since the announcement. </p>



<p>These counterfeit tokens have proliferated on diverse blockchain networks such as BNB Smart Chain, Ethereum, and Coinbase&#8217;s latest layer 2 platform, Base.</p>



<p>It is imperative to note that the authentic <a href="https://coincu.com/208927-paypal-stablecoin-pyusd-may-freeze-by-paxos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PYUSD</a> was <a href="https://coincu.com/208865-paypals-pyusd-connected-to-ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced</a> in November 2022, with its legitimacy verifiable via the designated contract address. </p>



<p>PayPal&#8217;s stipulation that PYUSD can only be transacted between verified <a href="https://coincu.com/208826-paypal-pyusd-new-stablecoin-u-s-dollar-deposits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PayPal</a> and compatible wallets underscores the improbability of any similarly titled tokens on decentralized exchanges like UniSwap being genuine.</p>



<p>The most prominent imitation, a PYUSD token minted on Ethereum, has amassed an astonishing $2.9 million in trading volume merely a day following the PYUSD revelation.</p>

<p>New York-based financial giant PayPal disclosed its forthcoming plan to introduce the PYUSD stablecoin, becoming the first major financial institution to launch its own stablecoin. </p>



<p>The token will facilitate seamless transfers between PayPal accounts and supported external digital wallets, enabling token usage for payments and conversion with its backed cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>While anticipation for the authentic tokens remains, scammers have already initiated their schemes. Their ploy involves minting tokens named &#8220;PYUSD,&#8221; infusing liquidity with ether or alternative tokens, and marketing them to decentralized exchange users.</p>



<p>As users await legitimate PYUSD tokens, heightened vigilance against scams is imperative in this evolving landscape.</p>

<p>Kraken, known for its high trading volume, <a href="https://blog.kraken.com/product/asset-listings/brick-and-moon-trading-starts-today-on-spot-and-futures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incorporated</a> support for these tokens on August 7, igniting a positive response in the market.</p>



<p>The announcement by Kraken stated that users can now engage in trading the two <a href="https://coincu.com/203618-reddit-community-tokens-skyrocket-over-300-in-just-two-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit-based cryptocurrencies</a> on its platform, encompassing both spot and futures markets. Trading can be conducted through USD and EUR trading pairs and on Kraken Pro. </p>



<p>Furthermore, the inclusion of trading on the Kraken App and the Instant Buy feature is on the horizon, contingent upon market entry and platform liquidity.</p>



<p>Notably, these tokens can be deposited solely through Arbitrum Nova, which predominantly hosts them. While trading commencement specifics remain unclear, users could initiate deposits immediately after the announcement.</p>



<p>Moons and Bricks are integral components of Reddit&#8217;s Community Points initiative, which rewards users for generating high-quality content. Moons are associated with r/CryptoCurrency, catering to a user base exceeding 6.5 million, while Bricks are linked to the gaming subreddit r/FortniteBR.</p>



<p>In the past 24 hours, MOON <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/moon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">experienced</a> a remarkable 45% surge. Similarly, BRICK <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bricks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">observed</a> an impressive 88% increase in the same timeframe.</p>



<p>The move by Kraken to list MOON and BRICK comes after subtle indications by the exchange&#8217;s support team, sparking anticipation within the <a href="https://coincu.com/194304-reddit-crypto-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit community</a>. </p>



<p>Following the back-and-forth, which boosted MOON holders&#8217; expectations for acceptance, the cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com <a href="https://coincu.com/203781-crypto-com-integrates-reddits-moons-token/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jumped</a> in and decided to support the token a few days later.</p>

<p>According to th<a href="https://www.hankyung.com/finance/article/202308083745B" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.hankyung.com/finance/article/202308083745B" rel="noreferrer noopener">e Korea Economic Daily</a>, the CEO allegedly orchestrated the embezzlement of a staggering 10 billion won (approximately US$7.6 million) in deposits and investment funds, sending shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community.</p>



<p>The charges stem from a web of alleged misdeeds. The CEO stands accused of manipulating computer systems to artificially inflate the prices and trading volumes of virtual assets from January 2019 to May 2021. This maneuver is said to have been designed to mask mounting losses when faced with investor withdrawal demands that couldn&#8217;t be met.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-422.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="427" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-422.png" alt="Bitsonic CEO Arrested For Alleged 10 Billion Won Asset Theft" class="wp-image-208979" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-422.png 640w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-422-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" title="Bitsonic CEO Arrested For Alleged 10 Billion Won Asset Theft 9"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Prosecutors further allege that in an attempt to hide the truth about the precarious financial situation, the CEO resorted to transferring both cash and virtual assets worth 10 billion won. This transfer was reportedly facilitated by selling crypto-locked products to unsuspecting customers, compounding the web of deceit.</p>



<p>Additionally, the CEO is charged with obstructing his official duties while holding the position of vice president of technology at Bitsonic, leading to an intensification of the legal troubles he now faces.</p>



<p>The Bitsonic CEO&#8217;s trial will undoubtedly be closely watched by both the cryptocurrency community and regulatory bodies alike. The outcome of this case will likely have far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency industry&#8217;s credibility and the measures implemented to curb fraudulent practices.</p>

<p>The decision, if executed, would render the company&#8217;s operations management systems and customer service inaccessible, potentially impacting its user base significantly.</p>

South Korean crypto-finance company revealed that a range of fees, crucial for the company&#8217;s continued operation, require pre-approval from the court. These fees encompass network hosting, labor costs, and other essential expenses. Despite filing for permission to pay these fees, the court&#8217;s final approval remains pending, leaving Delio in a precarious position.</p>

<p>The critical deadline of August 11 has been marked as the potential turning point for South Korean crypto-finance company&#8217;s web hosting service. Failure to settle the outstanding service fee by this date could result in a suspension of the service, further plunging the company into operational uncertainty. </p>



<p>Delio finds itself under the scrutiny of the Korean virtual property crime joint investigation team. Allegations of cryptocurrency fraud involving Delio, Haru Invest, and WeMade have prompted an investigation, casting a cloud of suspicion over the companies&#8217; activities. This development adds a layer of complexity to Delio&#8217;s ongoing challenges, potentially influencing the course of its future.</p>

<p>Linghui Kong, the CEO of Bitdeer, shared that around 15,000 new mining machines were delivered to their Gedu data center in Bhutan in July.</p>

<li><em>Sun Yuchen&#8217;s role in the transaction raises eyebrows.</em></li>

<p>The transaction occurred a mere 45 minutes ago and has stirred intrigue due to its magnitude and the entities involved.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Justin just yoinked $200M USDT out of JustLend (the USDT he has taken from Huobi) back to his personal wallet, and then transferred to a new address…<br><br>Feeling some heat your excellency? <a href="https://t.co/khywV9Qxn7" target="_blank">https://t.co/khywV9Qxn7</a></p>&mdash; Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1688733773938995201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August 8, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Adam Cochran, a respected partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, has cast a spotlight on the situation by identifying the enigmatic recipient of the transfer. Cochran stated that the recipient address was allegedly linked to none other than Sun Yuchen, a prominent figure in the blockchain space and the founder of TRON.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-413.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="982" height="632" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-413.png" alt="JustLendDAO&#039;s 200M Transfer Raises Justin Sun Connection" class="wp-image-208943" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-413.png 982w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-413-300x193.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-413-768x494.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-413-750x483.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 982px) 100vw, 982px" title="JustLendDAO&#039;s 200M Transfer Raises Justin Sun Connection 18"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>What adds to the intrigue is that after the initial transfer to Sun Yuchen&#8217;s purported personal wallet, another transfer of 200 million USDT swiftly followed, this time to an entirely new address. This sequence of transactions has fueled conjecture about the motives behind such a substantial and swift movement of funds.</p>



<p>Analysts and industry insiders are buzzing with theories about the significance of this transfer and its potential implications for JustLendDAO, TRON, and the broader cryptocurrency landscape. The identity of the new address remains shrouded in mystery, prompting heightened curiosity among enthusiasts and investors alike.</p>
