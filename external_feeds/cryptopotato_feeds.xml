			            <description><![CDATA[Ripple is this week's market frontrunner. Here are a couple of possible reasons why. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple (XRP) is this week&#8217;s frontrunner as the rest of the market continues to either consolidate or trade in a ruthless chop. The cryptocurrency has defied expectations and is trending upwards with little signs of slowing down.</p>
<p>Here are a few possible reasons why and whether this rally could go any further.</p>
<h2>Case Against SEC Tilts in Ripple&#8217;s Favor</h2>
<p>It seems that the major reason for the increase in XRP&#8217;s price is that investors seem to be leaning bullish on Ripple winning the case against the US Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Recall that the SEC filed a lawsuit alleging that Ripple conducted an unregistered sale of securities, essentially claiming that XRP is a security.</p>
<p>This week, Judge Analisa Torres <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-vs-sec-judge-denies-the-sealing-of-hinmans-speech-once-again/" data-wpel-link="internal">denied</a> the Commission&#8217;s request to seal documents pertaining to a speech by Bill Hinman &#8211; the director of the agency&#8217;s corporate finance division. This is the third time this specific request has been denied, so the question is &#8211; why is it so important for the SEC to seal these records? Well, it&#8217;s pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>William Hinman is a former director of the SEC&#8217;s Division of Corporation Finance. The speech in question refers to when he indicated that the agency didn&#8217;t consider ETH security at the time, and Ripple layers have fought to find out more about how he came to that conclusion. They hope it could impact XRP&#8217;s own classification.</p>
<p>Judge Torres says the documents should be accessible based on the common law principle of public access to judicial documents:</p>
<blockquote><p>Documents are considered &#8220;judicial documents&#8221; if they are &#8220;relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process. [&#8230;] The relevance of a specific document does not depend on which way the court ultimately rules or whether the document ultimately in fact influences the court’s decision. Rather, what is important is whether a document “would reasonably have the tendency to influence a district court’s ruling on a motion.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>$250M Metaco Deal Finalized</h2>
<p>Another positive development for Ripple, and thereby &#8211; XRP, is that the company <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-xrp-enters-a-250-million-deal-to-acquire-metaco/" data-wpel-link="internal">entered</a> into a $250 million deal to acquire Metaco. The latter is a cryptocurrency custody provider based in Switzerland.</p>
<p>The deal aims to expand Ripple&#8217;s position in the world of crypto by also expanding its services toward crypto custody.</p>
<p>Speaking on the deal, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Metaco is a proven leader in institutional digital asset custody with an exceptional executive bench and a truly unmatched customer track record. Through the strength of our balance sheet and financial position, Ripple will continue pressing our advantage in the areas critical to crypto infrastructure. Bringing on Metaco is monumental for our growing product suite and expanding global footprint.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The above can finally explain XRP&#8217;s price surge in the past few days, but the question is &#8211; will it continue? This is a question that only time can answer, but if the positive developments surrounding the case against the SEC continue, then this might also have a somewhat positive impact on the price. After all, crypto is known for being news-driven, where announcements, be it good or bad, tend to influence the price.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, we take a closer look at Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Optimism, and Pepe.</p>
<h2>Ethereum (ETH)</h2>
<p>The market leaders turned flat this past week, and ETH booked a modest 2.6% price increase. The volatility has remained low, and the price continues to sit below the key resistance at $1,820.</p>
<p>The PA and momentum indicators show indecision from market participants. With decreasing volume, both bulls and bears seem absent from the market. There is no conviction on either side, and the price failed to move in a decisive manner. The current support is $1,660.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, it seems that this consolidation under the key resistance could continue. It seems unlikely that sellers will attempt to test the key support level since the market is waiting for a trigger to bring back volatility.</p>
<figure id="attachment_251355" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-251355" style="width: 1813px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-19_16-18-43.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-251355" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-19_16-18-43.png" alt="ETHUSD_2023-05-19_16-18-43" width="1813" height="861" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-19_16-18-43.png 1813w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-19_16-18-43-300x142.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-19_16-18-43-1024x486.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-19_16-18-43-768x365.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-19_16-18-43-1536x729.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-19_16-18-43-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1813px) 100vw, 1813px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-251355" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Ripple (XRP)</h2>
<p>XRP rallied by 8.5% in the past week, and the price has now arrived at the 47 cents resistance. This impressive rally is atypical, considering that ETH and BTC failed to rally this week.</p>
<p>Thanks to this renewed interest from buyers, the momentum indicators for this cryptocurrency have turned bullish. With decent volume on the way up and five consecutive daily candles closing in green, bulls dominate at this time.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, sellers may make a stand at the key resistance and stop this uptrend, at least for a while. If a pullback happens, then XRP has good support at 44 cents which could be tested before the next leg up.</p>
<figure id="attachment_251354" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-251354" style="width: 1813px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-19.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-251354" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-19.png" alt="XRPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-19" width="1813" height="803" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-19.png 1813w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-19-300x133.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-19-1024x454.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-19-768x340.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-19-1536x680.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-19-50x22.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1813px) 100vw, 1813px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-251354" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Cardano (ADA)</h2>
<p>This past week, ADA failed to break above the key resistance at 38 cents but still managed to book a modest 2.8% price increase. At the time of this post, the price appears to be compressing between 36 and 38 cents, and a decisive move could happen soon.</p>
<p>The most significant level of support is found at 34 cents. It is unlikely for this level to be tested, considering that buyers appeared eager to buy this cryptocurrency whenever it had a pullback. Despite this, bulls were unable to break the key resistance to date.</p>
<p><span style="color: #2b2b2b;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead</span></span>, Cardano could be positioning for a major breakout similar to XRP, which could see the 38 cents resistance quickly falls but it remains to be seen if this would be the case.</p>
<figure id="attachment_251353" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-251353" style="width: 1813px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-44.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-251353" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-44.png" alt="ADAUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-44" width="1813" height="803" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-44.png 1813w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-44-300x133.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-44-1024x454.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-44-768x340.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-44-1536x680.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ADAUSDT_2023-05-19_16-19-44-50x22.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1813px) 100vw, 1813px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-251353" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Optimism (OP)</span></p>
<p>Optimism had a volatile week and managed to book a price increase of almost 10%, which took it to the key resistance at $1.8. This performance came after bulls found good support at $1.6.</p>
<p>Since touching the key resistance, the price has entered into a pullback. This could see OP retest the key support if buyers are not eager to return soon. Nevertheless, this price action has put a stop to a major downtrend that started in April.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Optimism seems well-positioned to attempt a breakout above $1.8 and seek a higher valuation. If successful, then the next major target will be found at $2, which is also a key psychological level.</p>
<figure id="attachment_251352" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-251352" style="width: 1813px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-22-06.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-251352" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-22-06.png" alt="OPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-22-06" width="1813" height="861" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-22-06.png 1813w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-22-06-300x142.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-22-06-1024x486.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-22-06-768x365.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-22-06-1536x729.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OPUSDT_2023-05-19_16-22-06-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1813px) 100vw, 1813px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-251352" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Pepe (PEPE) </span></p>
<p>After finding good support at $0.0000011, PEPE managed to rally hard in a short amount of time and booked a 24% price increase compared to last Friday. However, the price is now correcting, and buyers are showing a lack of interest.</p>
<p>The momentum on the 4-hour timeframe appears bearish at the time of this post, with the MACD having completed a bearish cross. This indicates that the price may continue to fall in the short term until buyers return.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, PEPE continues to draw a lot of volatility not seen in many altcoins. This attracts traders that are likely to become active whenever the price reaches a critical level, like the key support. The current resistance is at $0.0000018.</p>
<figure id="attachment_251351" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-251351" style="width: 1813px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PEPEWETH_A43FE1_ETHUSDT_2023-05-19_16-23-12.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-251351" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PEPEWETH_A43FE1_ETHUSDT_2023-05-19_16-23-12.png" alt="PEPEWETH_A43FE1_ETHUSDT_2023-05-19_16-23-12" width="1813" height="861" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PEPEWETH_A43FE1_ETHUSDT_2023-05-19_16-23-12.png 1813w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PEPEWETH_A43FE1_ETHUSDT_2023-05-19_16-23-12-300x142.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PEPEWETH_A43FE1_ETHUSDT_2023-05-19_16-23-12-1024x486.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PEPEWETH_A43FE1_ETHUSDT_2023-05-19_16-23-12-768x365.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PEPEWETH_A43FE1_ETHUSDT_2023-05-19_16-23-12-1536x729.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PEPEWETH_A43FE1_ETHUSDT_2023-05-19_16-23-12-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1813px) 100vw, 1813px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-251351" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>

My Financial Friend, who boasts over 236,000 subscribers on YouTube, recently released a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp9j_aKKfAU&amp;ab_channel=MyFinancialFriend" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> video</a> speculating that AiDoge could be &#8220;the new king of meme coins.&#8221;</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[OpenAI also provided more details concerning Android users. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American artificial intelligence research laboratory OpenAI announced the launch of an iOS app for ChatGPT. Similar to the original web model of the chatbot that was released around six months ago, the app is also a free-to-use version that is built on GPT-3.5.</p>
<p>The existing subscribers of ChatGPT Plus will be able to have exclusive access to GPT-4&#8217;s capabilities, early access to features as well faster response times on iOS.</p>
<h2>ChatGPT on App Store</h2>
<p>OpenAI revealed in a <a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-the-chatgpt-app-for-ios" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">blog post</a> that the new mobile app will sync the user history of chats with its bot across devices. It also features voice input, supported by the company&#8217;s open-source speech recognition model Whisper.</p>
<p>At the launch, the app will be available only in the US and will expand to other countries &#8220;in the coming weeks.&#8221; Next up in its roadmap for OpenAI is Android device expansion.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With the ChatGPT app for iOS, we’re taking another step towards our mission by transforming state-of-the-art research into useful tools that empower people, while continuously making them more accessible.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Although the company failed to provide a precise date, it said Android users will be next in line.</p>
<h2>Rise to Prominence</h2>
<p>While OpenAI did not hint at a new mobile incarnation, the move is not surprising since ChatGPT&#8217;s popularity has skyrocketed in a very short span of time. The popular artificial intelligence chatbot <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/02/chatgpt-100-million-users-open-ai-fastest-growing-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">attracted</a> 100 million users just two months after launching. In January, it had nearly 590 million visits.</p>
<p>OpenAI, which is a private company backed by Microsoft, made it available to the public for free last November, just 5 days after which ChatGPT acquired a million users. To put things into perspective, it took Instagram nearly 2.5 months to reach a million downloads. Whereas popular streaming service Netflix had to wait more than 3 years to reach one million users.</p>
<p>Recently, ChatGPT also <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/chatgpt-predicts-8-things-that-will-happen-to-crypto-by-2033/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">came up</a> with several scenarios on what could happen in the digital asset space within the next decade.</p>
<p>The roaring success of ChatGPT has ignited a frantic rush to release new AI products to market. This hysteria has consumed some of the biggest tech behemoths and startups as they fight for space in the burgeoning sector.</p>
<p>Google, for one, is working on its own AI chatbot, Bard, which has so far failed to woo investors after giving an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">incorrect</a> answer in a promotional video. Chinese tech giant Baidu has also doubled down on plans to integrate its AI chatbot Ernie into its search engine services this year.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[XRP is the only larger-cap alt in the green today. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin dropped by over a grand in the past 24 hours and registered its lowest price tag in about a week earlier today.</p>
<p>The altcoins are also slightly in the red now, with LDO dumping the most (over 6%).</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Slips Under $27K</h2>
<p>Last week&#8217;s unfavorable market conditions culminated on Friday when BTC slumped to a two-month low at $25,800. However, the asset bounced off during the weekend, and spent most of it at around $27,000.</p>
<p>Monday began on a more positive note as BTC jumped to $27,600. However, it failed there and quickly lost all daily gains. Another <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-pushes-past-27k-render-rndr-explodes-20-daily-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">leg up came</a> on Wednesday, but the bears intercepted the move once again, and BTC was unable to challenge $27,500.</p>
<p>The subsequent rejection was a lot more violent than the previous one. It took bitcoin south by a grand, and it plummeted to a weekly low of $26,400. Despite regaining several hundred dollars since then, bitcoin still trades under $27,000 as it&#8217;s 2% down on the day.</p>
<p>As a result, its market capitalization has slumped back down to $520 billion, while its dominance over the altcoins sits tight at 46.3%.</p>

Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>XRP Defies Market Sentiment</h2>
<p>Most of the altcoins have also followed suit with minor daily declines. Ethereum, for one, has retraced by around 1% and is close to breaking below $1,800 once again. Binance Coin is back below $310 after a similar daily decline.</p>
<p>Cardano, Solana, Litecoin, Polkadot, Shiba Inu, and Avalanche have produced drops of around 1-2%. More daily losses come from the likes of Chainlink, ATOM, and TONCOIN &#8211; all of which are down by around 3%.</p>
<p>Lido DAO&#8217;s native token has dropped the most from the larger-cap alts with a 6% nosedive. Yet, LDO still trades above $2.1.</p>
<p>Ripple is the only top 10 alt with a minor daily increase. XRP, perhaps fueled by the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-vs-sec-judge-denies-the-sealing-of-hinmans-speech-once-again/" data-wpel-link="internal">positive developments</a> around the blockchain company&#8217;s legal case against the SEC, is up by around 3% and trades above $0.45.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[America’s largest crypto exchange is trying to increase its customer base with the lure of zero-fee trading but all is not what it seems.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On May 18, the company announced upgrades to Coinbase One, a membership account that offers zero trading fees, boosted staking rewards, and priority support.</p>
<p>However, the catch is that users will have to stump up $30 a month for the privilege.</p>
<p>Coinbase has often been criticized for having some of the highest trading fees in the industry. It makes the lion’s share of its <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-posts-79m-net-loss-but-beats-expectations/" data-wpel-link="internal">profits</a> from these often extortionate fees, so the model obviously works.</p>
<p>Paying a monthly fee to eliminate these fees would only be of benefit to whales and heavy traders. Furthermore, those that do trade a lot are unlikely to trade on Coinbase and would favor a decentralized exchange (DEX) where the fees are a fraction.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">2/ The best of Coinbase just got <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />better<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Unlock zero trading fees, a dedicated support team, boosted staking rewards, and exclusive benefits from partners with Coinbase One — all for $29.99/month.</p>

<h2>Coinbase One Catches</h2>
<p>Coinbase is offering a 30-day free trial for its new service, which includes priority support. Aside from its hefty fees, the firm has also been heavily criticized for its lack of customer support.</p>
<p>It appears that Coinbase <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-decentralization-claim-draws-fury-from-its-customers/" data-wpel-link="internal">customers</a> now have to pay to get a timely response through support channels. Members will also be able to receive support with crypto tax filing, it <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/new-updates-to-coinbase-one-zero-trading-fees-boosted-staking-rewards-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">added</a>.</p>
<p>The firm stated it was expanding access to Coinbase One in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Ireland in addition to the United States.</p>
<p>Moreover, the firm is offering perks with partners, including Messari, CoinTracker, and Lemonade.</p>
<p>Coinbase already offers premium accounts and stated that the zero trading fee offer does not apply to Advanced Trade, Coinbase Pro, or Coinbase Prime.</p>
<p>The crypto community&#8217;s reaction was mixed with a fair bit of skepticism over the service. “Nebraskangooner” said to his 300,000 followers:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Your support team told me to cancel my membership because the zero trading fees is misleading and only for up to $10,000 worth of trading a month and you still take advantage of people with slippage on basic trading anyway.”</p></blockquote>
<p>COIN shares slipped 1.28% on the day in a fall to $60.35 in after-hours trading.</p>
<h2>Crypto Market Outlook</h2>
<p>Crypto markets dropped 1.5% on the day, with total capitalization falling to $1.16 trillion.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a> lost 2% in a fall to $26,782, while <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum</a> dipped 1.3% to just below $1,800 at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Markets have remained sideways for the past couple of months and are still cooling from their mid-April high for the year.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Followinng today's transaction, Ripple will become the sole shareholder of Metaco.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple announced the acquisition of Swiss-based crypto custody provider Metaco, marking the blockchain firm&#8217;s expansion across the growing institutional crypto custody market.</p>
<p>The deal, worth $250 million, surfaces as Ripple continues to defend against the long-drawn lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<h2>Ripple Acquires Metaco</h2>
<p>Ripple is expected to ramp up its enterprise offerings providing customers the technology to custody, issue, and settle any type of tokenized asset. At the heart of the deal, the two companies look to tap the growing institutional crypto custody market, which is forecasted to reach $10 trillion by 2030.</p>
<p>Metaco, on the other hand, will be able to leverage the San Francisco-based company&#8217;s established base of hundreds of customers and capital to address new demand and resources for its banking and institutional clients.</p>
<p>According to the official press <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230514005055/en/Leading-Enterprise-Crypto-Company-Ripple-Acquires-Custody-Provider-Metaco-for-250M" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">release</a>, Metaco will continue to operate as an independent brand and business unit, while its founder and CEO, Adrien Treccani, will lead its operations.</p>
<p>Commenting on the development, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Metaco is a proven leader in institutional digital asset custody with an exceptional executive bench and a truly unmatched customer track record. Through the strength of our balance sheet and financial position, Ripple will continue pressing our advantage in the areas critical to crypto infrastructure. Bringing on Metaco is monumental for our growing product suite and expanding global footprint.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Reports also suggest that Ripple <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/17/ripple-buys-swiss-startup-metaco-as-sec-lawsuit-conclusion-looms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">invested</a> $250 million of cash off its own balance sheet to fund the acquisition, despite challenging market conditions as a result of higher interest rates and tighter funding conditions to mass layoffs and falling company valuations.</p>
<p>In a call to CNBC, Garlinghouse said the deal would help Ripple increase its presence overseas at a time when the SEC is taking stringent actions against major players in the digital asset industry.</p>
<h2>Ripple Vs. SEC: Another Breakthrough</h2>
<p>The lawsuit contested by Ripple has been dragging on for years. But in a significant development, a federal judge <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-vs-sec-judge-denies-the-sealing-of-hinmans-speech-once-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">ruled</a> that the SEC cannot seal documents connected to former official William Hinman&#8217;s 2018 speech on crypto and securities.</p>
<p>The documents in question consist of drafts and emails that indicated the agency did not consider Ether a security at the time. The lawyers representing Ripple have been fighting to learn more about how Hinman came to the conclusion a claim could impact XRP&#8217;s own classification.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[FTX is accusing its former management team of conducting no due diligence before acquiring Embed.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bankrupt cryptocurrency entities FTX, FTX.US, and Alameda Research have filed a lawsuit against former executives Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), Nishad Singh, and Gary Wang for lavishly spending FTX Group’s assets on the acquisition of stock clearing firm Embed Financial Technologies.</p>
<p>The move is the first formal action from FTX CEO John Ray against the company’s former management. The lawsuit, <a href="https://t.co/U4nXh9qhVu" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">filed</a> in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, seeks to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-attempts-3-9-billion-clawback-from-genesis/" data-wpel-link="internal">claw back</a> the funds spent during the acquisition.</p>
<h2>FTX Sues SBF and His Inner Circle</h2>
<p>According to the court document, the plaintiffs accused the former management of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-us-discovers-another-90-million-missing/" data-wpel-link="internal">taking advantage</a> of FTX Group’s lack of controls and recordkeeping to inflate the valuation of Embed and deliberately purchasing the platform for more than it was worth.</p>
<p>The defendants, addressed as FTX Insiders, performed little to no due diligence on Embed, as they prioritized speed above everything else in the transaction. They accepted all the terms proposed during the negotiation by Michael Giles, Embed’s founder and CEO, who was also the sole representative.</p>
<p>Giles walked away from the deal with roughly $157 million and an “extravagant and unwarranted retention bonus” as an incentive to quickly complete the sale.</p>
<p>FTX began the acquisition negotiation with Giles at the end of March 2022. By mid-April of the same year, the parties had signed the “Memorandum of Terms,” which ascribed a $220 million enterprise value to Embed with a $75 million retention bonus to the platform’s employees, including $55 million to Giles.</p>
<p>However, when the deal was finalized in September – a few weeks before FTX Group went bankrupt – the FTX Insiders spent more than $248 million to acquire Embed. The plaintiffs allege that while the deal took about six months, the essential terms were negotiated and agreed upon within two weeks.</p>
<h2>FTX Seeks to Recover $250M</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the plaintiffs accused SBF, Singh, and Wang of causing the bankrupt entity to issue Simple Agreements for Future Equity (SAFEs), which could be converted into common stock in the event of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.</p>
<p>Through his lawyers, Ray <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/john-ray-says-reviving-ftx-is-on-the-table-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">seeks</a> to revoke the SAFEs and recover the funds spent during the acquisition of Embed. The plaintiffs have also asked the court to order the defendants to bear the legal costs of the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the plaintiffs also <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTUwNDgyOQ==&amp;id2=-1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">filed</a> an adversary lawsuit against Giles, the employees, and former equity holders of Embed. Some former equity holders include Silicon Valley venture capital firms like Y Combinator, Bain Capital Ventures, and 9Yards.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Lido Finance currently owns 31% of total Ether staked. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lido Finance &#8211; which is the largest liquid staking protocol on Ethereum &#8211; upgraded to version 2 earlier this week. The move essentially enabled liquid staking users, meaning, the holders of staked ether (stETH), to withdraw stETH to ETH from Lido at a 1:1 ratio.</p>
<p>The latest data suggest that only 0.42% of the withdrawals have been processed so far.</p>
<h2>Aftermath of V2 Upgrade</h2>
<p>According to Switzerland-based 21Shares&#8217; <a href="https://twitter.com/21Shares/status/1659118810111287297" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">estimates</a>, Lido Finance currently owns 31% of the total ETH staked. There are around 6.7 million stETH in supply. Of which, 448.04k stETH has been sent to Lido for request withdrawals.</p>
<p>Celsius Network, the insolvent CeFi lender, accounts for the vast majority with approximately 448.04 stETH in withdrawal requests, as per on-chain analytics provider, Dune.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lido has 470k ETH Buffer for handling the withdrawals which come from execution layer reward (Priority Fees/MEV), partial withdrawals, as well as daily ETH deposits from new stakers through the staking platform. With only 0.42% of the withdrawals processed so far, the analysis by 21Shares noted that Lido may not require to exit any validator from the network to honor all the withdrawals.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With the current amount of $stETH requested to withdraw, Lido will not need to exit any validator from the network to honor all the withdrawals and still have 20k $ETH left as a buffer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Lido Finance Activating Withdrawals</h2>
<p>Lido Finance, which has over $12.41 billion in total value locked (TVL), <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/lido-launches-v2-and-releases-staked-ethereum-for-withdrawals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">deployed</a> its v2 iteration on May 15th. This move was made through an on-chain vote, with the community members deliberating over the proposal.</p>
<p>The upgrade, which includes reduced gas fees and enhanced security measures, comes a month after the Shapella hard fork that allowed staking validators to withdraw Ether. Lido&#8217;s V2 underwent nine total audits from several firms, such as Statemind and MixBytes.</p>
<p><span style="color: #2b2b2b; font-size: 16px;">Celsius, on the other hand, </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptopotato.com/bankrupt-crypto-lender-celsius-moved-nearly-900m-of-eth-within-a-week-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">unstaked</a><span style="color: #2b2b2b; font-size: 16px;"> the $779 million of ETH it had with the liquid staking derivatives protocol. </span><span style="color: #2b2b2b; font-size: 16px;">The fund movement by the beleaguered crypto lender was speculated to be used as part of its restructuring and creditor repayment efforts.</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[PEPE coin mania is fueling intense rallies across the altcoin landscape in May. SNX is soaring Thursday after a proposal to add support for PEPE to the Synthetix blockchain.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Synthetix (SNX) is trading 10% up over the 24-hour period. The recent spike in price comes amid a new proposal.</p>
<ul>
<li>SNX bulls likely have PEPE madness to thank for the market bump. The classic meme frog cryptocurrency <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/pepe-but-on-solana-and-other-web-3-0-frogs-got-a-bump-on-pepe-coin-mania/" data-wpel-link="internal">is adding</a> value to every market it touches. Volumes surged 150% in the wake of Synthetix Improvement Proposal (SIP) 2014. That would add PEPE coin markets to the L2 blockchain.</li>
<li>Synthetix is a decentralized exchange for trading &#8220;synthetic&#8221; crypto assets. It operates in the blockchain ecosystem as both a Layer-2 scaling solution and DEX.</li>
<li>The project was launched in Sept 2017 by Kain Warwick. Synthetix lives on the Ethereum and Optimism mainnets.</li>
<li>SNX <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/reasons-why-synthetix-snx-skyrocketed-by-over-100/" data-wpel-link="internal">skyrocketed</a> last year when the network introduced atomic swaps.</li>
<li>This week, the crypto got a big price bump out of a proposal to add eight new markets. Among them, most notably, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/defi-token-synthetix-soars-10-100310269.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">was this</a> year&#8217;s memecoin darling, PEPE coin:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Synthetix Improvement Proposal (SIP) 2014 and 2015, if passed, would open eight new markets for synthetic versions of several notable cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The most notable market is likely the community’s interest in integrating the mega-popular meme coin Pepecoin (PEPE).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>SIP 2014 would open trading for PEPE, SUI, and BLUR. SIP 2015 would add XRP, DOT, TRX, FLOKI, and INJ. The proposals <a href="https://twitter.com/synthetix_io/status/1658127407906447360" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">were currently</a> up for voting this week.</li>
