<p>While there has not been much time since the crypto market's peak, prices are miles down, and investor behavior has begun to shift. During the bull run, investors were willing to throw money at any crypto project and its dog. The competition was fierce regarding who could accumulate the most cryptocurrencies, earn huge returns, and invest in new projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investors got burned in every corner of the industry&mdash;-savings in protocols like Celsius evaporated, holdings that were supposed to be safe on FTX got stuck or disappeared, not likely to be redeemed, and the list goes on. Meanwhile, HODLers are largely underwater, holding on to losses.</p>
<p>What surfaces now are alternative ways for investors to expose themselves to the benefits and tremendous potential of Web3 without taking on the excessive volatility inherent in much of the industry.</p>
<p>One such project is ShelterZoom, a leading blockchain-based, smart-document SaaS provider. While the crypto economy collapsed, ShelterZoom inked a significant partnership with an Argentinian hospital to tokenize medical records.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the first time, patients can share their medical data with other doctors safely and easily and hear second or third opinions whenever they want. It will also prevent bureaucratic delays and mistakes, which are crucial in healthcare.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finding Web3 projects and companies with real products and maturity to commercialize is a challenging but rewarding way of trying to catch the upside of this budding technology.</p>
<p>Investing in a Startup might be complex, which is why many investors still try to accumulate tokens available on major exchanges. But even in the token ecosystem, new examples are popping up with value propositions.</p>
<p>Illumishare has unveiled a token backed by three uncorrelated assets, including gold, stored in a safe room at a bank in Abu-Dhabi and broadcast live 24/7. The idea is that backing the token with a diversified set of uncorrelated assets can prevent volatile downward swings&mdash;but still offer unlimited upside. Even though uncorrelated assets support its SRG token, it's not a stablecoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another project with a robust Web3 selling proposition is VAIOT. The first company to be regulated by the Maltese VFA Act in 2020, VAIOT is building AI-powered intelligent virtual assistants to digitize major industries. .&nbsp;</p>
<p>The value of the regulation proved itself over time, in stark contrast to companies that either aren&rsquo;t regulated or very loosely regulated. Early in 2022, the company suffered a hack. As VAIOT is legally required to maintain the highest operational standards of the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), every investor was reimbursed in full.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This episode shows a real-life example of a company that works based on a professional business plan reviewed and approved by the regulator, which creates a layer of protection for the token holders. The VAIOT token is available on Gate.io and KuCoin.</p>
