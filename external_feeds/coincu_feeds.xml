<p>This is Binance&#8217;s latest move towards the troubled Multichain cross-chain bridge. Previously, Binance had temporarily <a href="https://coincu.com/189765-binance-10-bridge-token-multichain-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suspended</a> the top-up of tokens via the project-linked bridge the day after this incident. Deposits for pairs POLS-BSC, ACH-BSC, BIFI-FTM, SUPER-BSC, AVA-ETH, SPELL-AVAXC, ALPACA-FTM, FTM-ETH, FARM-BSC and DEXE-BSC have been affected by This situation.</p>



<p>The event started on May 24, the Twitter social network stirred up information that the authorities had arrested the Multichain team in China. At the same time, many on-chain signs indicate<a href="https://coincu.com/189798-9-7-million-ftms-binance-multichain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> suspicious movements </a>related to the MULTI token.</p>

<p>Multichain has confirmed that some of the project&#8217;s cross-chain remittance gateways are not working due to &#8220;force majeure reasons, &#8221; with unknown recovery time.</p>



<p>Multichain pledged to compensate affected users fully but did not disclose any further information on the compensation plan.</p>



<p>Data tracking site Lookonchain has detected moves to transfer large amounts of MULTI tokens to the Gate exchange. This increasingly worries the users of this bridge.</p>



<p>According to the update, some cross-chain bridges of the Multichain protocol have been restored and are now operational as of June 5. Tung Dinh, Vice President of Multichain, confirmed the restoration of the Multichain router2 router, showing that the core component of the bridge is back to normal. There is also speculation about the condition of Multichain&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, Zhao Jun, that he may have been released from prison.</p>

<p>Among other advantages, the technology offers easy reconciliation by delivering consolidated merchant reports with itemized e-CNY transactions – the report is available through DBS IDEAL, the bank&#8217;s digital business banking platform.</p>



<p>DBS is a participant in <a href="https://coincu.com/197908-singapore-mas-proposes-digital-assets-framework/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Guardian</a>, an initiative created by the Singapore Monetary Authority to explore asset tokenization and decentralized financing (DeFi) for conventional banks.

<p>After its trial introduction in April 2020, e-CNY use in China has gradually increased. As of December 2022, there were about 13.6 billion e-CNY in circulation. The CBDC is now recognized in 26 Chinese cities and 17 provinces, with acceptance likely to increase as the program steadily spreads to other locations. According to official figures, e-CNY accounts for 0.13% of China&#8217;s central bank&#8217;s currency and reserves.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Investors sue Haru Invest, Delio, and B&#38;S for breaching the Capital Market Act.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Investors sue Haru Invest, Delio, and B&amp;S for breaching the Capital Market Act.</em></li>



<li><em>Loss to investors is estimated at up to $230 million, with recoverable assets expected to be less than half.</em></li>



<li><em>Delio and Haru Invest face low receivable collection rates, raising concerns about their operations and integrity.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Investors who committed their crypto to Haru Invest and Delio sued the firms&#8217; management for breaching the Capital Market Act. B&amp;S was also included in the lawsuit.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-272.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-272.png" alt="BREAKING: Haru Invest, Delio Caused Damage Up To $230 Million For Investors" class="wp-image-200207" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-272.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-272-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-272-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-272-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BREAKING: Haru Invest, Delio Caused Damage Up To $230 Million For Investors 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>Lawyer Lee Jeong-yeop of LKB &amp; Partners, a legal firm representing the victims, assessed the loss to Haru Invest and Delio at up to 300 billion won ($230 million) in an interview with <em><a href="https://www.blockmedia.co.kr/archives/329899" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Block Media</a></em> on June 5. Haru Investment is worth around 150 billion won, while Delio is worth approximately 100 billion won.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The amount of damage to investors who entrusted their assets to the two companies is expected to reach up to 300 billion won. It is estimated to be less than 50%,” Lee said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Less than half of the virtual assets controlled by the two organizations seem to be recoverable.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The amount invested by Haru Invest in B&amp;S is currently unknown. It seems to be at the level of several tens of billions of won,” Lee added.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Victims are undergoing separate rehabilitation processes for these corporations. Seo Dong-gi, a certified public accountant of Saeyeon Accounting Company and a business rehabilitation specialist, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The receivable collection rate in the case of Haru and Delio is remarkably low compared to other cases. In the case of a general financial institution, even a 20-30% loss is a huge loss. A loss of more than 50% can be a serious situation.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite having a VASP (Virtual Asset Service Provider) license, Delio did not handle client assets correctly. While Haru Invest is a firm founded abroad, legal processes may be followed in Korea. Haru Invest and Delio were both held in Korea. According to lawyer Lee:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“It is possible to sell the company even during the corporate rehabilitation process. The difference between a self-sale and a sale during rehabilitation is &#8216;who is better for it.&#8217; If you go through the rehabilitation process, a more powerful investigation than the prosecution&#8217;s investigation will take place.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It is known that some Delio victims believe that the rehabilitation procedure does not help them recover from their injuries.</p>

<p>The storm has recently been brewing in the Korean cryptocurrency sphere as the country&#8217;s leading crypto lending firm, <a href="https://coincu.com/198064-delio-resumes-deposits-and-withdrawals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delio</a>, comes under examination. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) of South Korea has allegedly <a href="https://coincu.com/199209-delio-under-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> an inquiry into the agency&#8217;s activities due to accusations of fraud, embezzlement, and breach of belief.</p>



<p>Prior to the suspension decision, Delio&#8217;s administration apparently denied having any knowledge of Haru Invest investments. In light of recent events, this denial raises further concerns about Delio&#8217;s activities and integrity. The FSC probe is anticipated to shed further light on this issue.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Flare token attackers have moved 56,200 BNB (worth $13.95 million) to Tornado Cash, raising concerns about the misuse of funds and the complexity of the attack.</em></li>



<li><em>The Flare token project on the BSC chain was previously flagged as an exit scam, resulting in a significant decline in the FLARE token&#8217;s price by over 95%.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a recent development, Flare token attackers have successfully transferred 56,200 BNB, equivalent to approximately $13.95 million, to Tornado Cash.</strong>&nbsp;</h5>

<p>The attackers initiated their actions back in November 2022 when they managed to extract a staggering 3.98 billion Flares from specific addresses starting with 0xf99c. Subsequently, they proceeded to exchange a portion of the stolen Flares, approximately 1 billion, for 16.9 million BSC-USD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, they converted 1.98 billion Flares into 32.7 million Futures, which were then swapped for 1.6 million BUSD. A small fraction of stablecoins were further exchanged for 2431.14 ETH, bridging the funds to both Ethereum (1939 ETH) and Avalanche chain (399.8 WETH) via cBridge and Multichain. The attackers attempted to obscure their activities by laundering the funds through mixers and centralized exchanges using a technique known as chain-hopping.</p>

<p>Previously, security companies had flagged the Flare token as an exit scam, with the scammers reportedly profiting around $18.5 million at the time. It is important to note that the Flare project on the BSC chain involved in the exit scam should not be confused with tokens or symbols bearing similar names. Consequently, the <a href="https://coincu.com/16877-flares-canary-network-songbird-is-officially-going-live-and-distributing-sgb-tokens/">FLARE</a> token&#8217;s price experienced a significant decline of over 95% following the incident.</p>



<p>The recent transfer of 56,200 BNB to Tornado Cash adds another layer of complexity to the Flare token attack, raising concerns about the potential misuse of the funds and the efforts taken by the attackers to obfuscate their activities. Authorities and security organizations continue to closely monitor the situation, seeking to mitigate any further harm caused by these fraudulent actions.</p>

<p>On July 5th, Metis announced via Twitter that it has taken snapshots of METIS holding addresses during two critical periods, namely the Poly Network attack and the initial sale of this token by the attacker. Importantly, any METIS purchases made on the identified address will not be recognized.</p>



<p>To ensure the security and integrity of <a href="https://coincu.com/164236-metis-with-banxa-simplify-crypto-adoption/">METIS</a> tokens, the platform advises users against interacting with the current token contract on the BNB Chain. Instead, the platform will deploy a new contract to address any vulnerabilities. This proactive measure aims to maintain the trust and confidence of the community.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A snapshot was taken of the BNBChain addresses holding METIS at the time of PolyNetwork’s exploit, and at the time of the exploiters first sale of exploited METIS.

</div></figure>



<p>Additionally,  the platform urges liquidity providers to withdraw all liquidity from Pancake Swap. By doing so, they can safeguard their assets and minimize potential risks associated with the ongoing situation. Ensuring the protection of user funds and maintaining a secure ecosystem are their top priorities.</p>



<p>The Poly Network attack, which made headlines on July 3rd, saw hackers exploit vulnerabilities across multiple chains, resulting in the issuance of more than ten different assets worth a staggering $34 billion. The platform&#8217; swift response to the attack demonstrates its commitment to safeguarding the interests of its users and actively addressing security concerns.</p>

<p>The platform continues to monitor the situation closely and is actively working towards implementing necessary measures to enhance the security and resilience of its platform. By taking snapshots of METIS holdings and deploying a new contract, they aims to mitigate any potential risks and ensure the long-term stability of its ecosystem.</p>



<p>As the investigation into the Poly Network attack unfolds, the team remains dedicated to providing transparent updates and ensuring the safety of user assets. Users are encouraged to stay updated with official announcements from the platform and exercise caution while engaging with any related activities on the BNB Chain.</p>

<p>The recently passed &#8220;Act on the Protection of Users of Virtual Assets&#8221; primarily focuses on user protection and regulation of unfair trade practices, prompting the need for supplementary regulations related to market order and virtual asset issuance and financing.</p>



<p>The Financial Services Commission (FSC) held a digital asset private joint task force (TF) working group meeting, outlining the second-stage legislation that will establish virtual assets as an institutional system. Discussions were held regarding the key components to be included in the upcoming legislation.</p>



<p>The first bill, known as the <a href="https://coincu.com/195023-south-korean-banks-limit-crypto-deposits/">Virtual Asset User Protection Act</a>, has already been passed by the National Assembly. It covers areas such as safeguarding user assets, regulating unfair practices in the virtual asset market, and granting financial authorities the power to oversee and penalize market participants.</p>

<p>In response to the National Assembly&#8217;s call for research services for the second-stage legislation, the FSC is taking steps to ensure the smooth integration of the virtual asset industry into the institutional framework. This includes addressing conflicts of interest that may arise during the issuance and distribution of virtual assets.</p>



<p>The Financial Services Commission aims to order research services for the second phase of virtual asset legislation either by this month or the next. By initiating this research, they are actively working towards the development of comprehensive regulations that will govern the virtual asset market and promote its long-term stability.</p>



<p>As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, these research efforts will play a crucial role in shaping the regulatory framework and ensuring a secure and transparent environment for virtual asset users and businesses alike.</p>

<li><em>The company&#8217;s Australian offices were searched as part of the ongoing inquiry.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/binance-australia-offices-searched-by-regulator-as-part-of-derivatives-probe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>, The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) is conducting an investigation into Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange.</strong></h5>

<p>According to unnamed sources, ASIC searched the company&#8217;s Australian offices as part of an ongoing inquiry into the exchange&#8217;s now-defunct local derivatives business. The categorization of retail and wholesale customers by Binance Australia is the subject of ASIC&#8217;s investigation.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/199795-binance-drops-spot-volume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> said in April that it would close its local futures exchange while continuing to operate its spot platform. Due to misclassification as wholesale investors, the business claimed to have terminated the derivatives holdings of some Australian customers.</p>



<p>ASIC, who had previously suspended Binance Australia&#8217;s derivatives license, indicated that their investigation against the business is still continuing and declined to confirm or deny the search activities. The exchange replied by saying its collaboration with local authorities and commitment to achieving regulatory requirements in order to provide fully compliant service to Australian customers.</p>

<p>Binance is facing several investigations and difficulties throughout the world, notably in the United States, where the US Securities and Exchange Commission has accused it of mishandling user assets and violating securities laws.</p>

<p>Authorities in France paid a visit to Binance last month. French authorities are looking into the suspected unlawful offering of digital-asset services as well as aggravated money laundering. The exchange has said that it complies with all regulations in France and every other market in which it operates.</p>



<p>On June 26, the exchange also withdrew its application for regulatory accreditation in Austria. After failing to get regulatory approval, the exchange announced its withdrawal from the Netherlands earlier this month. It has also attempted to deregister its local firm in <a href="https://coincu.com/197893-bybit-now-secures-license-to-cyprus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyprus</a>, and a few weeks ago, Belgium&#8217;s regulator <a href="https://coincu.com/197526-binance-ordered-to-stop-in-belgium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ordered</a> Binance to cease activities in the country.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Ethereum Layer 2 network Starknet launched on the Georli test network for voting on Starknet v0.12.0 on July 4.</em></li>



<li><em>Deployment to the mainnet is expected on July 12 after a frozen period on July 11.</em></li>



<li><em>The upcoming release focuses on improving network performance and reducing transaction latency.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On July 4, the Ethereum Layer 2 network Starknet was launched on the Georli test network to commence voting for <a href="https://coincu.com/199386-starknet-0-12-0-upgrade-better-ux-lower-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Starknet v0.12.0</strong>.</a></strong></h5>

<p>The test voting period has started and will finish on July 6. After that, the formal voting for Starknet v0.12.0 will begin, and it is slated to conclude on July 10. According to the vote results, Starknet v0.12.0 is likely to be deployed to the mainnet on July 12 after the frozen period on July 11.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/194137-why-is-starknet-ecosystem-explosive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">StarkNet</a> is an Ethereum Layer 2 solution that takes the shape of a ZK-Rollup. Because of StarkNet&#8217;s dependency on the STARK system &#8211; StarkWare&#8217;s technological development &#8211; any dApp may run, function, and expand endlessly without jeopardizing Ethereum&#8217;s capacity to aggregate and protect.</p>

<p>The network contract and operating system are developed in the Cairo programming language, which allows for the deployment and scalability of Dapps or smart contracts independent of business logic.</p>



<p>Starknet had announced that the new mainnet would be available in a matter of weeks. Moreover, the Starknet literature states that the future Starknet v0.12.0 release will concentrate on boosting network performance to increase scaling and transaction latency.</p>



<p>A new Rust implementation of Sequencer will be created to do this. The Sequencer incorporates more efficient local storage and critical route logic to drastically cut transaction confirmation wait times and alleviate network congestion.</p>



<p>The suggested architecture for the Starknet Alpha v0.12.0 upgrade plan is as follows, according to the Starknet governance page:</p>



<ul>
<li>Integration period: the stable version is integrated during the first 7 days.</li>



<li>Testnet period: deployment on the Goerli testnet in the first three days, followed by five days of voting, and finally one day of waiting (Freeze period).</li>
</ul>



<p>Install the main network the next day for a total of 17 days.</p>

<p>Yesterday, ParaSpace announced its decision to<a href="https://coincu.com/199951-paraspace-temporarily-suspend-azukis-pool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> temporarily suspend</a> Azuki&#8217;s team, including deposits, withdrawals, and liquidations. This measure is intended to give users more time to replenish liquidity, repay debt and improve health.</p>



<p>The decision was made in connection with the recent Azuki ecosystem collections that received a lot of criticism from the community for disappointing them with the new Elemental collection.</p>

<p>After the crisis of confidence broke out in Azuki, the price collapsed by more than 50% within 7 days. Amid insufficient liquidity, NFT lending platform ParaSpace abruptly suspended the liquidation of Azuki&#8217;s collateral yesterday, resulting in tens of thousands of dollars in bad debt.</p>



<p>While the official stated that the move is intended to give users more time to replenish liquidity, repay debt, and improve health, the liquidation will continue after that. And the lending platform says any shortfall at the end of the suspension will be covered by ParaSpace&#8217;s reserves. But it should be noted that ParaSpace&#8217;s losses could continue to spread without stabilizing Azuki&#8217;s price.</p>



<p>At a time when the market is facing major challenges from the sharp decline in market prices, lending contracts need to prove their worth for an illiquid asset like NFT.</p>



<p>ParaSpace is a Lending project that the community notices in the NFTFi array. Although it has only just launched the mainnet version, the platform has surpassed BendDAO to lead the TVL ranking of NFT Lending projects.</p>
