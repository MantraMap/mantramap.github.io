<p class="s6">According to CoinMarketCap, Tether (USDT) is the largest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market. However, its safety has come under question in recent times. The question now is if Tether is the safest option for storing your crypto? Meanwhile, Tradecurve, a hybrid platform, has raised over $3 million in its presale, causing excitement among investors.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Is Tether (USDT) the Safest Stablecoin To Store Your Crypto?
<p class="s6">Tether (USDT) is the top stablecoin in the crypto market with a market capitalization of over $83 billion. Meanwhile, there are several factors to consider when ascertaining the safety of a stablecoin. One is the assets backing the stablecoin like gold, government treasury bills, etc. Also, the stablecoin issuer must have sufficient funds available to fulfill all redemption requests.</p>
<p class="s6">Despite being embroiled in controversy over the past year, the Tether coin has recently implemented measures to enhance transparency within its operations. Notably, the platform now publishes regular audits of its USD reserves. Additionally, Tether has made efforts to bolster its USD reserves.</p>
<p class="s6">According to the Q1 attestation conducted by financial services firm, BDO Italia, Tether possessed approximately $2.44 billion in excess reserves. Although the token has de-pegged from the USD more than 3 times in the past year, it has always rebounded.</p>
Tradecurve (TCRV) Presale Run Skyrockets With $3M Raise in Presale
<p class="s6">Tradecurve, a trading platform that has generated significant attention, has raised $4 million during its presale so far. The team anticipates raising a total of $20 million by Q3. Meanwhile, Tradecurve adopts a hybrid approach, blending elements of CEXs and DEXs, to establish a private trading environment. Safety is particularly crucial in the present era of data breaches, especially for traders who prioritize privacy.</p>
<p class="s6">Unfortunately, many traditional trading exchanges have yet to implement a Proof of Reserves (PoR) system, causing diminishing trust from traders. Interestingly, Tradecurve is out to fill this void, enhance user trust and promote the exchange's integrity by implementing PoR.</p>
Tradecurve (TCRV) To Hit &nbsp;$0.025 in Stage 5
<p class="s6">Tradecurve's TCRV token has captured significant attention in the crypto community. Over the past month, Tradecurve's price has skyrocketed by 150%, with the token surging from $0.015 to $0.025. What sets Tradecurve apart from rivals like Huobi and Coinbase is its emphasis on decentralization, user anonymity, and privacy.</p>
<p class="s6">Moreover, Tradecurve ensures that traders enjoy a smooth trading experience by providing quick withdrawals, deposits, and trade execution. At present, the token is in stage five of its presale, enabling investors to acquire it for $0.025 per token. Analysts predict that with the current bullish trend, the token could reach $0.029 in stage 6.</p>
How High Can Tradecurve Go?
<p class="s6">While the forthcoming 40% surge appears like a remarkable price jump, it doesn&rsquo;t compare with the long-term prediction for Tradecurve. Experts have predicted that the launch of the platform will attract a wave of traders to Tradecurve. This spike in activity is expected to cause a 50xsurge for Tradecurve in 2023 for TCRV to trade as high as $1 per token.</p>
