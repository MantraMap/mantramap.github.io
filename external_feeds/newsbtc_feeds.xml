					<description><![CDATA[In recent weeks, Ethereum has demonstrated a downtrend in shorter timeframes, where the bulls struggled to maintain the critical $1900 support zone. This allowed the bears to gain dominance. However, there appears to be a change in price sentiment during recent trading sessions. Related Reading: Terra Luna Token Burn Proposal Greenlit – Could $1 Be Hittable? On the daily chart, ETH experienced a 2% climb. A positive movement is observable on the weekly chart, although it remains relatively modest. Despite the upward movement, there is a potential risk of waning bullish momentum if Ethereum fails to sustain its price above the immediate trading zone. From a technical standpoint, the altcoin is leaning toward bullishness, with increased buying strength apparent in recent trading sessions. Both accumulation and demand have played a role in this positive shift. Furthermore, Ethereum&#8217;s market capitalization has grown, indicating heightened demand during the past trading sessions. At the time of writing, ETH was priced at $1,840. It is currently nearing its immediate resistance level of $1,850, which has previously functioned as a liquidity pocket. Approaching this level might trigger a price decrease. However, if the altcoin successfully surpasses $1,850 and establishes a trading position above the subsequent resistance at $1,870, it could signal a more prolonged period of bullish activity. On the flip side, the support level is $1,780, followed by another at $1,760. Falling within this range might lead to further downward movement in the price. The trading volume of ETH in the previous session was lower. However, the fact that it was in the green indicates that buyers were gradually entering the market. Technical Analysis Regarding buyer activity, there has been increased demand for the altcoin following a notable dip within the past 48 hours. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) climbed above the 60 mark, suggesting a revival for the altcoin and signaling buyer engagement surpassed seller activity. Furthermore, the price remained above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating that buyers were the driving force behind the market&#8217;s price momentum. Another observation is that ETH remained above the 200-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line (green). This suggests a substantial price surge could be anticipated before the bullish momentum wanes. Correlating with the increase in demand, ETH exhibited buy signals on the daily chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which signifies price momentum and potential shifts, showed green histograms aligned with buy signals. These buy signals also suggest a potential upward movement in the price over the subsequent immediate trading sessions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Show Accumulation Again, Bullish Sign? Additionally, the Bollinger Bands appeared wide from each other, indicating the likelihood of price volatility, although not overly significant as the bands mainly remained parallel. These parallel bands coincide with the immediate resistance level. Featured image from Unsplash, charts from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin price has experienced a slight uptick in the past 24 hours as bulls defended critical support. The number one cryptocurrency by market cap might try another run north of critical resistance, but recent data points towards further sideways price action. Related Reading: Terra Luna Token Burn Proposal Greenlit – Could $1 Be Hittable? As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $29,400 with a 2% profit in the past day. Over the past week, the cryptocurrency has recorded similar profits while the rest of the market stalls or sees losses. Key resistance stands at around $30,000, but BTC failed to breach it on every recent occasion. Bitcoin Price Prepares… For Monotony? Over the past two years, the Bitcoin price has been moving in tandem with macroeconomic forces. In particular, BTC reacts to the tension from the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) and its interest rates hike program. The financial institution is entering a quiet period due to summer vacations. As a result, according to crypto analysis firm Blofin, Bitcoin and the crypto market will likely stay within their current range until September. Over this period, price movements and volatility spikes will continue to decline as the low liquidity environment impacts price action, and institutions hedging their positions impact volatility, Blofin stated. Furthermore, the report claims that potential interest rate hikes are “somewhat priced in” and could be inefficient in propelling BTC above $30,000. The current macroeconomic landscape could persist until May 2023 as inflation, the key reason behind the interest rates hike, becomes sticky. The above could translate into sideways price action until that period or until the U.S. Fed decides to cut interest rates paving the way for more risk appetite across the sector. Blofin stated: (…) investors seem to have become accustomed to daily life at high interest rates. The lack of liquidity has left investors with little interest in “trading”. Most investors are sitting on the sidelines. Bitcoin Investors Brace For Impact The chart below shows monthly trading volume across crypto exchanges has declined since July 2022.

In that sense, the crypto research firm believes that, due to the lack of strength around BTC and ETH, prices are likely to see a dip: (…) it is not difficult to find that when the price of BTC is around $30,000, and the price of ETH is around $2,000, both will lose further upward momentum here, hovering for a while, and then fall.

					<description><![CDATA[In recent developments, Hong Kong regulators have issued cautionary warnings to crypto investors, asking them to be careful of potential investment risks. According to the city’s chief regulatory agency, some cryptocurrency trading platforms have been making erroneous claims about meeting the regulatory requirements for digital assets.  Investors Beware Of False Claims From Crypto Firms The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the chief regulatory body of Hong Kong, released the alert on August 7. In the statement, the commission noted that some unlicensed exchanges in the city were engaging in “improper practices.”  Related Reading: Valkyrie Unveils Double-Barreled Approach To Launch An Ethereum ETF Alongside A Bitcoin ETF According to the body, unlicensed Virtual Assets Trading Platforms (VATPs) are falsely claiming to have submitted license applications to the body, which would enable them to conduct transactions legally in the special administrative region of China.  Such fraudulent claims were designed to “give the public a false sense of assurance” and were targeted at “inducing another person to trade in virtual assets.” Making such claims amounts to a punishable offense under the city’s Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Finance Ordinance, the regulatory body said.  Furthermore, the SFC will consider any likely misrepresentation made by an unlicensed Virtual Asset Trading Platform when deciding whether or not to grant them a license. The SFC may view as unfavorable any non-compliant actions that would need the reversion of client withdrawal or transactions that could have been reasonably avoided.  The Securities and Futures Commission said it will evaluate a Virtual Asset Trading Platform’s application based on its ability to show genuine intention to correct previous non-compliant actions, including the gradual unwinding of impermissible transactions.  Virtual Assets Trading Platforms that do not meet the agency’s requirements must make efforts to meet the regulatory and legal obligations of licensed VAPTs, the SFC clarified. Total market cap recovers to $1.133 trillion &#124; Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com Hong Kong’s Regulatory Framework Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC)  recently released guidelines for Virtual Asset Trading Platform operators in the country to provide more regulatory certainty for the crypto industry in the country and help protect investors’ interests.  The SFC laid down rules that would enable centralized exchanges to provide services to retail clients, provided they are authorized by a license obtained from the Securities and Futures Commission.  Under Hong Kong’s VASP regime, which kickstarted on June 1, 2023, a one-year grace period commencing from June 1, 2023, allowed exchanges with an existing large presence in the city to continue operations while making changes to their businesses to ensure compliance with the new SFCs rules.  Related Reading: PayPal’s PYUSD Launch Triggers Calls For Stablecoin Bill Platform operators that had not commenced operations before June 1, 2023, had to be SFC-licensed before they could operate. However, it seems that certain exchanges are already violating the rules provided under the new regime.  According to SFC, investors participating in trading on unregulated virtual asset exchanges are likely to face “losing their entire investment” on the exchange if it “ceases operation, collapses, is hacked,” or “suffers from any misappropriation of assets.”  Following this, many exchanges have publicly pledged to submit licensing applications with the SFC, including Huobi and OKX, two popular exchanges in Asia.  Featured image from PayBito, chart from Tradingview.com]]></description>

<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the chief regulatory body of Hong Kong, released the alert on August 7. In the statement, the commission noted that some unlicensed exchanges in the city were engaging in “improper practices.” </p>

<p>According to the body, unlicensed Virtual Assets Trading Platforms (VATPs) are falsely claiming to have submitted license applications to the body, which would enable them to conduct transactions legally in the special administrative region of China. </p>
<p>Such fraudulent claims were designed to “give the public a false sense of assurance” and were targeted at “inducing another person to trade in virtual assets.” Making such claims amounts to a punishable offense under the city’s Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Finance <a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/ord/2022ord015-e.pdf" rel="nofollow">Ordinance</a>, the regulatory body said. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the SFC will consider any likely misrepresentation made by an unlicensed Virtual Asset Trading Platform when deciding whether or not to grant them a license. The SFC may view as unfavorable any non-compliant actions that would need the reversion of client withdrawal or transactions that could have been reasonably avoided. </p>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission said it will evaluate a Virtual Asset Trading Platform’s application based on its ability to show genuine intention to correct previous non-compliant actions, including the gradual unwinding of impermissible transactions. </p>
<p>Virtual Assets Trading Platforms that do not meet the agency’s requirements must make efforts to meet the regulatory and legal obligations of licensed VAPTs, the SFC clarified.</p>

<h2>Hong Kong’s Regulatory Framework</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/hong-kong-to-provide-crypto-trading-platforms/" rel="nofollow">Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission</a> (SFC)  recently released <a href="https://www.sfc.hk/-/media/EN/assets/components/codes/files-current/web/guidelines/Guidelines-for-Virtual-Asset-Trading-Platform-Operators/Guidelines-for-Virtual-Asset-Trading-Platform-Operators.pdf?rev=f6152ff73d2b4e8a8ce9dc025030c3b8" rel="nofollow">guidelines</a> for Virtual Asset Trading Platform operators in the country to provide more regulatory certainty for the crypto industry in the country and help protect investors’ interests. </p>
<p>The SFC laid down rules that would enable centralized exchanges to provide services to retail clients, provided they are authorized by a license obtained from the Securities and Futures Commission. </p>
<p>Under Hong Kong’s <a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/api/consultation/openFile?lang=EN&amp;refNo=23CP1" rel="nofollow">VASP regime</a>, which kickstarted on June 1, 2023, a one-year grace period commencing from June 1, 2023, allowed exchanges with an existing large presence in the city to continue operations while making changes to their businesses to ensure compliance with the new SFCs rules. </p>

<p>Platform operators that had not commenced operations before June 1, 2023, had to be SFC-licensed before they could operate. However, it seems that certain exchanges are already violating the rules provided under the new regime. </p>
<p>According to SFC, investors participating in trading on unregulated virtual asset exchanges are likely to face “losing their entire investment” on the exchange if it “ceases operation, collapses, is hacked,” or “suffers from any misappropriation of assets.” </p>
<p>Following this, many exchanges have publicly pledged to submit licensing applications with the SFC, including Huobi and OKX, two popular exchanges in Asia. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood has sparked speculation with her recent prediction that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may potentially grant approval for multiple Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) simultaneously. Deviation From The Norm For Spot Bitcoin ETFs In a recent interview with Bloomberg on August 7, Cathie Wood shared her insight that the SEC might opt for a groundbreaking strategy by approving more than one Bitcoin ETF at the same time. Related Reading: PayPal’s PYUSD Launch Triggers Calls For Stablecoin Bill Wood&#8217;s assertion, &#8220;I think the SEC, if it’s going to approve a Bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once,&#8221; has captured attention, especially given her prior assurance that her firm would lead in securing approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Wood&#8217;s projection deviates from the conventional practice of sequential ETF approvals. By envisioning a simultaneous approval scenario, she introduces a novel approach that could streamline the regulatory process. This potential shift aims to foster a balanced and inclusive investment landscape, catering to an expected demand of over $50 billion. Implications For The Cryptocurrency Industry Historically, the SEC has not granted approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs, while permitting the listing of ETFs tied to crypto futures. Wood&#8217;s forward-looking statement emerges amidst a surge in applications from major players like BlackRock Inc, Fidelity, WisdomTree, VanEck, and Invesco, all vying for the approval of similar crypto ETFs as ARK.  Wood&#8217;s forecast also emphasizes the significance of strategic marketing. Given the anticipated resemblance among various funds, Wood suggests that issuers&#8217; marketing prowess will be crucial in setting them apart as a race for dominance is expected. This insight underscores the competitive edge sought by applicants in a rapidly evolving sector. BTC price recovers as positive sentiment grows &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com As Cathie Wood&#8217;s prediction reverberates through the financial realm, industry observers await  SEC&#8217;s response. With a significant deadline for ARK&#8217;s application looming on August 13, amidst speculation of potential delays, Wood suggested that the deadline might pass and be extended but then the date will be eagerly waited on.  Although Ark Invest filed for its spot Bitcoin ETFs application on May 15, earlier than others like BlackRock who filed its application on June  15, this was thought to be a race for winners or losers according to Cathie&#8217;s &#8220;first in line&#8221; phrase to favor Ark Invest. However, her revised view makes the race for Spot Bitcoin ETFs and SEC ruling more interesting. This innovative forecast accentuates the intersection of forward-thinking and regulatory dynamics, highlighting an era where digital assets are increasingly integrated within traditional financial frameworks, especially the recent push for ETFs.

					<description><![CDATA[Since the Bitcoin bull market began, one discussion that has never left the crypto community is when the next bull rally will commence and if it would follow the previously established trend around the halving events. To this end, a crypto analyst, Lark Davis, has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to share his forecast around the next bull market. What Could Happen If History Repeats Itself All of the previous Bitcoin bull markets have always begun after the BTC halving event which cuts block rewards in half. However, this time around, there have been dissenting views regarding the digital asset’s tendency to follow this established trend once more due to deviations in various Bitcoin metrics. But Davis has shared a possible scenario for BTC if the bull market begins after the rally once more. Related Reading: Litecoin Hashrate Taps New All-Time High, Will LTC Price Follow Suit? In the chart shared by the analyst on X, he points out a long period of accumulation. This is when investors fill up their bags with BTC as it is possibly the lowest that the price of the digital asset would get during the bear market. BTC could reach $180,000 if the bull market follows halving cycle &#124; Source: Lark Davis on X Next comes the Bitcoin halving event, at which time, the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the market start to pick up steam. This is when the bull market starts to take shape, leading to the next part of the trend which is when prices explode. In Davis’ post, he shows that the price of the digital asset could rise as high as $180,000 during this time. If the cryptocurrency does touch this price mark, it would mean that the price of BTC would almost triple from its current all-time high of $69,000. How This Can Happen For Bitcoin As clarified by the analyst in his X post, for any of this to happen, it would mean that BTC would have to completely follow the trends of the previous bull cycles. This would mean the bottom could likely be reached in early 2024, but it would also be the same year for the start of the bull run. Even if Bitcoin does follow this trend though, it would not always be ‘up-only’ for the market. It would mean that the bull market would top out sometime in 2025 and then there would likely be a market crash that sends BTC spiraling in the following year. As Davis points out, the digital asset could tumble 70% to reach $50,000 again. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Break Above $2,000 If This Happens However, even with the obvious bear market that would follow this trend, it is still an incredibly bullish scenario for Bitcoin and the crypto market at large. The bull market would last around one year, following historical data, providing ample opportunity for investors to make the most of the market. The next Bitcoin halving is expected to take place in April 2024, and if history is anything to go by, this is around when the bull market should be expected to start back up.

					<description><![CDATA[Decentralized gaming platform, The Sandbox is set to execute a SAND token release valued at $133.86 million. According to data from TokenUnlocks, Sandbox will release 332.55 million SAND tokens into circulation on August 14, representing 16.16% of the token’s maximum supply.  New SAND Tokens In 2023 To Rise Over 700 Million With the upcoming SAND release, the total number of new SAND tokens in 2023 is expected to rise to 705.3 million. This latest unlock will add to the 372.75 million SAND released earlier during the last token unlock in February.  Based on more data from Token Unlocks, the newly released tokens will be allocated to various parties, including the Sandbox&#8217;s development team, project advisors, strategic and seed investors, and the project’s reserve.  SAND functions as the utility token of the Sandbox metaverse, serving as the platform&#8217;s payment medium and governance token. According to its design, SAND is expected to undergo a token unlock every six months until 2025. Currently, the number of circulating SAND tokens is 2.05 billion, representing 68.6% of SAND’s total supply. With the projected release on August 14, these figures are expected to jump to 2.39 billion and 84.76%, respectively. SAND trading at $0.40 on the daily chart &#124; Source: SANDUSD chart on Tradingview.com Related Reading: Massive Token Unlock: Ripple Releases One Billion XRP From Escrow Potential Impact of Token Release on SAND’s Price Token unlocks are common events in the crypto space, usually accompanied by fears of a bearish market. This is because the sudden introduction of massive tokens to the market creates a higher supply-to-demand ratio, which drives down asset prices.  Looking at on-chain data, this is one likely effect of SAND’s upcoming token unlock on its market price due to declining network growth on the Sandbox platform. Based on data from blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, the number of new addresses on Sandbox is down by 66.87% in the last month, falling from a peak of 649 in July to its current value of 215.  The continuance of this trend means Sandbox may lack the necessary traction to counter the upcoming inflationary pressure, which may ultimately lead to a fall in price. Source: IntoTheBlock Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Gains By 10% Ahead Of July Token Release Following SAND’s last token release on February 14, SAND’s price movement was fairly positive, opening at $0.68 to trade as high as $0.72 and close at $0.71. In the subsequent days, SAND would record more gains, reaching a market value of $0.88 on Feb 20.  While token unlocks are widely expected to precipitate bearish pressure, their effects are still unpredictable. Investors are advised to watch out for major developments on Sandbox regarding network growth and whale movement. At the time of writing, CoinMarketCap data shows that SAND is trading at $0.40 with a 0.62% gain on the last day. However, the token is down on the weekly chart losing about 2.98% of its value.  Featured image from Binance Academy, chart from Tradingview.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Data shows that Litecoin long-term holders exited the asset before the halving, while short-term holders were left to panic on the halving day. The &#8220;halving&#8221; here refers to an event where the block rewards of Litecoin are permanently cut in half. Litecoin Long-Term Holders Sold During Price Surge Before The Halving According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the long-term holders had been well-prepared for the &#8220;sell the news&#8221; halving event. The &#8220;long-term holders&#8221; (LTHs) generally include all investors who have been holding onto their coins since at least six months ago. Related Reading: These Bitcoin Metrics Are At Important Retests, Will Bullish Trend Prevail? This group includes some of the most resolute investors in the Litecoin market, who don&#8217;t easily react to whatever is going in on in the wider sector, as they usually hold through FUD or profit-taking opportunities without participating in any significant selling. Because of how rare movements from these investors can be, the few times that they do sell can be the ones to watch out for, as they may spell trouble for the market. A way to gauge whether the LTHs are participating in selling or not is through the &#8220;holding time of transacted coins&#8221; metric, which tells us about the average amount of time that coins being transferred on the blockchain had been dormant prior to this movement. When the value of this metric is high, it means that the age of coins being sold on the network is high, which can naturally be a sign that the LTHs are active right now. On the other hand, low values usually indicate that the short-term holders (STHs) are the ones selling currently. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Litecoin holding time of transacted coins over the past few months: The value of the metric seems to have been relatively low in recent days &#124; Source: IntoTheBlock on X As you can see in the above graph, the Litecoin holding time of transacted coins spiked back in June, when the price of the cryptocurrency had been observing a sharp rally. During the largest of these spikes, the indicator&#8217;s value had exceeded 1 year, implying that some of the most experienced investors in the market had broken their silence. This rally had occurred as the market had started getting hyped about the halving, which was only a month and a half away at that point. This event takes place every four years, with the latest one having occurred just earlier this month. Unlike what some may have hoped for, the event didn&#8217;t prove to be bullish for LTC, as the aforementioned rally didn&#8217;t last for too long and the cryptocurrency only declined in the remaining leadup to the halving, until finally it actually sharply plunged on the day of the event itself. It would appear that the experienced LTHs had already predicted something like this may happen, so they had taken the wise decision of selling while the opportunity was there.

In the post-halving selloff, the indicator&#8217;s value has remained low, implying that it&#8217;s only the short-term holders who have been panic selling after they saw that a bullish trend couldn&#8217;t return to Litecoin with the event.

					<description><![CDATA[Hedera Hashgraph’s native cryptocurrency, HBAR, is shining following the slight boost in the crypto market today, August 8. Hedera briefly broke through the one-month-long $0.5 resistance, climbing above $0.6, while top coins like Bitcoin bleed with losses. Even though the overall crypto market cap gain affected many assets positively, HBAR owes most of its gains to the latest ecosystem developments and partnerships. HBAR Price Performance Amid Impressive Ecosystem Updates Despite a drop in trading volume, HBAR has soared over 6%, attaining a peak of $0.06032 on Tuesday morning. This sharp spike represents a nearly 10% increase from the day low of $0.05483. But the token has now receded from its peak value and currently trades at $0.05951.  Related Reading: Valkyrie Unveils Double-Barreled Approach To Launch An Ethereum ETF Alongside A Bitcoin ETF Moreover, the HBAR price has soared over 16% in a week, bucking the bearish trend that snatched all of Bitcoin and Ethereum’s past week’s gains. The token’s value is now over 22% higher than the price recorded 30 days ago. However, HBAR&#8217;s trading volume is south of its price trajectory. The over 16% decline in 24-hour trading volume raises questions about whether the bulls had reached saturation and capitulated to the bears even before the rally grew strong. Strategic Partnerships Drive HBAR&#8217;s Rally Hedera’s network advancements and strategic partnerships have helped to boost HBAR&#8217;s current market position. In August, the Hedera network recorded notable deals with leading banking and financial institutions and automobile companies.  On August 2, Korean automobile firms Hyundai and KIA announced the launch of a new blockchain and AI-powered Supplier co2 Emission Monitoring System (SCEMS) on the Hedera network. This integration allows Hedera to record the carbon emission data from suppliers while AI will predict future emissions following the data provided.  Similarly, on August 4, Hedera announced a partnership with FreshSupplyCoAu in a groundbreaking move that could reshape the digital finance landscape. The strategic partnership allows users to connect with conventional banking and the Mastercard network for a seamless, safe, and wider range of cross-border payments.  Through Mastercard’s payment gateway, Hedera will connect traditional banking infrastructure with decentralized finance technology, bridging the gap between blockchain and traditional finance. These strategic partnerships mark significant milestones for the network. They could boost HBAR&#8217;s usability and trading activity as more investors adopt the token. This move could amplify HBAR&#8217;s reach and market presence, potentially increasing network activities and the token&#8217;s price. HBAR Market Outlook, Will The Bulls Sustain? Hedera’s dwindling 24-hour trading volume, however, raises questions about the longevity of the ongoing rally since a trading volume decline often signifies bearish market activities.  The HBAR&#8217;s price chart reveals that technical indicators suggest a bearish trend reversal for HBAR as the token trades above the 50-day moving average, confirming the bullish momentum on its price today.  But the Relative Strength Index has receded from 62 to 57, demonstrating weakening momentum as buyers exit the market.

<p>Despite a drop in trading volume, HBAR has soared over 6%, attaining a peak of $0.06032 on Tuesday morning. This sharp spike represents a nearly 10% increase from the day low of $0.05483. But the token has now receded from its peak value and currently trades at $0.05951. </p>

<p>Moreover, the HBAR price has soared over 16% in a week, bucking the bearish trend that snatched all of Bitcoin and Ethereum’s past week’s gains. The token’s value is now over 22% higher than the price recorded 30 days ago.</p>
<p>However, HBAR&#8217;s trading volume is south of its price trajectory. The over 16% decline in 24-hour trading volume raises questions about whether the bulls had reached saturation and capitulated to the bears even before the rally grew strong.</p>

<h2>Strategic Partnerships Drive HBAR&#8217;s Rally</h2>
<p>Hedera’s network advancements and strategic partnerships have helped to boost HBAR&#8217;s current market position. In August, the Hedera network recorded notable deals with leading banking and financial institutions and automobile companies. </p>
<p>On August 2, Korean automobile firms Hyundai and KIA <a href="https://twitter.com/CoingraphNews/status/1686749892763336705" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> the launch of a new blockchain and AI-powered Supplier co2 Emission Monitoring System (SCEMS) on the Hedera network. This integration allows Hedera to record the carbon emission data from suppliers while AI will predict future emissions following the data provided. </p>
<p>Similarly, on August 4, Hedera <a href="https://twitter.com/HBAR_foundation/status/1688537412509540353" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> a partnership with FreshSupplyCoAu in a groundbreaking move that could reshape the digital finance landscape. The strategic partnership allows users to connect with conventional banking and the Mastercard network for a seamless, safe, and wider range of cross-border payments. </p>
<p>Through Mastercard’s payment gateway, Hedera will connect traditional banking infrastructure with decentralized finance technology, bridging the gap between blockchain and traditional finance.</p>
<p>These strategic partnerships mark significant milestones for the network. They could boost HBAR&#8217;s usability and trading activity as more investors adopt the token. </p>
<p>This move could amplify HBAR&#8217;s reach and market presence, potentially increasing network activities and the token&#8217;s price.</p>
HBAR Market Outlook, Will The Bulls Sustain?
<p>Hedera’s dwindling 24-hour trading volume, however, raises questions about the longevity of the ongoing rally since a trading volume decline often signifies bearish market activities. </p>
<p>The HBAR&#8217;s price <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/TxOt7Pw6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">chart</a> reveals that technical indicators suggest a bearish trend reversal for HBAR as the token trades above the 50-day moving average, confirming the bullish momentum on its price today.  But the Relative Strength Index has receded from 62 to 57, demonstrating weakening momentum as buyers exit the market.</p>

<p>Also, the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence has converged with the signal line and now moves below, while the faded green histogram bars have birthed red ones. </p>
<p>This observation shows HBAR could face downturns in the next few hours unless the bulls regain control.</p>
