			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As December inflation figures fell to 6.5% Bitcoin led the crypto market in a continuance of its rally.</p>
Price inflation much lower
<p>The consumer price index (CPI) figures came in today, and on an annualised basis inflation hit the expected much lower rate of 6.5%, down from 7.1% a month ago.</p>
<p>With what surely must be seen as quite an aggressive drop, bitcoin made hay and led most of the crypto market higher, although initially bitcoin did appear to falter and it took the market a few hours to digest the news and decide that the move was upwards.</p>
Bitcoin continues its rally
<p>At time of going to press bitcoin has been up as high as 5.8% on the day. A move of this kind of magnitude to the upside has not been seen that often since bitcoin has traversed down and sideways since June of last year.</p>
<p>Given that the relative strength indicators (RSIs) have topped on the daily time frame, it could be time for bitcoin to take a pause for a while, but who knows, as first $19,000, and then the $20,000 resistances beckon.</p>
<p>Another thing going in Bitcoin&rsquo;s favour is the weakness of the dollar. The dollar index (DXY) is continuing to roll over and has hit a new local low of 102 today. USDT dominance is also falling fast and is heading down to the 200-day moving average located at around 7.5%.</p>
AI surges higher
<p>A niche within crypto that is making some really stunning gains at the moment is that of artificial intelligence (AI) related projects. With all the buzz around Chat GPT, and Microsoft looking to make a $10 billion investment, eyes have focused more on AI in crypto.</p>
<p>Singularity Net has risen 115% in the last week, Fetch AI is up around 100% so far, and VectorSpace has also done 114% over the same time period. Many other AI related cryptos are also doing extremely well.</p>
Time for a retrace?
<p>With il Capo Of Crypto tweeting that in his view this is &ldquo;one of the biggest bull traps I&rsquo;ve ever seen&rdquo;, it is perhaps time for Bitcoin and crypto to take a breather, and who knows, retrace back down a fair way again.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">One of the biggest bull traps I've ever seen.</p>
&mdash; il Capo Of Crypto (@CryptoCapo_) January 12, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>Bear rallies are notorious for being quite violent, but usually end in tears eventually. Nevertheless, the bottom needs to be found at some point, and many factors are pointing to a bottom already being made at $15,500. Time will tell.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, has found a new audience to spew his crypto-skeptic views &ndash; the United States Army. </p>
<p>Gary Gensler, chairman of the SEC, has found new listeners to his anti-crypto rants, the US Army. The U.S. Army hosted its first Twitter Spaces event of 2023, with Gensler and SEC commissioner Caroline Crenshaw attending to provide financial advice to U.S. soldiers on how are where they should invest their money. During the Twitter session, Gensler said most cryptocurrencies lack regulatory compliance and use cases. Gensler added that the industry is the &ldquo;Wild West.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="zxx">https://t.co/oRjE3pDc8C</p>
&mdash; U.S. Army (@USArmy) January 11, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>In his newest iteration of crypto critiques, Gensler said that it&rsquo;s easy to get caught up in &ldquo;FOMO&rdquo; surrounding the sector. He added that traders and companies should proceed with caution as he maintains that most currencies are not abiding by the law, noting:</p>

<p>Most of these, again, are not complying with the securities laws, but they should be.</p>

<p>Gensler added:</p>

<p>Most of these 10 or 15,000 tokens will fail. Adding, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because venture capital fails, new startups fail &mdash;&nbsp; but also because history tells us that there&rsquo;s not much room for micro currencies, meaning, you know, we have the US dollar and Europe has the euro and the like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crenshaw added to Gensler&rsquo;s comments saying that cryptocurrencies are &ldquo;noted for their scams&rdquo; and further stated:</p>

<p>They claim to be transparent, what&rsquo;s on the blockchain is transparent but the rest of what&rsquo;s there is not transparent and I think there have been some examples of that recently.</p>

<p>Crenshaw also advised those considering a crypto investment should give &ldquo;careful, careful consideration&rdquo; to the share of their portfolio they invest into digital assets. Commenting on the SEC&rsquo;s advice on where Army personnel should save their money, Crenshaw told soldiers to invest &ldquo;as much as possible&rdquo; in a Thrift Savings Plans (TSP). A TSP is a government-sponsored retirement plan set up for federal employees and service members per reports by Cointelegraph.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Extends Recent Surge:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 13 January 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) surged higher early in the Asian session as the pair appreciated above the 18800 level after Stops were elected above the 18385.36 level, a relative high that represented its strongest print in December.&nbsp; Stops were also elected above the 17933.40 area during the ascent, a level that represents the 78.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 18385.36 to 16273.40.&nbsp; If BTC/USD adds to recent gains, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp; Selling pressure intensified around the 17510.29 area recently and knocked BTC/USD lower to the 17315 level, a test of the 23.6% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 16670.82 to 17510.29.&nbsp; Additional downside retracement levels in the appreciating range include the 17189, 17090, 16991, 16868, and 16850 levels.&nbsp; Another technically significant range that traders are monitoring is the appreciation from 16326.16 to 17510.29, and corresponding retracement levels include the 17230, 17057, 16918, 16778, 16605, and 16579 levels</p>
<p>BTC/USD depreciated approximately 64% in 2022, was off more than 3% in December, and is up approximately 12.9% month-to-date. Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas. &nbsp;Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Previous selling pressure around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels may result in possible tests of the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 17200.43 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 17723.51.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;19199.48/ 20070.64/ 20837.83 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>BTC/USD depreciated approximately 64% in 2022, was off more than 3% in December, and is up approximately 12.9% month-to-date. Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas. &nbsp;Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Previous selling pressure around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels may result in possible tests of the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 17200.43 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 17723.51.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;19199.48/ 20070.64/ 20837.83 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Big data, AI, and cryptocurrencies have all converged in recent years to make the financial sector much more intricate and fast-moving than it ever was. With a CAGR of 11.1% from 2021 to 2028, the worldwide cryptocurrency industry is forecast to grow rapidly, reaching USD 1,902.5 mln by 2028.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As stated in their research titled "Cryptocurrency Market," published by Fortune Business Insight in 2020, the market was worth USD 826.6 million.</p>
<p>The significance of confidence in traditional institutions is reflected in differences in bitcoin valuations across countries, and new financing mechanisms make it possible for more entrepreneurs to begin enterprises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crypto and AI, when used appropriately, can also assist in eliminating prejudice from recruiting and other crucial procedures.</p>
<p>However, with these prospects come new obstacles that will necessitate society having tough dialogues, the consequences of which will influence the future of economics. Let's look at it with a level head.</p>
<p>Access to Post-Virus World</p>
<p>The sheer quantity and level of detail of the financial data that is currently available to financial institutions are believed by many to have far-reaching ramifications. In the past, for instance, "subprime" communities were all seen as relatively dangerous, which made it challenging for financial institutions to extend credit to those individuals in such populations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a consequence of this, financial lending institutions mitigated the risk associated with their operations by offering an average rate of interest to the general populace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By combining ubiquitous access to extensive data with sophisticated algorithms, lenders may better discern "good" peers from "bad" peers in the lending industry today. Those who are regarded as having a lower credit risk are put at a disadvantage as a result of this, even as it lowers the cost of financing for those who are regarded as having a superior credit risk.</p>
<p>A negative credit score may be a consequence of imprudent financial decisions made by a person or corporation; however, there is also the possibility that another big issue played a substantial part in the situation.</p>
<p>A Progressive Square One For Startups&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data-driven technologies produced by the fusion of crypto and AI are not only making it easier to develop groundbreaking new goods but also making it more affordable to launch a company from scratch. Many of the once-fixed expenditures associated with launching a new technology enterprise are now movable targets, thanks to the development of available-to-rent cloud-based services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specifically, the launch of crypto and AI supporting trading bots like Bitcoin prime has further eased out the financial plans for newbies who have just stepped into the market. As all one has to do is sign up with it and take worthy financial suggestions or better investments while conducting transactions in different currencies, securely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Banking AI targeting algorithms will require clear wording from the developers. Will we now penalize people if they suffer an unlucky shock, such as being sick? The magnitude of this problem is enormous.</p>
<p>The reduced cost of getting a company off the ground coincides with developments that make risk management easier for venture capitalists (VCs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to the last five or ten years, the typical venture capitalist would spend months conducting due diligence before making an investment in a firm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today's venture capitalists are more inclined to make multiple, smaller investments in a wide variety of firms, some of which may provide products that are identical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further streamline the process, venture capitalists may make their initial investments in the form of "convertible notes" that are pre-set to convert in the case of a subsequent fundraising round.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This method allows venture capitalists to spread their risk among a larger pool of prospective entrepreneurs operating in the same industry by allowing market data to determine which startups ultimately succeed.</p>
<p>Potentially substantial changes may result from these alterations: Women and people of color, who historically have been denied equitable access to financial resources, will make up a sizable portion of the next wave of entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Seeing Global Crypto-Sector With A New Lens&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2019, Bitcoin and other digital currencies were traded by more nearly 50 million investors globally. Researches show that there are substantial variances in the value of cryptocurrencies across markets, with the discrepancies being based on the underlying institutional dynamics including public attitudes in each region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, the daily average difference here between the United States with Korea was above 15% and occasionally approached 40% from December 2017 to February 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So why is there a "kimchi premium," exactly? Limited capital movement across countries is a major contributor to the large pricing discrepancies, as it reduces the availability of arbitrage opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To put it plainly, it's not possible to make a profit by making a low purchase in NYC and a high sale in Seoul.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surveys indicate that people in nations with less developed financial markets place a higher value on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A higher level of confidence in the monetary system tends to reduce the perceived value of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Summing Up&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each passing day sees the relation between crypto and AI become more dynamic and more efficient than humans at performing mundane activities; the question now is whether or not AI will eventually replace people in every industry. That is simply not the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technology and its human complement are not antagonistic. Though it may shake up the status quo at first, eventually it will help pave the way for whole new possibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies today need to adopt a new culture in which innovation and lifelong education are valued highly. This paves the way for more flexibility, adaptation, and development.</p>
<p>What the fiscal tremors of 2020 will do to the crypto market, AI, plus big data is still unknown. But one thing is sure: as long as there are innovators, the velocity of change will only quicken.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">The crypto market is constantly evolving and changing. Every year brings new challenges and opportunities. To stay ahead of the curve, it's important to be aware of the latest developments in space. One of the most exciting developments in crypto space is OrbeonProtocol (ORBN). Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a new venture capital-based cryptocurrency that promises to offer better gains than existing projects like Aave (AAVE) and Tron (TRX). In this article, we will discuss why.</p>
<p class="s9">&nbsp;&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s11">Aave (AAVE) declines by 17% in a month</p>
<p class="s7">In recent weeks, Aave (AAVE) has been steadily declining. A week ago, it was selling for $58 but now it's down to $52. Aave (AAVE) is having trouble gaining acceptance among competing cryptocurrencies. In the past week, Aave (AAVE) has dropped by over 5%. There was a 17.68% drop in the price of Aave (AAVE) last month, which equates to an average loss of $11.34 per token. Such price changes have led the technical indicators to point to a major downward trend in the coming month for Aave (AAVE). Aave (AAVE) tried to recover from its price by embarking on a new developmental journey but it has made no effect on its price. Recently, Aave (AAVE) purchased the NFT mobile game, Sonar, to incorporate it with their social media platforms. Despite the fact that its foundations may be solid, experts do not believe Aave (AAVE) would be a profitable asset in the near future.</p>
<p class="s11">Tron (TRX) is expected to experience major declines this year</p>
<p class="s7">The price of Tron (TRX) is expected to drop in the coming weeks as per the current technical indicators. Since April 2021, the price of Tron (TRX) has been trading below its all-time high. Furthermore, experts predict that Tron&rsquo;s (TRX) downward trend is expected to continue. Currently, the Tron (TRX) price is trading at $0.055, down from its all-time high of $0.30. Tron (TRX) has consistently been in a volatile cycle throughout the last year and has dropped significantly. With highs of $0.09 to lows of $0.045, there hasn&rsquo;t been much that Tron (TRX) investors are looking forward to. Additionally, the weekly time frame's heavy bearish divergence suggests that Tron&rsquo;s (TRX) price will fall and a drop to around $0.036 is likely. There is a wide range of opinions on what the price of Tron (TRX) will be throughout the rest of 2023. At the end of the year, experts predict a drop to $0.044703, or a greater low of $0.005519, for Tron (TRX).</p>
<p class="s11">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) goes up by 600%</p>
<p class="s7">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) paves the way for ordinary people to put money into startups. To help startups raise capital, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) issues fractionalized NFTs backed by equity. This enables Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) to serve as a decentralized trading platform for financial assets. These fractionalized NFTs are priced as low as $1 with the help of OrbeonProtocol&rsquo;s (ORBN) platform and can be purchased by investors to represent equities in companies. If an investment round fails to reach its goal, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) will return the investments using its "Fill or Kill" strategy. Thus, in the event that a fundraising campaign is unsuccessful, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) would return investors' funds in full. Additionally, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) holders are eligible for benefits like reduced trading fees, reduced fees for staking, and voting rights in governance. The third presale phase of Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is almost complete, with current prices at $0.0435. More than 987% has been gained during the ongoing presale phase of Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), and over 6000% more is expected in the coming months.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Samsung launches the 2nd Bitcoin Futures ETF in the whole of Asia. Begins trading on January 13.</p>
The Samsung Bitcoin Futures ETF
<p>Samsung Asset Management Hong Kong (SAMHK), a subsidiary of Samsung Asset Management, designed the ETF to track the spot price of Bitcoin by investing in Bitcoin futures products listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The ETF will mainly invest in the CME Bitcoin Futures, with a small portion of investments in the CME Micro-Bitcoin Futures.</p>
Interest in crypto increases
<p>The launch of the ETF comes at a time when there is increasing interest from both government and institutional investors in Hong Kong for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Recently, Hong Kong&rsquo;s finance secretary Paul Chan announced at a Web3 forum that the region was still committed to being a hub for cryptocurrencies, and then this was followed by the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB), a Hong Kong regulator, stating that a new framework could allow retail investors to trade on licenced exchanges.</p>
A way of gaining exposure to Bitcoin
<p>This ETF listing provides investors with a new way to gain exposure to Bitcoin, which may help attract more mainstream investors to the cryptocurrency space. Samsung's reputation and brand power also make the ETF an attractive option for investors looking for a way to invest in Bitcoin without having to manage their own private keys.</p>
Is a futures ETF good for Bitcoin?
<p>Some might say that futures ETFs are actually bad for the crypto space given that the value of the ETF is based on the futures contracts, rather than the underlying asset, leaving it open for manipulation by traders with large positions. In fact, it might also be said that a futures ETF is really best for shorting the asset, and is not a suitable tool for retail investors.</p>
<p>It also might be said that this makes it rather odd that Gary Gensler, Chairman of the US SEC, only approves futures ETFs for Bitcoin. Many Bitcoin ETFs have been turned down over the years, but futures ETFs are given the nod. This does rather appear to fly in the face of one of Gensler's main remits, which is to protect retail investors.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Samsung launches the 2nd Bitcoin Futures ETF in the whole of Asia. Begins trading on January 13.</p>
The Samsung Bitcoin Futures ETF
<p>Samsung Asset Management Hong Kong (SAMHK), a subsidiary of Samsung Asset Management, designed the ETF to track the spot price of Bitcoin by investing in Bitcoin futures products listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The ETF will mainly invest in the CME Bitcoin Futures, with a small portion of investments in the CME Micro-Bitcoin Futures.</p>
Interest in crypto increases
<p>The launch of the ETF comes at a time when there is increasing interest from both government and institutional investors in Hong Kong for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Recently, Hong Kong&rsquo;s finance secretary Paul Chan announced at a Web3 forum that the region was still committed to being a hub for cryptocurrencies, and then this was followed by the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB), a Hong Kong regulator, stating that a new framework could allow retail investors to trade on licenced exchanges.</p>
A way of gaining exposure to Bitcoin
<p>This ETF listing provides investors with a new way to gain exposure to Bitcoin, which may help attract more mainstream investors to the cryptocurrency space. Samsung's reputation and brand power also make the ETF an attractive option for investors looking for a way to invest in Bitcoin without having to manage their own private keys.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain game developer N3twork Studios has pulled off a major coup by hiring Tinder Chief Product Officer Josh Sell to become its new Chief Operating Officer. Sell is joining N3twork Studios to help the company achieve its goal of revolutionizing the video games industry through the integration of new Web3 capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>N3twork Studios is getting an experienced executive in Sell, who spent years in the video games industry prior to joining Tinder. Notably, Sell served at the developer Glu Mobile, assisting with the development of its hit Deer Hunter franchise. He also worked on the Farm Heroes franchise at King, where he served as its vice president and general manager, co-founded the Web3 gaming startup Midnight, and held the role of GM of Mobile at NCSoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During Sell&rsquo;s time at Tinder, he helped oversee a range of new product features for the popular dating app, including the new &ldquo;Explore Tab&rdquo; that provides users with a new way to search for matches across the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sell&rsquo;s extensive expertise will come in handy for N3twork Studios, which is a Web3 gaming studio that has its roots in the traditional video games industry. The company is the developer of the hit mobile game RPG Legendary: Game of Heroes, which has racked up more than $300 million in lifetime revenue. These days, N3twork Studio is more focused on so-called &ldquo;blockchain games&rdquo; that incorporate NFTs and play-to-earn rewards, and Sell will be tasked with assisting in the ongoing development and rollout of new titles such as Legendary: Heroes Unchained and Triumph, which will launch globally later this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The addition of Sell means N3twork Studios is well placed to fulfill its mission of merging the gaming industry with Web3. The company boasts more than 80 gaming industry veterans on its books that have contributed to some of the world&rsquo;s most recognizable free-to-play games, and is led by its President Matt Richetti, who previously worked at companies such as PerBlue Entertainment, Kabam, and Zynga.</p>
<p>Richetti welcomed Sell with open arms, describing him as a &ldquo;world-class product executive&rdquo; with tons of experience in both Web2 and Web3. &ldquo;With Josh on board, we&rsquo;ll be able to take our two upcoming titles to the next level, particularly as we move into live operations on both in 2023,&rdquo; Richetti promised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at the bigger picture, Sell&rsquo;s move to N3twork Studios is just the latest in a trend that has seen a number of notable Web2 names up sticks and move to the emerging Web3 industry. Last year we saw former Googler and YouTube executive Ryan Watt join the Ethereum scaling platform Polygon as its new CEO, while Pravjit Tiwana left an executive role at Amazon Web Services to take on a leading position at the crypto exchange Gemini.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sell said he was attracted to N3twork Studios by both the company&rsquo;s mission, and its talented team of developers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The folks I met with prior to joining were all intrinsically motivated by consumer experience,&rdquo; Sell said. &ldquo;Their views lined up perfectly with my own around how Web3 can drive genuine and sustained player benefit. I also got my hands on the product(s) before joining and loved them; there&rsquo;s a huge opportunity for success here.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s not clear is how much Sell&rsquo;s move was motivated by Tinder&rsquo;s recent decision to reject Web3. Last August, Tinder sprang a major surprise when it announced the sudden departure of its former CEO Renate Nyborg, shortly after the company posted lower-than-expected financial results. At the time of Nyborg&rsquo;s departure, Tinder also said it would be canceling plans initiated by Nyborg to adopt cryptocurrencies and experiment with metaverse-based dating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The decision may well have been at odds with Sell&rsquo;s own beliefs about the prospects of Web3.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Web3 fundamentally changes how gamers can take ownership of their experience, both through the freedom of open economies and through the ability to influence development,&rdquo; he added in a statement. &ldquo;Developers in the Web3 space have already learned a lot, and the next generation of titles will offer a deeper, more engaging experience on a level playing field to AAA games.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>New York, United States, 10th January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>The program aims to help Web3&rsquo;s rising stars boost their media presence, community growth and brand awareness in exchange for project tokens.</p>
<p>The Web3 space is growing rapidly and new startups are emerging daily, with investment into Web3 projects skyrocketing to $30 billion in 2021 and around $36 billion in 2022.</p>
<p>While many Web3 founders have great ideas and a strong value proposition to bring to the space, this is a challenging field riddled with competition and a lack of trust from the broader audience.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013, Cointelegraph has grown to become a world leader in the digital assets, metaverse and emerging technologies media space, with over 20 million readers worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company is now looking to help other rising stars reach their full potential and is delighted to introduce its Accelerator program &mdash; a startup booster leveraging the company&rsquo;s capabilities as a strong media and strategic partner, including content, branding, network, marketing, investor relations and much more.</p>
What is the Cointelegraph Accelerator program?
<p>Cointelegraph Accelerator will leverage the expertise of the global Cointelegraph team, which consists of over 150 professionals working across and developing global media products in 11 different languages.</p>
<p>The program focuses on decentralized finance, nonfungible tokens, GameFi, Web3 social, cross-chain and layer 2 solutions, as well as other segments of the broader Web3 industry. It has already onboarded over a dozen companies and publicly opened the application process for new candidates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While many accelerator programs focus on advisory, followed by monetary investments, Cointelegraph takes a different route. Participants will be able to receive contributions from Cointelegraph in the form of media products available in our ecosystem including advertorials, individually tailored special projects, educational materials, native content integrations and much more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the program&rsquo;s key features is that it will be run by a separate commercial arm independent of Cointelegraph&rsquo;s editorial team. Startups will be able to participate in the program in exchange for their projects&rsquo; native tokens or equity, subject to specific conditions. By doing so, Cointelegraph will align its interest in the project&rsquo;s success and growth in token value with supported teams.</p>
<p>Strategic support in the program will typically run from nine to 24 months and will be based on the participating startup&rsquo;s roadmap milestones, marketing and strategic goals. With long-term success in mind, Cointelegraph will leverage its vast partner network to offer a comprehensive, 360-degree marketing strategy to support the program&rsquo;s portfolio of projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This support comes in various shapes and forms, depending on each individual project&rsquo;s needs. Cointelegraph can offer support in marketing, branding and introductions to investors, exchanges, mentors, market makers, technological partners and online and offline events.</p>
<p>Paul Solntsev, Head of Cointelegraph Accelerator, said: &ldquo;We are excited to expand our product suite with the Accelerator program, bringing more knowledge and education to our worldwide audience, especially regarding emerging tech startups and evolutions in Web3.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul continued: &ldquo;We welcome companies with strong convictions and innovative projects to apply for the program and join our partner network to bring long-lasting value to the industry.&rdquo;</p>
How to participate&nbsp;
<p>Cointelegraph is looking to support projects in their early stages of development that have already designed a product ready for market, usually between pre-seed and Series A stage. A well-outlined roadmap and project documentation with clearly defined utility for the token are also required.</p>
<p>To become part of the Cointelegraph Accelerator program, projects should visit the official Accelerator program website, where they can familiarize themselves with Cointelegraphs offers as a recognized media leader and brand establishment partner. From there, they can also apply.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Sweden has become the seventh EU member state to grant regulatory approval to the Binance crypto exchange.&nbsp;</p>
Binance Now In Sweden
<p>Binance is on a roll with its expansion into Europe. The world&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange has recently been approved by the regulatory body in Sweden to offer its services in the country. The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (Swedish FSA) has authorized Binance Nordics AB as a financial institution for management and trading in virtual currency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The approval comes after months of constructive engagement and discussions with the regulating body.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking on the matter, Richard Teng, Head of Europe and MENA at Binance, said:&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Our registration in Sweden is the result of many months of diligent, hard work from our team, underpinning our commitment to the Swedish market and our users. We are deeply grateful for the support from the Swedish Financial Services Authority throughout the application process and for the approval."</p>

Binance In Europe
<p>The registration will allow Binance to offer its crypto and Web3 services to all Swedish citizens. Residents will also be able to deposit and withdraw in crypto or Euros, buy crypto with Euros, as well as participate in trading and staking with the Binance Visa card. The authorization has made Sweden the seventh EU member state to grant Binance legal permission to conduct operations in the country. Before this, the exchange had been granted registrations by regulatory bodies in France, Italy, Lithuania, Spain, Cyprus, and Poland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the Regional Lead at Binance for Nordics and Benelux, Roy van Krimpen,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Sweden fully adopts EU laws and has further local requirements, so we have been careful to ensure that Binance Nordics AB has adopted risk and AML policies to match this exacting standard. Our next big task will be the successful migration and launch of local operations, including hiring of local talent, organizing more events and delivering more crypto education in Sweden."</p>

Binance&rsquo;s Global Expansion
<p>The crypto exchange has had a successful 2022, despite the catastrophes that wreaked havoc throughout the year. CEO Changpeng Zhao has claimed that the company grew from a workforce of 3000 to 8000 people in the last year, in stark contrast to many of its peers that have been downsizing their workforce and filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Other than Europe, the company has also focused on its Asia and Middle East expansions by applying for and getting operational registrations in Abu Dhabi, South Korea, and Japan.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Geneva, Switzerland, 12th January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Orange Financial, a multi-chain yield farming treasury, is excited to announce its public mint date on February 1st, 2023. As the only NFT project to offer stablecoin rewards through yield farming to its holders, Orange Financial will revolutionize the world of yield farming and NFTs.</p>
<p>Through its innovative approach, Orange Financial has created a basket of DeFi assets and farming opportunities to provide yield for its NFT holders. The Treasury takes care of all the compounding and harvesting on behalf of its holders and routes the returns back through USDC, making it a convenient and secure choice for hands-off diversification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the key features of Orange Financial is that the Treasury rewards users in stablecoins as opposed to using a native token. This allows holders to receive real-yield instead of devaluing volatile assets. The treasury participates in a wide range of yield farming opportunities to provide the best returns for its holders. With no native token and no fixed interest rate, the Treasury's payout schedule is purely dependent on market conditions and is transparently posted on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>In addition to its diversified DeFi Treasury, Orange Financial is also Polygon native and does not require any staking or interaction from NFT holders after they mint their NFTs. All USDC rewards are air-dropped directly to the wallet of each holder, making it a hassle-free way to participate in yield farming.</p>
<p>Orange Financial NFT's can be stored on cold wallets with no connection to the internet, making it a safe and convenient way to receive stablecoin rewards. With a low cost of entry and no minimum stake requirement, Orange Financial allows NFT holders to diversify into a basket of high-cost-of-entry yield farming projects and receive all the compounding benefits without any additional effort.</p>
<p>Be sure to catch the launch of Orange Financial on February 1st, 2023 and keep an eye out for updates on Orange Financial's progress as we work to revolutionize the DeFi industry and offer real-yield opportunities for NFT holders.</p>
<p>About Orange Financial
Orange Financial was Created from a desire to have a service in the web3 space that simply did not exist: A efficient, yet incredibly transparent yield farming treasury that has no native token and no fixed interest. A treasury that pays rewards to holders only when they are due- and always in an asset that never loses value (USDC).&nbsp;</p>
<p>As DeFi continues to grow the price of entry for certain projects continues to rise. Orange Financial believes everyone should have the opportunity to participate in DeFi. With a low cost of entry, Orange Financial NFT holders are able to diversify into a basket of high-cost of entry-yield farming projects and receive all the compounding benefits without lifting a finger.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency data aggregator CoinGecko has announced plans to incorporate Proof of Reserves (PoR) into its Trust Score 3.0 methodology for centralised cryptocurrency exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a move aimed at raising industry accountability standards, centralised cryptocurrency exchanges will be able to show transparency as regards their assets and liabilities.&nbsp;</p>
Update in two phases
<p>The update will be implemented in two phases. The first phase, which has already been completed, assigns a weightage of 1 point out of a maximum of 10 points in the Trust Score for exchanges that disclose publicly verifiable assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second phase, scheduled for Q4 2023, will encompass Proof of Liability (PoL) and will assign a higher weightage for PoR in the Trust Score methodology.</p>
<p></p>
PoR tracking
<p>CoinGecko first started tracking PoR on November 15, 2022, with the introduction of an &lsquo;Exchange Reserves&rsquo; tab on each centralised cryptocurrency exchange&rsquo;s page. This information is now reflected in the new &lsquo;Reserve Data&rsquo; column on the Top Crypto Exchanges page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Available&rsquo; label indicates that there is official or crowdsourced reserves information for users to explore for due diligence, while the &lsquo;Unavailable&rsquo; label indicates no known data. An icon with a check mark indicates that a third party audit has been conducted on the exchange&rsquo;s reserves.</p>
The CoinGecko Trust Score
<p>CoinGecko's Trust Score was first launched in May 2019 to combat fake exchange volume data and assist users in performing due diligence. Its subsequent updates have included additional rating categories, multiple metrics, and considerations for cybersecurity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Trust Score 3.0 takes into account recent events that have highlighted the importance of public accountability and transparency from centralised cryptocurrency exchanges, and will be continually improved to empower users to make informed decisions.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>INTERNET CITY, Dubai, 12th January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>LBank Co-Founder Johnason Chan has shared a bullish thesis for 2023, tipping the crypto industry to reach new milestones this year. Chan predicts a resurgence in the NFT market, further growth of Web3 through layer 2 solutions and the convergence of TradFi and DeFi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Web3 will be a big opportunity for the next wave of blockchain applications, but more solid blockchain platforms are required to host them&rdquo;, says Chan. The exchange boss claims that blockchains like Ethereum will continue to play a central role in the evolution of Web3, but layer 2 solutions will help new apps to blossom. &ldquo;As more layer 2 technologies mature and infrastructure is built, it will bring new opportunities for the development of Web3.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Chan believes NFTs will enjoy a resurgence in 2023, saying: &ldquo;NFTs still provide new opportunities for underlying assets and blockchain expressions. Currently, NFTs mainly consist of assets for chain games. But they can be used to express so much more. I believe they could be an important force to kickstart the next bull run in this market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>LBank&rsquo;s co-founder also expects GameFi to flourish in 2023, asserting: &ldquo;The development of chain games may usher in completely new opportunities for the video game industry. As more institutions and game studios enter this new market, developers will be able to create more products in 2023.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The penultimate prediction from Johnason Chan is that decentralized finance will see a resurgence, with some of this growth coming from the traditional finance (TradFi) industry. &ldquo;Traditional finance will definitely find a way to implement some of these innovations. We could even see products developed by institutional players being launched on DeFi platforms one day,&rdquo; the LBank Co-Founder says.</p>
<p>Finally, Chan tips digital identities to capture attention in 2023, saying: &ldquo;Digital identity caught more attention last year but we&rsquo;ve yet to see any killer applications utilizing this technology. I expect new DID use cases and apps to flourish this year, making it easier for web2 users to start experiencing Web3.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A Florida judge has ordered the cancellation of FTX&rsquo;s sponsorship of the home of the Miami Heat, paving the way for new bids for the sports arena.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Miami-Dade count stated that unless a new sponsor is found, the stadium will simply be known as &ldquo;The Arena.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
FTX Stripped Of Naming Rights&nbsp;
<p>With the collapse of the FTX exchange and its associated businesses, a Florida judge has stripped the exchange of its naming rights to the home stadium of the Miami Heat. As a result, the FTX Arena is no more. The decision came soon after a court hearing that took place at the Bankruptcy Court of Delaware, where attorneys told the court that funds from Alameda Research were used to fund the deal with Miami-Dade county.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The county was already given prior approval to remove the FTX signage after the Sam Bankman-Fried-led exchange filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2022, shocking the cryptocurrency ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
Search For New Bidders Begins&nbsp;
<p>With the court order taking away the naming rights from FTX, the owners of the Miami Heat Arena are free to look for new bidders for naming rights and other partnerships. Legal analyst, David Weinstein, described the way forward, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their short-term goal, both by filing their own motion and by becoming the recipients of the granting of this motion, is that it will no longer be the FTX Arena. They will have, of course, whatever remedies might be available under the contract to recover lost money. But given the nature of the way everything went down with this, I think it&rsquo;s one of those situations where you cut ties, put it behind you, and move on to the future.&rdquo;</p>

What About Funds Received By the County?
<p>Weinstein added that Miami-Dade county would have to decide what to do with the funds that it has already received in the deal and whether it should keep the funds or turn them over to the bankruptcy court that is overseeing the FTX case.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That becomes something for the court to look into how [Miami-Dade] obtained the money, whether or not they did their due diligence, whether they were duped just like every other investor in this alleged Ponzi scheme. And whether or not they have a good faith basis to say we received that money.&rdquo;</p>

The FTX-Miami-Dade Deal&nbsp;
<p>The arena in question opened in 1999 as the 18,000-seat American Airlines Arena. In 2021, FTX signed a 19-year contract with Miami-Dade county for the naming rights in a deal worth $135 million. Under the deal, the county stood to earn around $2 million a year. The deal raised considerable eyebrows at the time, not only due to its high value but also because FTX was just two years at the time, with its launch complete only in 2019. At the time, Bankman-Fried had stated in an interview,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a pretty good year for us. To the point where, frankly, we don&rsquo;t need to rely on the other 18 years to have the funds for this. So, it&rsquo;s been a phenomenal year for a number of businesses and for the crypto industry in particular. And then I think for us, even more so. And so, that&rsquo;s given us a pretty big cushion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>FTX was not the only entity in the crypto space to go the naming rights deal route before the crypto winter. In 2021, Crypto.com announced it had signed a deal with $700 million with the owners of the Staples Centre, home of the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers.</p>

<p>With the court order taking away the naming rights from FTX, the owners of the Miami Heat Arena are free to look for new bidders for naming rights and other partnerships. Legal analyst, David Weinstein, described the way forward, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their short-term goal, both by filing their own motion and by becoming the recipients of the granting of this motion, is that it will no longer be the FTX Arena. They will have, of course, whatever remedies might be available under the contract to recover lost money. But given the nature of the way everything went down with this, I think it&rsquo;s one of those situations where you cut ties, put it behind you, and move on to the future.&rdquo;</p>

What About Funds Received By the County?
<p>Weinstein added that Miami-Dade county would have to decide what to do with the funds that it has already received in the deal and whether it should keep the funds or turn them over to the bankruptcy court that is overseeing the FTX case.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That becomes something for the court to look into how [Miami-Dade] obtained the money, whether or not they did their due diligence, whether they were duped just like every other investor in this alleged Ponzi scheme. And whether or not they have a good faith basis to say we received that money.&rdquo;</p>

The FTX-Miami-Dade Deal&nbsp;
<p>The arena in question opened in 1999 as the 18,000-seat American Airlines Arena. In 2021, FTX signed a 19-year contract with Miami-Dade county for the naming rights in a deal worth $135 million. Under the deal, the county stood to earn around $2 million a year. The deal raised considerable eyebrows at the time, not only due to its high value but also because FTX was just two years at the time, with its launch complete only in 2019. At the time, Bankman-Fried had stated in an interview,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a pretty good year for us. To the point where, frankly, we don&rsquo;t need to rely on the other 18 years to have the funds for this. So, it&rsquo;s been a phenomenal year for a number of businesses and for the crypto industry in particular. And then I think for us, even more so. And so, that&rsquo;s given us a pretty big cushion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>FTX was not the only entity in the crypto space to go the naming rights deal route before the crypto winter. In 2021, Crypto.com announced it had signed a deal with $700 million with the owners of the Staples Centre, home of the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) is reportedly begun an investigation into the founders of Saber Labs, Ian, and Dylan Macalinao, CoinDesk reports citing persons familiar with the matter. The probe surrounds how the brothers used various pseudonym identities to create or rather orchestrate inaccurate crypto gain metrics. </p>
<p>The investigation follows a report from August 2022, in which CoinDesk reported that the brothers used a web of 11 pseudonymous identities to create an &ldquo;ecosystem of interlocking financial products that double-and triple-counted deposits by passing tokens between themselves.&rdquo; The report details that their enterprise boosted a key growth metric for Solana by billions during the height of the 2021 bull market. Ian Macalinao also indicated that this inflated the price of SOL &ndash; the native token of the Solana ecosystem.</p>
<p>In a never-published blog, Ian wrote:</p>

<p>The metric to optimize for in Summer 2021 was [total value locked (TVL)]. Continuing, &ldquo;TVL can only count if protocols are built separately, so I devised a scheme to maximize Solana&rsquo;s TVL: I would build protocols that stack on top of each other, such that a dollar could be counted several times.&rdquo;</p>

DOJ also Probing Cashio and Sunny Aggregator
<p>One of the people familiar with the matter, investigators are also looking for information on the web of cryptocurrency projects that orbited Saber, including DeFi yield-farming app Sunny Aggregator and Cashio. Cashio is a stablecoin project that famously lost million during a hack in March 2022. The reports indicate that Ian Macalinao wrote the code for both of these projects using pseudonym identities.</p>
<p>Ian described how the brothers managed to create the ecosystem:</p>

<p>If an ecosystem is all built by a few people, it does not look as authentic. Adding, &ldquo;I wanted to make it look like a lot of people were building on our protocol rather than ship 20+ disjoint [sic] programs as one person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the DOJ begins its investigation into Saber and the Macalinao brothers, Saber is still operational and over the past 24 hours handled $4.34 million in trading volume according to its website. Ian continues to work to maintain the project infrastructure, but Saber&rsquo;s Discord server, a space where users can ask questions and obtain updates regarding the project, remains largely abandoned following the publication of CoinDesk&rsquo;s original report. The same does however not ring true for the Discord servers of Sunny and Cashio, whose tokens have all but become worthless, and are full of messages from furious customers and investors demanding to know where the project developers have gone.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In a landmark move, El Salvador has opened the doors for issuing a Bitcoin-backed bond called the &ldquo;Volcano Bond.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The legislation, called the &ldquo;Digital Asset Issuance,&rdquo; will also look to create a regulatory body and create a legal framework for digital assets operating in the country.&nbsp;</p>
A Landmark Legislation&nbsp;
<p>The Central American country of El Salvador has passed a landmark judgment that will see the creation of the legal framework for a Bitcoin-backed bond, dubbed the &ldquo;Volcano Bond.&rdquo; The bond will be utilized to pay the country&rsquo;s sovereign debt and fund the construction of a proposed &ldquo;Bitcoin City.&rdquo; The bill passed relatively easily in the assembly, seeing 62 votes for the proposal and 16 votes against it, and will soon be ratified by president Nayyib Bukele.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bukele had announced in 2021 that El Salvador was planning on raising $1 billion through Bitcoin-backed bonds. The proposed paper began to be called &ldquo;Volcano Bonds,&rdquo; with the money to create a bitcoin mining industry that would rely solely on renewable energy sources, including energy from the country&rsquo;s numerous active volcanoes. The country&rsquo;s Bitcoin office announced the bill&rsquo;s passage on 11th January 2023 on a Twitter thread.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today, El Salvador builds on our first-mover advantage by passing landmark legislation establishing a legal framework for all digital assets that are not bitcoin. As well as those issued on bitcoin. The law also paves the way for volcano bonds which we will soon begin issuing. El Salvador is the epicenter of Bitcoin adoption, and thus, economic freedom, financial sovereignty, censorship resistance &amp; unconfiscatable wealth. When we issue the first of the volcano bonds, we will once again be blazing the path forward for this new monetary revolution.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Cut Sovereign Debt And Create A Bitcoin City&nbsp;
<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which is the technology provider for the bonds, stated that the Volcano Bonds would allow El Salvador to cut down its sovereign debt, fund the creation of Bitcoin mining infrastructure, and the construction of a Bitcoin City. The bonds have been dubbed the &ldquo;Volcano Bonds&rdquo; thanks to the location of El Salvador&rsquo;s Bitcoin city, which is poised to become a bitcoin mining hub that will be powered by geothermal energy drawn from the Conchagua volcano.&nbsp;</p>
A New Financial Hub&nbsp;
<p>According to Bitfinex, El Salvador&rsquo;s new Bitcoin city will operate as a special economic zone similar to those seen in China. The city will offer crypto-friendly regulations and tax advantages and incentivize Bitcoin-based businesses for all its residents. The country hopes to raise around $1 billion, out of which around half would be allocated toward the construction of the special economic zone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bonds will be denominated in US Dollars, along with a ten-year maturity date, and will feature an annual interest rate of 6.5%. According to Samson Mow, who has been closely working with the development of the Volcano Bonds, the bill could transform the country into a major financial nerve center.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The move to pass the new Digital Securities Law, and enable new instruments like the Bitcoin Bonds, will help El Salvador to pay off their existing debts and will be critical to transforming the country into a major financial center of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apart from Bitcoin, the bill also comes with a legal framework for other digital assets. It also creates a new regulatory agency that would apply the securities law and protect users and investors from malicious actors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The new legislation also creates the National Digital Assets Commission, the regulating agency in charge of applying the securities law and protecting the rights of digital asset purchasers as well as issuers in El Salvador, and of deterring fraudsters from operating here.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency market has seen some impressive gains recently, with two projects, in particular, standing out: Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) and Terra Classic (LUNC). ORBN, a decentralized crowdfunding and startup launchpad, has already exploded by 980% in its Presale. Analysts are predicting even more gains from ORBN in the near future. Meanwhile, LUNC rallied over 20%. As for Ripple (XRP), experts are divided on its future price performance. Some believe it has the potential to rise significantly, while others are more cautious. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Ripple (XRP)</p>
<p>Ripple operates on an open-source, decentralized, peer-to-peer technology that enables seamless money transactions. Ripple's clientele includes a number of well-known banks and financial industry companies. Ripple (XRP) is utilized in its products to facilitate the rapid conversion of multiple currencies. Ripple, which was released in 2012, is one of the earliest cryptocurrency projects on the coin market.</p>
<p>The Ripple network utilizes a consensus mechanism instead of a proof-of-work (PoW) or proof-of-stake (PoS) process. The consensus process tries to strengthen the system's integrity by eliminating double-spending.</p>
<p>Ripple will have little trouble reaching the top of the coin market since it can securely execute transactions for nearly any type of cryptocurrency. The price of Ripple (XRP) is expected to rise after the cryptocurrency emerges from its legal battle with the SEC.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Terra Classic (LUNC)</p>
<p>Terra Classic (LUNC) is an algorithmically-governed, seigniorage-style stablecoin ecosystem that is native to a collection of fiat-pegged tokens and Luna.</p>
<p>Terra was founded in January 2018 to facilitate the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies by generating digitally native assets with stable prices relative to the world's major fiat currencies.</p>
<p>Investors in Terra Classic (LUNC) are extremely concerned about the future of their holdings. This is due to the fact that Terra Classic (LUNC) had a difficult year in 2022, as the Terra Classic (LUNC) price sank to almost zero after a major scandal resulting in the collapse of its network.</p>
<p>Although Terra Classic (LUNC) has seen some positive price movement recently, having days where the token rallies by double digits, Terra Classic (LUNC) is currently up 149% in the past 200 days. This renewed momentum has investors confident in Terra Classic (LUNC)&rsquo;s performance into 2023.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN)</p>
<p>In the current crypto winter, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has emerged as a standout performer, having gained nearly 980% in its ongoing Presale. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a DeFi platform that provides users with a secure and uncomplicated way to participate in early-stage investment opportunities.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) was created to assist entrepreneurs in raising funding without the obstacles of the venture capital industry. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) mints NFTs against company-issued equity, and individuals can become investors by purchasing these NFTs beginning at $1.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) places a strong emphasis on security. The "fill or kill" mechanism will repay investors if a funding round falls short, creating a safe environment for both sides.</p>
<p>Analysts forecast that ORBN will skyrocket over 6000% from its initial pre-sale price of $0.004, resulting in a 60x return. The presale of the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has been a tremendous success, as the price of ORBN has increased by 980% within a few months, in large part due to benefits of being an ORBN holder. These include staking rewards, governance rights and more.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ava Labs, the company behind the Avalanche blockchain, has partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to bring scalable blockchain solutions to enterprises and governments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partnership allows Ava Labs to leverage the power and scalability of AWS's cloud infrastructure to provide its customers with a secure and efficient way to build decentralised applications.</p>
<p>The Avalanche network is designed to handle thousands of subnets, each of which can support thousands of decentralised applications and billions of assets. This makes it ideal for large-scale use cases such as supply chain management, digital identity, and asset tokenization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partnership with AWS will allow Ava Labs to bring these capabilities to a wider audience and help customers to easily and securely deploy and manage their decentralised applications on the Avalanche network.</p>
<p>AWS is a leading provider of cloud computing services, with a global network of data centres and a wide range of services that enable businesses to run their applications and store their data in the cloud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By partnering with AWS, Ava Labs can offer its customers a secure and reliable way to build and deploy their decentralised applications, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX has released its proof of reserves and with that revealed that 90% of its user&rsquo;s assets are stored in Binance wallets. </p>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchange WazirX has released its proof of reserves and says that it is India&rsquo;s largest exchange in terms of both volume and reserve funds. Following the chaos that ensued after the fall of bankrupt exchange FTX, most major digital-asset service providers in the industry began publicizing their reserve funds, with Binance taking the lead. As distrust within the industry began to siphon through the industry, many firms had to release their reserves in order to maintain consumer confidence. The latest to join this trend is the Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX. The exchange made its act of transparency public on January 11 and said:</p>

<p>We are not only India's largest crypto exchange by volume but also India&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange by reserves.</p>

<p>The exchange utilized CoinGabbar, a third-party crypto asset tracking forum, to make its proof of reserves public. Per the data, WazirX has about $285 million in total assets displayed in the Tether stablecoin. WazirX&rsquo;s further indicated that 90% of its user assets are held in Binance-based wallets, and the remaining 10% is stored in both hot and cold storage wallets. WazirX said that Binance was its chosen wallet due to its &ldquo;strict protocols and industry-leading technical measures&rdquo; used to safeguard user funds on its platform.</p>
<p>Another revelation to come from the proof of reserves is that over 19% of the exchange&rsquo;s holdings are in Shiba Inu, 9.37% in Ether, 8.28% in Bitcoin, and 8.18% in DogeCoin. The exchange also assured customers that its reserves-to-liabilities ratio was more than 1:1, meaning that it should not experience any liquidity issues should it undergo major customer withdrawals.</p>
