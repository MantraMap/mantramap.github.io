<li>Litecoin started a downside correction from the $95 zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>LTC price is now trading above $88 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $92 on the 4-hours chart of the LTC/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair remains supported for a fresh increase unless there is a clear move below $86.50.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Litecoin price is correcting gains from $95 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-faces-key-resistance-near-28-5k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. LTC price could resume its increase if it remains well supported above the $86.50 level.</em></p>
<h2>Litecoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, there was a decent increase in Bitcoin, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-eyes-upside-break-above-1920/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ripple-price-analysis-upside-break-looms-at-0-485/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Ripple</a>, and Litecoin against the US Dollar. Earlier, LTC formed a base above the $82.50 level and started a fresh increase.</p>
<p>There was a clear move above the $88 and $90 resistance levels. The price even climbed above the $92 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). However, the bears were active near the $94 zone. The recent high was formed near $93.32 and the price started a downside correction.</p>
<p>There was a move below the $92 level. The price traded below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $82.52 swing low to the $93.32 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $92 on the 4-hours chart of the LTC/USD pair.</p>
<p>It is now trading above $88 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $92 level.</p>
<p>The next major resistance sits near the $94 level. A clear move above the $94 level could pump the price toward the $95 level. Any more gains might call for a test of $100. Immediate support is near the $88.00 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $82.52 swing low to the $93.32 high`.</p>
<p>The next major support is near the $86.50 zone. A downside break below the $86.50 support might start a strong decline.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Texas startup My E Listing is launching a <a href="https://www.chron.com/news/article/texas-startup-real-estate-cryptocurrency-17912708.php" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">website that will allow users</a> to purchase real estate in the Lone Star State with digital currency. Right now, properties can only be purchased with either bitcoin or Ethereum, but the company says it plans to extend its digital currency capabilities in the coming months.</p>
<h2>My E Listing Lets You Buy Your Dream Home with BTC</h2>
<p>My E Listing CEO Caleb Richter stated in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>This initiative will drive innovation in the crypto and real estate industries. Real estate commerce needs to be changed. It’s hard enough as it is to buy property in your local neighborhood, let alone in another state or country.</p></blockquote>
<p>The move is pushing the goals of bitcoin and its digital counterparts closer to being achieved. What many people likely forget is that while bitcoin and many of its crypto cousins have taken on either speculative or even hedge-like statuses in recent years, many of them were initially designed to serve as payment tools. They were built to push checks, credit cards, and fiat currencies to the side, but this has been a relatively slow journey given the volatility that continues to drag them down.</p>
<p>It is extremely hard to understand when bitcoin and its crypto family will go up or down when it comes to their prices. Many stores and companies have been reluctant to say “yes” when it comes to accepting crypto payments for this reason, and to a degree, we can’t blame them.</p>
<p>Consider the following scenario: someone walks into a store and buys $50 worth of merchandise with bitcoin. For one reason or another, the store doesn’t trade the BTC into fiat right away and about 24 hours go by. From there, the price of BTC goes down and that $50 becomes $40. The customer gets to keep everything he or she bought, but the store loses money in the end. Is this a fair situation? Not everyone thinks so.</p>
<p>That’s what makes enterprises like My E Listing so important. They understand the initial purposes of bitcoin and digital currencies and are trying to transform them into usable tools that everyday people can benefit from.</p>
<h2>A Lot of Crypto Love</h2>
<p>Texas has long been a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/texas-is-still-a-major-crypto-mining-hub/" data-wpel-link="internal">major hub for crypto</a> activity and businesses. The state opened its borders to the many crypto miners in China after their native <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-crypto-mining-clampdown-in-china-is-not-over/" data-wpel-link="internal">country disallowed the practice</a> of extracting new units of digital currency from the blockchain. Many went to Texas so that they could continue their operations and take advantage of the region’s vast open spaces and cheap electricity prices.</p>
<p>The company has also announced a partnership with Coinbase. The leading digital currency exchange will aid the firm by converting cash into BTC or ETH and vice versa, thus allowing transactions to occur with ease.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An elderly woman – who’s choosing not to be named at the time of writing – has been scammed out of $20K through <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/newton-grandmother-scammed-out-of-20000-used-bitcoin-atms-to-send-money/ar-AA1a4XM7" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the illicit use of a bitcoin</a> ATM.</p>
<h2>Woman Loses $20K to Bitcoin Fraud</h2>
<p>The woman recalled in an interview how the situation came about. She received a call from someone claiming to be a federal agent, and he mentioned she had potentially been the subject of identity theft. She commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>He said, &#8216;Alright, are you ready to go to the bank?&#8217; I said yes.” He spelled his name for me. He had me put his phone number into Google. It took me directly to the US Marshals Service website.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the site is a distinct warning claiming events like these are becoming very common. Nevertheless, the woman either didn’t see it or wasn’t aware that the situation was <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/scam/" data-wpel-link="internal">scam-ridden</a>. She said there was no threatening tone from her caller, and thus she had no choice but to take things seriously.</p>
<p>She said she was instructed to go to her local bank and withdraw some money. From there, she was told to go to a bitcoin ATM and purchase the asset. She was told, in her own words:</p>
<blockquote><p>Then, you&#8217;re going to go and use that money to buy bitcoin. It&#8217;ll go into a wallet that is strictly yours. Your name is on it. It&#8217;s your money.</p></blockquote>
<p>When she went to the bank to withdraw the necessary funds (which turned out to be around $30K), she said she wasn’t questioned by any of the tellers, and nobody hinted that things may not be what they seemed. She mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>The teller said, &#8216;We don&#8217;t carry that kind of money. The best we can do is give you $9,000 and small bills.’ He called over and found out the branch in Needham could give me $10,000.</p></blockquote>
<p>After she had sent about $20K to the person she spoke with on the phone, she stopped at her attorney’s office and asked him for advice about what to do regarding the situation. She wasn’t two sentences in when her attorney said she was being victimized.</p>
<p>Her bank – Citizens Bank – has put out a statement concerning her situation. It reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are sorry to hear that one of our customers may have been the victim of a scam&#8230; We do work closely with law enforcement when incidents occur and provide training for our colleagues in order to help detect such incidents.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Money May Have Disappeared</h2>
<p>Police in her town are investigating the matter, but it’s likely her money is gone. The woman said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m just pulling myself together now. It was just a terrible ordeal. This can happen to you. It doesn&#8217;t matter how smart you are. It doesn&#8217;t matter how skeptical you are. You can be had. They&#8217;re very good at what they do.</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>At the time of writing, the price of bitcoin – the world’s number one digital currency by market cap – has fallen towards $28K, about $2,000 less from where it was just a few weeks ago.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the time of writing, the price of bitcoin – the world’s number one digital currency by market cap – has fallen towards $28K, about $2,000 less <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/04/20/bitcoin-moves-toward-28000-as-worlds-largest-crypto-extends-losses/?sh=6b23c6965b2f" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">from where it was just a few</a> weeks ago. During that period, the currency rose to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-rose-to-30k-in-mid-april-analysts-discuss-why/" data-wpel-link="internal">about $30K for the</a> first time in about ten or 11 months, giving everyone the feeling that it was somehow stepping onto an entirely new bullish path.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Has Fallen Back a Bit</h2>
<p>Crypto analyst Tim Enneking recently blamed rising <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/federal-reserve-hikes-rates-again-what-will-happen-to-btc/" data-wpel-link="internal">federal interest rates</a> for why the price of bitcoin continues to endure small periods of suffering. In an interview, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The entire world (crypto and fiat) is basically on tenterhooks waiting for the May 3 FOMC decision… Although the correlation between crypto and fiat has generally weakened this year, major events still cause correlation, and the pending FOMC decision has halted the upward movement of crypto. That, plus regulatory uncertainty (the SEC and Bittrex, MICA), banking difficulties (Silvergate, Signature), and contagion fears (banking, commercial real estate) are all conspiring to create a retracement after what, for BTC especially, has been a major move up.</p></blockquote>
<p>The price of bitcoin also appears to have been hit by the news of Coinbase potentially looking into relocating to Bermuda. The top crypto exchange has applied for a license in that part of the world and will allegedly investigate leaving the U.S. While customers in America will still be serviced, Coinbase is not likely to remain within the nation’s borders. The company has cited ongoing regulatory concerns as the reason for the move.</p>
<p>Not long ago, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">Coinbase was hit with a Wells</a> notice by the SEC, who said that while the exchange had not yet been charged with a crime, charges were likely coming. Coinbase took issue with this and said it met with the SEC several times over the course of the last nine years to ensure it remained compliant.</p>
<p>Scott Melker – a crypto writer and investor – said the latest bitcoin slide is nothing to worry about, commenting:</p>
<blockquote><p>For now, this is nothing more than a healthy retracement after an overextended move to the upside.</p></blockquote>
<p>Marc Bernegger – co-founder of crypto fund Alt Alpha Digital – also threw his two cents into the mix, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>I personally think that the massive gains in recent weeks made investors take some profits from the table, which might have been a trigger for this long squeeze.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Rises May Still Occur</h2>
<p>Some analysts believe the price of bitcoin is going to do quite well in the future. Robert Kiyosaki – author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad” – for example, has <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/rich-dad-poor-dad-author-says-people-s-money-bitcoin-on-its-way-to-100k-1032249559" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">commented that bitcoin</a> will soon hit $100K. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>People support [bitcoin], not Fed or gov. [Bitcoin] did not need Fed or gov bailout because [bitcoin] people&#8217;s money. [Bitcoin] to $100k. Long live [bitcoin].</p></blockquote>

<li>There is a major bullish trend line forming with support near $0.0752 on the 4-hours chart (data feed via Kraken).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to move up if it breaks the $0.0780 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>TRON price started a fresh increase above $0.0720 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-faces-key-resistance-near-28-5k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. TRX’s price could rise further if it clears the $0.0780 resistance.</em></p>
<h2>Tron Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, Tron price started a steady increase from the $0.0712 support zone against the US Dollar. TRX’s price remained well-bid and was able to climb above the $0.0755 zone.</p>
<p>It traded above the $0.0780 and $0.0788 levels to move further into a positive zone. Finally, the bears appeared near the $0.080 level. A high is formed near $0.0798 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $0.0669 swing low to the $0.0798 high.</p>
<p>It is trading below $0.0780 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, TRX is facing resistance near the $0.0770 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.078 level.</p>
<p>A close above $0.078 could send the price toward the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tron-trx-price-analysis-rally-could-extend-above-0-08-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">$0.0800 resistance zone</a>. Any more gains might send TRX price toward $0.0825, above which the price could even rise toward $0.085. On the downside, initial support is near the $0.0752 level.</p>
<p>There is also a major bullish trend line forming with support near $0.0752 on the 4-hours chart. The next major support is now forming near $0.0718 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $0.0669 swing low to the $0.0798 high.</p>
<p>If there is a downside break below the $0.0718 support, the price might revisit the $0.0700 support. Any more losses might call for a move toward the $0.0665 zone in the near term.</p>

<li>Bitcoin price started a fresh increase above the $27,500 zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading above $27,400 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key contracting triangle forming with resistance near $28,000 on the 4-hour chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to rise if it stays above the $27,150 support zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin price is showing positive signs above $2,000 against the US Dollar. BTC might correct lower but dips could be limited below the $27,150 zone.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price started a steady increase from the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-eyes-another-increase-to-30k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">$26,000 support zone</a>. The price gained and cleared many hurdles near the $26,500 and $27,000 levels.</p>
<p>There was a clear move above the $27,500 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). The price even rallied above the $28,000 resistance zone. However, the bears were active near the $28,500 zone. A high was formed near $28,473 before there was a downside correction.</p>
<p>The price traded below $28,000 and the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $25,864 swing low to the $28,473 high. The price is now trading well above $27,200 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-faces-uphill-task-near-27250/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>.</p>
<p>Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $28,000 level. There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance near $28,000 on the 4-hour chart of the BTC/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $28,500 level, above which the price could rise toward the $29,500 zone.</p>
<p>Any more gains might send the price toward the $30,000 zone. If there is no upside break, the price might start a downside correction below $27,500.</p>
<p>The next key support is near the $27,150 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $25,864 swing low to the $28,473 high. Any more losses might call for a move toward the $26,550 support zone.</p>
<div id="attachment_78575" style="width: 1834px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2023/05/Bitcoin-4.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-78575" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-78575" src="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2023/05/Bitcoin-4.png" alt="Bitcoin Price" width="1834" height="845" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-78575" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Price</p></div>
<p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XBTUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="exclude">chart</a>, Bitcoin price is trading above $27,200 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). Overall, the price could continue to rise if it stays above the $27,150 support zone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many analysts believe the present wave <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/04/20/biggest-ever-crypto-cycle-has-already-quietly-begun-after-huge-bitcoin-and-ethereum-price-rally/?sh=2d64daf31b28" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">of price hikes and technical</a> upgrades recently enjoyed by leading digital currencies like bitcoin and Ethereum will lead to a huge surge in institutional crypto investing.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin and Ethereum May Be Boosting Institutional Confidence</h2>
<p>Not long ago, the price of bitcoin rose to a ten-month high <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-rose-to-30k-in-mid-april-analysts-discuss-why/" data-wpel-link="internal">and hit $30K for</a> the first time since last June. The world’s number one digital currency has been on the rise since the beginning of the year and has nearly doubled its price from the end of 2022 (during that time, it was trading in the mid-$16K range).</p>
<p>But bitcoin isn’t alone in its present ascension. The world’s number two digital currency and the primary competitor to bitcoin, Ethereum, has endured what’s known <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-ethereum-shapella-upgrade-occurred-now-what/" data-wpel-link="internal">as the Shapella upgrade</a>. This has opened the door to all kinds of staked ether withdrawals, which were not available prior to this point. As a result, Ethereum has entered a rather bullish path and recently struck $2K per unit for the first time in what feels like an eternity.</p>
<p>Analysts with a broker called Bernstein believe these elements – and others – will cause more institutional investors to enter the crypto arena. They believe these institutions will view crypto in a much more positive light and seek to add these assets to their portfolios as the prices are likely to gain further steam in the coming months and weeks. In a report, the analysts wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The opportunity to build a new institutional financial stack on the blockchain remains a worthy goal, and serious participants remain focused on the long term.</p></blockquote>
<p>For the longest time, the belief has been that if institutions can get involved in digital currency investing, the industry will take on a much more legitimate and mainstream appearance. However, it’s been troublesome getting them to hop on board as many of them do not see the space as valid or secure enough to warrant further attention.</p>
<p>While there have been occasional institutions out there (i.e., <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-microstrategy-bitcoin-bet-is-already-paying-off-big-time/" data-wpel-link="internal">MicroStrategy</a>, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/square-just-bought-a-whole-lot-of-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">Square</a>, etc.) that have shown interest in crypto, they are ultimately in the minority, and most of them prefer to play it safe with stocks, cash, and bonds.</p>
<h2>The Banking Failures Are Also Playing Roles</h2>
<p>But with <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/analysts-provide-their-thoughts-on-latest-bitcoin-rally/" data-wpel-link="internal">the recent banking failures</a> in the U.S. and Europe, the analysts are confident that institutions will begin to see assets like bitcoin as potential “safe havens” and start investing their money in the digital side of the financial spectrum. They commented in the report:</p>
<blockquote><p>Any potential dislocation, whether on the bank&#8217;s credit side or on the sovereign side… positions bitcoin perfectly as a safe-haven asset alongside gold.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite its recent bullish behavior, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/btc-falls-following-high-inflation-in-the-u-k/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin has taken a step back</a> at press time given there is sudden fear surrounding inflation in the U.K., as numbers were higher than expected.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two men broke into a home in Durham, North Carolina with <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/durham-couple-forced-to-wire-250k-of-cryptocurrency-at-gunpoint-during-home-invasion-police-investigating/ar-AA1a4Gh5" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">guns and forced the couple</a> living there to transfer hundreds of thousands of dollars in crypto to them. The men were armed handguns and allegedly used zip ties to restrain the pair.</p>
<h2>Durham Is the Focus in New Crypto Crime</h2>
<p>The man and the women were both around 76 years of age. They were forced into moving over $250,000 in digital currency funds to wallets controlled by the attackers. Police have issued arrest warrants for the men and say they are looking for their getaway vehicle, which is a BMW X5 built between 2021 and 2023.</p>
<p>The married pair sustained minor injuries and were taken to a local hospital after the ordeal was over. Durham Police Sergeant Jermaine Clark explained in a recent interview that crypto crime containing this level of violence is rare. Clark said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anytime we&#8217;re dealing with a home invasion, they&#8217;re inherently violent. You probably could count on a hand how many times recently there have been cases&#8230; of this magnitude involving cryptocurrency.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clark also mentioned that while bitcoin and crypto are difficult to track, it’s not impossible, and he expressed confidence that his police staff will be able to locate the stolen units and return them to their rightful owners. Clark said:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are investigative tools that can be utilized to assist in recuperating those assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Home invasions in the region of Durham are relatively rare, though they do happen on occasion, Clark further mentioned. Police investigator Christopher Walker said that the best way to avoid getting your home invaded is to refrain from opening the door to someone you don’t know. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>If somebody comes over to your house that you don&#8217;t know that&#8217;s coming unannounced, do your due diligence. Ask for information [or] IDs before you open any door to anybody that you don&#8217;t know.</p></blockquote>
<p>He further advised getting security systems or doorbell cameras installed to ensure you can always see who is near your property. Lastly, you should have solid relationships with all your neighbors and community members so they can keep an eye on your home for you when you’re not around and report anything suspicious.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the case is still ongoing. Police are asking for assistance from residents and requesting anyone with potential information to come forward and report it right away.</p>
<h2>This Is Rare&#8230;</h2>
<p>For the most part, crypto theft doesn’t occur through such physical or over-the-top means. Usually, attackers set their sights on wallets and exchanges and steal what they can, though scams (i.e., <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/romance-scams/" data-wpel-link="internal">romance scams</a>) have also become rather prominent over the last few years.</p>
<p>They’ll often take the form of fraudsters getting online victims to invest in digital currency platforms controlled by their criminal cronies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The European Parliament has approved some of <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/eu-parliament-approves-worlds-most-110912633.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">the most sweeping digital</a> currency regulations the continent has ever seen. A digital euro is also planned to go into effect at some point later in the year.</p>
<h2>European Regulators Are Getting Serious</h2>
<p>The goal is to prevent all crypto traders from ongoing abuse and manipulation. The rules stem from concerns arising from last November’s <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">FTX debacle</a>. As one of the leading digital currency exchanges in the world, the company came crashing down in a heaping pile of bankruptcy and fraud after it was alleged executives used customer funds to pay off loans for another company and buy luxury Bahamian real estate.</p>
<p>European Union (EU) commissioner for financial services Mairead McGuinness explained in a recent debate that the present rules Parliament is implementing would have likely prevented FTX from happening or could have at least minimized the damage done by those in charge had they been established earlier.</p>
<p>She emphasized the importance of ongoing digital currency regulation in her interview by saying that the present rules system requires that all wallet providers (including exchanges) will be required to take measures to ensure all digital currency assets held within their systems remain protected. She also said that those that fail will endure harsh penalties. She commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe that had FTX, for example, been captured under EU jurisdiction, many of its practices would not have been permissible under MiCA.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, the rules are set to bring a certain level of eco-friendly protocols to the present arena. She said that all crypto companies and large providers must provide information on how they’re planning to reduce energy use, carbon emissions, and overall pollution. Lastly, the present regulations will make crypto mirror some of the aspects of traditional finance.</p>
<p>All this, the European Union feels, will make it much harder for cyberthieves to make off with digital assets. Ernest Urtasun – one of the EU lawmakers pushing the regulations forward – said that these regulations bring an end to the “Wild West” status the crypto industry has been holding over the past several years. Urtasun said:</p>
<blockquote><p>For over a decade, the lack of regulation has resulted in massive losses to many first-time investors and provided a safe haven for fraudsters and international criminal networks.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Not Everyone&#8217;s Happy</h2>
<p>Despite being considered a solid step forward, some – like Elizabeth McCaul, a European Central Bank supervisor board member – don’t think they’re going far enough and were critical of the regulations. McCaul said:</p>
<blockquote><p>In line with the principle of proportionality, significant CASPs should be subject to both stricter requirements and enhanced supervision. Neither of the two is catered for by MiCA… What we believe is that having a regulatory framework allows the industry to evolve in a more cohesive and safer environment.</p></blockquote>
