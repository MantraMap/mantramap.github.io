Under the new rules, issuers that want their fiat-pegged tokens to be labeled as “MAS-regulated” will have to meet certain requirements. </strong></p>
<h2>Singapore to Require Stablecoin Issuers to Maintain Minimum Base Capital and Liquid Assets</h2>
<p>Singapore’s central banking institution has finalized its new regulatory framework for stablecoins issued in the country. On Tuesday, the monetary authority said its features seek to ensure a high degree of value stability for the stablecoins it will regulate.</p>
<p>MAS emphasized that feedback from the public consultation launched in October 2022 has been taken into account. “Stablecoins are digital payment tokens designed to maintain a constant value against one or more specified fiat currencies,” the regulator noted in a press release and elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>When well-regulated to preserve such value stability, stablecoins can serve as a trusted medium of exchange to support innovation, including the &#8216;on-chain&#8217; purchase and sale of digital assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>The financial authority also pointed out that the framework will apply to single-currency stablecoins (SCS) pegged to the Singapore dollar or any of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G10_currencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G10 currencies</a>, the world’s most traded fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, and the Swiss franc.</p>
<p>SCS issuers will have to fulfill some key requirements in order to apply for and obtain a “MAS-regulated stablecoins” label for their digital currencies. These cover several important areas such as value stability, capital, and redemption.</p>

<p>Reserve assets for the stablecoins will be subject to requirements relating to their composition, valuation, custody and audit, to ensure value stability, the MAS explained. Issuers will be obliged to maintain minimum base capital and liquid assets to limit insolvency risks.</p>
<p>They must also return the par value of SCS to holders within five business days from a redemption request and appropriately disclose to users information about the implemented value stabilizing mechanism, the rights of stablecoin holders, as well as the results from audits of reserve assets.</p>
<p>This label will allow users to distinguish MAS-regulated stablecoins from other digital payment tokens, the central bank emphasized. Its Deputy Managing Director for Financial Supervision, Ho Hern Shin, urged issuers that want their stablecoins to be recognized as such to prepare early for compliance.</p>
<p>She also highlighted that the regulatory framework aims to facilitate the use of stablecoins as a “credible digital medium of exchange” and a bridge between the fiat and digital asset ecosystems. It’s being introduced over a year after the collapse of stablecoin terrausd and cryptocurrency luna issued by the Singapore-registered company Terraform Labs. The stablecoin rules also follow the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/singapore-implements-new-crypto-regulations-targeting-custody-lending-staking/">implementation</a> of new regulations for crypto service providers in July.</p>

Davidson explained that many people wrongly conflate cryptocurrencies with CBDC when these are two different concepts.</strong></p>
<h2>Congressman Warren Davidson: &#8216;CBDC Is Evil&#8217;</h2>
<p>Congressman Warren Davidson has warned about the dangers that issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) represents for the financial technology industry in America. Davidson vocally criticized the use of these tools, reaffirming his opposition to CBDC by <a href="https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1691050354283048963?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a> on social media that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At least most agree that CBDC is evil &#8211; the financial equivalent of the Death Star. Don’t become an accomplice to anyone designing, building, testing, developing, or establishing CBDC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Davidson, part of the House Financial Services Committee, emphasized that many people wrongly conflated the concept of CBDC with Bitcoin and that banning the existence of a CBDC in America would be &#8220;essential&#8221; to America&#8217;s fintech future.</p>
<p>Davidson&#8217;s opposition to CBDC is not new, as the representative has railed against the concept before, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-representative-warren-davidson-cbdc-corrupts-money-into-a-tool-for-coercion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a> that &#8220;central bank digital currency (CBDC) corrupts money into a tool for coercion &amp; control,&#8221; explaining that there was no way of implementing CBDCs in America without legislation.</p>

<h2>People, Not Tokens</h2>
<p>The congressman noted that the tech behind these tools was not the problem, as he pinned responsibility on the human resource behind CBDC projects. Davidson <a href="https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1691050987014782976?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tokenized assets are not the problem. It’s the people. Entities (including the Federal Reserve, Ripple, Consensys) and influencers are actively working on CBDC projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Davison concluded by <a href="https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1691051791339638785?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcing</a> that he was working on passing a regulation that would &#8220;criminalize designing, building, testing, developing, or establishing a central bank digital currency.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the Federal Reserve is now openly <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/cbdc-faqs.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considering</a> a digital dollar as &#8220;a means to expand safe payment options, not to reduce or replace them,&#8221; it recognizes that it has taken &#8220;no decision on issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and would only proceed with the issuance of a CBDC with an authorizing law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several bills have been introduced to stop the hypothetical issuance of a digital dollar. In February, Representative Tom Emmer <a href="https://emmer.house.gov/2023/2/emmer-leads-effort-to-squash-financial-surveillance-state-initiatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act to &#8220;halt efforts of unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) that strips Americans of their right to financial privacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, in March, Senator Ted Cruz <a href="https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-introduces-legislation-to-prohibit-the-fed-from-establishing-a-central-bank-digital-currency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> a bill to stop the Federal Reserve from developing a CBDC.</p>

<h2>Little Green Monsters, Gurus, Cats, and Prediction Markets</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
After the May 15, 2023 <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cashtokens-take-center-stage-following-bitcoin-cash-upgrade-over-26000-tokens-created/">Bitcoin Cash upgrade</a>, which effectively <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-cash-smart-contracts-comparable-to-those-on-ethereum-possible-via-may-upgrade-1000x-efficiency-advantage-dev-jason-dreyzehner/">enables smart contracts onchain for BCH</a> by utilizing unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs), much development has been ongoing on the network surrounding Cashtokens, a feature that has inspired the creation of numerous non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and marketplaces like <a href="https://tapswap.cash/">tapswap.cash</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a href="https://tapswap.cash/trade">NFT sales</a> and trading activity are still modest compared to other networks, with marketplaces in their nascent stages, and decentralized exchanges (dexs) in <a href="https://app.cauldron.quest/#/">test phases</a>. That notwithstanding, development has been occurring at an industrious pace in the background, as advocates of Cashtokens point to the power of the upgraded chain to enable even more types of <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf">permissionless peer-to-peer exchange directly onchain</a>, for lower fees than other leading protocols. Some NFT collections of note include <a href="https://tapswap.cash/trade/180f0db4465c2af5ef9363f46bacde732fa6ffb3bfe65844452078085b2e7c93">Emerald DAO</a>, <a href="https://tapswap.cash/trade/07275f68d14780c737279898e730cec3a7b189a761caf43b4197b60a7c891a97">Bitcats Heroes Club</a>, and <a href="https://tapswap.cash/trade/f54ce0297a4017cc922aacde5f7abe7a8397a1058b879f5eb9e2a643d4ec2301">BCH Gurus</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As developer Jason Dreyzehner mentioned to Bitcoin.com News back in May: &#x201C;Suddenly it was possible to build very efficient, UTXO-based decentralized applications while preserving important features of Bitcoin Cash: stateless transaction validation (low fees) and zero-delay re-spending (fast transactions).&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Paytaca, creator of the Cashtokens-friendly Paytaca wallet, is now working on a tool to enable anyone to create their own NFTs via a project called Cashtokens Studio. CEO of Paytaca Joemar Taganna is also involved with the Bitcats Heroes Club NFTs. Taganna told Bitcoin.com news:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a need now for a tool for the general public that will allow anyone to create tokens using the Cashtokens protocol. Currently, the process is largely manual, so it is tedious and error-prone. That&#x2019;s why we are building Cashtokens Studio.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
One popular NFT project springing up after the May upgrade has been the <a href="https://nfts.bch.guru/">BCH Gurus</a>. This project is a multi-dimensional NFT endeavor which is currently building price prediction games fueled by NFTs and other tokens on the new protocol.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;The Cashtokens upgrade has allowed for an entirely new ecosystem to develop directly on Bitcoin Cash mainchain,&#x201D; the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> Guru Team told Bitcoin.com News via Telegram, elaborating: &#x201C;The <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> Guru combines the fun and addictive element of a uniquely designed NFT collection, along with a fungible token (Furu), allowing users to play price prediction games onchain through a Cashtokens smart contract.&#x201D;&#13;</p>
<p class="p1">
<p>&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Community and Tech Developments, Crypto Custody Ethos</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Noting that Cashtokens&#x2019; simple token primitives &#x201C;that can allow you to create most (if not all) of defi applications you see in other chains&#x201D; will require some tooling developed from scratch, Taganna says his group is &#x201C;happy to take on part of that huge challenge.&#x201D; Speaking of Bitcoin Cash development over the last few years, the Paytaca CEO notes:&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;The <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> community is becoming more vibrant and productive, a breath of fresh air from the prior years of political conflict leading to splits. We now have individuals, dev teams, and entrepreneurs, supported by well-aligned donors / investors, all working together to make the peer-to-peer cash revolution happen.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Part and parcel of refusing to compromise on <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/decade-old-wisdom-unpacking-satoshi-nakamotos-definitive-quote-on-bitcoin-transaction-challenges-13-years-on/">Satoshi Nakamoto&#x2019;s</a> vision for a money which can&#x2019;t be censored and can be traded with no need for a financial institution &#x2014; an ethos enthusiastically championed by many in <a href="https://t.me/bchchannel">Bitcoin Cash communities</a> &#x2014; is keeping complete control over one&#x2019;s crypto. Non-custodial bitcoin cash wallets supporting the Cashtokens upgrade include <a href="https://www.paytaca.com/">Paytaca</a>, <a href="https://electroncash.org/#download">Electron Cash</a>, <a href="https://cashonize.com">Cashonize</a>, and <a href="https://www.zapit.io/">Zapit</a>.&#13;<br />

<h2>Xi and Putin Advancing China-Russia Cooperation</h2>
<p>Chinese foreign ministry&#8217;s spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a press conference Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are advancing the strategic partnership between China and Russia. Putin is scheduled to visit China in October.</p>
<p>&#8220;The presidents of China and Russia have maintained strategic communication in various ways,&#8221; Wang explained. &#8220;Their discussions cover a rich and comprehensive range of topics. High-level exchanges have proceeded in an orderly manner with extensive exchange of views on bilateral cooperation and issues of mutual interest.” The Chinese official emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>The two sides will continue to advance the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era under the strategic guidance of the presidents of the two countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>Both Xi and Putin are expected to participate in the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-leaders-to-talk-expansion-at-august-summit-host-confirms/">BRICS summit</a> that will take place in Johannesburg on Aug. 22-24. However, Putin <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/historic-brics-summit-to-be-held-without-putin-in-person/">will not attend in person</a>. The BRICS nations comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor has revealed that the BRICS summit&#8217;s agenda will include discussions about the expansion of the economic bloc. South Africa is the host of the BRICS summit this year.</p>
<p>A total of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/23-countries-apply-for-brics-membership-as-leaders-prepare-to-convene-at-summit/">23 countries</a> have applied for BRICS membership: Algeria, Argentina, Bangladesh, Bahrain, Belarus, Bolivia, Venezuela, Vietnam, Cuba, Honduras, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Morocco, Nigeria, State of Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, and Ethiopia.</p>
<p>South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/23-countries-apply-for-brics-membership-as-leaders-prepare-to-convene-at-summit/">invited</a> 67 leaders of countries in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and the Caribbean to the summit.

The changes could include a Republican president being elected, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler resigning, and &#8220;crypto mom&#8221; Hester Peirce being appointed as the acting SEC Chair.</strong></p>
<h2>Possible Changes at SEC That Could Benefit Crypto Industry</h2>
<p>Former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official John Reed Stark highlighted potential changes that could benefit the crypto industry, including the approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), in a lengthy tweet on Sunday. Stark is currently president of cybersecurity firm John Reed Stark Consulting. He founded and served as chief of the SEC Office of Internet Enforcement for 11 years. He was also an SEC enforcement attorney for 15 years.</p>
<p>A number of companies in the U.S. are seeking SEC approval to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">Blackrock</a>, the world’s largest asset manager. However, the SEC has not approved any spot crypto ETFs so far. Stark opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>My take is that the current SEC will NOT approve a bitcoin spot ETF application for a range of compelling reasons.</p></blockquote>
<p>The former SEC official referenced Better Markets, a non-partisan independent nonprofit organization advocating for economic security, which <a href="https://bettermarkets.org/newsroom/sec-should-reject-bitcoin-etf-filings-because-they-will-expose-investors-to-fraud-manipulation-and-other-investor-harms/">outlined</a> on Aug. 9 why the SEC should reject spot bitcoin ETF filings.</p>
<p>However, Stark believes that the SEC could undergo changes that benefit the crypto industry if a Republican is elected president of the United States in 2024. The 2024 U.S. elections are scheduled to be held on Nov. 5. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The crypto-regulatory tides could shift exponentially after Election Day.</p></blockquote>
<p>He explained that under a Republican U.S. president, the SEC&#8217;s crypto-enforcement efforts would likely &#8220;decrease significantly.&#8221; He clarified that this could involve focusing more on fraud cases, &#8220;shifting efforts away from charging pure registration violations (such as the failure of a crypto-trading platform to register as an exchange, broker-dealer and clearing firm).&#8221; In addition, Stark expects the new SEC to “become far more receptive to approving a bitcoin spot ETF and far more likely to take other significant crypto-friendly regulatory actions.”</p>
<p>The former SEC enforcement official proceeded to explain that when a new U.S. president is elected, the SEC chairman typically resigns and the new chairman position is usually confirmed and filled in a span of three to four months after Inauguration Day. He continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hence, should a Republican get elected President, Chair Gensler would likely resign and the senior Republican appointed SEC Commissioner (in this case famed ‘crypto-mom’ Hester Peirce) would possibly become acting Chair.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stark noted that if Peirce “becomes acting Chair of the SEC, given her lengthy track record of dissent and opposition to most crypto-related SEC actions, the world should expect that most U.S. SEC crypto-related enforcement and most crypto-related SEC disruption would grind to a screeching halt.”</p>
<p>Last week, Stark warned that the crypto regulatory onslaught will <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-sec-official-warns-crypto-regulatory-onslaught-will-never-end/">never end</a> under the current SEC.</p>

The bank does not expect the widespread adoption of PYUSD to occur in the near future, noting that the introduction of Paypal&#x2019;s stablecoin will not lead to &#x201C;accelerated regulatory clarity.&#x201D; Nonetheless, </strong><strong>Bank of America believes that stablecoins have the potential to provide a more efficient payment solution.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Bank of America on Paypal&#x2019;s US Dollar Stablecoin</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Bank of America published a Global Digital Asset Strategy report last week covering its view on Paypal&#x2019;s U.S. dollar stablecoin and the Fednow payments system. The report was written by Alkesh Shah, head of global crypto and digital assets strategy at Bank of America Global Research, and Andrew Moss, the bank&#x2019;s global digital asset strategist.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Paypal (Nasdaq: PYPL) is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/payments-giant-paypal-launches-dollar-backed-stablecoin-pyusd/">launching</a> a U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin, called Paypal USD (PYUSD), which will be available to U.S.-based Paypal customers. According to the payments giant, the stablecoin will be compatible with select third-party digital asset wallets and backed by traditional assets, including the U.S. dollar, short-term Treasuries, and cash equivalents.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Noting that Paypal, with 435 million users, is the first global company &#x201C;to launch a stablecoin with regulatory approval,&#x201D; Bank of America stated:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>We expect PYPL&#x2019;s PYUSD launch to drive payments efficiencies and an improved customer experience over time, but PYUSD adoption is unlikely to be significant in the near term, given lack of wallet compatibility, exchange trading pairs or new functionality.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
&#x201C;Over the longer term, we expect PYUSD to experience additional adoption headwinds as competition from CBDCs [central bank digital currencies] and yield-bearing stablecoins increases,&#x201D; Bank of America continued. &#x201C;Investors may have been fine holding non-yield-bearing stablecoins, such as <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> and USDC, when rates were close to zero, but yield-bearing stablecoins will likely become increasingly available and attractive with short-term rates above 5%.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Regarding crypto regulations, Bank of America stressed:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>We do not expect PYUSD&#x2019;s launch to lead to accelerated regulatory clarity, given the stablecoin&#x2019;s issuance does not alter systemic risk for traditional markets, but the stablecoin may face regulatory headwinds if non-banks are ultimately barred from stablecoin issuance.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Bank of America on Fednow</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The Bank of America report also provides an analysis of the Fednow service, which <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-launches-fednow-for-instant-payments-jpmorgan-wells-fargo-and-33-banks-onboard/">went live</a> on July 20 to &#x201C;enable financial institutions, specifically banks and credit unions, to facilitate bank account-to-bank account transfers of customer funds in (near) real-time,&#x201D; the bank described. Shah and Moss detailed:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>We view Fednow as a needed and innovative solution to a problem &#x2013; inefficient domestic payments and transfers &#x2013; that other countries have already solved.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
The analysts explained that Fednow&#x2019;s infrastructure does not leverage blockchain technology, stating: &#x201C;Instead, Fednow uses traditional payment rails to produce an interbank settlement system.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
They emphasized: &#x201C;As the digital asset ecosystem evolves, we see the potential for stablecoins and, ultimately, CBDCs to provide an even better solution that would be faster and cheaper, especially for cross-border payments and transfers, which Fednow does not support &#x2026; We note that the efficiencies Fednow enables are unlikely to be fully captured without financial institution adoption and resulting network effects, as well as development of end-user interfaces and applications.&#x201D;&#13;<br />

In light of these allegations against SBF, Ryan Salame, FTX Digital Markets&#8217; former co-CEO, has expressed his intent to plead the Fifth if summoned, thus becoming &#8220;unavailable as a witness.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Former FTX Co-CEO Ryan Salame to Plead the Fifth</h2>
<p>Merely a week prior, insiders hinted at <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftxs-odd-relationship-with-vertical-farming-firms-a-look-at-exchange-boss-ryan-salames-and-bahamian-pm-philip-davis-trip-to-80-acres/">Ryan Salame</a>, ex-co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, navigating a plea agreement. These sources <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-ftx-co-ceo-ryan-salame-in-plea-deal-talks-private-jet-may-be-forfeited/">claimed</a> that part of the deal might involve Salame parting with his private jet. Yet, with the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-boss-sam-bankman-fried-in-custody-bail-revoked-remanded-to-jail/">re-arrest of SBF</a> and new campaign financing allegations surfacing, Salame&#8217;s potential contribution to the case seems limited.</p>
<p>The authorities have pushed for the inclusion of specific evidence during the trial, while sidelining other bits presented by SBF’s defense. The evidence in question encompasses SBF&#8217;s supposed bank deception, unlawful campaign contributions, international bribery, crypto price manipulation, and the implementation of auto-delete protocols within his firms.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the prosecution is attempting to remove certain defense-related evidence and arguments, deeming them either irrelevant or unjustly biased. These include claims about the victims&#8217; lack of due diligence, the negative impact of the bankruptcy process on clients, the rapidity of the charges indicating ulterior motives, the idea that virtuous deeds signify innocence, and details about potential penalties. The government&#8217;s stance is that such evidence might muddle the issues, misguide the jury, lead to unnecessary delays, or provoke jury nullification.</p>
<p>In a pivotal move, the authorities <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.204.0.pdf">aim to present alleged remarks</a> by the former FTX co-CEO Ryan Salame, now an &#8220;unavailable witness,&#8221; about his supposed pact with SBF to illicitly fund political endeavors. Salame&#8217;s legal counsel has indicated that Salame would assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if asked to testify. However, the prosecution posits that Salame&#8217;s remarks on being a conduit for donations remain valid under the exception to the hearsay rule in Rule 804(b)(3), given they are statements against his interests.</p>
<p>Prosecutors emphasize the credibility of Salame&#8217;s alleged comments, pointing to the trail of corporate funds channeled through his accounts for political contributions. Despite his absence, the government maintains that these purported remarks can be treated as statements against Salame&#8217;s legal interests. Reports have recurrently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-execs-gave-70-million-to-both-democrats-and-republicans-heading-into-the-2022-us-midterms/">suggested</a> that Salame funneled a whopping $24 million to GOP candidates before FTX&#8217;s unraveling.</p>

Economists attribute the ruble&#8217;s latest plunge to the effectiveness of a price cap imposed on Russian oil by Western countries. Russ Mould said a strengthening U.S. dollar could be the reason why the Russian currency has struggled against the greenback in the past few months. </strong></p>
<h2>Impact of the Oil Price Cap</h2>
<p>On Aug. 14, the Russian currency’s exchange rate versus the greenback dropped to a new low of just over 100 rubles for every dollar. The currency’s latest plunge means the ruble has now depreciated by over 8% in the past month and by more than 20% since the start of 2023.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-602571 size-full" title="Russian Ruble Plunges to 16-Month Low vs the US Dollar — Experts Cite Oil Price Cap" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/russ-ruble-e1692079156967.png" alt="Russian Ruble Plunges to 16-Month Low vs the US Dollar — Experts Cite Oil Price Cap" width="640" height="393" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/russ-ruble-e1692079156967-300x184.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/russ-ruble-e1692079156967.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The ruble&#8217;s woes, which appear to have worsened in the past few months, are in contrast to the currency&#8217;s fortunes in 2022 when it was the world&#8217;s best-performing currency for much of that year. As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/american-economists-are-baffled-by-an-unusual-situation-as-russias-ruble-is-the-worlds-best-performing-fiat-currency/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, the ruble&#8217;s performance at the time appeared to defy predictions that the currency would struggle in an isolated Russia.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p>Some experts have nevertheless linked the ruble’s latest woes to the price cap imposed on Russia’s oil by Western countries. The price cap seeks to stop Russia — a major oil exporter — from benefiting from rising oil prices. While the effectiveness of the price cap is still debatable, some economists including Robin Brooks have repeatedly urged the G7 countries to consider lowering the price cap.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Russian Ruble is falling (black), while the global Brent oil price (blue) is rising. This kind of decoupling is highly unusual and is the best piece of evidence that the G7 oil price cap is working. Putin isn&#39;t getting a windfall from rising oil prices like he did in 2022&#8230; <a href="https://t.co/Rqmfm35WYb">pic.twitter.com/Rqmfm35WYb</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Robin Brooks (@RobinBrooksIIF) <a href="https://twitter.com/RobinBrooksIIF/status/1689647911720910848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>China Unwilling to Take Rubles</h2>
<p>According to a BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66496736">report</a>, the ruble’s fall to its lowest rate versus the dollar in 16 months can be attributed to the sanctions imposed by Western countries on Russia after the latter invaded Ukraine. The report added that the move by countries like Germany to ditch Russian oil has also deprived Moscow of an important revenue source. Reduced export revenues have in turn restricted Russia&#8217;s ability to fund its budget.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Russ Mould, an investment director at AJ Bell, is quoted in the report suggesting that China’s unwillingness to take rubles may be another reason why the Russian currency is losing ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exports are down, so hard currency inflows are down, and imports are up, and even reliable trading partners such as China appear reluctant to take rubles,&#8221; Mould said.</p>
<p>The investment director added that Russia’s removal from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) could also be a factor that explains the currency’s slide. However, Mould also suggested that the ruble’s fall may be down to the U.S. dollar’s appreciation in the past few months.</p>

Burry&#8217;s Scion Asset Management shorted the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 for the close of the second quarter, wagering approximately $1.6 billion on an impending stock market collapse.</strong></p>
<h2>A New &#8216;Big Short&#8217;? Michael Burry Wagers $1.6 Billion Against QQQ and SPY</h2>
<p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/big-short-investor-michael-burry-doubts-sec-has-resources-or-iq-to-investigate-crypto-listings-on-coinbase-correctly/">Michael Burry</a> appears to be taking a bearish stance on Wall Street once more, with Scion Asset Management&#8217;s latest Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://13f.info/13f/000090514823000689-scion-asset-management-llc-q2-2023">13F filing</a> revealing a substantial acquisition of put options against Invesco QQQ ETF (NASDAQ: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-QQQ/">QQQ</a>) and SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AMEX-SPY/">SPY</a>). These options have a notional value of $1.62 billion, comprising a staggering 93% of Scion&#8217;s disclosed assets.</p>
<p>Of this substantial wager, $738.8 million has been placed against QQQ, while $886.6 million targets SPY. Despite the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 performing robustly thus far in 2023, the specifics of Burry&#8217;s filings, such as purchase prices and expiration dates, remain concealed. Given Burry&#8217;s successful bets during the 2008 financial crisis, his market moves are closely watched. Yet in a surprising turn, Burry shifted from a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/big-short-investor-michael-burry-warns-of-another-inflation-spike-expects-us-to-be-in-recession-by-any-definition/">selling stance</a> in January 2023 to admitting he was mistaken by April.</p>
<p>He openly <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/big-short-investor-michael-burry-says-he-was-wrong-to-advise-selling-congratulates-btfd-generation/">acknowledged</a> his error in advising sales, even extending congratulations to the &#8220;BTFD generation.&#8221; Alongside these bold moves, Scion&#8217;s latest filing reveals long positions in companies such as Stellantis, Discovery, Expedia, CVS, MGM Resorts, Iheartmedia, and Cigna. It was around this same time last year, in August 2022, when Burry began to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/big-short-investor-michael-burry-dumps-all-stocks-but-one-after-predicting-market-crash/">predict</a> a multi-year recession in the United States, adopting a more bearish outlook.</p>
<p>In March, Burry <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/michael-burry-compares-current-banking-turmoil-to-panic-of-1907-highlights-markets-bottoming/">likened</a> three major bank collapses to the Panic of 1907, and the latest SEC filings indicate that Scion eliminated exposure to Western Alliance Bancorp and Pacwest. As August 2023 progresses, both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 have retreated against the U.S. dollar, shedding 2% to 3% respectively this month. The 13F filing additionally reveals that Scion has divested its holdings in Alibaba Group and JD.com.</p>

<h2>FDIC: Cryptos and Climate Top Risk List for Banks in 2023</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrencies present &#8220;novel and complex risks&#8221; that are difficult to assess amid recent volatility, according to the <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/risk-review/2023-risk-review/2023-risk-review-full.pdf">report</a>. Growth in crypto assets corresponded with more banks expressing interest in crypto activities last year. However, the sector then experienced a crash that exposed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-a-32-billion-valuation-to-financial-troubles-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rise-and-fall-of-ftx/">vulnerabilities</a>. The FDIC is closely monitoring crypto activities at banks and said additional guidance is likely.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Part of the difficulty in assessing these risks arises from the dynamic nature of crypto-assets, the crypto marketplace, and the rapid pace of innovation,” the report said. “Some of the key risks associated with crypto-assets and crypto-asset sector participants include those related to fraud, legal uncertainties, misleading or inaccurate representations and disclosures, risk management practices exhibiting a lack of maturity and robustness, and platform and other operational vulnerabilities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news follows a </span><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/reports-by-fed-and-fdic-reveal-vulnerabilities-behind-2-major-us-bank-failures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about Signature Bank’s (SBNY) collapse that discusses the risks involved with crypto assets and the FTX failure. In the SBNY report, a sharp uptick in withdrawals of uninsured deposits due to liquidity risk management is prominently highlighted. The FDIC delved deeply into the chaos within the crypto industry, pinpointing it and the FTX collapse as a significant factor in SBNY&#8217;s downfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the FDIC claims U.S. banks face increasing physical risks from alleged </span><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ecb-president-christine-lagarde-blames-climate-change-for-europes-torrid-inflation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">climate change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issues as severe weather causes more damage. The FDIC highlights that t</span>here were 18 natural disasters in 2022 that each caused over $1 billion in damages, the third most expensive year on record.</p>
<p>“Increased frequency and severity of climate and weather events present challenges and emerging risks to the banking industry,” the report said. “Changes in climate conditions, including [the] increasing frequency and intensity of severe climate and weather events and other natural disasters, will likely pose additional risks.”</p>
