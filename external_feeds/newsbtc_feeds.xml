					<description><![CDATA[Ahead of Gold, US Treasury, the S&#38;P 500, and others, banking giant Goldman Sachs ranks Bitcoin (BTC) in the top 1 best-performing asset year-to-date, per a Twitter user. Related Reading: MakerDAO Passes Proposal To Deploy $100 Million USDC In Yearn Finance Vault According to Goldman Sachs, Bitcoin has outperformed its cryptocurrency pairs and those major financial institutions of the traditional market with a risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio) of 3.1. The Sharpe Ratio is used to measure market volatility-adjusted performance; the higher the ratio, the better the investment, currency, or stock in terms of risk-adjusted returns. Bitcoin Takes The Lead In Broad Market Recovery On smaller timeframes, Bitcoin continues its quest to regain lost territory.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of Gold, US Treasury, the S&amp;P 500, and others, banking giant Goldman Sachs ranks Bitcoin (BTC) in the top 1 best-performing asset year-to-date, <a href="https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1617594072280989698/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">per a Twitter user</a>.</p>

<p>According to Goldman Sachs, Bitcoin has outperformed its cryptocurrency pairs and those major financial institutions of the traditional market with a risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio) of 3.1. The Sharpe Ratio is used to measure market volatility-adjusted performance; the higher the ratio, the better the investment, currency, or stock in terms of risk-adjusted returns.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In the hopes of generating yield while offering users what its best known for, MakerDAO, the issuer of the Ethereum-based stablecoin, DAI, has approved a proposal to deploy $100 million of Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) in a Yearn Finance yield-generating account called a “vault.” The proposal, submitted on January 9, aims to look for a way MakerDAO could split its treasury allocations and earn yield. MakerDAO To Generate Yields From Yearn Finance Vault Following the approval of the MIP92 (Maker Improvement Proposal 92), MakerDAO plans to begin depositing $100 million USDC to the Yearn finance vault to earn a 2% yield annually, approximately $2 million every year on its YearnFi investment.  Related Reading: MakerDAO Could Replace Governance Token, Will It Provide Enhanced Incentives? Founded by prominent DeFi developer Andre Cronje, Yearn finance is a yield aggregator built on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to deposit crypto assets in the service in exchange for yield or interest over some time.  With a total of 95,666.284 of Maker’s native token, MKR cast in the vote, approximately 68,462 MKR, which accounts for 71.56%, voted in favor of deploying USDC in Yearn Finance, while 27,204 MKR, which accounts for 28.44% voted out the whole idea and 0.0% voted “abstain.” Though the MIP92 has been passed, the proposal still has to go through an executive vote for the concept to be implemented. MakerDAO Attraction To USDC Before the MIP92 submission, MakerDAO had already demonstrated interest in Circle’s dollar-backed token, USDC. Late last year, the DAI stablecoin operator invested a hefty amount alongside collaboration with Coinbase to become the largest stakeholder in USDC. As reported by NewsBTC, MakerDAO and Coinbase Prime have a total of USD 1.6 billion in custody, allowing both partners to earn 1.5% returns from the deposited assets. Notably, stablecoins have seen rapid growth in recognition in recent years. As a result, investors now rely on these assets to protect the value of their investments. Related Reading: MakerDAO Invests Hefty Amount Becoming The Largest Stake Holder In USDC Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, which fluctuate now and then, stablecoins are tied to the value of an underlying asset, like the U.S. dollar. Due to the nature of stablecoins, many investors have found them enticing, especially as a vital part of future finance. With the USDC still lagging behind USDT in adoption, the goal has always been to surpass the latter and become number one in the market cap. Veering back to MakerDAO, the protocol&#8217;s native token, MKR, has also been thriving to cover the gaps between its current price and its all-time high. Over the past 30 days, MKR has surged more than 20% and currently trades above $650 with a 24-hour trading volume of $22.3 million.

					<description><![CDATA[The crypto market’s rally is losing strength, forcing significant cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano, back to their support regions. The latter has been deploying products and development that hint at a longer bullish trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Profit-Taking Spikes, Will BTC Price Recover? As of this writing, Cardano (ADA) trades at $0.35 with a 5% loss in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, ADA’s price still recorded some profits as the bulls made their stand against a spike in selling pressure. Cardano In The Olympus Of Development Activity Data from research firm Santiment indicates that the Cardano ecosystem is vibrating with development activity. Currently, this blockchain ranks number 3 in the metric, according to the number of commits on the software development platform GitHub. As seen in the chart below, Cardano’s development activity over the past 30 days records over 330 GitHub commits for the different projects on this blockchain. Only Polkadot and its experimental environment Kusama have seen more development activity, with 441 commits. As the chart above shows, the price of Cardano (ADA) has been moving in tandem with its developments and the general market sentiment. As more developers onboard the blockchain, the ecosystem is more appealing to investors. ADA records a 38% rally over the past 30 days. In the coming weeks, this blockchain will deploy a new upgrade for its smart contract programming language, Plutus. This update will enable support for the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Schnorr. These new components will allow developers to provide more security and build cross-chain capabilities. Plutus was designed to operate as an easy-to-use and accessible programming language. Thus, people might feel even more incentive to build on this blockchain. Related Reading: Here’s What Might Have Triggered Ethereum’s Decline Below $1,600 It remains to be seen if ADA’s price will extend its recent trend and follow its spike in development activity. According to Input Output Global, Cardano’s lead developer company: This upgrade will bring greater interoperability and secure cross-chain #DApp development to #Cardano, making it easier for developers to work with other blockchains. Developers would otherwise need to spend extra time, effort, and funds to implement ECDSA and Schnorr over the SECP elliptic curves in #Plutus, increasing potential security risks and using an unrealistic amount of resources.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After what has been two weeks of an incredible rally for the price of Ethereum, the digital asset seems to be running out of steam. ETH’s price has now declined once more below $1,600 after a sharp downturn on Tuesday. The culprit for this seems to be growing FUD across the community. FUD Could Have Been The Trigger According to Santiment, the social dominance of Ethereum grew rapidly in the last couple of days. While this can sometimes be a good thing, it tells a negative story this time around. Ethereum is now dominating 21% of cryptocurrency discussion on social media and the on-chain data aggregator says this might be evidence that FUD might be behind the dip. However, this may not be the only reason. Related Reading: Money Leaves ADA, SOL To Small Cap Altcoins, Here’s Where It’s Headed A report from Bitcoinist had previously shown that profit-taking in large assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum had been ramping up with the increase in price. Santiment also highlights this in its post, pointing to the spike in the profit-taking ratio on January 20. Taking this in concert with the growing FUD, it presents a recipe for disaster for the digital asset. ETH social dominance indicates FUD &#124; Source: Santiment Another prominent event was the Wormhole attacker started moving the stolen funds around. On Monday, the attacker moved over $155 million in ETH to OpenOcean which they proceeded to exchange for staked ETH tokens such as stETH and wstETH. The dumping of these coins on the open market saw sell pressure mount on ETH during this time. It contributed to the already declining momentum, resulting in the current dip in the price. Can Ethereum Recover From Here? Despite the recent decline, the overall sentiment for Ethereum is still skewing largely toward buy. This is because the cryptocurrency is still trading well above its 50-day and 100-day moving averages. And even with the decline, it continues to trend around its 200-day moving average. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Could See Another 30% Rally What this shows is that, at least in the short to mid-term, there is still a lot of bullish sentiment surrounding the digital asset. Add in the ample support that has built up around $1,500 over the last couple of days and Ethereum is still presenting as a formidable choice of investment. ETH price falls below $1,600 &#124; Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com Investors are also seeing good profits during this time with 57% of all holders in profit. Figures like these also help to push a bullish narrative for the digital asset as more investors try to take advantage of the dip and move into the green. Overall, as long as ETH maintains its momentum and trading volume continues rising, it’ll retest the $1,600 resistance once more.  ETH’s price is changing hands at $1,555 at the time of this writing. Its price is down 5.27% in the last 24 hours but trading volume is up 11.91% over the same time period to be sitting at $9.32 billion.

<p class="p2">Another prominent event was the Wormhole attacker started moving the stolen funds around. On Monday, the attacker moved over $155 million in ETH to OpenOcean which they proceeded to exchange for staked ETH tokens such as stETH and wstETH.</p>
<p class="p2">The dumping of these coins on the open market saw sell pressure mount on ETH during this time. It contributed to the already declining momentum, resulting in the current dip in the price.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Can Ethereum Recover From Here?</h2>
<p class="p2">Despite the recent decline, the overall sentiment for Ethereum is still skewing largely toward buy. This is because the cryptocurrency is still trading well above its 50-day and 100-day moving averages. And even with the decline, it continues to trend around its 200-day moving average.</p>

<p class="p2">What this shows is that, at least in the short to mid-term, there is still a lot of bullish sentiment surrounding the digital asset. Add in the ample support that has built up around $1,500 over the last couple of days and Ethereum is still presenting as a formidable choice of investment.</p>

<p class="p2">Investors are also seeing good profits during this time with 57% of all holders in profit. Figures like these also help to push a bullish narrative for the digital asset as more investors try to take advantage of the dip and move into the green. Overall, as long as ETH maintains its momentum and trading volume continues rising, it’ll retest the $1,600 resistance once more. </p>
<p class="p2">ETH’s price is changing hands at $1,555 at the time of this writing. Its price is down 5.27% in the last 24 hours but trading volume is up 11.91% over the same time period to be sitting at $9.32 billion.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows Bitcoin short-term holder profit-taking has spiked, will this lead to a correction in the price of the crypto? Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Has Surged Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, instances of the current trend have led to declines in the crypto&#8217;s price in the past. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;Spent Output Profit Ratio&#8221; (SOPR), which tells us whether the average Bitcoin investor is selling their coins at a profit or at a loss right now. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the holders as a whole are realizing some profits on their selling currently. On the other hand, values below the threshold suggest the overall market is leaning towards loss realization at the moment. Naturally, the indicator being exactly equal to 1 implies the average holder is just breaking even on their distribution right now. One of the two main segments of the BTC market is made up of the &#8220;short-term holders&#8221; (STHs), which is a cohort that includes all investors who acquired their coins within the last 155 days. The holders who have been sitting on their coins for more than this threshold amount are called &#8220;long-term holders&#8221; (LTHs). Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR specifically for the STHs: The value of the metric seems to have risen in recent days &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH SOPR (as well as its 7-day moving average) has surged and broken above 1 recently. This means that as the BTC rally has taken place, the STHs have come into profits and they are now selling to harvest these gains. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Declines 6%, Gets Flipped By Litecoin In Market Cap Again The chart also includes data for the 7-day triple exponential average (TRIX) of the STH SOPR. The TRIX is a momentum oscillator that shows the percentage change in a metric&#8217;s moving average after smoothening it exponentially three times (hence the name). From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that during this bear market, whenever the STH SOPR 7-day TRIX has hit a positive top, the price of Bitcoin has noticed a local top formation as well and has subsequently gone down. It looks like most recently, the 7-day TRIX of the STH SOPR has shot up again, and the metric seems to be curving inside now, potentially moving toward a top formation. This pattern looks similar to the instances seen earlier in the bear market, which could suggest this Bitcoin rally may be heading toward the same fate as those previous ones. Though that would be only if the pattern does complete and the indicator makes the top.

There have been some similarities between the current rally and that of April 2019 already, which may mean that the current one could also shrug off this first spike in the indicator and continue its momentum, just like the past rally.

<h2>Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Has Surged Recently</h2>
<p>As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/63d10d294a71fb5ea520e4b6-STH-SOPR-shows-a-bearish-alert" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a>, instances of the current trend have led to declines in the crypto&#8217;s price in the past. The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;<a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-asopr-bull-bear-resistance-break/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spent Output Profit Ratio</a>&#8221; (SOPR), which tells us whether the average Bitcoin investor is selling their coins at a profit or at a loss right now.</p>

The holders who have been sitting on their coins for more than this threshold amount are called &#8220;long-term holders&#8221; (LTHs).</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR specifically for the STHs:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[For traders thinking Solana is controlled by the bears, a popular crypto market analyst, Chris Burniske, is giving a fresh perspective of hope for the major altcoin.    According to the former lead of Ark Invest&#8217;s crypto department, those who think that SOL is generally bedridden in a bearish mood are mistaken. SOL Sets To Make a Breakthrough Burniske said that the Ethereum killer still has a breakthrough opportunity to rally its price despite its reverse down at a resistance level. The prominent analyst urged traders not to be extremely bearish on SOL as the coin would eventually retrace its value. He expects the crypto&#8217;s retracement to occur within the next few months.  Related Reading: Solana Keeps Positive Radiance But Bears Could Dampen The Mood At This Level Burniske, however, cautioned that investors might experience price decline due to the market volatility, which might heighten and cause massive losses for traders who have opened long positions in their leverages. Since the start of the year, Solana has been in a bullish mood and showing signs of resilience and bravery, actually benefiting from the recent market bullishness. Based on the daily and weekly trading movement since the beginning of the year, the current bearish action of SOL can be regarded as a mere retracement, something which is generally seen in other risky assets. Most Ethereum killers, including Solana, are witnessing a similar kind of price reversal, which signals no major panic on the part of the SOL price. Solana Price Analysis Shows Buy Signal Burniske’s projection seems to be right based on technical price analysis. Over the past three months, Solana moved in a sideways trajectory trend at an average price of around the $14 mark. But within the last two weeks, Solana has surged its value by over 68% to trade at an average price of $23.59. At the time of writing, Solana is currently trading at $23.18, down 5.50%, with a trading volume of $801,611,149 in the last 24 hours. The altcoin’s market cap stands at $8.6 billion, which puts it the 10th largest cryptocurrency, according to Coinmarketcap. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Outperforms Top Coins With 28% Gains On Weekly Chart As per the TradingView chart below, the presence of a bullish hammer in the candlesticks signals the buyers are taking back control and pushing the price back above. The green indicator shows the sellers’ inability to drive the price of an asset further down. The 50-day and 200-day moving average settings on the 4-hour price chart further support this bullish trend. The presence of the golden cross, as it is indicated by an asset’s short-term moving average crossing above its long-term moving average, signals a switch from a bear trend to a bull trend. Based on price analysis, the current sentiment is bullish, as this can also be seen in the RSI stands at 64.22, showing that Solana is in the bull territory. Generally, the technical analysis shows that Solana has the potential to regain its value, though it may experience some corrections triggered by macro events.   Featured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On January 24, Justin Sun, TRON Founder, announced that St. Maarten has expressed his wishes to adopt TRON which is alongside TRON’s goals of massive adoption on a global scale. St. Maarten bares plans of adopting TRON TRX price down by 3.31% Price to peak by Q2 of 2023; could potentially shoot to $0.0973 St. Maarten, also spelled Saint Martin, is a country located in the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the Lesser Antilles, northeastern Caribbean Sea.

Essentially, decentralization remains the focus of the TRON project which facilitates the smooth transfer of money between users without any interference from financial companies or middlemen. Another milestone for #TRON! St Maarten to adopt TRON as legal tender marks another achievement for our push on worldwide blockchain adoption.https://t.co/HXEnouj0Le — H.E. Justin Sun🌞🇬🇩🇩🇲🔥₮ (@justinsuntron) January 23, 2023 The contrasting factor lies mainly in TRX unique architecture, as it is dispersed into three categories or layers: the Storage Layer which has a distributed block storage the Application Layer which is mobilized by developers for creating dApps that are used for issuing tokens the Core Layer which consists of varied modules and smart contracts These different layers are interconnected using a protocol that is compatible with multiple programming languages. More so, the network also has built its community which is fostered towards the goal of speeding up the internet’s decentralizations with the use of blockchain and dApps. On December 27, the TRX community merged with the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) bandwagon, which is geared towards promoting best practices with the use of Ethereum blockchain technology, enabling real-world applications and processes. TRON As Legal Tender; Social Volume Up With St. Maarten’s announcement declaring the adoption of TRON as legal tender, its native token responded accordingly with metrics looking positive. TRX&#8217;s social volume spiked which hints at its booming popularity. More so, TRX also exhibited an increased demand in the futures market with its Binance Funding Rate extremely high.

According to CoinMarketCap, TRX price is seen to retreat by 3.31%. The token is trading at $0.06068 as of this writing. Evidently, investors have so much to rejoice about with TRX looking to spike in the next couple of days as seen in the recent market indicators, with the crypto peaking in the Q2 of 2023 or reaching as much as $0.0973. With St. Maarten’s collaboration with TRON, the latter taps into the inclusive and expansive global network which can further boost the island nation&#8217;s economy.

<p>The contrasting factor lies mainly in TRX unique architecture, as it is dispersed into three categories or layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Storage Layer which has a distributed block storage</li>
<li>the Application Layer which is mobilized by developers for creating dApps that are used for issuing tokens</li>
<li>the Core Layer which consists of varied modules and smart contracts</li>
</ul>
<p>These different layers are interconnected using a protocol that is compatible with multiple programming languages.</p>
<p>More so, the network also has built its community which is fostered towards the goal of speeding up the internet’s decentralizations with the use of blockchain and dApps.</p>
<p>On December 27, the TRX community merged with the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) bandwagon, which is geared towards promoting best practices with the use of Ethereum blockchain technology, enabling real-world applications and processes.</p>
<h2><b>TRON As Legal Tender; Social Volume Up</b></h2>
<p>With St. Maarten’s announcement declaring the adoption of TRON as legal tender, its native token responded accordingly with metrics looking positive. </p>
<p>TRX&#8217;s social volume spiked which hints at its booming popularity. More so, TRX also exhibited an increased demand in the futures market with its Binance Funding Rate extremely high.</p>

<p>However, the network&#8217;s development activity has plunged as seen in the past couple of days which could pose problems for the network. According to<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> CoinMarketCap</a>, TRX price is seen to retreat by 3.31%. The token is trading at $0.06068 as of this writing.</p>
<p>Evidently, investors have so much to rejoice about with TRX looking to spike in the next couple of days as seen in the recent market indicators, with the crypto peaking in the Q2 of 2023 or reaching as much as $0.0973.</p>
<p>With St. Maarten’s collaboration with TRON, the latter taps into the inclusive and expansive global network which can further boost the island nation&#8217;s economy.</p>
