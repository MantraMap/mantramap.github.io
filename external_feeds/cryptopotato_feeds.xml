            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; DUBAI, DUBAI, July 6th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>The options trading market gets another boost thanks to yet another collaboration between the cryptocurrency derivatives exchange BIT and the duo of Darley Technologies and DWF Labs.</p>
<p>Just recently, BIT rolled out options tied to Cardano&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bit.com/usd-options?type=ADA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">ADA</a> token in collaboration with strategic partner Darley Technologies and market maker DWF Labs. Today, LADYS Options marks a significant milestone in the industry as the world&#8217;s first Meme-coin Options brought to the market for both institutional and retail traders.</p>
<p>Options might be seen as an intimidating instrument for new traders or existing spot traders. This type of derivative gives the trader the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a certain price on or before a specific date. The core functionalities of options are binary: the right to buy the asset is a call option, and the right to sell it is a put option.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our intention is to simplify access to options trading for all traders, providing an interface that is simple to understand and instruments that are in line with what communities are passionate about. Meme-coins are an excellent way to engage people to learn options trading&#8221; said Andrei Grachev, the Managing Partner of DWF Labs.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are proud to announce the listing of LADYS options as the world&#8217;s first meme-coin options, made possible through the support of our esteemed partners, Darley Technologies and DWF Labs.&#8221; Said Justin Buitendan, the Global Head of Institutional Sales of BIT, &#8220;Meme coins have experienced rapid growth, and we are thrilled to provide our clients with an additional avenue to enhance their trading strategies. LADYS options mark the starting point of an exciting journey, and there are more exciting opportunities on the horizon.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The incredible popularity of the LADYS token, as well as the sudden sprout of related projects, made it the perfect candidate for the first Meme-coin Option to be traded, thanks to the alliance between BIT, DWF Labs, and Darley Technologies.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The venture capital fund Hashed Emergent will host a multi-chain Web3 conference in Bangalore, India, at the beginning of December this year. The event, dubbed &#8220;India Blockchain Week (IBW),&#8221; will touch upon the country&#8217;s increasing role in the cryptocurrency industry.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Indians have shown interest in digital assets lately (especially during the COVID-19 pandemic), whereas some leading crypto-related companies have decided to expand their presence in the Asian nation.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The First Such Event in India</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a document seen by </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CryptoPotato</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the upcoming &#8220;India Blockchain Week&#8221; will be the first Web3 event with pan-industry agenda in India. It will last from December 4 until December 10 and include hackathons and parties.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The headline conference will take place on December 6-7 and will include panel discussions, speaker sessions, and debates with participants part of the blockchain sector. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">IBW will also focus on the latest developments in the cryptocurrency industry, the adoption and use cases of the asset class, and regulations. Last but not least, it will touch upon the emerging Web3 field and its potential advancement in India.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The marketing agency &#8211; MarketAcross &#8211; will join the conference as the global media lead. The entity has played a similar role in other events, including Korea Blockchain Week, Paris Blockchain Week, WebX, and IVS Kyoto.</span></p>

However, it will feature some prominent names part of the cryptocurrency field. Sharing more details on the event was Tak Lee &#8211; Managing Partner of Hashed Emergent:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re excited to bring the first world-class, pan-industry, and multi-chain web3 conference to India, finally giving it the attention it has always deserved.</p>
<p>Bangalore ranks among the most prolific startup hubs worldwide, and Indian startups in web3 have made a considerable impact on the industry, spearheaded by multiple hugely successful protocols and products. We believe that IBW will quickly become one of the most interesting and diverse gathering places for the crypto industry.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Simon Kim, CEO of Hashed, views India as &#8220;a tech innovation hub&#8221; that &#8220;has penetrated the crypto realm with a highly qualified pool of skilled talent and will lead a new wave of the blockchain industry.&#8221; He raised hopes that the conference could emerge as the main blockchain event in the county and position the nation on the global Web3 map.</p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Indians Flock to Crypto</span></h2>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The analysis showed that the residents of Delhi and Bengaluru (where the IBW event will take place) have the highest number of HODLers. </span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cardano ($ADA) finds its recent momentum slowing down, with the token’s price dropping 5% in the past two days.</p>
<p>After a period of sustained positivity, it appears that the bears have regained control – leading many to speculate that $ADA may be on the precipice of another downtrend.</p>
<p>In contrast, new Web3 platform Launchpad XYZ ($LPX) continues to turn heads in the market and has succeeded in raising over $1.1 million through its ongoing presale.</p>
<h2>Cardano Stumbles as Bullish Momentum Comes to an End</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, the $ADA price is hovering around $0.286, following two bearish daily closes in a row.</p>
<p>Price has rejected the resistance zone at $0.300, which was also tapped at the end of June.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for $ADA bulls, price has broken below the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) – a commonly-used proxy for a token’s short-term trend.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-5.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259008" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-5.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="288" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-5.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-5-300x144.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-5-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This break below the 20-day EMA signals that bearish pressure could now start mounting on Cardano.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/onchain-analysis/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CoinMarketCap</a> data, a whopping 88% of $ADA holders are out of the money at the current price – an indicator that the market conditions are causing unease among Cardano investors.</p>
<p>Not only that, but <a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/ADA?pid=coingecko&amp;utm_source=coingecko_widget" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">IntoTheBlock</a> reveals that the number of large $ADA transactions has decreased by 24%, further evidencing the lack of interest from the crypto community.</p>
<h2>Regulatory Uncertainty Adds to $ADA’s Woes</h2>
<p>The recent price drop signifies that $ADA bulls are opting to take profits rather than wait for an extended uptrend.</p>
<p>Regulatory events in the US have pushed Cardano into murky waters after the SEC categorized $ADA (along with several other cryptos) as securities last month.</p>
<p>Following this, major platforms like Revolut, Robinhood, and eToro have announced plans to delist the token – adding further pressure to $ADA’s position in the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-6.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259010" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-6.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="401" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-6.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-6-50x33.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This decision to delist $ADA indicates a wave of caution from trading platforms, even though most in the crypto community contest the “security” label that the SEC has placed on Cardano.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the uncertainty surrounding the token has impacted its price, evidenced by its inability to sustain positive momentum for more than a few days.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this paints a complex picture for the future of $ADA, indicating that caution could be the watchword for crypto investors in the short term.</p>
<h2>Which New Cryptos Look Primed for Significant Growth?</h2>
<p>While the regulatory climate is placing constraints on Cardano, there are still opportunities for new and promising projects to emerge.</p>
<p>One such project that has been turning heads is Launchpad XYZ, which is demonstrating remarkable growth potential during its ongoing presale.</p>
<h2>Launchpad XYZ Revolutionizes Web3 Accessibility &amp; Raises $1.1m</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_596f215c.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=cardano-price-momentum-stalls-while-launchpad-xyz-raises-1-1m" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Launchpad XYZ ($LPX)</a> is an exciting entrant to the Web3 space and is committed to making the complex investing landscape accessible to all users – regardless of their market experience.</p>
<p>This user-friendly hub offers a dynamic interface for trading and investing in various Web3 assets, including cryptocurrencies and NFTs.</p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ&#8217;s listings are backed by real-time insights and market analysis, making it simple for investors to discover promising Web3 projects – as the website states, users can &#8220;find the next $PEPE before it explodes.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-6.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259011" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-6.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="351" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-6.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-6-300x175.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-6-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Not only that, but Launchpad XYZ has a dedication to education. Per the <a href="https://launchpad.xyz/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">whitepaper</a>, users can access resources that help clarify complex Web3 concepts, like DeFi and the metaverse.</p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ will also have a play-to-earn (P2E) gaming hub and a metaverse experience library, allowing users to access these immersive worlds without using multiple third-party platforms.</p>
<p>All of these features are fuelled by $LPX, Launchpad XYZ&#8217;s native token, which can also be staked to access premium perks – like trading fee discounts and beta P2E game invites.</p>
<p>The Launchpad XYZ presale is still ongoing, having raised an impressive $1.1 million thus far.</p>
<p>Early investors can purchase $LPX through the presale for just $0.0445 – a 26% discount on the planned exchange listing price.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The narrowing GBTC discount resulted from the renewed hope for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Grayscale Bitcoin Trust&#8217;s (GBTC) share price discount has dropped below 27% for the first time in more than 14 months. The milestone has sparked optimism among investors and crypto enthusiasts, signaling a positive trend for the popular investment vehicle.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/Grayscale" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">data</a> from monitoring resource CoinGlass, the GBTC negative premium is currently at -26.76%. The last time the shares traded at this level was in May 2022 during the Terra LUNA saga, which sent the entire crypto industry into chaos.</p>
<h2>GBTC Discount Drops Below 27%</h2>
<p>GBTC, owned and operated by the world&#8217;s largest digital asset manager Grayscale Investments, has long been recognized as a prominent investment option for investors seeking exposure to bitcoin without directly owning the crypto asset. The trust holds a substantial amount of BTC, allowing investors to gain indirect exposure to the leading digital asset.</p>
<p>Over the past year, GBTC has struggled and experienced periods of trading at a significant discount to its underlying BTC holdings. The negative premium, a measure of the difference between the net asset value (NAV) of GBTC shares and the market price, has been a source of concern for investors and has often been attributed to the trust&#8217;s structure and unique characteristics.</p>
<p>The GBTC discount can be attributed to several factors, such as the crypto credit crunch in 2021, the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/gbtc-discount-narrows-by-over-42-as-grayscale-sec-face-off-inches-closer/" data-wpel-link="internal">rejection</a> of Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) application, and the financial <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cameron-winklevoss-issues-3-day-ultimatum-to-dcgs-barry-silbert-threatens-lawsuit/" data-wpel-link="internal">struggles</a> of its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG). In December last year, these events caused the GBTC discount to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/grayscale-ethereum-trust-discount-sinks-to-60-gbtc-down-to-45/" data-wpel-link="internal">reach a record high</a> of nearly 50%.</p>
<p>However, the recent narrowing of the discount below 27% marks a significant positive development for GBTC and its investors. The reduction indicates that the market is valuing GBTC shares more closely in line with the underlying BTC holdings, which has bolstered investor confidence and optimism.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Behind GBTC&#8217;s Narrowing Discount?</h2>
<p>The narrowing discount likely resulted from the renewed hope for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States. In mid-June, the world&#8217;s largest asset manager BlackRock <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-taps-31k-on-blackrocks-etf-refiling-aptos-jumps-10-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">resubmitted</a> its application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch such a product.</p>
<p>Shortly after the filing, other firms, including WisdomTree and Invesco, were <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/not-just-blackrock-these-companies-have-also-filed-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-in-the-us/" data-wpel-link="internal">inspired</a> to submit new applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Although the SEC said the recent filings were not &#8220;sufficiently clear and comprehensive,&#8221; the applications made investors bullish.</p>
<p>The discount on GBTC was 41.7% before BlackRock&#8217;s application and has been consistently decreasing.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Fink likened crypto to "digitizing gold" and outlined bitcoin as an "international asset" that could serve as a hedge against inflation.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Larry Fink &#8211; Chief Executive Officer of BlackRock &#8211; raised hopes that his company&#8217;s recent filing to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the USA could make investing in the primary cryptocurrency less expensive and &#8220;democratize crypto.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The American regulators have not approved such a product yet. However, BlackRock&#8217;s outstanding record with the SEC made some believe it could become the first company with such a green light.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Praising Crypto (Bitcoin)</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a recent </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6330640643112" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">interview</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> for Fox Business, Fink noted that BTC transactions are still quite expensive. As such, one of BlackRock&#8217;s efforts in the field is to remove that burden for investors:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;What we&#8217;re trying to do with crypto is make it more democratized and make it much cheaper for investors. It costs a lot of money right now to transact Bitcoin. We hope our regulators look at these filings as a way to democratize crypto.&#8221;<br />

</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the Commission initially considered the effort &#8220;inadequate,&#8221; forcing BlackRock to refile, naming Coinbase as a &#8220;surveillance partner.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fink also joined the list of prominent individuals who think the asset class is akin to digital gold. More specifically, he claimed that people could distribute some of their wealth in BTC instead of in the precious metal as a hedge against inflation and protection against the devaluation of many national currencies.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Bitcoin is an international asset. It&#8217;s not based on anyone&#8217;s currency, and so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative,&#8221; he added.</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">From a Critic to a Proponent</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unlike his current view on the crypto industry, Fink was nowhere near that supportive of it in the past, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/13/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-calls-bitcoin-an-index-of-money-laundering.html#close" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">calling</a> </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin an &#8220;index of money laundering&#8221; in 2017:</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He opined in 2020 that the development of the digital asset sector could undermine the dominance of the US dollar as the world&#8217;s reserve currency. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fink softened his stance last year, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/former-crypto-sceptic-larry-fink-says-blackrock-is-studying-digital-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">revealing</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that BlackRock has started &#8220;studying digital currencies, stablecoins, and the underlying technologies to understand how they can help us serve our clients.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In his most recent interview for Fox Business, he explained that his initial backlash toward the industry was because &#8220;it was heavily used for, let&#8217;s say, illicit activities.&#8221;</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[XEC has surged the most from the top 100 digital assets, by adding 18% in a day. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After dipping to just over $30,000, bitcoin has reacted well and has spiked toward the coveted $31,000 line once more.</p>
<p>Most larger-cap altcoins are slightly in the red on a daily scale, aside from SOL and BCH, both of which have neared round-numbered milestones as well.</p>
<h2>BTC to Challenge $31K Again</h2>
<p>Last Friday turned out to be a highly unfavorable day for the BTC bulls as the asset slumped by $1,500 in minutes after the SEC issued a warning against the most recent filings for a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>However, the cryptocurrency reacted well and recovered almost all losses by the time Saturday arrived. As it happens frequently during the weekends, this one was relatively calm, with BTC standing mostly at around $30,500.</p>
<p>Monday didn&#8217;t bring any more price fluctuations either, but the landscape <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-taps-31k-on-blackrocks-etf-refiling-aptos-jumps-10-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">changed</a> on early Tuesday when BTC pushed to $31,400. However, it failed there, and the subsequent <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/comp-mkr-aave-soar-triple-digits-weekly-btc-loses-31k-weekend-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">rejection</a> drove it south to $30,200 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the bulls seem to be back in charge now as they stopped bitcoin&#8217;s freefall and initiated another leg-up that has helped it touch $31,000 as of now.</p>
<p>As such, the asset&#8217;s market cap has reclaimed $600 billion once again, and its dominance over the alts has taken a breather and is close to 50%.</p>

<h2>BCH on a Roll</h2>
<p>While BTC is trying its hand at taking down $31,000, several of the larger-cap alts are sitting quietly, mostly in the red. These include Ethereum, Binance Coin, Ripple, Cardano, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Polkadot, Polygon, and Shiba Inu, as all of them are down by up to 2% in a day.</p>
<p>Solana, on the other hand, has jumped by 3% and has neared $20. Bitcoin Cash has soared by 8% and sits close to $300. Recall that BCH <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-cash-explodes-33-to-14-month-high-solana-and-litecoin-soar-15-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">tapped</a> a 14-month high last week at over $320.</p>
<p>eCash has also been on a roll lately, having surged 18% in a day and over 60% in the past week.</p>
<p>In total, the crypto market cap has added just over $10 billion in a day and has gone back above $1.210 trillion on CMC.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Institutional investors are showing much more interest in Bitcoin derivatives and options contracts since BlackRock and several other firms filed for exchange-traded funds.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Professional traders are flocking back to Bitcoin funds in the wake of multiple applications for exchange-traded funds by leading asset managers.</p>
<p>As a result, open interest (OI) for options contracts has soared to $13.8 billion, according to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the increase in demand for <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-btc-posts-2-consecutive-green-quarters-for-the-first-time-since-2021/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a> options has pushed OI close to its all-time high of $15.1 billion, the firm added before commenting:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This suggests market investors are increasing their exposure to risk-defined derivative instruments.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a> Options Contracts have experienced an increase in demand as Open Interest recently soared to a value of $13.8B, just $1.3B shy of the ATH of $15.1B.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Options Demand Surges</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/for-the-first-time-bitcoin-options-open-interest-higher-than-futures-what-does-it-mean/" data-wpel-link="internal">Open interest</a> refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled. For each buyer of a futures or options contract, there must be a seller.</p>
<p>Options are similar to futures but do not have a fixed settlement date and have the ‘option’ to be renewed or extended.</p>
<p><a href="https://metrics.deribit.com/options/BTC" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">According</a> to Deribit, around $116 million in Bitcoin options are set to expire on July 6. However, this is a very small amount of options contracts compared to previous expiries. Around $1.7 billion options contracts are set to expire on July 28, which may have a bigger impact on markets.</p>
<p>It also noted that the put/call ratio for these contracts was 0.81. This means that there are slightly more calls than puts which is neutral but leaning to bullish.</p>
<p>The ratio is calculated by dividing the number of put (short) contracts by the number of call (long) contracts. Values lower than 1 are often considered bullish as more speculators are trading in long options contracts.</p>
<p>Bitcoin futures trading has also seen an uptick last month. According to data provided to the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the number of traders maintaining futures position of at least 25 BTC increased from a recent low of 94 at the end of May to 121 by the last week of June.</p>
<h2>Crypto Market Outlook</h2>
<p>Bitcoin derivatives may be in high demand, but spot markets are continuing to decline from their recent rally. Total capitalization is down 1.2% on the day to $1.23 trillion at the time of writing.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">BTC</a> has dropped 1.1% over the past 24 hours in a fall to $30,516 as it struggles to break heavy resistance. Meanwhile, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">ETH</a> has retreated a similar percentage to trade at $1,914 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko.</p>
