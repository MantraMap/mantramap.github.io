<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Stronghold Digital Mining reports impressive Bitcoin mining results in June.</em></li>



<li><em>Steady growth despite market fluctuations and increased network hash rate.</em></li>



<li><em>Emphasis on sustainability and ethical operations sets Stronghold apart in the industry.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Stronghold Digital Mining, a vertically integrated Bitcoin mining company, has <a href="https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/643103536/stronghold-digital-mining-provides-june-2023-bitcoin-mining-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> remarkable June operating results.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-301.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="498" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-301-1024x498.png" alt="Stronghold Gains Strong Growth With 626 Bitcoin Mined In Q2" class="wp-image-200333" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-301-1024x498.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-301-300x146.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-301-768x373.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-301-1536x746.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-301-750x364.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-301-1140x554.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-301.png 1850w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Stronghold Gains Strong Growth With 626 Bitcoin Mined In Q2 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>The company reported mining 225 Bitcoin in June, increasing total Bitcoin output for the second quarter of 2023 to over 626 Bitcoin. This is a 43% increase over Bitcoin prizes awarded in the fourth quarter of 2022.</p>



<p>Despite significant improvements in the Bitcoin network hash rate over the same time, Stronghold achieved 1% sequential growth vs the first quarter of 2023. This indicates the company&#8217;s capacity to sustain consistent mining performance while navigating changing market circumstances efficiently.</p>



<p>Stronghold acquired and activated 2,000 Avalon 1346 Bitcoin mining machines in June in accordance with its growth objectives. These mining equipment were part of the Canaan Bitcoin Mining Agreement, which the company previously revealed. Stronghold continues to aggressively seek more possibilities to fill its remaining data center slots, which total more than 1 EH/s (exahashes per second). By the end of the third quarter of 2023, the company intends to utilize its current 4 EH/s data center capacity.</p>

<p>Moreover, <a href="https://coincu.com/177264-stronghold-bitcoin-mining-revenue-35/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stronghold</a> is looking at possibilities for deploying its extra 25 MW of end-to-end data center equipment, which includes 20 unique StrongBox containers that are presently in inventory. The selection of a third site for this deployment is likely to be determined in the third quarter of 2023.</p>



<p>Stronghold Digital Mining differentiates itself with its emphasis on ecologically friendly processes. The company&#8217;s mining activities are housed in its fully owned Scrubgrass and Panther Creek plants in Pennsylvania, which are low-cost and ecologically beneficial coal waste power production facilities.</p>

<p>Stronghold underlines the necessity of ethical and sustainable operations within the sector since crypto market regulation is still waiting. The company thinks that uncontrolled trading in crypto assets might damage faith in the financial system and advocates for the careful legitimization of such trade.</p>



<p>Stronghold Digital Mining&#8217;s exceptional growth in Bitcoin mining and dedication to environmentally sustainable operations place it as an industry leader. The company intends to benefit from the rising demand for cryptocurrencies while maintaining long-term financial stability, with a strategic emphasis on growth and ethical operations.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Danish FSA has ruled that Saxo Bank's proprietary cryptocurrency transactions are not within the legal business scope of financial institutions.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority has ruled that Saxo Bank&#8217;s proprietary cryptocurrency transactions are not within the legal business scope of financial institutions.</em></li>



<li><em>Unregulated cryptocurrency trading can create distrust in the financial system, and the authority believes there is no justification for legitimizing such trading.</em></li>



<li><em>Saxo Bank has been ordered to dispose of its crypto holdings, and new regulations for crypto markets will be implemented by the end of 2024.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/danish-regulator-orders-saxo-bank-to-stop-own-trading-in-crypto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>, the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority decided that Saxo Bank&#8217;s crypto asset transactions for its own account did not fall within the legal business scope of financial institutions, and unregulated encrypted asset transactions may cause distrust in the financial system, and the Danish Financial Services Authority believes that legalizing crypto asset trading is unnecessary.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-297.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-297-1024x768.png" alt="Saxo Bank Asked To Stop Crypto-Related Activities By Danish Regulator" class="wp-image-200322" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-297-1024x768.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-297-300x225.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-297-768x576.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-297-750x563.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-297-1140x855.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-297.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Saxo Bank Asked To Stop Crypto-Related Activities By Danish Regulator 4"></a></figure></div>


<p>As a result, this activity is not acceptable as an auxiliary banking company for financial stability considerations (see section 24 of the Financial Services Act). Moreover, Saxo Bank maintains a portfolio of cryptoassets as a hedging mechanism to counter the market risk linked with the bank&#8217;s cryptoasset products. Saxo Bank was obliged to sell its own crypto assets on this grounds.</p>

<p>The new laws governing crypto markets will not go into effect until the end of 2024, thus, the sector will remain uncontrolled for the time being, according to the FSA.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Unregulated trading in cryptoassets can create distrust in the financial system, and the Danish FSA believes it would be unfounded to legitimize trading in cryptoassets,” the agency stated.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Saxo Bank provides its clients with the ability to trade a variety of crypto asset products through the bank&#8217;s platform. On the one hand, there are ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) and ETNs (Exchange Traded Notes) that track the growth of cryptoassets, while on the other, it is possible to bet on cryptoassets, which are advertised as &#8220;cryptocurrency cross.&#8221;</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-299.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="600" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-299.png" alt="Saxo Bank Asked To Stop Crypto-Related Activities By Danish Regulator" class="wp-image-200325" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-299.png 1000w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-299-300x180.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-299-768x461.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-299-750x450.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Saxo Bank Asked To Stop Crypto-Related Activities By Danish Regulator 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>The Copenhagen-based bank is under increased regulatory scrutiny after being designated as a systemically significant financial institution for the first time last month.</p>



<p>The legislation on cryptoasset markets (MiCA) will not be fully implemented until December 30, 2024. Unregulated trade in crypto-assets might cause mistrust in the financial system, and the Danish FSA believes that legitimizing trading in crypto-assets would be unwarranted. As a result, the activity is deemed unsuitable for supplementary bank operations on grounds of financial stability.</p>

<p>Anchorage Digital, a San Francisco-based crypto bank, has seen a significant increase in business this year due to a growing demand for safer custody of assets. The company reported an 80% jump in assets under custody in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. </p>



<p>Anchorage Digital has become the first federally chartered crypto bank and received approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to act as a custodian for other institutions that want to offer crypto. The company is in talks to offer custody to EDX Markets, a newly launched crypto exchange backed by firms such as Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Charles Schwab Corp.</p>



<p>Anchorage Digital&#8217;s core business remains providing custodial services to institutions, and it has expanded into trading, lending, and decentralized finance tools as more financial institutions push into the crypto space. The company has also been affected by the changes in the industry, having announced layoffs of 20% of its staff in March to refocus the business. However, the company is not planning any more job cuts at this time.</p>



<p>The shift from retail to institutional players in the digital assets market has also created opportunities for startup custodians and technology providers. BlackRock Inc., the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, filed for a US spot Bitcoin ETF, and other firms, including Fidelity, Invesco Ltd., and WisdomTree, followed suit.</p>



<p>Anchorage Digital raised $350 million at a more than $3 billion valuation from investors led by private equity firm KKR &amp; Co. in 2021. The company is expanding its presence in Portugal, where co-founder and president Diogo Monica lived until his early twenties and where the company has almost 100 employees. Monica plans to relocate to Lisbon to oversee Anchorage&#8217;s overseas expansion plans personally.</p>

<p>The compensation scheme is separated into three categories based on the number of user losses, with Orbiter Finance entirely compensating losses of $1,000 or less. Users may claim compensation beginning at 7:30 UTC on July 5, with a 48-hour application window.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Regarding the losses suffered by community users due to the Discord attack, we are committed to providing compensation,&#8221; the team announced.</p>

<p>According to Orbiter Finance, while filing a claim form, consumers must include a signed notification to confirm that they possess the address.</p>

<p>On June 1, unscrupulous actors gained access to the Orbiter Finance Discord server. On the platform, the hackers uploaded a link to a bogus airdrop application.</p>



<p>CertiK Alert, a blockchain security and analytics company, first revealed the attack on Twitter. It is the community members&#8217; responsibility to avoid connecting with the links offered on the site. The unscrupulous actors advertised a bogus ORB token launch and airdrop event in which 5,000,000 ORB tokens would be issued to members of the Orbiter Finance community.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://coincu.com/197671-orbiter-finance-stops-events-bitkeep-wallet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orbiter Finance</a> team also acknowledged the theft on Twitter, emphasizing that the company is working diligently to reclaim control of its Discord server. Via a Twitter thread, the project warned its members not to believe anything on its Discord server.</p>



<p>According to CertiK Alert monitoring, Orbiter Finance&#8217;s Twitter account was recently <a href="https://coincu.com/197635-orbiter-finance-twitter-account-hacked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hacked</a>, and tweets containing phishing links were posted.

Orbiter Finance <a href="https://coincu.com/197744-orbiter-finance-confirms-account-not-hacked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a> on social media to CertiK&#8217;s warning that its official Twitter account had been hacked by stating that its official Twitter account is secure and has not been compromised.</p>

<p>This is Binance&#8217;s latest move towards the troubled Multichain cross-chain bridge. Previously, Binance had temporarily <a href="https://coincu.com/189765-binance-10-bridge-token-multichain-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suspended</a> the top-up of tokens via the project-linked bridge the day after this incident. Deposits for pairs POLS-BSC, ACH-BSC, BIFI-FTM, SUPER-BSC, AVA-ETH, SPELL-AVAXC, ALPACA-FTM, FTM-ETH, FARM-BSC and DEXE-BSC have been affected by This situation.</p>



<p>The event started on May 24, the Twitter social network stirred up information that the authorities had arrested the Multichain team in China. At the same time, many on-chain signs indicate<a href="https://coincu.com/189798-9-7-million-ftms-binance-multichain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> suspicious movements </a>related to the MULTI token.</p>

<p>Multichain has confirmed that some of the project&#8217;s cross-chain remittance gateways are not working due to &#8220;force majeure reasons, &#8221; with unknown recovery time.</p>



<p>Multichain pledged to compensate affected users fully but did not disclose any further information on the compensation plan.</p>



<p>Data tracking site Lookonchain has detected moves to transfer large amounts of MULTI tokens to the Gate exchange. This increasingly worries the users of this bridge.</p>



<p>According to the update, some cross-chain bridges of the Multichain protocol have been restored and are now operational as of June 5. Tung Dinh, Vice President of Multichain, confirmed the restoration of the Multichain router2 router, showing that the core component of the bridge is back to normal. There is also speculation about the condition of Multichain&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, Zhao Jun, that he may have been released from prison.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>DBS becomes one of the first international banks in China to offer an e-CNY merchant collection system.</em></li>



<li><em>The technology enables DBS China corporate clients to collect payments in e-CNY and settle them automatically into their CNY bank deposit accounts.</em></li>



<li><em>The bank showcases its commitment to supporting China&#8217;s financial market innovation and offers additional benefits.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DBS is one of the first international banks in China to provide an e-CNY merchant collection system.</strong></h5>

<p>The technology enables DBS China corporate clients to collect payments in <a href="https://coincu.com/161200-e-cny-now-accessible-for-securities-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e-CNY</a>, China&#8217;s central bank digital currency (CBDC), and utilize automatic settlement of e-CNY straight into their CNY bank deposit account.</p>



<p>Businesses may now automate the settlement of e-CNY into their bank deposit accounts thanks to the newly introduced merchant collection platform. <a href="https://coincu.com/167379-dbs-digital-exchanges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DBS</a> stated that at least one customer has already utilized this platform for a transaction.</p>



<p>DBS China CEO Ginger Cheng said that the bank had completed its first e-CNY collection for a Shenzhen catering firm.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“This showcases our dual commitment of making banking joyful for our clients while actively supporting the development of China’s financial market innovation,” she adds.</p>

<p>Among other advantages, the technology offers easy reconciliation by delivering consolidated merchant reports with itemized e-CNY transactions – the report is available through DBS IDEAL, the bank&#8217;s digital business banking platform.</p>



<p>DBS is a participant in <a href="https://coincu.com/197908-singapore-mas-proposes-digital-assets-framework/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Guardian</a>, an initiative created by the Singapore Monetary Authority to explore asset tokenization and decentralized financing (DeFi) for conventional banks.

<p>After its trial introduction in April 2020, e-CNY use in China has gradually increased. As of December 2022, there were about 13.6 billion e-CNY in circulation. The CBDC is now recognized in 26 Chinese cities and 17 provinces, with acceptance likely to increase as the program steadily spreads to other locations. According to official figures, e-CNY accounts for 0.13% of China&#8217;s central bank&#8217;s currency and reserves.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Investors sue Haru Invest, Delio, and B&#38;S for breaching the Capital Market Act.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Investors sue Haru Invest, Delio, and B&amp;S for breaching the Capital Market Act.</em></li>



<li><em>Loss to investors is estimated at up to $230 million, with recoverable assets expected to be less than half.</em></li>



<li><em>Delio and Haru Invest face low receivable collection rates, raising concerns about their operations and integrity.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Investors who committed their crypto to Haru Invest and Delio sued the firms&#8217; management for breaching the Capital Market Act. B&amp;S was also included in the lawsuit.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-272.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-272.png" alt="BREAKING: Haru Invest, Delio Caused Damage Up To $230 Million For Investors" class="wp-image-200207" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-272.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-272-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-272-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-272-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BREAKING: Haru Invest, Delio Caused Damage Up To $230 Million For Investors 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>Lawyer Lee Jeong-yeop of LKB &amp; Partners, a legal firm representing the victims, assessed the loss to Haru Invest and Delio at up to 300 billion won ($230 million) in an interview with <em><a href="https://www.blockmedia.co.kr/archives/329899" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Block Media</a></em> on June 5. Haru Investment is worth around 150 billion won, while Delio is worth approximately 100 billion won.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The amount of damage to investors who entrusted their assets to the two companies is expected to reach up to 300 billion won. It is estimated to be less than 50%,” Lee said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Less than half of the virtual assets controlled by the two organizations seem to be recoverable.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The amount invested by Haru Invest in B&amp;S is currently unknown. It seems to be at the level of several tens of billions of won,” Lee added.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Victims are undergoing separate rehabilitation processes for these corporations. Seo Dong-gi, a certified public accountant of Saeyeon Accounting Company and a business rehabilitation specialist, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The receivable collection rate in the case of Haru and Delio is remarkably low compared to other cases. In the case of a general financial institution, even a 20-30% loss is a huge loss. A loss of more than 50% can be a serious situation.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite having a VASP (Virtual Asset Service Provider) license, Delio did not handle client assets correctly. While Haru Invest is a firm founded abroad, legal processes may be followed in Korea. Haru Invest and Delio were both held in Korea. According to lawyer Lee:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“It is possible to sell the company even during the corporate rehabilitation process. The difference between a self-sale and a sale during rehabilitation is &#8216;who is better for it.&#8217; If you go through the rehabilitation process, a more powerful investigation than the prosecution&#8217;s investigation will take place.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It is known that some Delio victims believe that the rehabilitation procedure does not help them recover from their injuries.</p>

<p>The storm has recently been brewing in the Korean cryptocurrency sphere as the country&#8217;s leading crypto lending firm, <a href="https://coincu.com/198064-delio-resumes-deposits-and-withdrawals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delio</a>, comes under examination. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) of South Korea has allegedly <a href="https://coincu.com/199209-delio-under-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> an inquiry into the agency&#8217;s activities due to accusations of fraud, embezzlement, and breach of belief.</p>



<p>Prior to the suspension decision, Delio&#8217;s administration apparently denied having any knowledge of Haru Invest investments. In light of recent events, this denial raises further concerns about Delio&#8217;s activities and integrity. The FSC probe is anticipated to shed further light on this issue.</p>

<p>Delio found discovered to have shifted all of its digital assets worth around $7 million in crypto only hours before suspending payments and withdrawals on its platform, as Coincu <a href="https://coincu.com/200089-delio-transferred-all-7-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>.</p>

<li><em>Flare token attackers have moved 56,200 BNB (worth $13.95 million) to Tornado Cash, raising concerns about the misuse of funds and the complexity of the attack.</em></li>



<li><em>The Flare token project on the BSC chain was previously flagged as an exit scam, resulting in a significant decline in the FLARE token&#8217;s price by over 95%.</em></li>

<p>The attackers initiated their actions back in November 2022 when they managed to extract a staggering 3.98 billion Flares from specific addresses starting with 0xf99c. Subsequently, they proceeded to exchange a portion of the stolen Flares, approximately 1 billion, for 16.9 million BSC-USD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, they converted 1.98 billion Flares into 32.7 million Futures, which were then swapped for 1.6 million BUSD. A small fraction of stablecoins were further exchanged for 2431.14 ETH, bridging the funds to both Ethereum (1939 ETH) and Avalanche chain (399.8 WETH) via cBridge and Multichain. The attackers attempted to obscure their activities by laundering the funds through mixers and centralized exchanges using a technique known as chain-hopping.</p>

<p>Previously, security companies had flagged the Flare token as an exit scam, with the scammers reportedly profiting around $18.5 million at the time. It is important to note that the Flare project on the BSC chain involved in the exit scam should not be confused with tokens or symbols bearing similar names. Consequently, the <a href="https://coincu.com/16877-flares-canary-network-songbird-is-officially-going-live-and-distributing-sgb-tokens/">FLARE</a> token&#8217;s price experienced a significant decline of over 95% following the incident.</p>



<p>The recent transfer of 56,200 BNB to Tornado Cash adds another layer of complexity to the Flare token attack, raising concerns about the potential misuse of the funds and the efforts taken by the attackers to obfuscate their activities. Authorities and security organizations continue to closely monitor the situation, seeking to mitigate any further harm caused by these fraudulent actions.</p>

<p>On July 5th, Metis announced via Twitter that it has taken snapshots of METIS holding addresses during two critical periods, namely the Poly Network attack and the initial sale of this token by the attacker. Importantly, any METIS purchases made on the identified address will not be recognized.</p>



<p>To ensure the security and integrity of <a href="https://coincu.com/164236-metis-with-banxa-simplify-crypto-adoption/">METIS</a> tokens, the platform advises users against interacting with the current token contract on the BNB Chain. Instead, the platform will deploy a new contract to address any vulnerabilities. This proactive measure aims to maintain the trust and confidence of the community.</p>

<p>Additionally,  the platform urges liquidity providers to withdraw all liquidity from Pancake Swap. By doing so, they can safeguard their assets and minimize potential risks associated with the ongoing situation. Ensuring the protection of user funds and maintaining a secure ecosystem are their top priorities.</p>



<p>The Poly Network attack, which made headlines on July 3rd, saw hackers exploit vulnerabilities across multiple chains, resulting in the issuance of more than ten different assets worth a staggering $34 billion. The platform&#8217; swift response to the attack demonstrates its commitment to safeguarding the interests of its users and actively addressing security concerns.</p>
