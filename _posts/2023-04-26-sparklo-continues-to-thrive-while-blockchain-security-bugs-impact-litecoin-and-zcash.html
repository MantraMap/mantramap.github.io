<p class="s3">Blockchain security hacks have been increasing in recent times. Halborn, a blockchain security firm, has detected an exploitable vulnerability that will impact Litecoin and ZCash. However not all news from the crypto industry is sad as Sparklo, a new cryptocurrency investment project, continues to thrive.</p>
<p class="s3">Litecoin and ZCash On the Verge of Been Exploited</p>
<p class="s3">Blockchain network flaws might put billions of dollars at risk by causing all protocols that depend on them to function improperly. "On vulnerable networks, a successful exploitation of the relevant bug could lead to denial of service or remote code execution," writes Behnke.</p>
<p class="s3">Halborn, a blockchain security company, has discovered a number of important and exploitable flaws affecting more than 280 networks. Among the impacted blockchains are Litecoin and Zcash, which support multiple DeFi protocols and other Web3 platforms for the metaverse, gaming, and asset trading. While these blockchains are still unpatched, a total of $25 billion (about Rs. 2,06,300 crore) is at risk.</p>
<p class="s3">According to the official blog post, Holborn researchers discovered the most dangerous peer-to-peer (p2p) communication vulnerability. If exploited, this flaw could allow attackers to generate consensus messages, deliver them to specific nodes, and then take those nodes offline. A vulnerability like this might eventually expose networks to 51% assaults and other major issues.</p>
<p class="s3">The security company describes the technical warning signs that can assist programmers determine whether the Rab13s has affected their blockchains and claims to have discovered a fix for the flaw. "Halborn created an exploit kit for Rab13s with great success. The designated stakeholders have received all the technical knowledge they require to fix the bugs and deliver the required fixes for the community and miners." Behnke continued. </p>
<p class="s3">If these security issues are not fixed on time Litecoin and Zcash are in danger of losing maximum value. </p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo: Shining Bright As Ever</p>
<p class="s3">All can't be bad in the crypto industry. Despite the threatening news about Litecoin and Zcash, other cryptocurrencies continue to perform well free of blockchain security bugs. </p>
<p class="s3">Experienced investors are aware that buying early on promising projects is the key to long-term gains, and with Sparklo, that theory may be confirmed once more. This coin is now in Level One of its public presale, with a price of $0.015. During the Sparklo presale, just 60% of the 1B token supply will be accessible, and they are selling at a fast rate. </p>
<p class="s3">According to notable crypto analysts, Sparklo might grow by 3,200% to $0.50 by December 2023. We are confident that this forecast will come true as a result of the features and real-world benefits that Sparklo will bring to the metal trading industry.</p>
<p class="s3">The platform is building itself to become the first cryptocurrency investment platform for precious metal objects. Investors will be able to make their investments by aquring fractional NFTs. </p>
<p class="s3">With the overwhelming news of hacks on blockchains, you might be concerned about the security of the Sparklo platform; there's no need for that. Sparklo has completed it's audit with InterFi Network, and a KYC audit is nearing completion. Plus the platform will lock liquidity for 100 years while the team tokens will be locked for 1,000 days. </p>
<p class="s3">If you wait too long, you may miss out on the opportunity to purchase this prospective blue-chip token at a very low price. Remember that early investments yield maximum long-term gains.</p>
