			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Renowned author Robert Kiyosaki has revealed he had bought more Bitcoin and why he chose to do this arguing that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations will &ldquo;crush&rdquo; most other currencies. </p>
<p>Author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, has said that the main reason for his investment in Bitcoin stems from a belief that the SEC will &ldquo;crush&rdquo; most other tokens with its regulations. In a Tweet on December 30, Kiyosaki revealed that he is investing in Bitcoin and explained he is &ldquo;very excited&rdquo; about the currency &ldquo;is classified as a commodity much like gold, silver, and oil.&rdquo; Kiyosaki said he is buying more Bitcoin, and the SEC classified bitcoin as a commodity while most other cryptocurrencies have been deemed to be securities. Kiyosaki has also cautioned that &ldquo;SEC regulations will crush most of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Q: Are you investing in Bitcoin?A: Yes I am. I am very excited about Bitcoin. Why? Because Bitcoin is classified as a commodity much like gold, silver, and oil. Most crypto tokens are classifed as a security and SEC regulations will crush most of them. I am buying more BC</p>
&mdash; therealkiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 31, 2022
<p>

</p>
<p>The Rich Dad Poor Dad author has for a long time advised investors to buy gold, silver, and Bitcoin and previously stated that he is now a Bitcoin investor rather than a trader according to a blog post by Binance. Earlier in December, Kiyosaki made the bold claim that when the Federal Reserve pivots and creates trillions of &ldquo;false&rdquo; dollars, this token investor will benefit. After the fall of the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, Kiyosaki stated that he is still bullish on Bitcoin and underscored that investors need to remember that cryptocurrencies as such cannot be claimed for the crash of FTX. Kiyosaki also in September urged investors to invest in crypto now, before the next market crash.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Orbiting 16504 Technicals:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 2 January 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to orbit the 16504 area early in the Asian session as the pair was drawn to the level that represents the 78.6% retracement of the appreciating range from 15992.64 to 18385.36.&nbsp; Traders recently drove BTC/USD as low as the 16326.16 area after Stops were elected below the 16375.18 area, a downside retracement level related to selling pressure around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels.&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD depreciated approximately 64% in 2022, and was off more than 3% in December.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16691.47 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16543.73.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bearishly below MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Internet of Things technology has given rise to concepts such as smart factories, cities and vehicles and next-generation agri-tech, among many other use cases. Almost every industry is looking to take advantage of IoT and the world is well set for that to happen. These days, almost everyone owns a smartphone or tablet device, and a great many machines are equipped with Wi-Fi enabled sensors that can send data to a centralized server. Things like factory machines, traffic lights, airplanes - you name it, they all have the ability to talk to one another thanks to IoT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the rise of IoT may present some problems. With so many devices in the world all collecting, sending, receiving and processing data, existing networks will soon become clogged, resulting in very high costs for compute and storage power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why blockchain is often touted as an ideal platform for IoT devices. With blockchain, data is stored on a distributed, decentralized ledger that&rsquo;s hosted on multiple nodes. Its immutable nature means that the data stored within it cannot be corrupted.&nbsp; The merger of blockchain and IoT results in a reliable and secure method of storing that&rsquo;s generated and processed by intelligent devices. Moreover, because it&rsquo;s decentralized, there&rsquo;s no need for centralized control, management and maintenance, and no expensive costs associated with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
How Blockchain Benefits IoT
<p>Given the advantages, it&rsquo;s no surprise that blockchain and IoT have already made considerable progress. In 2019, almost 20% of all IoT deployments were powered by blockchain solutions, according to data from International Data Corp. There&rsquo;s lots of room for potential growth in this area too, with Statista estimating the total installed base of IoT devices to exceed 75 billion by the end of 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The growth of IoT will result in enormous volumes of data being generated, and dealing with all of that information is likely going to be a daunting challenge if we continue to rely on conventional cloud-based networks. For one thing there&rsquo;s the enormous costs to consider. Today&rsquo;s cloud networks can be extremely costly in terms of storage and processing power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is that existing IoT ecosystems are powered by a highly centralized, brokered communication model based on a client/server architecture. Within this infrastructure, each device is identified, connected and authenticated by cloud servers that use massive amounts of storage and processing power at extremely high costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another issue with cloud networks is the risk of outages, which can cause data to become inaccessible and sometimes even lost forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proponents of blockchain for IoT say decentralized networks will make it simpler to track billions of devices, enabling distributed processing and coordination at much lower costs. By adopting a standardized, peer-to-peer communication model to process large volumes of transactions between connected devices, companies will no longer need to rely on cloud servers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, blockchain will eliminate single points of failure, which is a big problem with today&rsquo;s centralized cloud networks. Blockchain is incredibly secure too, thanks to its use of cryptography to secure the data it collects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Problems To Overcome
<p>It won&rsquo;t all be plain sailing if we&rsquo;re to migrate IoT workloads to a blockchain-based infrastructure. There are some key issues that need to be overcome, but luckily a number of interesting solutions are already being built.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the main challenges with blockchain is that it&rsquo;s not a low-latency protocol. As such, most blockchains process a very low number of transactions per second, and that presents issues for large-scale IoT device networks, as these require extremely rapid rates of data transfer to keep up. Ethereum, the world&rsquo;s most popular smart contract blockchain, is only capable of processing around seven transactions per second, for example. Moreover, the Ethereum network is often congested, leading to high transaction costs. In its natural state, it&rsquo;s not a realistic platform for large-scale IoT deployments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer to this problem may lie in scaling solutions like Boba Network, which is a Layer-2 network and hybrid compute platform that powers lightning fast transactions with much lower costs than traditional Layer-1 networks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boba Network relies on a technology called optimistic rollups, which enable multiple transactions to be bundled into one and processed simultaneously. In this way, transactions are not only performed more quickly, but are more cost-effective too, as the gas fees for each bundle are split between them. What&rsquo;s more, Boba Network&rsquo;s hybrid compute technology makes it a perfect fit for IoT data, as it enables Ethereum smart contracts to talk to any external Web2 API or sensor to collect and process real-world information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A second problem that needs to be solved is blockchain&rsquo;s compatibility issues. SQL datasets have emerged as the standard for IoT networks, but blockchain is not well suited for use as a traditional database as it stores data differently, in blocks, as opposed to rows and columns. Its distributed nature is also not compatible with SQL-type databases. Still, there are some promising projects working to fix these compatibility issues. IOTA, for instance, has developed an IoT compatible blockchain that relies on a Directed Acyclic Graph-based tangle structure, as opposed to standard blocks. This makes it more suited for storing the kind of chronologically-ordered data created by IoT devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
IoT Blockchain Applications At Work
<p>The combination of blockchain and IoT is an extremely powerful one for many specific application use cases. One of the best examples is in logistics, which is the backbone of most global industries, ensuring that raw materials and finished products are always in stock, and get where they need to go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The logistics and supply chain industries face numerous challenges, including too much paperwork, lack of control over shipping, issues around traceability, transportation difficulties and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IoT and blockchain together can fix many of these issues. For instance, they can combine to collect and store data on things such as locations, times of departure and arrival, the temperature of goods in transit, the status of containers being shipped and so on. Because blockchain is decentralized and immutable, anyone can access this data at any time and be sure that it hasn&rsquo;t been corrupted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One company doing this is Ambrosus, the creator of a blockchain-powered IoT network for the pharmaceutical and food logistics industries. It relies on a network of blockchain-connected sensors to provide full visibility into goods throughout the supply chain, leading to faster and more efficient movement of these goods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connected cars are another obvious example of how blockchain and IoT can be utilized together. Car manufacturers are increasingly turning to IoT enabled sensors to develop automated vehicles, and the addition of blockchain creates many new possibilities for the industry around smart parking, automated traffic control and more. Take NetObjex, which has created a smart parking solution that&rsquo;s powered by IoT and blockchain. Through its collaboration with PNI, which designs smart parking sensors, it has created a platform for autonomous vehicles to quickly find an available parking spot with integrated payments using cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last but not least is the energy sector, which has already enjoyed the benefits of IoT enabled sensors that led to the creation of so-called smart meters. When IoT is merged with blockchain, smart meters can upload data in real-time and enable better distribution of energy across the grid. A home equipped with solar panels for instance can provide surplus power back to the grid, reducing energy wastage. An example of how this works can be found in Brooklyn, New York. There, solar powered homes are connected through so-called &ldquo;microgrids&rdquo; that enable smart meters to talk to one another across a distributed network. Through this network, these homes now have a way to buy and sell electricity from one another, with the blockchain facilitating transactions and ensuring everyone can save money on their energy bills.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Connected cars are another obvious example of how blockchain and IoT can be utilized together. Car manufacturers are increasingly turning to IoT enabled sensors to develop automated vehicles, and the addition of blockchain creates many new possibilities for the industry around smart parking, automated traffic control and more. Take NetObjex, which has created a smart parking solution that&rsquo;s powered by IoT and blockchain. Through its collaboration with PNI, which designs smart parking sensors, it has created a platform for autonomous vehicles to quickly find an available parking spot with integrated payments using cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last but not least is the energy sector, which has already enjoyed the benefits of IoT enabled sensors that led to the creation of so-called smart meters. When IoT is merged with blockchain, smart meters can upload data in real-time and enable better distribution of energy across the grid. A home equipped with solar panels for instance can provide surplus power back to the grid, reducing energy wastage. An example of how this works can be found in Brooklyn, New York. There, solar powered homes are connected through so-called &ldquo;microgrids&rdquo; that enable smart meters to talk to one another across a distributed network. Through this network, these homes now have a way to buy and sell electricity from one another, with the blockchain facilitating transactions and ensuring everyone can save money on their energy bills.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto suffered its worst ever year for hacks in 2022. Most of these hacks were on DeFi platforms which saw a third of all such activity in the last year.</p>
<p>While certain crypto and DeFi platforms have contributed the most disruptive technology to finance and other industrial sectors, platforms have been exploited due to the nascent state of the code that they have deployed.</p>
<p>Many would argue that crypto is basically a testing ground for what might prove to be the most innovative technology, the scale of which could compare with the internet and the dotcom era that began on top of it.</p>
<p>However, 2022 has been a particularly tough year for this technology, and fraudulent activity and hacks have abounded. According to an article on Forbes, more than $3 billion in value was misappropriated. The following are 8 of the biggest hacks:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Ronin Network: $625 million - Hackers stole over $625 million worth of ether and USD coin from the Ronin Network, a blockchain for the Axie Infinity video game. The U.S. Treasury Department later linked the heist to North Korean state-backed hacking group Lazarus Group.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Wormhole Network: $325 million - On February 2, an unknown hacker exploited a vulnerability in the Wormhole Network, a protocol that allows users to move cryptocurrencies and NFTs between different blockchains. The attacker created 120,000 wETH (worth around $325 million) without putting up the necessary collateral. Jump Crypto, the parent company of Wormhole, later replaced the stolen funds.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Nomad: $190 million - A hacker exploited a weakness in Nomad's code to steal approximately $190 million in tokens on August 1. Dozens of copycats joined the heist. Nomad was able to recover over $20 million after pleading with users to return the funds.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Beanstalk Farms: $182 million - In April, an attacker drained over $150 million in crypto from Beanstalk Farms, a stablecoin project based on Ethereum. The hacker used a flash loan from the Aave protocol to borrow nearly $1 billion in crypto and gain a 67% voting stake in Beanstalk. With this supermajority, the hacker was able to transfer the Beanstalk tokens to their own wallet.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Wintermute: $160 million - The London-based crypto market maker lost $160 million in a September 20 hack. It is believed that hackers used brute-force computing to generate all the possible passwords to a company vanity address.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Mango Markets: $112 million -&nbsp; Avraham Eisenberg held $112 million worth of tokens in ransom to force Mango Markets, a decentralised crypto exchange, to finance bad debt. Eisenberg used two accounts on the platform to take large positions in perpetual futures on the dollar-pegged USD coin, causing its price to spike tenfold on other decentralised exchanges. He then used the profit to borrow and withdraw a number of tokens from Mango.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">BNB Smart Chain XCN2: $110 million - Hackers stole an estimated $110 million from the Binance-affiliated BSC Token Hub on October 6. Binance blamed the hack on a "flash loan exploit" and later recovered the stolen funds.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Harmony Horizon Bridge: $100 million - There were concerns about the bridge even before it was hacked for $100 million in various cryptocurrencies in June of 2022, given that the small number of validators for its multi-sig wallet left it vulnerable to attack.</li>
</ul>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>After Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison entered into a plea deal for leniency in her own case, Sam Bankman-Fried is set to plead out himself.

<p>Indian crypto exchanges suffered extremely badly during the crypto bear market of 2022, with the trading volume on WazirX falling a massive 97% over the year.</p>
<p>The FTX/Alameda plot thickens as wallets belonging to Alameda suddenly became active on December 28. $1.7 million was put through mixers and swapped for stablecoins and BTC.</p>
<p>In a Twitter Spaces chat on Wednesday, Michael Saylor outlined how Microstrategy can contribute to the Bitcoin and Lightning ecosystem.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>V Global, a South Korean crypto exchange valued at roughly 2 trillion won (about $1.5 billion USD), has been subjected to a government investigation, with six of its executives facing arrest and imprisonment from cases filed by the South Korean government's regulatory authorities.</p>
<p>According to initial reports from the The Economist, V Global's execs allegedly enthused investors with the promise of 300% in APY or returns. This promise was coupled with huge referral bonuses for bringing in other investors into what is now being revealed as large-scale fraud network.</p>
<p>South Korean regulators, who have been clamping down on crypto exchanges for some time now, declared that V Global had misused its customers' funds. South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), the country's integrated financial regulator, has warned investors to be wary of any suspicious investment proposals in the future, especially those promising abnormally high rewards.</p>
<p>The South Korean government's arrest of V Global's executives did not result into imprisonment for all of them, however. Of the six, three were not detained after claiming innocence and are still open to appeal for their charges while under a five-year probation. The other three have received prison sentences of between three years up to a maximum of eight years.</p>
<p>The fraudulent crypto exchange, which at the height of its operations between July 2020 to April 2021, attracted roughly 50,000 investors by promising them immense returns of up to 300% APY on investments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The defendants only trusted the VGlobal management team, evaded responsibility, and once the investigation began, they destroyed evidence and interfered with the investigation,&rdquo; the judge of the 12th Criminal Division of the Suwon District Court stated.</p>
<p>According to Korean media reports, however, the judge gave some degree of leniency to the defendants, given that further investigations revealed the scale of the fraud operation to be much less than previous estimates. These executives now join the firm's former CEO aliased as "Mr. Lee" who is now serving a 22-year prison term after being sentenced in February 2022.Earlier reports from Korean media outfit Kyeongin detail how roughly 10,000 investors from the exchange were actually able to see significant returns. These were, however, only made from the multilevel marketing schemes for recruiting other investors into the network. In June of 2022, the firm paid out "referral bonuses" worth $1,000 to each of its clients, suggesting that its operation indeed mirrored that of a Ponzi scheme.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Finishes 2022 Off 64%:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 1 January 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) capped a very bearish year with additional weakness early in the Asian session as the pair continued to trade below the psychologically-important 17000 figure after recently trading as low as the 16326.16 level.&nbsp; Late last year, BTC/USD has generally been orbiting the 16880.44 area, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460. &nbsp;Selling pressure recently intensified around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels and BTC/USD tested downside price objectives related to these levels, including the 16375.18 area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD has depreciated approximately 64% year-to-date, and is off more than 3% month-to-date.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Finishes 2022 Off 64%:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 1 January 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) capped a very bearish year with additional weakness early in the Asian session as the pair continued to trade below the psychologically-important 17000 figure after recently trading as low as the 16326.16 level.&nbsp; Late last year, BTC/USD has generally been orbiting the 16880.44 area, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460. &nbsp;Selling pressure recently intensified around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels and BTC/USD tested downside price objectives related to these levels, including the 16375.18 area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD has depreciated approximately 64% year-to-date, and is off more than 3% month-to-date.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16705.87 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16598.31.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Securities Commission of The Bahamas announced that it seized $3.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency assets from the now-bankrupt and collapsed crypto exchange FTX. </p>
<p>Per a media release issued on Thursday, the Bahamian authority said the total amount taken from FTX&rsquo;s Bahamian subsidiary, FTX Digital Markets, along with added funds has been moved into its own digital wallets &ldquo;for safekeeping.&rdquo; The Commission had previously said that it was holding some of the exchange&rsquo;s assets but failed to disclose the total sum thereof.</p>
<p>According to the regulator, the funds were valued at over $3.5 billion based on market pricing at the time of transfers and added that the transfer took place the day after FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 12. Reports by American news agency CNBC indicate that the Bahamian Securities Commission said that the funds are only being held on a &ldquo;temporary basis&rdquo; or until they receive instruction from the Bahamas&rsquo; Supreme Court to deliver the assets to customers and creditors, or in the case of the insolvency estate to the liquidators. The Commission said that it seized the assets after receiving information from former FTX CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, regarding cyberattacks on the systems of FTX&rsquo;s Bahamian arm.</p>
<p>According to the media release, there was a &ldquo;significant risk of imminent dissipation&rdquo; of the assets as long as they remained under the control of FTX Digital Markets.</p>
<p>Apparently, there was cause for concern as the day after FTX filed for bankruptcy, it became under attack from a suspected hack that over $400 million drained from the firm&rsquo;s crypto wallets. The events surrounding the suspected hack remain unclear and the matter is now being investigated by the United States Justice Department.</p>
FTX Debtors Seek the Return of Assets Held by Bahamian Regulators
<p>According to a press release, FTX Trading, and its affiliated debtors announced on Friday that it would seek the return of the crypto assets held by the Bahamas Securities Commission to their Chapter 11 estates for the benefit of creditors. The group added:</p>

<p>The FTX Debtors have informed the&nbsp;Bahamas&nbsp;Commission that none of Mr. Bankman-Fried, Mr. Wang or the&nbsp;Bahamas&nbsp;Commission had a right to take cryptocurrency of the FTX Debtors.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Some eyebrows were raised when Microstrategy sold a part of its Bitcoin holdings, even though the company then bought more. A tax loophole was the reason.</p>
Sell at a loss then immediately repurchase
<p>Crypto investors can reduce their capital gains tax in 2022 by selling their crypto assets at a loss and immediately repurchasing them, thanks to a regulatory distinction that crypto assets have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This strategy was recently used by business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, which bought 2,395 bitcoin on Wednesday, sold a portion at a loss, and bought 810 bitcoin just two days later.</p>
Crypto still an asset and not a security
<p>Unlike other securities, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does not consider crypto to be a security, but rather an asset, which means that certain tax laws, such as the "wash rule," do not apply to it. This allows investors to sell crypto at a net loss and buy it back instantly while still being able to claim the loss on their tax filings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other investors who sell securities for a net loss at the end of the tax year can deduct up to $3,000 from their capital gains tax and carry any additional losses over to the next tax year.</p>
IRS could change its policy
<p>Crypto investors will continue to have this advantage as long as the IRS maintains its current policy of treating crypto as assets rather than securities. This allows investors to sell their crypto assets at a loss and immediately repurchase them, allowing them to claim the loss on their tax filings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the IRS has not made any official statements on this matter, and it is possible that they may change their policy in the future. It is worth noting that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) considers many widely-traded cryptocurrencies to be securities, which has been a source of controversy in the crypto community.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>David Marcus, advocate of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, thinks there is more pain to come in 2023 as market tries to recover from bad actors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>David Marcus is the CEO and co-founder of Lightspark, and ran Payments/Crypto and Messenger at Meta. He also led PayPal, and has built three startups. On Friday he published his thoughts for the future in a Medium article.</p>
Recession plus obsolete workforces
<p>The experienced executive is not bullish in the short to medium term on the economy nor on crypto. He thinks that a full-blown recession is approaching, probably caused by the Federal Reserve raising rates as they seek to tame inflation.</p>
<p>He believes that large tech companies are going to realise that they can cut their workforces drastically, and do more with few people. He thinks that AI will &ldquo;see the beginning of a Cambrian explosion&rdquo;, that will serve to automate many work areas, and also lead to human obsoletion across many industries.</p>
Crypto will recover
<p>As for crypto, he is of the opinion that the sector will need a couple of years to recover from the bad actors that have plagued it. He thinks that regulation will need time to be responsibly developed and implemented.</p>
<p>He sees a sea change in crypto and states:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In crypto, years of greed will make room for real-world applications. The years of creating a token out of thin air and making millions are over. The music has stopped. We&rsquo;re back to our regular programming of having to create real value and solving real world problems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the solving of these problems he expects to see:</p>

<p>&ldquo;key innovations in the areas of payments, asset securitization, DeFi, zero-knowledge applications including proof of reserves and layer 1 scaling solutions, and a renewed development energy and interest on the Bitcoin network.&rdquo;</p>

Sceptical on regulation
<p>Once more on regulation, Marcus is not very hopeful that the regulators will get it right. He believes that new regulation is necessary for digital assets and crypto, contrary to the belief of Gary Gensler, chair of the SEC, who believes that crypto must be shoehorned into existing regulation. He says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sadly, I&rsquo;ve become increasingly skeptical of our ability to reach consensus on legislative or regulatory approaches that achieve the right balance in these areas. I think we will therefore see more of the same in 2023 with increased responsibility on leaders of industries to do what they believe is right in the vacuum left by our deadlocked legislative system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, he is of the firm belief that &ldquo;destruction comes with an opportunity to rebuild anew&rdquo;, and that despite an extremely challenging environment, digital assets and crypto will come out of this next period stronger and better.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto Assets Manager Valkyrie Investments has unveiled a proposal to become the sponsor and manager of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is the world&rsquo;s largest Bitcoin fund and has been trading at a record discount compared to the price of BTC.&nbsp;</p>
The Valkyrie Proposal&nbsp;
<p>In a blog post published this week, Valkyrie Investments proposed becoming the sponsor and manager of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which will see the company manage its much larger rival. The Nashville-based asset manager, which manages around $180 million in assets, announced the launch of the Valkyrie Opportunistic Fund, which is looking to take advantage of the significant discount in the value of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plan is considered extremely ambitious, considering the fact that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust manages over $10 billion in assets, compared to Valkyrie&rsquo;s $180 million. The Valkyrie fund plans to increase its holdings of GBTC, enabling the company to realize the true value of the underlying Bitcoin for its investors. In a letter posted on its website, co-founder and CIO of Valkyrie Investments, Steven McClurg, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We understand that Grayscale has played an important role in the development and growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem with the launch of GBTC, and we respect the team and the work that they have done. However, in light of recent events involving Grayscale and its family of affiliated companies, it is time for a change. Valkyrie is the best company to manage GBTC to ensure its investors are treated fairly.&rdquo;</p>

A Long Shot?
<p>In the proposal, Valkyrie highlighted several ways through which they aim to improve the current management of GBTC. The fund stated that it aims to facilitate redemptions at a net asset value (NAV) for investors through a Regulation M filing, allowing investors to redeem their shares at a fair price. The proposal also seeks to lower the fee to 75 basis points, compared to the current 200 basis points, and offer redemptions in BTC and cash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, a move to manage and sponsor the trust could be a long shot, considering Grayscale filings have stated that shareholders can play no part in the management or control of the trust. Additionally, they also have limited voting rights. It also states that no amendments to the trust agreement that could impact the interest of shareholders can be made without a vote of at least a majority (50%) of the shares.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Valkyrie also noted that it has a proven track record of success, running its own Bitcoin Trust since January 2021. It added that it has launched a host of Bitcoin-related ETFs and was, along with VanEck and ProShares, one of the firms to launch the first Bitcoin futures ETFs in 2021.&nbsp;</p>
Trading Below Value&nbsp;
<p>Currently, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is trading around 50% below the value of the Bitcoin it holds. This is because of the structure of the GBTC, where while new shares can be created, they cannot be destroyed as demand for the trust&rsquo;s underlying Bitcoin faces a bit of a downturn, leading to a discount in the net asset value. On its part, Grayscale tried to convert the GBTC into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) which would allow for share redemptions.</p>
<p>However, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) denied the application to convert GBTC into a spot bitcoin ETF. Grayscale was highly critical of the move by the SEC, calling it arbitrary, capricious, and discriminatory, and filed a lawsuit against the agency.&nbsp;</p>

On its part, Grayscale tried to convert the GBTC into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) which would allow for share redemptions.</p>
<p>However, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) denied the application to convert GBTC into a spot bitcoin ETF. Grayscale was highly critical of the move by the SEC, calling it arbitrary, capricious, and discriminatory, and filed a lawsuit against the agency.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Bearishness at Year End:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 31 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) retained acutely bearish technical sentiment early in the Asian session as the pair spiked lower to the 16326.16 level after recent selling pressure that intensified around the 16654.81 level.&nbsp; The pair has generally been orbiting the 16880.44 area, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460. &nbsp;Selling pressure recently intensified around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels and BTC/USD tested downside price objectives related to these levels, including the 16375.18 area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD has depreciated approximately 64% year-to-date, and is off more than 3% month-to-date.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16731.07 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16.561.09.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bearishly below MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">The crypto market is always active. With more people investing in cryptocurrencies, market volatility has also increased. The competition between the crypto coins and trading platforms is intense. But what does it mean for new tokens in the market? Let&rsquo;s find out how Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is racing ahead with 805% presale gains, while Polygon (MATIC) and Aptos (APT) are struggling to attract investors.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s11">Polygon (MATIC) is Gaining Attention, But it May Not be Enough</p>
<p class="s7">Polygon (MATIC) platform offers several attractive features like security and speed. However, Polygon (MATIC) tokens couldn&rsquo;t influence the crypto market. Things are changing with Polygon (MATIC) gaining visibility through Reddit and Donald Trump&rsquo;s NFT collection. Polygon&rsquo;s (MATIC) tokens have suddenly become popular.</p>
<p class="s7">The whale activity is evident as the price showed an increase last weekend. Yet, Polygon (MATIC) is down to $0.768, as of mid December. The current price of Polygon (MATIC) has improved a bit, though it is still at $0.79, at the time of writing. It&rsquo;s interesting to note that Polygon (MATIC) hasn&rsquo;t gotten anywhere close to $2 after January 2022. Despite the sudden interest and whale activity, Polygon (MATIC) cannot be a worthy choice for crypto investment.</p>
<p class="s11">Is Aptos (APT) Going to Lose the Price Marathon</p>
<p class="s7">Aptos (APT) is one of the latest blockchain platforms in the crypto market. Aptos (APT) touched its highest point on 23rd October 2022. The price of Aptos (APT) token hovered around the all time high for a brief period and then fell below the $8.5 mark on 28th October. Unfortunately, Aptos (APT) hasn&rsquo;t succeeded in attracting crypto lovers in large numbers.</p>
<p class="s7">The Aptos (APT) price graph had more lows than highs during the last two months. The Aptos (APT) token price fell to its lowest point at $3.67 on 10th November 2022. Aptos (APT) is at $3.76, at the time of writing. The Aptos (APT) platform is planning the Aptos World Tour Hackathon in 2023 and will travel to four cities in different countries. This might bring some traction for Aptos (APT), but experts say it may not be enough to create a long-term impact.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s11">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is the New Token Taking the Crypto Market by Storm</p>
<p class="s7">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a venture capital platform aiming to revolutionize crowdfunding through its unique NFTs as a service. Startups seeking to raise capital on the platform can mint equity-backed, fractionalized NFTs available for as little as $1. This allows startups to raise capital more efficiently, while everyday investors can buy into startups with comparatively low capital.</p>
<p class="s7">ORBN, the project&rsquo;s native token, has seen significant growth and attention during presale. ORBN grants holders various benefits like staking rewards, access to exclusive investor groups, and more.</p>
<p class="s7">ORBN has already risen from $0.004 to $0.0362 in presale, however analysts expect this to continue until ORBN has risen by a factor of 6000% in January.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto exchange Binance will now allow users to buy cryptocurrencies on its platform using the payment services of Apple Pay and Google Pay.&nbsp;</p>
Binance Build Update
<p>In their latest Binance Build update, the crypto exchange announced that the platform had adopted the two payment services into its platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Binance team tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apple Pay and Google Pay payment options are now available on Binance! Purchase crypto, with ease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This means that customers can now pay for cryptocurrencies using either Apple Pay or Google Pay. The update has already been implemented, and early responses indicate that the new functionality is working properly.&nbsp;</p>
Increasing Crypto Accessibility&nbsp;
<p>This move would be helpful for drawing in more customers to Binance, especially owing to the 44 million strong userbases of Apple Pay and 25 million strong userbases of Google Pay. Both of these payment platforms are the most popular worldwide and occupy the first two rankings in the total number of users. The decision to incorporate these two payment services will open up Binance and cryptocurrencies in general to a massive potential customer base, thus increasing its accessibility. This update has the potential for the greatest customer acquisition into crypto for Binance and the rest of the crypto world. However, the fact remains that these two payment services are not functional in all countries around the globe. It remains to be seen how Binance plans to increase accessibility in these zones.&nbsp;</p>
Other Crypto Firms Adopting Apple Pay
<p>Binance is not the first crypto firm to adopt more mainstream payment services. Apple Pay itself has been adopted by other crypto platforms, like MetaMask. This crypto wallet, which is the preferred mode of interaction with the Ethereum blockchain (DeFi, Web3 dApps, NFTs), integrated Apple Pay into its platform in March 2022. Another crypto wallet, Klever, also added Apple Pay functionality back in April 2021 to provide users with an easier payment option.</p>
Binance In The News
<p>The crypto exchange has been in the news lately since word spread that Binance.US was planning on buying Voyager Digital assets. The crypto exchange put forth a bid of $1 billion and was successful in acquiring the Voyager assets just a few weeks ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Binance had also paused USDC stablecoin withdrawals for several hours, leading to some market-wide FUD around mid-December. The reason given for the pause was insufficient USDC reserves, which warranted a BUSD to USDC swap, after which the service was resumed as normal.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Car manufacturing company BMW has integrated blockchain solutions through BNB Chain and Coinweb for its loyalty program.</p>
BMW x Coinweb Partnership&nbsp;
<p>The luxury car brand has partnered with blockchain company Coinweb to integrate blockchain technology into its organization. This integration will greatly benefit BMW&rsquo;s customers in Thailand through a cross-chain customer loyalty program and will be executed in two phases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coinweb will also be introducing a cross-chain Smart Contract set-up and implementation for BMW. Additionally, the BNB Chain has been chosen as the anchor chain to broadcast transactions to multiple blockchains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CEO of BMW Leasing (Thailand) spoke on the partnership and the blockchain loyalty program, saying,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are very excited to be working with such a great team at Coinweb, and anticipate all the positive outcomes of embracing DLT into our ecosystem. We foresee this shift of manual paperwork towards immutable records on the blockchain to immensely contribute to infallible efficiency and transparency. For our long-time customers here in Thailand, we look forward to continually cultivating their loyalty while rewarding them at the same time through the blockchain-based rewards system delivering real value to be rolled out in 2023."</p>

<p>BMW had previously joined forces with Ford and the non-profit alliance MOBI (Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative) to release the second part of the Vehicle Identity Standard (VID II)</p>
First Phase Plans
<p>In the first phase of the project, both parties will be testing if it is feasible to cross-chain parallel-execute Smart Contracts. The focus will be to automate time-consuming manual processes and streamline vehicle finance operations as offered by BMW. This assessment will have to incorporate checks like fully integrated Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes abiding by Thailand laws.&nbsp;</p>
Second Phase Plans
<p>In the second phase of the project, Coinweb will develop a customized SaaS Web3 application for a customer loyalty program for BMW customers to be able to earn rewards through the blockchain-based rewards program. Owners will collect and accumulate loyalty points through various activities and then be able to redeem them against certain products and services from the BMW ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coinweb CEO Toby Gilbert has also spoken on the partnership,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is an honour to be piloting such an exciting project with BMW, Coinweb's first collaboration with such a prestigious household brand. We hope that once this project is fully launched, it can be used as a benchmark to prove that traditional businesses can fully leverage blockchain technology and benefit hugely from it, without deviating from their core values and mission."</p>

For our long-time customers here in Thailand, we look forward to continually cultivating their loyalty while rewarding them at the same time through the blockchain-based rewards system delivering real value to be rolled out in 2023."</p>

<p>BMW had previously joined forces with Ford and the non-profit alliance MOBI (Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative) to release the second part of the Vehicle Identity Standard (VID II)</p>
First Phase Plans
<p>In the first phase of the project, both parties will be testing if it is feasible to cross-chain parallel-execute Smart Contracts. The focus will be to automate time-consuming manual processes and streamline vehicle finance operations as offered by BMW. This assessment will have to incorporate checks like fully integrated Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes abiding by Thailand laws.&nbsp;</p>
Second Phase Plans
<p>In the second phase of the project, Coinweb will develop a customized SaaS Web3 application for a customer loyalty program for BMW customers to be able to earn rewards through the blockchain-based rewards program. Owners will collect and accumulate loyalty points through various activities and then be able to redeem them against certain products and services from the BMW ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coinweb CEO Toby Gilbert has also spoken on the partnership,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is an honour to be piloting such an exciting project with BMW, Coinweb's first collaboration with such a prestigious household brand. We hope that once this project is fully launched, it can be used as a benchmark to prove that traditional businesses can fully leverage blockchain technology and benefit hugely from it, without deviating from their core values and mission."</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Venezuelan banking watchdog, Sudeban, is working on a system to monitor crypto-related transactions in real-time in order to control any negative impact on the stability of the exchange market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This move is reportedly in response to the recent drop in the value of the bolivar, which some analysts have attributed to activity in the peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto market. To further protect the value of the bolivar, the government is reportedly seeking to monitor the movements of P2P exchanges that involve cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an article first published by Bitcoin.com, Sudeban, in conjunction with the national cryptocurrency regulator Sunacrip, is said to be developing a system with the goal of "fighting the irregular practices that attack our currency and the stability of the exchange market."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The organisation has not provided any additional details on the system, but it is believed that the government is examining the relationship between the volumes exchanged in the cryptocurrency market and the exchange rate between the bolivar and the US dollar.</p>
<p>Some analysts have suggested that the recent drop in activity in peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto markets, caused in part by the collapse of FTX, may be contributing to the rise in the bolivar-dollar exchange rate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it is also believed that other factors, such as the influx of fiat currency into the market during the holiday season, may also be contributing to this trend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the Venezuelan government has not explicitly stated that there is a direct relationship between crypto and the bolivar, it obviously has its suspicions for it to monitor crypto transactions so closely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In relation to the government's efforts to monitor these crypto-related transactions, Legalrocks, a national law firm focused on cryptocurrencies, has reported that more than 75 bank accounts have been blocked due to suspicious activity involving crypto transactions since the end of 2021.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Reserve Bank of India has released its Financial Stability Report, in which it says that crypto needs the same regulation applicable to traditional finance.</p>
No change on crypto from the RBI
<p>Noises coming out of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have not changed in tone at all as regards all things crypto. The latest salvo to be fired at crypto came in the form of the bank&rsquo;s Financial Stability Report.</p>
<p>It does seem rather odd, given the incoming recession, which was undoubtedly caused by central banks printing far too much currency. This in turn sent inflation spiralling up across the world, impacting on the ordinary citizen by reducing their purchasing power by another huge amount.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the leading bank in India to spend so much time and effort on maligning such a tiny and still fairly inconsequential asset as crypto might appear to be a case of bringing in a cannon to kill a fly.</p>
<p>However, the RBI is not alone in its endeavours. Central banks from across the world also seem eager to join in the crypto-bashing, given that crypto is in the midst of a particularly harsh bear market, and various centralised exchanges have collapsed, they are having quite a field day.</p>
<p>Despite the entire crypto market cap amounting to less than $800 billion, the RBI said in its Financial Stability Report:</p>

<p>"Although the crypto assets market remains volatile, there have not yet been any spillovers onto the stability of the formal financial system. The accumulated experience, however, suggests that they form an unstable ecosystem and there is growing evidence that they remain highly concentrated and interconnected,"&nbsp;</p>

3 options to deal with crypto
<p>The RBI stated in the report that in its view there were 3 options that might be applied to crypto. The first option, and the only one with any vestige of credibility, is to regulate crypto the same as any traditional finance company.</p>
<p>Crypto is a completely new asset class that has brought incredible innovation to finance. Should it be allowed to continue with fair and well thought out regulation that protects investors while encouraging more innovation, then there wouldn&rsquo;t be many who would argue with it.</p>
<p>Option number two is to completely ban it given (in the bank&rsquo;s view) that it has &ldquo;negligible&rdquo; real-life use cases. However, the bank does acknowledge that other countries might choose not to go along with this given their differing regulatory approaches and their laws on individual rights.</p>
<p>Option number three was to just allow crypto to collapse and to let it become &ldquo;systemically irrelevant&rdquo;. For all that, crypto undeniably has use cases and investors will be keeping an eye on it as fiat currencies slip further in value and begin to lose trust across wider populations.</p>
<p>With this in mind, it could be expected that central banks and regulatory agencies across the world might seek to combine their approach to crypto in an effort to crush it enough that their central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) can be implemented.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain Protocol Coti, the protocol behind Cardano&rsquo;s new stablecoin, has announced that it has successfully upgraded its network, MultiDAG 2.0.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The upgrade aims to transition its ecosystem from a single-currency infrastructure to a multi-token network.&nbsp;</p>
Coti&rsquo;s MultiDAG 2.0 Mainnet Goes Live&nbsp;
<p>The DeFi protocol behind Cardano&rsquo;s new Djed stablecoin has announced the successful hard fork MultiDAG 2.0, aiming to transition the ecosystem from a single-currency infrastructure to a multi-token network. Coti revealed the launch of the mainnet on the 29th of December, during which Explorer 2.0 and the Bridge 2.0 app were also deployed. The team behind a protocol released a statement stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This launch signifies a massive step for the crypto industry, as well as COTI, as the MultiDAG 2.0 will increase the growth of the widespread adoption of crypto payments for enterprises that are yet to adopt crypto payment solutions. The transition from a single currency infrastructure to a multi-token network is an exciting step for us, and we&rsquo;re glad to have your support on this important path.&rdquo;</p>

MultiDAG 2.0&nbsp;
<p>MultiDAG 2.0 leverages the COTI MultiDAG (CMD) standard, which facilitates the issuance of tokens on the COTI Trustchain. This is similar to the concept of ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. However, in the case of the COTI Trustchain, the issuance takes place on a single DAG. The MultiDAG 2.0 release will help enhance Coti&rsquo;s position in helping enterprises launch their own Private Payment Network (PPN), which would also include the issuance of CMD-branded payment tokens, CMD-branded loyalty tokens, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The launch of the MultiDAG 2.0 protocol heralds the full transition of COTI from a single currency infrastructure to a multi-token network. We believe COTI is uniquely positioned to serve enterprises, enabling them to launch their own Private Payment Network (PPN), which includes the issuance of CMD [COTI MultiDAG] branded payment tokens, issuance of CMD branded loyalty tokens, and more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coti added that the new tokens would retain the same capabilities of the Trustchain in terms of security, scalability, and throughput, helping manage any requirement of enterprises. Additionally, the Bridge 2.0 app released along with the protocol also comes with a refund feature, allowing users to apply for a refund in case a swap fails due to technical difficulties.&nbsp;</p>
Change In Fee Model&nbsp;
<p>COTI also announced a change in its fee model. The firm revealed that deposit fees would see a decrease of 50%. Meanwhile, withdrawal fees will see a switch from a set price to a dynamic one. However, the early withdrawal fee will remain intact. Other changes in the fee include a fixed multiplier charge which is applicable to multiplied deposits, and a liquidation fee between 1% to 5%, which will also be applicable to multiplied deposits. According to the team, the new fee model will go into effect on the 15th of January, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
Coti&rsquo;s Association With Djed Stablecoin
<p>The Coti ecosystem is also heavily involved with Djed, the Cardano ecosystem&rsquo;s new stablecoin. The protocol is the official issuer of the over-collateralized algorithmic stablecoin, which is expected to launch on the mainnet in January 2023. The co-founder of Coti, Shahaf Bar-Geffen, is quite optimistic about the upcoming launch of Djed, despite the catastrophic failures of previous algorithmic stablecoins such as TerraUSD (UST). He shared his views on Djed when speaking at the Cardano summit, stating that he expected the stablecoin to act as a &ldquo;safe haven&rdquo; in the Cardano network.&nbsp;</p>

<p>COTI also announced a change in its fee model. The firm revealed that deposit fees would see a decrease of 50%. Meanwhile, withdrawal fees will see a switch from a set price to a dynamic one. However, the early withdrawal fee will remain intact. Other changes in the fee include a fixed multiplier charge which is applicable to multiplied deposits, and a liquidation fee between 1% to 5%, which will also be applicable to multiplied deposits. According to the team, the new fee model will go into effect on the 15th of January, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
Coti&rsquo;s Association With Djed Stablecoin
<p>The Coti ecosystem is also heavily involved with Djed, the Cardano ecosystem&rsquo;s new stablecoin. The protocol is the official issuer of the over-collateralized algorithmic stablecoin, which is expected to launch on the mainnet in January 2023. The co-founder of Coti, Shahaf Bar-Geffen, is quite optimistic about the upcoming launch of Djed, despite the catastrophic failures of previous algorithmic stablecoins such as TerraUSD (UST). He shared his views on Djed when speaking at the Cardano summit, stating that he expected the stablecoin to act as a &ldquo;safe haven&rdquo; in the Cardano network.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Pacific Island of Fiji has elected a new Prime Minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, who took office on December 24, and the good news is &ndash; he is reportedly pro-Bitcoin. </p>
<p>Fiji, a nation made up of over 330 islands and located in the Pacific Ocean, elected a new Prime Minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, who took office on December 24. The news was shared by Lord Fusitu&rsquo;a, a Tongan noble and a former member of the Tongan parliament. Lord Fusitu&rsquo;a said that he explained to the newly elected PM &ldquo;how Fiji can do Bitcoin legal tender like Tonga&rdquo; and hinted that could be two &ldquo;BTC Legal Tender Bills for the Pacific in 2023.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>Cointelegraph reports that Lord Fusitu&rsquo;a explained to them that &ldquo;The new PM is definitely pro-Bitcoin&rdquo; and quotes Fusitu&rsquo;a as saying:</p>
<p>

</p>

<p>He asked to meet with me which we did via zooms since last year to walk him through step by step, how he could adopt bitcoin legal tender.</p>

<p>Tonga has its own plans to implement Bitcoin as a legal tender and reportedly has legislation in the works which could go live as early as Q2 2023. Tonga started initiating its plans to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender soon after El Salvador&rsquo;s Bitcoin Law came into effect.</p>
Bitcoin Would Benefit Pacific Islands
<p>Both Fiji and Tonga stand to gain a lot from adopting Bitcoin with respect to remittances. Both countries face similar economic and developmental challenges given their location and history. Fiji reports strong growth in terms of financial inclusion recently, but just half of the female population has access to bank accounts making Bitcoin a brilliant tool to improve remittances and aid in banking the unbanked. Bitcoin Magazine reports that remittances sent to Fiji accounted for 11.33% of the country&rsquo;s GDP in 2021, while in Tonga the situation is even more severe &ndash; remittances accounted for a massive 45.5% of Tonga&rsquo;s GDP over the same period.</p>
