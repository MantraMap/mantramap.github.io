On-chain data shows Bitcoin exchanges have registered the most significant outflows since the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX back in November.

The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;all exchanges netflow,&#8221; which measures the net amount of Bitcoin exiting or entering into the wallets of all centralized exchanges. The metric&#8217;s value is calculated by taking the difference between the inflows (the coins going in) and the outflows (the coins moving out). When the indicator has a positive value, the inflows overwhelm the outflows, and a net number of coins are deposited to exchanges. As one of the main reasons investors deposit to exchanges is for selling purposes, this trend can have bearish implications for the price of the crypto. On the other hand, negative values imply that a net amount of supply is currently being pulled off these platforms. Generally, holders withdraw their coins from exchanges to hold onto them for extended periods in personal wallets. Thus, such metric values can signal that investors are accumulating at the moment, which may have a bullish impact on the price. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin all exchange&#8217;s netflow over the last few months: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite negative recently &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange netflow recorded a deep negative spike during the past day. This outflow amounted to around 7,000 BTC, leaving the wallets of these platforms the largest value the metric has seen since the FTX crash back in November of last year. From the chart, it&#8217;s apparent that the aftermath of FTX&#8217;s collapse saw some substantial outflow values. The reason behind that is that a known exchange like FTX going belly up instilled fear among investors and made them more aware of the risks of keeping their coins in centralized platforms. Naturally, these holders fled exchanges in masses (causing the netflow to plunge into red values) so that they could store their Bitcoin in offsite wallets, the keys they own. Interestingly, the latest negative netflow spike was recorded while Bitcoin has been observing a sharp rally. Usually, inflows are more commonly seen in periods like now, as investors rush to take some profits.

That would be only if these investors made the withdrawals with accumulation in mind. In the scenario that they transferred out these coins for selling through over-the-counter (OTC) deals instead, Bitcoin could instead feel a bearish impulse. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $23,100, up 8% in the last week.
