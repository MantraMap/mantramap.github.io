			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Bears Target 27466 on Downside:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 18 August 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) extended its recent weak performance early in the Asian session as the pair remained on the defensive after encountering additional selling pressure around the 29665.27 area.&nbsp; Stops were elected below the 28921 and 28614 levels during the ongoing depreciation, downside price objectives associated with recent selling activity around the 30222 and 29665.27 areas.&nbsp; Large Stops were also elected below the 28495.58 area during the tumble, a downside price objective linked to selling pressure around the 30421.29 area.&nbsp; The downside price pressure temporarily slowed around the 28316.37 area, representing a test of the 50% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 24750 to 31862.21.&nbsp; Large Stops are cited below the 27991.29 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 15460 to 31862.21.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional areas of technical support and potential buying pressure in these appreciating ranges include the 27466, 27166, 26428, 26272, and 25715 areas.</p>
<p>Above the market, upside price objectives include the 30526, 30611, 30762, and 31145 areas.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to other levels of buying pressure include the 32125 and 33569 areas, and Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 32043, 34531, 34658, and 35912 areas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional downside price objectives linked to recent selling pressure include the 28213, 28137, 27979, 27757, 27430, 27409, 27338, 27312, 27246, 26501, 26348, and 26199 levels.&nbsp; Also, the 28095.44 area represents the 23.6% retracement of the historic depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp;&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;100-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 29249.21 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 28998.47.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently, Visa announced its trial of Ethereum (ETH) gas payments via cards, marking a significant milestone toward mainstream crypto adoption. Additionally, the popularity of projects like Pomerdoge (POMD) and its presale has further illustrated the appeal of innovative crypto projects. Today, we will take a closer look at both of these developments. </p>
<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
Ethereum (ETH) Price Rises After Visa Announcement 
<p>The global payment company Visa has been developing an experimental method that enables on-chain Ethereum (ETH) gas prices to be paid using credit cards. The fintech startup claims that the testing for this solution is now complete, allowing customers to use credit or debit cards to pay the gas cost with fiat on Ethereum directly. </p>
<p>The ease of use and convenience offered by this approach has the potential to make Ethereum transactions more accessible to a broader audience. As a result, the Ethereum price soared by 1.2% over the past seven days.</p>
<p>This bullish trend has continued as the Ethereum value now sits at $1,849.67 with a market cap of $222B, a rise of 0.18% overnight. Furthermore, the technical analysis of Ethereum paints a bullish picture. In other words, its moving averages and technical indicators show buy signals. Therefore, experts forecast a jump to $2,335.71 by December 2023.</p>
Pomerdoge (POMD): Stellar Presale Performance
<p>While traditional financial players are making strides in crypto adoption with Ethereum, innovative blockchain projects are also making waves. Pomerdoge (POMD), an exciting play-to-earn gaming project, has captured mass appeal with its presale, providing early birds with a 14% ROI.</p>
Exploring The Pomerdoge (POMD) Success
<p>At the heart of Pomerdoge is the opportunity to build and nurture your Pomer character. As you progress through the game, your Pomer character evolves and grows to elite levels, reflecting your skill and dedication. To clarify, this unique feature adds an element of personalization and ownership that resonates with the core principles of blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Pomerdoge 7,777 NFT collection is another rare and exciting component. Each NFT within this limited edition collection holds the promise of something extraordinary, but the full extent of its benefits remains tantalizingly undisclosed until closer to the launch. What we do know is that only POMD holders will gain access to it, and each NFT will be worth 0.2 ETH.</p>
The Allure of POMD Tokens
<p>POMD tokens fuel the play-to-earn mechanics, allowing players to engage with the game and reap the rewards. Currently, the POMD token is valued at just $0.008 as it is in Phase One of its presale. However, millions of tokens have been sold already, so demand is high. In fact, some experts even foresee a 20x surge for it before its presale concludes.</p>
<p>Considering its low market cap of $14M and ties to an online game industry with 3B players, Pomerdoge could see the same growth as Ethereum did. If you wish to purchase this token and participate in weekly giveaways totaling $150,000 - sign up below. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">Pushing the possibility of artificial intelligence (AI), tools like Google Bard are now being used for market analysis and predictions. With very high accuracy, these tools are growing in relevancy. Today, Google Bard has stirred excitement in the crypto space, after bullish predictions for Shiba Inu (SHIB), ApeCoin (APE), and Everlodge (ELDG).</p>
<p>Join the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives</p>
Summary
● Shiba Inu is forming a golden cross and can rally by as much as 50%
● With an expansion of the APE ecosystem, the price of ApeCoin could rally to $2.5
● Experts predict up to 20x rally as Everlodge allows everyone to invest in real estate
<p>Join the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives</p>
Why Google Bard Predicts a Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rally
<p class="s5">Over the last eight weeks, the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been steadily increasing, finally reclaiming the $0.00001000 support last week. Google Bard has predicted that the rally for the Shiba Inu coin will continue, citing three major reasons.</p>
<p class="s5">The first reason according to Bard is the launch of Shibarium. The layer 2 network is set to launch this week and add more utility to Shiba Inu. Next, Google Bard highlights the increasing Shiba Inu burn. By reducing the number of SHIB, it predicts an increase in the Shiba Inu price.</p>
<p class="s5">Lastly, SHIB is approaching a golden cross after printing six consecutive weeks of bullish candles. If this holds up, Google Bard has predicted that the price of Shiba Inu could rally by 50% and trade as high as $0.00001510.</p>
Why Google Bard Predicts an ApeCoin (APE) Rally
<p class="s5">The AI chatbot has highlighted several reasons why the ApeCoin price could increase in the coming days. According to the AI chatbot, ApeCoin (APE) first is part of the biggest non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystem, ensuring its success.</p>
<p class="s5">Also, the ecosystem is about to witness a significant expansion, which could also help the Apecoin value increase. Lastly, APE has been decoupling from the price of Bitcoin, which hints at a major price outbreak.</p>
<p class="s5">At the time of this writing, the price of Apecoin stands at $2.01. With the current projections, ApeCoin could reach highs of $2.5 by the end of August.</p>
Why Google Bard Predicts an Everlodge (ELDG) Rally
<p class="s5">Everlodge (ELDG) is another project that has attracted strong bullish predictions from Google Bard. The project is disrupting the timeshare sector by introducing a hybrid property co-ownership model, allowing millions of new investors to participate with as little as $100.</p>
<p class="s5">Google Bard is bullish about Everlodge as the project debuts as a one-of-a-kind initiative in the $280 trillion global real estate industry. Also, the project&rsquo;s partnerships with well-known hotel brands and luxury real estate developers would drive the price higher.</p>
<p class="s5">Lastly, Everlodge's growth will be ensured by the project's broad ecosystem and customer-friendly benefits. At the time of this writing, Everlodge is in its beta presale stage and sells for $0.01.</p>
<p class="s5">Based on Google Bard&rsquo;s predictions, investors can expect a 20x price surge for Everloge in 2023 as the token has been given a yearly high of $0.20 per token.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently, three cryptocurrencies have been catching the eye of traders - Stellar (XLM), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Everlodge (ELDG). While the crypto market is a dynamic and ever-expanding landscape, these cryptocurrencies stand out with their unique features and potential for substantial growth. Let&rsquo;s examine these three projects further and find out what makes them so appealing. </p>
Summary
- Stellar partners up with Bitso, causing a price increase
- Dogecoin shows green monthly charts
- Everlodge to bring outstanding returns for early buyers
<p>Join the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives</p>
Stellar (XLM): Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments
<p>Stellar (XLM) is hailed as one of the frontrunners in the blockchain industry when it comes to facilitating cross-border transactions. Designed to bridge traditional financial systems with decentralized networks, Stellar&rsquo;s mission is to make money more fluid and accessible globally. </p>
<p>Additionally, Stellar&rsquo;s partnerships with established financial institutions bolster its credibility.</p>
<p>Recently, Bitso announced its partnership with the Stellar Development Foundation. This partnership aims to improve communication between the world stage and the Latin American crypto ecosystem. As a result, interest in the Stellar crypto rose as its trading volume jumped by 3% overnight, reaching $75,597,416. </p>
<p>Currently, one Stellar token costs $0.1339. In the past week, it achieved a peak of $0.1450. But,the technical indicators for Stellar are all showing strong buy signals. Therefore, experts remain bullish about it. Consequently, they predict a jump to $0.17 for Stellar by December 2023. </p>
Dogecoin (DOGE): From Meme to Market Resilience
<p>The Dogecoin (DOGE) journey from being a playful meme to a resilient cryptocurrency is a testament to its enduring popularity. Despite its lighthearted origins, Dogecoin has carved out a significant place in the crypto market. Consequently, gaining attention from high-profile individuals and capturing the mainstream spotlight.</p>
<p>This attention was displayed on the Dogecoin price charts as well. Most notably, the Dogecoin value soared by 4% in the past month alone. Moreover, its trading volume surged by 11.11% overnight, jumping to $318,640,213. One Dogecoin costs $0.0737 with a market cap of $10.3B. </p>
<p>While its price may experience fluctuations, its strong community engagement and potential for broader adoption continue to make it an attractive choice for investors. Due to all these reasons, bullish experts predict Dogecoin skyrocketing to $0.098 by this year&rsquo;s end. </p>
Everlodge (ELDG): Transforming Real Estate Investment
<p>While Stellar and Dogecoin are tokens worth watching, one project may outshine them - Everlodge (ELDG). With a predicted 20% pump coming in August, this upcoming property marketplace is breaking new ground by merging real estate and blockchain technology through fractional ownership and NFTs.</p>
<p>This innovative approach allows investors to gain exposure to many real estate assets that were previously out of reach. In other words, you can become a fractional owner of a luxurious home on the blockchain for prices as low as $100. Everlodge accomplishes this by minting NFTs representing high-end villas, homes, and properties and then fractionalizing them. </p>
<p>Due to this investment method, Everlodge provides greater property ownership transparency, security, and immutability. Not only that, NFTs enable unique and customizable ownership experiences, as owners can trade their NFTs on Everlodge&rsquo;s secondary marketplace or any third-party ERC20-compatible marketplace.</p>
<p>Holding the ELDG native token is crucial to obtaining discounts on trading fees, free nightly stays in properties, or staking rewards. One token costs only $0.01 since it is in Stage 1 of its presale. What separates ELDG from Stellar and Dogecoin is its low market cap, which means it can surge much faster. Thus, analysts forecast a 280% rise before its presale ends.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In this market analysis, we'll delve into the movements of three intriguing cryptocurrencies: XRP (XRP), Tron (TRX), and Pomerdoge (POMD). Market analysis is important since trends can shift daily in the cryptocurrency market. Thus, traders and enthusiasts alike must keep a keen eye on the performance of various tokens.</p>
<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
XRP (XRP): Navigating the Waves
<p>XRP (XRP) has been navigating waves in the market. Recent weeks have seen the XRP price experiencing turbulence, with a 10.8% decline over the past 14 days. </p>
<p>However, XRP has shown green charts again as it trades hands at $0.6306 with a market cap of $33.2B, up 0.70% overnight. This came as a result of the recent XRP listing on Gemini. </p>
<p>Despite this minuscule rise, the XRP coin trading volume has plummeted by 40.78% daily, sinking to $1,022,725,535. Moreover, its moving averages and technical indicators show strong sell signals. Therefore, many experts foresee a short-term price drop for XRP, prompting buyers to sidestep this token.</p>
Tron (TRX): Showing Increased Volatility
<p>Tron (TRX) has been facing challenges recently. In fact, over the past two weeks, the Tron price has dropped by 7.2%. Since it was rejected by the range high on July 22, the Tron coin value has been fluctuating between $0.070 and $0.088.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Tron recently breached a short-term ascending support line, further indicating the possibility of a negative trend. Tron has a value of $0.07725 with a market cap of $6.9B, up 0.39% in the past day alone. </p>
<p>But, the trading volume of Tron has taken a 10.41% dip during that time, sinking to $154,358,626. Its technical indicators also paint a bearish outlook as they are all in the red. Thus, market analysts foresee a drop to its support level of $0.066 for Tron soon. </p>
Pomerdoge (POMD): Unleashing Gaming Potential
<p>Amid XRP's and Tron's ups and downs, a new player has emerged on the scene with an intriguing ecosystem - Pomerdoge (POMD). This cryptocurrency introduces a gaming-focused approach, aiming to connect players globally through a play-to-earn model. In fact, with over 3B individuals playing online games, Pomerdoge taps into a flourishing market.</p>
Closer Look at the Pomergame
<p>The main appeal for gamers will lie in the Pomergame - a unique P2E crypto game where users can earn rewards just by playing it. Not only that, the Pomerplace marketplace is another exciting component of Pomerdoge. This innovative platform is a bustling hub where players gather to engage in many activities.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Pomerplace is a marketplace that opens doors to a universe of possibilities. Here, you can buy, sell, and trade the valuable items you've skillfully collected throughout your Pomerdoge journey, adding a tangible dimension to your virtual conquests.</p>
What Makes the POMD Native Token So Alluring?
<p>Buyers are flooding the Pomerdoge presale looking to obtain the POMD native token for an affordable price. One POMD token is worth $0.008, and those who bought it early enjoy a 14% ROI. Also, experts have taken notice of POMD's $14M market cap. In other words, when compared to XRP and Tron, POMD will skyrocket much quicker.</p>
<p>Those who purchase it now will gain access to an exclusive 7,777 NFT collection created by Pomerdoge. Each NFT will cost 0.2 ETH and provide holders with unique perks. In addition, early birds will also participate in weekly giveaways totaling $150,000. Therefore, do not miss out on this potential blue-chip token projected to surge by 20x before its presale ends.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Polygon Labs has partnered with Korean telecommunications company SK Telecom to develop a complete Web3 ecosystem.</p>
Enhancing Web3 Ecosystem with Polygon Integration
<p>International software development company Polygon Labs has announced a strategic collaboration with Korean mobile giant SK Telecom (SKT) to develop a robust Web3 ecosystem. The agreement signing ceremony took place at SKT's headquarters in Seoul, with Oh Se-hyun, Vice President and Head of Web3 CO of SKT, and Polygon Labs' CEO Marc Boiron in attendance.</p>
<p>Under the partnership, SKT will integrate support for the Polygon blockchain into its NFT marketplace TopPort and upcoming Web3 wallet.&nbsp;</p>
Polygon&rsquo;s Web3 Advancement
<p>The partnership between Polygon Labs and SKT will enable users to avail of faster and more cost-efficient transactions while leveraging the security and decentralization of Ethereum.</p>
<p>Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron emphasized the significance of this collaboration, saying,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Polygon Labs has been developing optimal blockchain technology for Web3 popularization, and we see this collaboration with SKT as an important step in providing Web3 experiences to more consumers."</p>

<p>The Polygon Labs team had previously revealed its plans to establish multiple layer-2 networks on the Polygon blockchain as an integral component of their Polygon 2.0 roadmap.&nbsp;</p>
TopPort and Web3 Wallet Integration
<p>SKT had launched its NFT marketplace, TopPort, in 2022. The new partnership will also come in handy for the marketplace, as it will expand its capabilities. Creators would be able to mint Polygon-based NFTs on TopPort, making it compatible and scalable with other NFT platforms on the Polygon ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SK Telecom is also scheduled to drop its Web3 wallet in the second half of 2023. The partnership with Polygon Labs will integrate the latter&rsquo;s excellent network support and NFT trading facilities into the wallet for a seamless adoption of Web3 technologies by SKT users.&nbsp;</p>
Fostering Web3 Startups and Ecosystem Growth
<p>The collaboration extends beyond technical integration. Both companies will work together to identify promising Web3 startups and provide incubation support. Polygon Labs plans to explore potential investments in Web3 startups recommended by SKT through its subsidiary, Polygon Ventures.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the partnership aims to facilitate the entry of competitive Web3 startups into the global market and introduce leading decentralized apps (dApps) from around the world into the Korean market.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Polygon Labs has partnered with Korean telecommunications company SK Telecom to develop a complete Web3 ecosystem.</p>
Enhancing Web3 Ecosystem with Polygon Integration
<p>International software development company Polygon Labs has announced a strategic collaboration with Korean mobile giant SK Telecom (SKT) to develop a robust Web3 ecosystem. The agreement signing ceremony took place at SKT's headquarters in Seoul, with Oh Se-hyun, Vice President and Head of Web3 CO of SKT, and Polygon Labs' CEO Marc Boiron in attendance.</p>
<p>Under the partnership, SKT will integrate support for the Polygon blockchain into its NFT marketplace TopPort and upcoming Web3 wallet.&nbsp;</p>
Polygon&rsquo;s Web3 Advancement
<p>The partnership between Polygon Labs and SKT will enable users to avail of faster and more cost-efficient transactions while leveraging the security and decentralization of Ethereum.</p>
<p>Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron emphasized the significance of this collaboration, saying,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Polygon Labs has been developing optimal blockchain technology for Web3 popularization, and we see this collaboration with SKT as an important step in providing Web3 experiences to more consumers."</p>

<p>The Polygon Labs team had previously revealed its plans to establish multiple layer-2 networks on the Polygon blockchain as an integral component of their Polygon 2.0 roadmap.&nbsp;</p>
TopPort and Web3 Wallet Integration
<p>SKT had launched its NFT marketplace, TopPort, in 2022. The new partnership will also come in handy for the marketplace, as it will expand its capabilities. Creators would be able to mint Polygon-based NFTs on TopPort, making it compatible and scalable with other NFT platforms on the Polygon ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SK Telecom is also scheduled to drop its Web3 wallet in the second half of 2023. The partnership with Polygon Labs will integrate the latter&rsquo;s excellent network support and NFT trading facilities into the wallet for a seamless adoption of Web3 technologies by SKT users.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The University of California Berkeley&rsquo;s SETI@Home project is no longer allowing new users to participate in its ongoing search for extraterrestrial life, meaning it&rsquo;s no longer able to provide a passive income stream for those who&rsquo;re willing to leave their computer on 24/7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SETI@Home project launched way back in 1999, inviting users to download a special software program that enabled them to donate their excess computing power to the initiative, which is looking for signs of alien life elsewhere in the cosmic void. But much to people&rsquo;s disappointment, scientists announced in 2021 that they&rsquo;re winding down the project and no longer require contributions from the general public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the announcement was a major disappointment for participants, the good news is that there are still many other distributed computing projects that allow users to make money by renting out their idle storage space or processing power.&nbsp;</p>
What is Distributed Computing?
<p>It might sound incredibly technical, but the concept of distributed computing is actually a very simple one. It refers to a process where the combined resources of multiple, distributed computers are aggregated together, providing powerful compute or storage resources for heavy-duty projects. In some ways it can be likened to Airbnb, but instead of renting out your spare room or vacation home, you simply rent out your unused computing resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To participate, you&rsquo;ll need to download and install the required application or plugin for whatever project it is you want to contribute to. Then it&rsquo;ll run in the background, allowing your computer&rsquo;s excess resources to be used by the organization concerned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Where Can I Participate?
<p>There are dozens of interesting projects looking to borrow people&rsquo;s excess computing capacity in support of various use cases:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Spacemesh
<p>Mining cryptocurrency is one of the most obvious ideas for utilizing your spare capacity that comes to mind, but it&rsquo;s important to choose a suitable network. While it was possible to mine Bitcoin from a PC back in the early days, its cryptographic algorithms have become so complex and its mining ecosystem so competitive that such limited hardware simply won&rsquo;t do any more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enter Spacemesh, an alternative cryptocurrency network that&rsquo;s designed to serve the average joe who wants to mine a little crypto on his or her computer at home. Unlike Bitcoin&rsquo;s proof-of-work consensus algorithm, Spacemesh uses a novel proof-of-space time consensus mechanism that is much less energy-intensive. It also employs a unique &ldquo;race-free approach&rdquo; that disincentivizes the use of massive amounts of hardware, ensuring everyone can participate and earn a passive income on their personal Mac or PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All that&rsquo;s required to start mining with Spacemesh is an Intel or AMD CPU with at least 1GB of RAM, and an always-on, unmetered internet connection with a minimum of 5 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike Bitcoin, where the CPU is the main factor for miners, Spacemesh relies on disk storage resources, which do not use energy when they&rsquo;re idle, resulting in much lower costs. The protocol is centered on fairness, and ensures all miners are rewarded for their contributions at every EPOCH, which currently concludes every two weeks, with their exact reward based on how much storage space they commit in proportion to the network size. In addition, the protocol prevents whales from joining the system with massive storage resources &ndash; in such a case, they would face much higher overhead costs, eliminating any profit gains. In this way, Spacemesh ensures its network remains highly decentralized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
HyperCycle&nbsp;
<p>As an alternative, PC and laptop owners can opt to join the HyperCycle network, which is a Layer-0 blockchain that&rsquo;s building an artificial general intelligence network. The idea with this is to promote cooperation between AI agents by establishing a network of nodes that collaborate with one another to solve complex problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This cooperative AI sees distributed computers aggregate their compute resources to create a &ldquo;global brain&rdquo;, kind of like a distributed supercomputer. AI systems can tap into this network and use its combined power to perform computing tasks that would normally be performed by sophisticated server networks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users are required to purchase an individual software node license to participate in HyperCycle&rsquo;s network and deposit a minimum of 1,024 HYPC tokens. That might sound expensive, but HyperCycle insists it&rsquo;s a small price to pay to democratize access to advanced AI computation and pave the way for a future &ldquo;Internet of AIs&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Fleek Network
<p>A great option for Web3 enthusiasts, Fleek Network is calling on users to participate in the industry&rsquo;s first decentralized content delivery network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CDNs play a key role in the internet, ensuring that websites, images and videos can load instantaneously no matter where users are located. Essentially, CDNs are geographically-distributed server networks that enable content to be cached closer to users. When someone connects to an app or website, the content will be delivered from the closest server to their location, significantly reducing latency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fleek Network aims to provide an alternative to centralized CDNs operated by companies like Cloudflare, which go against the ethos of Web3. Of course, it cannot build out a global server network from scratch, so instead it relies on people who&rsquo;re willing to provide computing resources in exchange for rewards. It invites anyone to contribute bandwidth to its network by running a cache node, so they can accelerate content delivery to end users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fleek Network&rsquo;s approach could actually be more advantageous, as its reliance on contributors means its network can potentially extend to the smallest rural villages. Whereas most centralized CDNs are restricted to building their infrastructure in cities, Fleek will be able to operate nodes across the globe. The result is that someone living in Siberia can be served by a node from the same town, rather than connecting to a large data center several hundred kilometers away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Storj
<p>If you have plenty of hard drive space and you&rsquo;re willing to put it to work, Storj offers a viable opportunity with its decentralized cloud storage network, which it presents as an alternative to services like Dropbox, Box and Amazon Web Services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It claims to have some big advantages, including greater privacy with guarantees that content stored within the Storj network will never be monitored or censored. All content stored on people&rsquo;s hard drives is fully encrypted, and only the owner has the keys required to access it. The other key selling point is that content is automatically distributed across multiple devices, eliminating the risk of downtime that would prevent users from accessing their files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To rent out your extra disk drive space to Storj, all that&rsquo;s required is to download its application, install it, and then select how much storage capacity you want to contribute. Once activated, that portion of your hard drive becomes a part of the Storj network so you can no longer use it yourself. Instead, you&rsquo;ll be compensated for renting it out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the requirements, obviously, is that you must be willing to leave your computer up and running and ensure it&rsquo;s always online, in return for payments made to your bank account each month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Hyperlink
<p>Hyperlink refers to itself as the &ldquo;World Supercomputer&rdquo;, but is really a global network of computers that anyone can join to earn passive income. Users donate their computer&rsquo;s resources to host third-party websites, mobile applications and content. Its services are offered as a low-cost alternative to businesses that don&rsquo;t want to invest in their own infrastructure or traditional cloud computing services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the advantages of Hyperlink is that it claims to offer significant earnings potential for users, saying it&rsquo;s possible to earn up to $8,600 per year by connecting a desktop or laptop to its network and leaving it running 24/7. Users can even contribute an entire server if they happen to have one lying around.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another bonus is that Hyperlink offers flexible payment options, allowing users to receive their earnings through PayPal, bank transfers, credit card payment and more. In future, Hyperlink will expand its network to include tablets and smartphones too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
What Are The Downsides?
<p>There actually does not seem to be a lot of downsides to earning a passive income, but those considering it should be aware that by running these programs and keeping their computer switched on 24/7, it may degrade its performance and lifetime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the reality is that most people don&rsquo;t normally use the full capacity of their machine, so they can afford to contribute without really noticing any performance impact. And of course, it&rsquo;s always possible to use an external storage device if you do need more disk space.</p>
<p>Then again, if you do need to perform intensive computing tasks yourself, it might be worth investing in a more powerful machine, or even a second computer that you can leave running and forget about.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest partnership is an extension of Open Campus&rsquo; mission to educate and raise awareness on issues of climate change and environmental conservation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This July, Open Campus, a community-led Web 3 educational content platform, announced the launch of their #ClimateChange4Kids campaign on X (formerly Twitter) to educate the upcoming generations on the importance of protecting our planet. To extend its efforts, Open Campus is now in partnership with its affiliate, TinyTap and Code Green, a Web 3 organization leveraging blockchain and art to help conserve the environment, to create educational content on climate change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The strategic partnership aims to extend knowledge and awareness of climate change via the Open Campus platform, providing creators, educators and teachers with a decentralized platform to create interactive educational games and earn from their content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While several parts of the world face extreme temperatures and wildfires, such an initiative could be a crucial step in imparting knowledge on how to stop it.&nbsp; Code Green, TinyTap and Open Campus come together in a mission to educate younger generations &ndash; in an engaging and interactive way &ndash; on climate change. Furthermore, the initiative extends the belief in &ldquo;the power of education to shape a more sustainable future&rdquo;, a mission also shared by the&nbsp; United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).&nbsp;</p>

<p>"By combining education, technology, and gaming, we're creating a unique platform to engage children and empower them with the knowledge and awareness to tackle this urgent crisis for our planet,&rdquo; Inna Modja, CEO of Code Green and Goodwill Ambassador for the UNCCD, said.</p>

Open Campus, TinyTap and Code Green launch NFT Giveaway&nbsp;
<p>In light of the new collaboration, TinyTap will create a new climate change-centred course and integrate some elements of Code Green&rsquo;s game HEALV3RSE, available on The Sandbox. Featured on the UNCCD website, HEALV3RSE is a metaverse game that allows users to play, learn about the planet, and have a real-world impact. The game&rsquo;s avatars and NFT will feature in the lessons to incentivize learners and enhance the overall quality of the course, the press statement reads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through various levels of the game, players discover facts about the environment, make eco-friendly choices to help their virtual planet and perform healing actions. The &lsquo;Play To Heal&rsquo; model enhances the game and gives players a novel experience as they participate in healing actions for our planet, such as planting trees, cleaning oceans, and installing solar panels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, Open Campus and Code Green are launching a giveaway to promote the new course. Players who participate in the giveaway campaign have a chance to win up to 100 HEALV3RSE avatars and equipment NFTs. Follow-up details on the giveaway will be posted on Open Campus X (fmr. Twitter) page.</p>
<p>The latest strategic partnership follows the successful launch of &lsquo;Climate Change for Kids&rsquo; in July, aiming to enhance awareness of climate change, especially in younger generations. The #ClimateChange4Kids initiative has seen tremendous support worldwide, with over 200,000 impressions on X. Lastly, Open Campus&rsquo; recent partnership with Cloud Co Entertainment saw the company get a license to use the image of Care Bears, one of the most popular children's products line.&nbsp;</p>

Banks fight dirty
<p>Founder of Morgan Creek Capital, Yusko recently gave an interview in which he gave a portrayal of the banks that isn&rsquo;t often heard. He stated that banks have paid more in fines for criminal acts such as fraud and money laundering than the entire market cap of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>He affirmed that banks are extremely worried about crypto and blockchain technology because it heralds an end to their existence, given that the middle man is now no longer needed. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We (the banks) skim $7 trillion a year out of this system. It&rsquo;s 6 to 8% of GDP that goes to the banks for trust - but we can replace trust with truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yusko is of the belief that the FTX collapse was actually orchestrated in order to bring controversy to the crypto industry and allow US regulators to react by launching an aggressive onslaught against the crypto sector.</p>
<p>He believes that the banking industry, in charge of money for hundreds of years, is in league with regulators to cripple the crypto industry so that it can continue its hegemony over printing money.</p>
<p>Yusko expects the banks&rsquo; fight against the crypto industry will carry on for the next few years before the obvious advantages of crypto and blockchain are finally recognised and given government support.&nbsp;</p>
How the incumbent fights the newcomer
<p>An example of an antiquated and embedded system that seeks to suppress and cripple a new and better system is given by Yusko. He points to when cars were invented and how the incumbent transport system of the horse and buggy sought to do just this in the late 19th century.</p>
<p>Reportedly there was collusion between those seeking to protect the horse and buggy system, and the regulators. Ridiculous and onerous rules were imposed on cars that forced them to have someone walking ahead of them holding a red flag. In addition, three persons were required by law to have charge of a vehicle, and additional persons were needed if wagons or carriages were attached.</p>
<p>These harsh and exacting laws were in place for 30 years before being repealed, and technology was finally allowed to progress.&nbsp;</p>
Imposition of CBDCs
<p>According to Yusko, banking is attempting to do the same thing against crypto. He believes that moves are afoot to impose central bank digital currencies on citizens, forcing their use. Yusko said of CBDCs:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you haven&rsquo;t watched Agustin Carstens (Head of the Bank for International Settlements) talk about what a CBDC actually is - and of course the central bank should control how, when, and if you are allowed to spend &lsquo;your&rsquo; money - it&rsquo;s one of the most chilling 1 minute and 47 seconds that you&rsquo;ll ever watch.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>$BNB, the Binance exchange token, is on the brink of a potential heavy collapse. Will this bring Bitcoin and the crypto market down?</p>
$BNB on the brink
<p>Following negative downward price action since November 2021, the $BNB token has reached the point where a slide under the critical $220 level could lead to a calamitous -5x crash down to below $50.</p>
<p>Right now the price is struggling to stay within the bottom limits of a bear flag it first entered in early June of this year. The price has already slid out of the bottom of the bear flag at time of going to press, but this break is still to be confirmed.</p>
<p>A nervousness does still appear to be upon the crypto market over recent weeks as bears and bulls both eye bitcoin and ethereum as they approach their own critical trendlines and support levels.</p>
Bitcoin and Ethereum also at critical levels&nbsp;
<p>If bitcoin hits the support of its bullish trendline this is likely to be as low as $28,000. The 200 daily moving average is just below this at $27,300. In its favour, the bitcoin hash ribbons indicator very recently signalled a buy. Ethereum is already at and holding its bullish trendline at just under $1,800. This is also the level of its 200 day moving average. Both bitcoin and ethereum could see a significant price drop if these levels break.</p>
Altcoins having a good day
<p>The rest of the altcoin market is mostly doing a lot better than either bitcoin or ethereum so far today. Total 3 (all cryptos with the exception of bitcoin and ethereum) is up 1% on the day so far. Strong support at $331 billion is below the current value of just under $337 billion.</p>
<p>$RUNE is still on the charge this morning with a more than 6% gain so far. This is counted in $RUNEs epic 70% rise since the beginning of August, making this crypto one of the biggest movers over the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Kaspa ($KAS) has also featured prominently among the altcoins but more so over the longer term. The innovative proof-of-work layer 1 rose more than 330% since May, but has been correcting over the last couple of weeks. It is up 3.6% on the day so far.</p>
A $BNB wipeout could mean serious issues for crypto&nbsp;
<p>The question now is whether or not $BNB can hold its ground at $220 if it should get down there. Many will be shorting the token given how the SEC is suing both Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao. Should $BNB indeed make the drop, the token, as well as the exchange, could be in serious financial trouble.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Binance accounting for much of the trade in crypto, plus holding large amounts of many other tokens, such a scenario could be calamitous for the exchange, as well as for the crypto market in general.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Road Town, BVI., August 17th, 2023, Chainwire</p>
<p>As the cryptocurrency market has witnessed a decline for over a year, many investors have chosen to liquidate their assets or move to alternative markets. However, 2023 has painted a different picture, positioning cryptocurrency as one of the best-performing investments. According to CoinMarketCap, the total crypto market capitalization rebounded from a low of $780.9 billion to a staggering $1.2198 trillion. Amid this resurgence, LBank, after a few years of dormancy, has announced the reboot of its IEO. Official participation link:&nbsp;https://www.lbank.com/launchpad-list/pins/</p>
<p>With LBank&rsquo;s IEO making a comeback, let&rsquo;s dive deep into its historical performance to gauge its potential.</p>
<p>Historical Gains of LBank IEO &ndash; 8 IEOs with an Average Surge of 1274%</p>
Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of LBank&rsquo;s past eight IEOs and their respective gains:
<p></p>
Key Insights from the Data:
<p>Extreme Performers: VEN stands out remarkably with an opening surge of 100% and a jaw-dropping peak surge of 5300%. DBC, with its 300% opening and 2096% peak, also highlights the potential of high return for investors when the right project is picked.</p>
<p>Steady Climbers: Projects like BLOC, SEER, and INK might not have the most impressive opening surges, but their peak surges underline the importance of holding onto investments and the potential for long-term gains.</p>
<p>Consistent Performers: Both CMT and DDD had modest opening surges but still managed to deliver reasonable peak surges. These indicate that even projects that start with a quieter entry can offer profitable opportunities.</p>
<p>Risky Endeavors: While the data predominantly showcases successes, it&rsquo;s also essential to note projects like INK and DDD. Their minimal to zero opening surges serve as a reminder of the risks inherent in IEO investments.</p>
<p>This data also showcases a strong correlation between the initial surge and peak surge. In simpler terms, projects with an impressive opening usually fare well in the long run. From the data, it&rsquo;s evident that investing in LBank&rsquo;s IEOs can provide returns in the short term. Holding onto these investments for an extended period might amplify the gains further, as exemplified by the metaverse project SAND.</p>
LBank&rsquo;s Current Market Stance:
<p>While LBank carries a notable legacy, it is essential to consider contemporary metrics when assessing its present standing. According to the H1 report from CoinMarketCap, LBank is featured among the top five global exchanges, an indication of its continued relevance and adaptability in the fast-evolving crypto landscape. Holding a 4.6% market share in spot trading volume, it&rsquo;s intriguing to observe their strategic emphasis on MEME coins. This focus, often seen as a blend of calculated risk and innovative market positioning, distinguishes LBank from many of its counterparts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To conclude, based on the available data and recent market performances, one can argue that LBank remains a significant player in the exchange arena. As they reboot their IEO, it might be a space to watch for investors keen on exploring fresh avenues.</p>
About LBank
<p>LBank is one of the top crypto exchanges, established in 2015. It offers specialized financial derivatives, expert asset management services, and safe crypto trading to its users. The platform holds over 9 million users from more than 210 regions across the world.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>According to a notice published by the regulatory authority, Dubai&rsquo;s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority has hit digital asset exchange OPNX and its founders nearly $2.8 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crypto bankruptcy claims exchange and its founders, Su Zhu, Kyle Davies, and Mark Lamb, were formally reprimanded by VARA in May.&nbsp;</p>
A Hefty Fine&nbsp;
<p>According to the notice published by Dubai&rsquo;s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority, a fine of 10,000,000 United Arab Emirates dirhams ($2.7 million) was issued against Open Technology Markets (OPNX) for violating several rules related to advertising, promotions, and marketing. The regulatory body stated in its notice,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Further to Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s (VARA) previous notices dated the 12th of April 2023 and the 27th of April 2023 regarding the conduct of Open Technology Markets Ltd. [trading as OPNX and opnx.com], VARA has issued the following fines. AED 10,000,000 against OPNX for a Market Offence under Regulation VIII.A.3 of the Virtual Assets and Related Activities Regulations 2023 (Regulations). This fine was issued on the 2nd of May 2023 and remains unpaid at the time of publication of this notice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dubai&rsquo;s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority also stated that the fine was issued on the 2nd of May, 2023, and remains unpaid as of the 16th of August, when the notice was published. The regulatory body also issued separate fines of 200,000 United Arab Emirates dirhams ($54,451) on Davies, Mark, and Lamb. This fine was for failing to meet advertising and marketing standards set by the regulator. According to the notice, all three have paid the second fine in full.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;AED 200,000 against each of the following 4 persons: OPNX founders Kyle Davies, Su Zhu, and Mark Lamb and OPNX CEO Leslie Lamb. The fines are for violations of Administrative Order No. 01/22 Relating to Regulation of Marketing, Advertising, and Promotions Related to Virtual Assets [failure to ensure marketing meets the requirements of paragraph II.1 and/or II.5 of the Marketing Regulation]. The fines were issued on the 2nd of May 2023 and have been fully paid by the individuals in question.&rdquo;</p>

Further Action?&nbsp;
<p>The fines issued by the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority are the biggest fines the regulator has issued to date. The regulatory body noted that all fines were referred to its grievance committee and were in accordance with all governance requirements. The committee determined that enforcement actions against OPNX and its founders should be upheld in their entirety.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All fines noted above were referred to Vara&rsquo;s grievance committee in accordance with due governance requirements. The committee reviewed the referral of the grievance and determined that the enforcement actions taken be upheld in their entirety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The regulator also hinted at further action against OPNX in a bid to recover payments and could potentially see the matter being referred to law enforcement agencies or competent courts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vara shall determine consequential actions warranted against Opnx, which may include further fines, penalties, and/or taking any actions necessary to recover payment and definitively remedy the behavior including, but not limited to, referring the matter to any law enforcement agency (ies) or competent courts.&rdquo;</p>

The Controversial OPNX Exchange&nbsp;
<p>OPNX was set up and launched by the founders of the failed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), Kyle Davies and Su Zhu. The platform was created following the downfall of Three Arrows Capital, with Zhu and Davies heavily criticized for starting the project. The platform allows investors to trade bankruptcy claims for platforms such as CoinFLEX and FTX. The exchange conducted less than $2 worth of trades as it stumbled into a launch, with major trading firms claimed to be investors by OPNX denied their involvement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency sector has endured a difficult 2022, with several major projects and entities collapsing, while hacks and other threats have also led to investor interest cooling. The most notable collapse was that of the Sam Bankman-Fried-led FTX, which filed for bankruptcy in November.&nbsp;</p>

The exchange conducted less than $2 worth of trades as it stumbled into a launch, with major trading firms claimed to be investors by OPNX denied their involvement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency sector has endured a difficult 2022, with several major projects and entities collapsing, while hacks and other threats have also led to investor interest cooling. The most notable collapse was that of the Sam Bankman-Fried-led FTX, which filed for bankruptcy in November.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In a major development, the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange (COIN) has received regulatory approval to list crypto futures in the United States.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The approval comes nearly two years after the exchange had originally applied for approval to offer crypto futures in the markets.&nbsp;</p>
A Long Wait Ends&nbsp;
<p>Coinbase announced on Wednesday that it had secured approval from the National Futures Association (NFA) to operate as a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM). FCMs are similar to market makers, buying and selling futures contracts. With approvals in place, Coinbase has stated its intention to offer eligible US-based customers regulated derivatives products through Coinbase Financial Markets. These will be subject to the oversight of the National Futures Association and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The crypto exchange stated in a post on X,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The National Futures Association, a CFTC designated SRO, has approved Coinbase Financial Markets. as a registered Futures Commission Merchant. Coinbase can now offer futures contracts in BTC and ETH to eligible customers in the US.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The approval makes Coinbase the first crypto platform in the United States to offer traders regulated and leveraged crypto futures along with traditional spot trading. According to the announcement, Coinbase had applied for registration as a Futures Commission Merchant with the NFA in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In September of 2021, we filed an application with the NFA to register an FCM. Our team has worked with regulators since then to ensure we will comply with all the necessary regulations and that our FCM&rsquo;s business model meets the CFTC&rsquo;s customer protection requirements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Coinbase, the approval will allow US customers to access regulated crypto derivatives and allow greater access to the larger crypto economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to announce that approval has been secured, which will allow eligible US customers to access regulated derivatives products through Coinbase Financial Markets and alongside our spot market for a seamless experience subject to the oversight of the CFTC and the NFA. Approval for US customers to access regulated crypto derivatives will allow more people to access the crypto economy in the United States in a safe way that helps keep the US at the center of digital innovation.&rdquo;</p>

Futures Contracts In Bitcoin And Ether&nbsp;
<p>The company also put up a post on X, stating that it could now offer users cryptocurrency futures contracts in Bitcoin And ETH. Coinbase stated in a message,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We believe this is a watershed moment to be able to bring regulated crypto products to US customers. This is a critical milestone that reaffirms our commitment to operate a regulated and compliant business and be the most trusted and secure crypto-native platform for our customers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Other Approvals&nbsp;
<p>The cryptocurrency unit of Cboe Global Markets, Cboe Digital, had already received approval from the CFTC to offer margined Bitcoin and Ether futures back in June. At the time, Christy Goldsmith Romero, the Commissioner of the CFTC, had stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been vocal about the benefits of bringing appropriate crypto activities into the regulated space in order to protect customers, but in a way that supports oversight, accountability, transparency, and risk management.&rdquo;</p>

<p>COIN shares have also registered a significant jump, opening 4% higher at $82.49. Currently, COIN is trading at around $79.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain security firm PeckShield has reported that around $1.7 million worth of ETH is stuck in the Shibarium Bridge after its launch failed to create a meme coin rally, as was widely expected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The much-hyped and highly anticipated Shibarium Network went live late on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
ETH Stuck In Limbo
<p>Blockchain security firm PeckShield broke the news in a post on social media platform X. The firm stated that around $1.7 million worth of ETH was stuck in the Shibarium Bridge. The news comes shortly after Shibarium, a chain that was designed to facilitate the optimum utilization of dog-themed tokens such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), TREAT, and the much-hyped Doge killer LEASH.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many expected the launch of Shibarium to push the price of these meme coins into orbit. However, things did not go as planned and went sideways quite quickly, with the value of the tokens plummeting. Tokens such as TREAT were down 10%, while the BONE and LEASH tokens were down 17% and 25%, respectively, over the past 24 hours. While the developments have, no doubt, left many new users disappointed. However, recovery is possible as network users adapt and reconcile with the changes.&nbsp;</p>
SHIB Plunges By Over 9%&nbsp;
<p>The Shiba Inu (SHIB) token dropped nearly 10% as users began reporting widespread bridging issues after the Shibarium network went live on Wednesday. Available data showed that transactions on the network had been stalled for hours, with users transferring around 954 ETH worth $1.7 million and $750,000 worth of BONE tokens to the contract. Additionally, users were also blocked from sending messages on community forums on Discord after reports of the issue began to surface.&nbsp;</p>
The Shibarium Mainnet&nbsp;
<p>The Shibarium mainnet is an Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution launched by Shiba Inu on the 16th of August. The launch was initiated after months of testing and participation from millions of users. In the end, around 21 million wallets were created. Shibarium uses a new consensus mechanism called the Proof-of-Participation, which selects validators based on the proportion of the quantity of their holdings in the associated crypto asset. This helps avoid the computational costs typically associated with Proof-of-Work consensus mechanisms. The new Layer-2 solution will interact with the Ethereum blockchain and provide a more scalable and cost-effective transaction platform.&nbsp;</p>
Significant Traction&nbsp;
<p>Prior to launch, Shiba Inu&rsquo;s lead developer, who uses the pseudonym Shytoshi Kusama, stated that the new Layer-2 solution has already gained significant traction from new projects interested in building on it. According to a post by the developer on X, over 100 companies are already using the Layer-2 network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kusama has also noted that people in the tech and blockchain industry are discussing an &ldquo;everyday app.&rdquo; However, they added that such innovations must be conducted from a community and decentralized perspective. They further added that Shibarium incorporates both of these principles without compromising on decentralization, interoperability, and user-centric design. Kusama elaborated that while the validator and delegator aspects of the new Layer-2 solution will keep it decentralized, its true innovation lies in the governance, framework, and charter that help govern the nascent ecosystem&rsquo;s technology, community, and innovative aspects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By using Shibarium for governance in this system, alongside self-sovereign identity to ensure quality membership (Shibizenship), the metaverse as our territory, and the ability to partner with other like-minded states, we have effectively shattered what nationhood is and rebuilt it upon the Shib ethos of decentralization!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shibarium will utilize the Heimdall validator and Bor block production nodes, similar to that of the Polygon ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance has officially announced the launch of its opBNB Mainnet, a notable addition to the burgeoning decentralized scaling solutions sector. Touted to bolster transaction speed, security, and scalability, the move is closely watched by industry insiders and users alike.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Harnessing the Optimism OP Stack Bedrock, an optimistic rollup framework, opBNB underwent a comprehensive Testnet phase over a span of 1.5 months. During this time, the network recorded more than 7 million on-chain transactions, connecting to over 435,000 unique wallet addresses. This trial run demonstrated block processing capabilities with times hovering around one second.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, opBNB's Testnet revealed its capacity to support an array of tokens, encompassing not only Binance's proprietary BNB but also widely recognized stablecoins like BUSD, USDT, and DAI.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance has officially announced the launch of its opBNB Mainnet, a notable addition to the burgeoning decentralized scaling solutions sector. Touted to bolster transaction speed, security, and scalability, the move is closely watched by industry insiders and users alike.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Harnessing the Optimism OP Stack Bedrock, an optimistic rollup framework, opBNB underwent a comprehensive Testnet phase over a span of 1.5 months. During this time, the network recorded more than 7 million on-chain transactions, connecting to over 435,000 unique wallet addresses. This trial run demonstrated block processing capabilities with times hovering around one second.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, opBNB's Testnet revealed its capacity to support an array of tokens, encompassing not only Binance's proprietary BNB but also widely recognized stablecoins like BUSD, USDT, and DAI. A distinguishing feature emerged in the form of minimized transaction costs, with the Layer 2 gas price set at a minimal 0.2 gwei, leading to significantly reduced expenses for users.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, provided an analytical dive into X's Community Notes tool via a post on his personal website. Notably, Buterin lauded the tool, formerly known as Twitter's Birdwatch, for aligning closely with the ethos of "crypto values" in mainstream contexts.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Launched as Birdwatch in the U.S. in October 2022, Community Notes was conceptualized as a feature that would empower users to classify tweets based on their helpfulness and context. This was introduced prior to Elon Musk's acquisition of the platform.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Buterin's assessment illuminated that the tool's core strength lies in its open-source algorithm, ensuring decisions about which notes are displayed are transparent and unbiased. He opined that the system is &ldquo;the closest thing to an instantiation of &lsquo;crypto values&rsquo; that we have seen in the mainstream world.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While emphasizing its merits, Buterin also touched upon certain imperfections of the algorithm, noting, "It&rsquo;s not perfect, but it&rsquo;s surprisingly close to satisfying the ideal of credible neutrality." Additionally, he highlighted the tool's capability in providing context to potentially misleading images used in news previews and addressing misinformation related to COVID-19.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Going deeper into the mechanics, Buterin elaborated on how the algorithm avoids simplistically averaging out people's votes to gauge a comment's utility. He further noted its efficiency in detecting stark political differences in content, reinforcing its neutrality.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Musk's Approach and Buterin's Observations</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Elon Musk's role in steering X's strategy since acquiring Twitter has been under scrutiny. Vitalik Buterin, while appreciating the algorithm's robustness, speculated that Musk might have directed the removal of certain Community Notes that could be perceived as contrary to his business alignments, specifically those critiques of the Chinese government. Despite this conjecture and comments on "highly contentious actions" post-Musk's takeover, Musk acknowledged Buterin's wrrite-up as a "great analysis".</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This commendation occurs amidst a backdrop of various discussions surrounding Musk's approach to free speech, exemplified by his self-proclaimed stance as a "free speech absolutist." There have been allegations, as per a Washington Post report, suggesting Musk&rsquo;s potential involvement in introducing a five-second delay for links to specific news outlets, including The New York Times.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a somewhat tangential twist, Buterin's analysis was published at a time when Musk was reportedly involved in a digital altercation with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, with discussions hinting at a potential mixed martial arts face-off between the two tech magnates.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Ethereum layer-2 solution Arbitrum is set to &ldquo;cliff unlock&rdquo; over 1 billion worth of $ARB on March 16, 2024 and finally start ARB&rsquo;s staggered unfreezing over the next four years. The first unlock is set almost a year after the $ARB token finally launched last March 2023.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to Token Unlocks, after the initial March 16 unlock, more $ARB tokens will be unlocked every four weeks for the next four years.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">At present, over 5 billion ARB tokens remain locked. Staggered unfreezing is a way to ensure that investors do not immediately sell the token in large quantities (thus drastically lowering the price so as to be completely worthless) and also to ensure that its stakeholders stay involved for a longer period.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The initially turbulent launch of the ARB token last March was somewhat remedied by its $120 million airdrop to DAOs. But ARB is currently on the decline partly because of security issues plaguing the still relatively-new platform. Just last July, Rodeo Finance suffered a significant $1.5 million blow when a code vulnerability was exploited. Last June, Chibi Finance executed a rug pull that stole approximately $1 million worth of tokens from users. The disturbing fact is that these were not the only incidents of some form of exploit in the Arbitrum platform. They highlight the pressing need for security measures in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Still, according to DefiLlama, Arbitrum is the fourth biggest protocol as of writing, with $1.88 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL). ARB on the other hand is currently trading at $1.09 according to Coingecko, down from $1.3 last July. Investors and traders should remain vigilant for developments in the protocol as the unlock date nears.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) encountered additional bearish momentum early in the Asian session as the pair continued to establish lower highs, increasing the risk that bears will test the 28306.11 area.&nbsp; Selling pressure recently intensified around the 30222 area, right around the 23.6% retracement of the appreciating range from 24750 to 31862.21.&nbsp; Additional downside pressure ramped up near the 29709 area, representing a test of the 38.2% retracement of the appreciating range from 26165.98 to 31862.21.&nbsp; Large Stops are cited below the 27991.29 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 15460 to 31862.21.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional areas of technical support and potential buying pressure in these appreciating ranges include the 27466, 27166, 26428, 26272, and 25715 areas.</p>
