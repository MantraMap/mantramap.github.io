										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="1200" height="700" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Bitcoin-Price-Dip-Buyers-Assert-Presence-By-Stashing-Billions-On-Exchanges.jpg" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Bitcoin Price Dip Buyers Assert Presence By Stashing Billions On Exchanges" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Bitcoin-Price-Dip-Buyers-Assert-Presence-By-Stashing-Billions-On-Exchanges.jpg 1200w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Bitcoin-Price-Dip-Buyers-Assert-Presence-By-Stashing-Billions-On-Exchanges-300x175.jpg 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Bitcoin-Price-Dip-Buyers-Assert-Presence-By-Stashing-Billions-On-Exchanges-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Bitcoin-Price-Dip-Buyers-Assert-Presence-By-Stashing-Billions-On-Exchanges-768x448.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div>
<p>According to blockchain data, centralized exchange volumes have fallen to an all-time low, with DEXs rising in popularity in the cryptocurrency market. The numbers show trading activity on centralized exchanges is declining and has reached its lowest point since October 2020.</p>



<p>The general sluggish market circumstances, the exit of well-known companies like Jane Street and Jump owing to regulatory worries, and the rise of decentralized exchanges with meme coin trading are some of the causes of this decline.</p>



<p>Decentralized exchanges are taking advantage of the rising need for better privacy and quicker asset listing. As centralized exchanges see a decrease, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have seen substantial growth.</p>



<p>By enabling direct peer-to-peer trading, these blockchain-based platforms provide improved security, anonymity, and control over funds. According to recent statistics from Dune, an on-chain analytics company, May has seen a noticeable surge in user activity on various decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms in May 2023. This increase in user numbers highlights the growing acceptance and popularity of DEXs in the crypto industry and is similar to the peak levels seen during the bullish market era in 2021.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, major cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has been having problems with its crypto gateway and delays in the deposit and withdrawal processes. Frustrated users have reported having trouble accessing their money. Delays and gateway issues are viewed as potential roadblocks for investors and traders using the Kraken platform, raising questions about its dependability and effectiveness.</p>



<p>Further on the legal front, a global emergency order to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-us-says-customer-funds-are-safe-as-sec-requests-restraining-order-to-freeze-assets/">freeze Binance.US assets</a> has been requested by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC&#8217;s action is part of a case now being litigated against the crypto exchange.</p>



<p>The development underscores the possible impact on Binance.US&#8217;s activities and assets and the increased regulatory scrutiny it is currently subject to. The development shows the importance of this regulatory action and the SEC&#8217;s efforts to impose control over Binance.US and its operations outside of the United States.</p>



<p>The agency claimed that the emergency restraining order was required to &#8220;prevent the dissipation of available assets for any judgment, given the Defendants&#8217; years of violative conduct, disregard of the laws of the United States.&#8221;</p>



<p>Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, is also required under the ruling to &#8220;show cause why a preliminary injunction&#8221; against him and two holding companies &#8220;should not be entered.&#8221;</p>



<p>The action follows the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against Binance</a> and Zhao earlier this week, claiming that CZ and the exchange conspired to inappropriately combine money, deceive investors, and act as an unregistered broker, dealer, and clearing house.</p>

<p>Bitcoin shook off the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) latest enforcement actions to climb back up to as high as $27,300.13 today, according to CoinGecko. BTC recovering lost ground prompted Arthur Hayes, the founder and former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, to make a bullish prediction for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-btc-bulls-unfazed-by-new-sec-lawsuits"><strong>BTC Bulls Unfazed By New SEC Lawsuits</strong></h2>



<p>Cryptocurrency prices largely ticked higher over the past 24 hours despite the uptick in regulatory scrutiny that the digital assets industry has confronted recently.</p>



<p>Bitcoin plummeted $25,400 on Monday in the hours after the SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">unveiled </a>a complaint against Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume. But the crypto began inching higher by the end of the day and continued its path on Tuesday even as the securities regulator initiated a second lawsuit against Binance competitor Coinbase. In so doing, BTC regained all of its lost ground, as it returned to just below $27,000, where it is trading at press time, up 4.53 percent on the day. The second most valuable crypto, ether, also rallied Wednesday to trade hands near $1,900, a 2.94 percent gain over the last 24 hours.</p>



<p>Analyzing the bounce, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes/status/1666232026054418432">stated </a>that the &#8220;wall of worry is being climbed,&#8221; encouraging his followers to join him on the &#8220;bull market bus&#8221; for Bitcoin.</p>



<p>“We are still on struggle street, but the moon ain’t far away,” Hayes tweeted.</p>



<p>Hayes’ prediction is a sign of strong conviction in a market that has been hit hard in recent days.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SEC’s Harsh Steps Against Crypto</strong></h2>



<p>Crypto prices have been extremely volatile this week in the wake of news that the SEC had charged Binance and Coinbase with selling unlicensed securities in the country. Binance and the company’s chief executive officer, Changpeng Zhao, were struck with 13 civil charges by the SEC on Monday. The commission claims Binance was involved in an “extensive web of deception” by commingling customer funds. Coinbase, on the other hand, was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">accused </a>of failing to register with the SEC as an exchange, clearing house, and broker.</p>



<p>The charges came despite the SEC&#8217;s lack of regulatory clarity on which crypto tokens qualify as securities. The SEC has not provided any formal legal definitions to token issuers and is yet to give its response to a petition from Coinbase seeking clearer rules on crypto.</p>



<p>That said, Binance and Coinbase have <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-responds-to-secs-complaint-pledges-vigorous-defense-amid-overwhelming-industry-support/">vowed</a> to “vigorously defend” the suits against them.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has ordered the SEC to clarify its position on Coinbase’s rulemaking petition within one week.</p>

<ul>
<li>Digital asset lawyer John Deaton sees only a slight window of opportunity for the SEC to emerge victorious over Ripple.</li>



<li>The lawyer predicted an end to the case in September, with a likely split in the middle between Ripple and the SEC.</li>



<li>Fox Business reporter tweeted on Ripple hosting a roadshow meeting with investors to gather ideas on the possibility of a public offering.</li>
</ul>



<p>Positive signs have come out of Ripple and XRP spaces in the past week as its case with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) nears its end. Who comes out victorious will set a landmark precedent in cryptocurrency regulation in the future, experts say.</p>



<p>A web3 lawyer, John Deaton says there is only a 3% chance that the SEC will win its case against Ripple. While he conceded that the Commission might get some concessions, an outright win from the present realities will be impossible. </p>



<p>Deaton has been vocal in the defence of Ripple since the SEC filed its case against them and two executives, Brad Garlnghouse and Chris Larsen. The founder of CryptoLaw, while speaking on The Good Morning Crypto Podcast, stated that there is a 25% chance of an outright win by Ripple.</p>



<p>He explained his position by noting that Judge Torres will likely “<em>split the baby”, </em>with Ripple claiming most of the victory. Deaton illustrated his position by claiming that Judge Torres could rule that XRP offered before 2018 was a security. This is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/web3-lawyer-backs-ripple-amid-discovery-of-conversation-between-sec-staff-prior-to-the-hinman-speech/">hinged</a> on the Hinman documents, a speech made by a former SEC director in 2018, therefore, digital assets can become commodities if they are fully decentralized.</p>



<p>“<em>I think that XRP itself is going to be deemed not a security and that I think that secondary market sales show comment. Even if [Judge Torres] does rule finding that Ripple violated the law, that doesn&#8217;t apply to secondary market sales,” </em>Deaton noted.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-at-last-the-end-is-finally-within-sight"><strong>At last!! The end is finally within sight</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse, alongside other stakeholders, have predicted an end to the case in the coming months. According to Deaton, the case would be concluded before Sept 30 because of the “<em>six-month list” </em>judges have to file. The list which is published in March and September, highlights all summary judgments pending more than six months.</p>



<p>“<em>She has never been on this list. It’s like a public shame list that says, ‘Look I’m shitty at my job,” </em>he added.</p>



<p>Deaton also predicted the price of XRP post the case stating that the price could soar between $2 and $10. Deaton’s views have been justified by a renewed surge of XRP following a tweet from Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terret on Ripple hosting a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-contemplates-ipo-as-sec-lawsuit-finally-nears-end-will-it-propel-xrp-to-10/">roadshow</a> with investors on the possibilities of going public soon.</p>



<p>At press time, XRP exchanges hands at $0.52, surging over 11% in the past ten days.</p>

<p>Block co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey — also co-founder and former CEO of Twitter — has caused outrage in the Ethereum community after claiming that the network’s native token, ether (ETH), is a security.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ether-a-security"><strong>Ether A Security?</strong></h2>



<p>Noted Bitcoin enthusiast and investor Jack Dorsey got into an online scuffle with multiple industry experts and prominent figures on Tuesday after designating ether as a security.</p>



<p>Amid the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">lawsuit </a>against Coinbase, Pierre Rochard, vice president of research at Riot Platforms, suggested that the San Francisco-based exchange should refocus its attention on Bitcoin. Rochard was referencing a 2015 post by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, where he referred to altcoins as a “distraction” and implied that the company should instead “be focused” on Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Jack Dorsey voiced support for prioritizing the OG cryptocurrency amid regulatory pressures. The Twitter founder added that there are only three truly censorship-resistant technologies at scale today: tor, bitcoin, and nostr. While these technologies are presently not accessible to most people or even easy to use, Dorsey is convinced that they will be someday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you are well aware, Dorsey is a long-time Bitcoin supporter, who has expressed his strong belief in its potential to become a global currency. Back in 2014, Dorsey predicted that Bitcoin could become the &#8220;native currency of the internet.&#8221; He has continued to endorse the flagship cryptocurrency and its underlying blockchain technology through his different ventures, including Block’s Cash App, a mobile payment service that lets users buy and sell BTC.</p>



<p>Asked by one Twitter user whether ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market cap, is a security, Dorsey simply <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1666078896327122946">replied</a>: “Yes.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crypto Twitter Reacts</strong></h2>



<p>Dorsey’s remark prompted brutal backlash from crypto pundits, including ordinals proponent and independent developer at Taproot Wizards Udi Wertheimer, who indicated Dorsey was a “clown” in a Tuesday tweet.</p>



<p>Dorsey replied saying, “ETH is not a security? Teach me wizard,” to which Wertheimer <a href="https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1666197838852677638">shared a viral 2018 video</a> where SEC chair Gary Gensler acknowledged that ether was not a security as it had attained sufficient decentralization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Twitter war comes in light of the SEC launching high-profile lawsuits against <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">Coinbase </a>and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">Binance </a>for allegedly offering a slew of tokens like Cardano, Solana, Polygon, Dash, Filecoin, and others, which the agency <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-community-mount-offensive-against-the-u-s-sec-for-naming-ada-a-security/">considers </a>to be unregistered securities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the Digital Asset director at VanEcK, Gabor Gurbacs, appeared to agree with Dorsey on Ether’s security designation. Gurbacs <a href="https://twitter.com/gaborgurbacs/status/1666218913699356673">argued </a>that Ethereum’s switch last year from a proof-of-work system to a proof-of-stake system for operating its network brought it closer in alignment with the SEC’s definition of a security.</p>



<p>An ether-as-a-security world would have serious consequences for the broader crypto industry. It is not, however, a foregone conclusion that the SEC will soon categorize ETH as a security.</p>

<p>A day after slapping Binance with a lawsuit, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now taking swift action to freeze assets tied to the American arm of the global exchange “on an expedited basis”.</p>



<p>However, Binance.US has clarified that it remains “fully operational” and that all customer funds are safe.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sec-file-motion-to-freeze-crypto-held-by-binance-us"><strong>SEC File Motion To Freeze Crypto Held By Binance.US</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC has requested a judge to freeze Binance.US assets in a temporary restraining order filed on Tuesday.</p>



<p>The freeze would impact two holding and operating firms associated with Binance.US operations: BAM Management US Holdings and BAM Trading Services. According to the SEC, Binance portrayed these two firms as independent, but they were secretly controlled by the parent company and its CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao.</p>



<p>The SEC seeks to freeze assets due to allegations claiming Zhao and other executives redirected customer funds to personal investment funds, which were used to purchase BUSD and an $11 million yacht for the Binance boss.</p>



<p>The court filing made in the D.C. District Court seeks the repatriation of assets — both fiat and crypto — belonging to Binance.US customers, a process that would entail the moving of assets back to the United States within 10 days.</p>



<p>The SEC believes the temporary restraining order is necessary “on an expedited basis to ensure the safety of customer assets and prevent the dissipation of available assets for any judgment, given the Defendants’ years of violative conduct, disregard of the laws of the United States, evasion of regulatory oversight, and open questions about various financial transfers and the custody and control of Customer Assets — including by Defendants who claim they are not subject to the Court’s jurisdiction — as described in the Complaint, Memorandum of Law, and supporting materials.”</p>



<p>If SEC’s request is granted, the two holding firms and CZ would be required to “show cause” as to why a preliminary injunction should not be allowed, as per the court filing. It would also forbid defendants named in the SEC’s complaint from destroying, changing, or hiding any records that are relevant.</p>



<p>Moreover, the motion seeks expedited discovery in the suit and alternative means of service. This means the SEC would not need to serve papers in person like is typically required.</p>



<p>The emergency order follows the SEC’s legal action against Binance and Zhao <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">lodged </a>on Monday. The regulator hit the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume with 13 charges, accusing it of buying, selling, and trading unregistered securities, commingling customers’ funds, among other claims.</p>



<p>Earlier Tuesday, the SEC filed a similar lawsuit against rival crypto exchange Coinbase, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">alleging </a>that it had failed to respect U.S. federal securities laws. The actions against two of the industry’s most preeminent firms appear to be part of a government crackdown on the fast-growing crypto sector.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance.US Hits Back At SEC Emergency Order</strong></h2>



<p>Binance.US has called the SEC’s asset-freeze motion “unwarranted”. The exchange <a href="https://twitter.com/BinanceUS/status/1666203325543374856">argued </a>on Twitter that it was filed as part of a plot to gain an advantage in litigation and not genuine concern about the safety of users’ funds.</p>



<p>“While we are disappointed by this action, we look forward to defending ourselves in court,&#8221; the company posited.</p>



<p>Binance.US also noted that “user assets remain safe and secure&#8221; and added the platform “continues to be fully operational with deposits and withdrawals functioning as normal.”</p>

<ul>
<li>The digital asset market plummeted 3.6% in the last 24 hours in reaction to the SEC&#8217;s legal action against Binance.</li>



<li>The Commission is alleging a lack of care on the part of Binance by operating an unregistered exchange, commingling, and putting user assets at risk.</li>



<li>Binance has denied all allegations so far adding that they will “<em>vigorously defend”</em> the integrity of its platform.</li>
</ul>



<p>Binance comes under the regulatory scrutiny of the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) once more, with the Commission <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">filing a lawsuit</a> that has sent the market tumbling.</p>



<p>Following the lawsuit filed by the SEC against Binance on June 5, the cryptocurrency market has felt the heat across asset prices, investor sentiments, and other ripple effects of the Commission’s hammer. Both top assets and meme coins have been trading at lows wiping billions off the market cap.</p>



<p>Market leader Bitcoin (BTC) lost 4.2% in the aftermath of the lawsuit, trading below $26,000 for the first time since March. BTC trades at $27,068 at press time, with bearish traders betting on a $24k BTC price. Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, declined by 3.1% in the same period and trades at $1,884.</p>



<p>Other altcoins recorded a much more significant drop culminating in a 3.6% market cap slip in 24 hours per CoinGecko. Elon Musk-backed Dogecoin DOGE plunged 7%, wiping away little gains picked up last week. Leading the pack was PEPE as it continued its free fall, losing 14.9%.</p>



<p>Other assets hit by the development include The Sandbox (SAND), Terra Luna Classic (LUNC), Axie Infinity (AXS), etc. The crypto fear and greed index also points to significant downward market sentiment not recorded since USD Circle lost its dollar&nbsp; peg in March. The radar is in the “fear zone” at 44 down from last week’s “neutral 51.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-binance-to-vigorously-defend"><strong>Binance to “<em>vigorously defend</em>”</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC filed a total of 13 charges against Binance, ranging from illegally operating an exchange, commingling user assets, and conducting the sale of unregistered securities. In a press release issued on Monday, the Commission added that- </p>



<p>“<em>We allege that Zhao and the Binance entities not only knew the rules of the road, but they also consciously chose to evade them and put their customers and investors at risk all in an effort to maximize their own profits.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, Binance has distanced itself from all allegations <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-responds-to-secs-complaint-pledges-vigorous-defense-amid-overwhelming-industry-support/">noting</a> that the exchange has been compliant with regulations and will defend its reputation “vigorously.”</p>



<p>“<em>Any allegations that user assets on the Binance.US platform have ever been at risk are simply wrong. We will vigorously defend against any allegations to the contrary.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The digital asset community has expressed dissatisfaction with the conduct of the SEC and other regulatory bodies recently. In recent months, Binance has been under intense regulatory pressure from the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. </p>

<p>Cardano (ADA) and the broader cryptocurrency market faced a significant setback as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) targeted Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, with a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-responds-to-secs-complaint-pledges-vigorous-defense-amid-overwhelming-industry-support/">lawsuit</a>. The regulatory action contributed to a market-wide price decline, impacting several crypto assets, including Cardano, which dropped over 5% hours after the announcement.</p>



<p>The SEC filed a complaint in the District of Columbia, alleging that Binance has been offering &#8220;unregistered securities&#8221; since its inception. In the complaint, the SEC specifically mentioned several cryptocurrencies that are claimed to fall into this category, including Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), Algorand (ALGO), Filecoin (FIL), and others.</p>

<p>In its filing, the SEC provided an overview of Cardano&#8217;s background, expressing concerns about its level of decentralization. In support of its argument, the SEC contended that the Cardano Foundation handles legal custody and brand ownership; IOHK, an engineering firm led by Charles Hoskinson and responsible for blockchain design and maintenance; and Emurgo possessed a substantial portion of ADA&#8217;s overall supply.</p>



<p>“<em>These three entities collectively received 5.2 billion ADA following the initial mining of ADA or approximately 16.7% of the initial token supply of 31.1 billion ADA,” </em>read the complaint.</p>



<p>The regulator asserted that these companies sold the token to finance different aspects of their projects, such as development, marketing, and business operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to the SEC&#8217;s classification, members of the Cardano community took to Twitter to voice their support and counter the allegations. Dr Shweta, a proponent of Ripple, <a href="https://twitter.com/Dr_shwetaPHD/status/1665758173624401923">emphasized</a> that ADA cannot be considered a security citing the Howey Test, which states that cryptocurrencies meeting certain criteria can be classified as securities.</p>



<p>According to his analysis, Cardano does not meet those criteria, as it was not offered to U.S. investors during its initial coin offering (ICO). He thus argued that it is not a security token, stablecoin, or decentralized finance (DeFi) token.</p>



<p>Another Cardano adherent, Chris O, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheOCcryptobro/status/1665821007368830977">criticized</a> the SEC&#8217;s argument, stating that the complaint overlooked crucial facts. Chris O pointed out that the ADA ICO occurred in Japan and was not accessible to U.S. investors. Moreover, he highlighted the omission of the thousands of stake pool operators who actively participate in running the Cardano protocol. The pundit also expressed confidence in Cardano&#8217;s decentralization, emphasizing that it would be the ultimate shield against such claims.</p>



<p>That said, as the legal battle between the SEC and Binance unfolds, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-scams-will-only-get-worse-with-ai-cardanos-charles-hoskinson-warns/">Cardano</a> proponents remain determined to defend their platform&#8217;s reputation and decentralized nature. It thus remains to be seen how this offensive against the SEC&#8217;s classification will shape the future of Cardano and its standing within the crypto market.</p>



<p>At press time on Tuesday, ADA was trading at $0.356, up 1.3% in the past 24 hours. Other cryptos had also recovered from what most players call FUD by the SEC, with Bitcoin and Ethereum up over 3% over the same duration.</p>

<p>Despite a sluggish beginning to the month, Ethereum is poised to gain bullish momentum, with key fundamental indicators signalling a potentially <a href="https://zycrypto.com/this-pundit-believes-ethereums-price-could-tap-450000-in-the-next-2-decades-heres-why/">positive trajectory</a> ahead.</p>



<p>On Monday, June 5th, onchain analytics firm Santiment shared an interesting observation regarding Ethereum&#8217;s distribution of wealth. In a tweet, the firm reported that a significant amount of Ethereum has been moving into self-custody and decentralized finance (DeFi) options, consolidating these coins within the largest whale addresses on the Ethereum network.</p>



<p><em>“As more and more Ethereum has been moving into self custody &amp; DeFi options, many of these coins have been absorbed by the largest whale addresses on the network. The 10 largest non-exchange addresses now hold an AllTimeHigh 31.8M $ETH worth $59.47B,” </em>wrote Santiment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="643" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-12-1024x643.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81844" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-12-1024x643.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-12-300x188.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-12-768x482.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-12.png 1430w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Notably, the accumulation of these 2.1M coins valued at just over $3.8 billion has continued unabated since 2019, with the holdings of the top 10 non-exchange addresses now surpassing the previous record set in August 2015.</p>



<p>Apart from the allure of discounted prices and the Merge in 2022, these whales&#8217; increased interest in Ethereum can be attributed to the recent Shanghai upgrade. This upgrade has sparked a surge in enthusiasm for Ethereum, leading these whales to capitalize on its potential opportunities.</p>



<p>Today, Cross-chain transaction platform iCrosschain noted that the upgrade has significantly impacted the Ethereum network by enhancing transaction throughput and reducing costs. This has, in turn, enhanced Ethereum&#8217;s potential to reshape the crypto world by opening doors to new possibilities and applications.</p>



<p><em>“With the Shanghai upgrade, more than 3 million ETH has been unstaked on the Ethereum network. Once Ethereum&#8217;s Shanghai upgrade permitted withdrawals from staking contracts, Celsius is reshuffling its staked ETH holdings. The amount of ETH on exchanges has decreased significantly in recent times,”</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/iCrosschain/status/1665700758166335488">added</a> the firm.</p>



<p>These developments and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereums-fate-hangs-in-balance-as-exchange-deposits-spike-to-an-8-month-high/">decreased ETH holdings on exchanges</a> indicate an evolving landscape for Ethereum and its potential to revolutionize the crypto world.</p>



<p>That said, just like Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has been facing price volatility in recent weeks, with the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization now facing another rocky start to the week. Despite remaining fairly stable for most of the day Monday, June 5, Ether plunged by about 5.6% after the US market opened to tap $1,785 after the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">SEC sued Binance</a> for allegedly offering several unregistered securities. </p>



<p>This marks the third consecutive day of decline for the cryptocurrency, with investors now hoping the price can recapture the $1,850 resistance level to avert a further slide southwards. At press time, Ether was trading at $1,884, down 2.50% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today sued Coinbase just a day after <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">cracking down on Binance</a>.</p>



<p>The regulatory body alleges in the new lawsuit that Coinbase failed to register as a broker, national securities exchange, or clearing agency despite providing these services to customers. The SEC also alleges that a number of tokens offered by the crypto exchange qualify as securities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sec-sues-coinbase-for-alleged-securities-violations"><strong>SEC </strong><strong>Sues Coinbase For Alleged Securities Violations</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC has dropped the hammer on Coinbase, a day after the regulator took similar action against Binance, the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange by market capitalization.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908.1.0.pdf">official case file</a>, Coinbase had operated as an unregistered security broker since 2019, nearly two years before the company became the first publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange in April 2021.</p>



<p>The SEC also alleges that the cryptocurrency exchange &#8220;made available for trading, crypto assets that are being offered and sold as investment contracts, and thus as securities.&#8221;</p>



<p>Tokens powering Solana, Cardano, Polygon, The Sandbox, Filecoin, Axie Infinity, Chiliz, Flow, Internet Computer, Near Protocol, Voyager Dash, and Nexo have all been identified as securities by the SEC.</p>



<p>Back in March, the securities watchdog <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-action-against-coinbase-triggers-ballistic-reaction-from-crypto-community/">served </a>Coinbase with a Wells Notice to hint that it would soon bring an enforcement action against the company. Coinbase responded to the Wells Notice in April.</p>



<p><em>“Coinbase has elevated its interest in increasing its profits over investors’ interests, and over compliance with the law and the regulatory framework that governs the securities markets and was created to protect investors and the U.S. capital markets,&#8221; the filing today reads.</em></p>



<p>The SEC also pointed to Coinbase’s staking service, alleging that it includes five stackable crypto assets, making the program an investment contract and, therefore, an area where the exchange violated securities laws.</p>



<p>Commenting on the charges against Coinbase, SEC chair Gary Gensler <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1666059466750541825">noted </a>that the crypto trading platform denied its clients&#8217; essential protections that prevent fraud and manipulation and evaded proper disclosure and safeguards against conflicts of interest.</p>



<p>The SEC wants the defendants — Coinbase, Inc. and Coinbase Global, Inc. — to be &#8220;permanently restrained and enjoined&#8221; and no longer able to do business within the U.S. Notably, unlike the Binance lawsuit, the SEC has not named founder and CEO Brian Armstrong or any other executive.</p>



<p>Still, this is not Coinbase&#8217;s first time locking horns with the American regulator. Last year the exchange, helmed by Brian Armstrong, petitioned the SEC to come up with new rules tailored to digital assets. In April, already under a publicly-acknowledged probe by the agency, Coinbase took a gamble and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-goes-offensive-against-the-sec-with-lawsuit-targeted-at-regulatory-clarity/">sued </a>the SEC, hoping to force the agency to respond to its petition.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coinbase Targeted By State Regulators</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase is also facing scrutiny from a task force of ten U.S. state securities regulators after getting sued by the SEC on the same day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>State regulators from Alabama, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, South Caroline, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin have <a href="https://asc.alabama.gov/News/2023%20News/6-6-2023_Coinbase.pdf">issued </a>a “show cause order” against Coinbase and its parent corporation Coinbase Global alleging that they broke the law by offering the staking rewards program &#8220;Earn&#8221; to state residents.</p>



<p>Coinbase has 28 days to explain why it should not be directed to cease and desist from selling unregistered securities in Alabama.</p>

<p>The crypto industry’s latest blow rocked digital assets’ prices on Monday.</p>



<p>The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Bitcoin, recently traded hands at around $25,496, down 4.54% over the past 24 hours. The downturn started after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">filed a lawsuit</a> against crypto behemoth Binance, the operating company for Binance.US, and Binance founder and CEO Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao on allegations of breaking federal securities rules.</p>



<p>Despite the carnage, recent analysis shows that some major crypto players are buying the dip.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-whales-accumulate"><strong>Whales Accumulate</strong></h2>



<p>Bitcoin may have taken a serious hit yesterday, but not every class of crypto investor is dashing to the exit.</p>



<p>The total crypto market capitalization plunged over 3.5% overnight as the SEC sued Binance. Bitcoin had been treading comfortably above the $27,000 level for the better part of last week, but the charges against the leading crypto exchange rekindled fears about industry integrity and the intention of regulators to exert more authority over trading platforms.</p>



<p>The SEC also alleged that a couple of tokens, including the native coins for the Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Coti (COTI), and Algorand blockchains (ALGO), Filecoin network (FIL), Cosmos hub (ATOM), Sandbox platform (SAND), Axie infinity (AXS) and Decentraland (MANA) are unregistered securities.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, on-chain data indicate that some larger market participants are scooping up crypto at the dip.</p>



<p>On-chain analytics tool Lookonchain <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1665977586718248960">said </a>on Tuesday that Cumberland — a prominent liquidity provider in digital assets — withdrew approximately 67.8 million USDC from Circle and deposited 67.1 million of the stablecoins to U.S.-based digital assets exchange Coinbase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crypto Prime brokerage FalconX also <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48?a=0x1157a2076b9bb22a85cc2c162f20fab3898f4101">acquired </a>37 million USDC from Circle before sending 29.5 million USDC to Binance. Additionally, as per etherscan, Asian investment firm FBG Capital <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xc3f7a7ed42125d2b45bcf8ebcb9fc5657eb674cd#tokentxns">deposited </a>44 million USDT to Binance shortly after the news of the SEC lawsuit went public.</p>



<p>Lookonchain also identified a crypto whale that withdrew 703,871 USDC and over 2.5 million USDT from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Aave before purchasing $3.35 million worth of ether.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is This Dip Worth Buying?</strong></h2>



<p>While the pain that this most recent capitulation has wrought across the market can’t be understated, the one glimmer of hope it offers weary crypto traders is that the worst of the decline could be over as high-net-worth investors are already stepping in to buy the dip.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, regular retail crypto traders should proceed with extreme caution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When crypto prices plummet as rapidly as they have in the market recently, it can make that token you’ve been eyeing look like a great deal. But old Wall Street experts have a rule of thumb that aptly explains moments like this: “Never try to catch a falling knife.”</p>



<p>This means pro traders could make a buck trading on increased market volatility, but further downside could occur shortly.</p>



<p>Trader Crypto Tony <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoTony__/status/1665986631764000768">suggests </a>that Bitcoin could see a short-term bounce before a fresh tumble toward the $24,500 region.</p>



<p>“Shed some more profit on my short this morning, but now looking for a relief wave before the final leg down towards $24,500. I anticipate this is the final leg down before we accumulate for pump to come July / August,” he tweeted.</p>

<p>On Monday, Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange by traded volume, was hit with a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">lawsuit</a> by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleging violations of federal securities laws.</p>



<p>Through thirteen charges, the SEC claimed that the exchange, led by CEO Changpeng Zhao &#8216;CZ&#8217;, offered unregistered securities through its BNB token and other tokens. The agency also accused Zhao and various Binance entities of engaging in deceptive practices, conflicts of interest, inadequate disclosure, and deliberate evasion of legal obligations.</p>



<p>In response to the charges, Binance issued a <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/sec-complaint-aims-to-unilaterally-define-crypto-market-structure-8707489117122437402">statement</a> expressing disappointment with the SEC&#8217;s decision to file a complaint, despite actively cooperating with the agency in extensive good-faith discussions to reach a negotiated settlement.</p>



<p>Binance further criticized the SEC&#8217;s approach, accusing the commission of lacking clarity and guidance in the digital asset industry. According to the exchange, <em>&#8220;The SEC&#8217;s refusal to productively engage with us is just another example of the Commission&#8217;s misguided and conscious refusal to provide much-needed clarity and guidance to the digital asset industry.&#8221;</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Binance also argued that the SEC&#8217;s actions undermined America&#8217;s position as a global hub for financial innovation and leadership. It noted that the SEC&#8217;s actions were driven by a desire to claim jurisdictional ground and make headlines rather than protect investors.</p>



<p>That said, the exchange expressed its intention to defend its platform, asserting, <em>&#8220;We intend to defend our platform vigorously&#8230; We take the SEC&#8217;s allegations seriously, but they should not be the subject of an SEC enforcement action.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>While some believe SEC’s decision to sue Binance was long overdue due to the long-felt apparent bad blood between the two entities, the industry has overwhelmingly criticized the SEC due to its latest overreach. Since Monday, industry partners have rallied behind Binance overwhelmingly, emphasizing the importance of defending this technology from what they perceive as misguided lawsuits.</p>



<p>“<em>Honestly, what is happening isn’t anything new. It’s always the same fight between freedom and authoritarianism just with different players, technology, and words,” </em><a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1665780536177217537">tweeted</a> Cardano co-founder Charles Honskinson. “<em>It does seem like this event is a perfect opportunity for the entire industry to set aside its fragmented nature and unite for a common sense set of rules and guidelines that can prevent the United States from slipping into a dystopia that would make 1984 look like a vacation.”</em></p>



<p>Ben Todar, CEO of Moon Nation Game, also expressed his disappointment arguing that the SEC&#8217;s actions undermine the freedom and innovation associated with cryptocurrencies and raise suspicions about the commission&#8217;s role as a tool utilized by traditional banks to stifle the growth of digital currencies.</p>



<p><em>“By targeting Binance, the SEC appears to align with the interests of established financial institutions that perceive cryptocurrencies as a threat to their dominance,” </em>he wrote.</p>



<p>That said, as the legal battle between Binance and the SEC unfolds, the cryptocurrency industry watches closely, hoping for a resolution that balances regulatory oversight with innovation and consumer protection.</p>

<p>Despite displaying an admirable measure of strength year-to-date, Bitcoin has not been off to a good start this month, with the top cryptocurrency losing momentum due to recent market dynamics.</p>



<p>At press time, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-bulls-put-on-defensive-amid-fears-of-damaging-inflation-and-job-data-this-month/">Bitcoin</a> was trading at $25,537, reflecting a 6.18% drop in the past 24 hours, with investors now closely observing its movements and assessing the possibility of a new low in its price.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-5-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81809" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-5-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-5-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-5-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-5-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-5-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Recently, &#8220;Grizzly&#8221;, an analyst with onchain analysis firm Cryptoquant, highlighted the short-term support level for Bitcoin. According to him, the realized price for the 1–3-month age band is $27,200, which has historically been a crucial support level. If Bitcoin fails to reclaim this level, he noted that further support can be found at $25,300. Accordingly, failure to hold this level would likely send the price towards $20,000, the current realized price of the 3–6-month age band, according to the analyst.</p>



<p>However, according to &#8220;DanCoinInvestor&#8221;, an analyst at the same firm, a further decline in Bitcoin&#8217;s price to a new low is &#8220;very unlikely.&#8221; On Monday, June 5, the pundit noted that the crypto market was transitioning into a bull market phase, pointing out two key indicators supporting this notion. First, he highlighted the unrealized loss indicator, which measures how many market participants are currently losing money.</p>



<p><em>“The Unrealized Loss reached the bottoming zone (green) and then escaped, and now we are in the transition zone towards the bull market. FYI, it is normal for the peaks of this model to decrease from cycle to cycle, as shown in the chart, as BTC&#8217;s width of peaks and bottom narrow as the volume of the crypto market continues to grow,” </em>he wrote.</p>



<p>Moreover, the analyst highlighted Bitcoin&#8217;s dip and recovery above the realized price (represented by the yellow line), stating BTC was now trading within a stable range. The realized price metric signifies the average purchasing price of the market participants. Despite the temporary drop, Bitcoin has maintained stability and is holding its ground within the established price range.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="561" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-4-1024x561.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81808" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-4-1024x561.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-4-300x164.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-4-768x421.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-4.png 1431w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>DanCoinInvestor further mentioned that although the crypto market may experience a decline in the fourth quarter of 2023 or early 2024, it is highly unlikely that Bitcoin will make a new low. Instead, he noted that any recession-induced drop would represent the last chance before entering the strong bull zone.</p>



<p>That said, whether Bitcoin can break through the abovementioned resistance and regain upward momentum or experience a deeper pullback remains to be seen as its price evolves. Moreover, perhaps the recent purchase of over 1 million BTC by about 2.36 million addresses between the $26,360 and $27,160 levels could keep price buoyed, as <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1665377439940313088">highlighted</a> by popular analyst Ali Martinez on Sunday, June 4.</p>

<p>Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/revolutionizing-cardano-decentralization-how-staking-baskets-enable-seamless-ada-delegation-to-stake-pools/">Cardano</a>, has sounded the alarm about the increasing threat of crypto scams, particularly with the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology.</p>



<p>Speaking in a June 4 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AnksNTWbIc&amp;ab_channel=CharlesHoskinson">video</a>, Hoskinson addressed the prevalence of scams in the cryptocurrency space where individuals impersonate prominent figures like him, Elon Musk, or Bill Gates to deceive unsuspecting victims into handing over their hard-earned crypto.</p>



<p>The pundit shared a recent video from Nvidia, a leading technology company, demonstrating their advancements in generative AI. The video showcased the ability to create realistic video game graphics and generate lifelike human images using AI technology. Hoskinson expressed his worry that this rapidly evolving technology could be used to manufacture videos and audio, making it appear as if he is soliciting money or offering investment opportunities.</p>



<p>The crypto millionaire warned that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/scammers-hack-openai-ctos-twitter-account-to-promote-crypto-scam/">scammers</a> could leverage generative AI to create convincing content, leading thousands of people to fall victim to these sophisticated scams. Despite his efforts to educate and raise awareness about scams, Hoskinson predicted millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies, including ADA, would be stolen in the next 12 to 24 months.</p>



<p><em>“Millions of dollars worth of ADA and other cryptocurrencies will be stolen. This is the world we&#8217;re heading towards because of generative AI. It&#8217;s one of the dark sides and unintended consequences, but scammers are already doing this,” </em>he said.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, while Hoskinson admitted feeling helpless in the face of this growing threat, he stressed the need for individuals to remain vigilant and authenticate any communication they receive. He further suggested using Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption to verify identity, given that AI is currently unable to crack such encryption.</p>



<p>Hoskinson also highlighted&nbsp;Atala Prism, a solution built on Cardano to create authenticated communication channels. He hoped that integrating this technology into various platforms and communication channels could mitigate the impact of scams fueled by generative AI.</p>



<p>In conclusion, Hoskinson reiterated his warning: &#8220;<em>You don&#8217;t get something for nothing. It&#8217;s always a scam.&#8221;</em> He urged viewers to adopt a sceptical approach, assuming all content is unauthenticated until proven otherwise.</p>



<p>As cryptocurrency evolves, the battle against scams becomes increasingly challenging. Earlier last month, Facebook’s parent company Meta <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-scams-are-the-new-crypto-scams-meta-warns-120006510.html">highlighted</a> the uptick in AI-driven crypto scams.</p>



<p>As per the firm, the scams often come disguised as browser extensions or mobile apps posing as ChatGPT and AI software to steal user credentials. And whereas the firm stated it is working on building tools to detect and block these types of malware, it emphasized prevention being better than cure, asking users to be more vigilant online.</p>

<p>Franklin Templeton, one of the world&#8217;s largest asset managers with over $1.5 trillion in assets under management, plans to invest heavily in Bitcoin as well as its underlying technology.</p>



<p>This strategy was revealed by Sandy Kaul, the Senior Vice President of Franklin Templeton&#8217;s burgeoning crypto business, during a Sunday <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSm-mrJAqNg&amp;t=5s&amp;ab_channel=ScottMelker">interview</a> with Scott Melker, host of the Wolf Of All Streets podcast.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discussing how Franklin Templeton entered the digital asset space, Kaul explained that the company was intrigued by the technology behind Bitcoin and had decided to experiment on blockchain to bring operational efficiency and cost savings for its businesses.</p>



<p>As such, the company commenced research on individual coins, created multi-coin portfolios, and even invested in various crypto firms through a dedicated venture capital fund created in 2021.&nbsp; Furthermore, she disclosed that Franklin Templeton operates its node operations to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Bitcoin network and its growth.</p>



<p>Kaul also emphasized that Franklin Templeton&#8217;s interest in crypto extends beyond Bitcoin. She highlighted the vast opportunities presented by the cryptocurrency’s blockchain and expressed her belief in investors exploring emerging opportunities.</p>



<p>“<em>I think one of the issues we have right now is that people fixate too much on just Bitcoin and oftentimes don&#8217;t think about the broader ecosystem….Bitcoin is a huge Innovation, and we think it&#8217;s going to have massive opportunities in the future,</em>” said Kaul.</p>



<p>Kaul also predicted a continued surge in institutional investors dabbling with cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. She highlighted the cyclical nature of the crypto market, with waves of bull markets occurring every few years since 2011.</p>



<p>According to her, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/arks-cathie-wood-says-bitcoins-upsurge-as-global-banks-roil-will-attract-new-institutional-investors-in-droves/">institutions</a> prefer to enter the market when prices are low, and the sector is not in the spotlight. Thus, the current crypto winter was a period in which institutions strategically positioned themselves in the market, similar to the gradual adoption of alternative assets that took around 10 to 15 years. Furthermore, Kaul emphasized the importance of institutional involvement in creating a solid foundation for the market, which would play a crucial role in propelling cryptocurrencies to new heights following substantial price declines.</p>



<p>“<em>I know they&#8217;re not worried about the price. They salivate at low prices…If you&#8217;ve seen Bitcoin go to $69,000 and you see it at $15,000, you know $69,000 can happen again.”</em> She added.</p>



<p>That said, as Franklin Templeton commits to investing further in Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem, the asset manager joins prominent hedge funds, such as Grayscale Investments, Ark Invest and Pantera Capital, that have already made substantial investments in the space.</p>



<p>Furthermore, with Franklin Templeton&#8217;s commitment to education and promotion alongside its investment activities, mainstream acceptance of digital assets in investment portfolios will likely accelerate.</p>
