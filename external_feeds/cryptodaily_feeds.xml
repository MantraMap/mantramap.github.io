<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) has been unable to sustain upward traction early in the Asian session as the pair remains pressured below the 30000 figure after recently topping out around the 30060.28 level, right around an upside price objective associated with recent buying pressure around the 29525 and 30059.95 levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;Following the print around 30060, downside price pressures reversed at the 29768.19 area, right around a downside price objective associated with recent selling pressure around the 30421 and 30281 levels.&nbsp; Additional downside price objectives include the 29403, 29089, 28775, 28386, and 27757 levels.&nbsp; Below current price activity, the 28095.44 area represents the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following recent upside activity, areas of technical support and potential buying pressure include the 28306, 27466, 26428, and 26272 levels.&nbsp; Above the market, upside price objectives include the 30526, 30611, 30762, and 31145 areas.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to other levels of buying pressure include the 32125 and 33569 areas, and Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 32043, 34531, 34658, and 35912 areas.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 29954.91 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 29869.83.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>DeFi protocol Conic Finance revealed that it had suffered an exploit, with the attacker draining over 1700 ETH worth $3.6 million from one of its Omnipools.</p>
<p>Conic Finance is a liquidity pool balancing platform for the decentralized finance protocol Curve.</p>
Details Of The Hack&nbsp;
<p>According to security firm BlockSec, the attack&rsquo;s root cause was price manipulation caused by &ldquo;read-only reentrancy.&rdquo; Reentrancy is a common bug that allows attackers to exploit smart contracts by tricking them into making repeated calls to the targeted protocol and stealing its assets. A call is an authorization for a smart contract to interact with a user&rsquo;s wallet address. Web3 risk-alert source Beosin stated that a single transaction sent nearly the stolen amount to a new Ethereum address. Conic Finance reached out to users, tweeting they were investigating the exploit and would share updates soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are currently investigating an exploit involving the ETH Omnipool and will share updates as soon as they are available.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Security firm PeckShield also analyzed the attack, revealing the root cause to be originating from the protocol&rsquo;s new CurveLPOracleV2 contract. The firm tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi, @ConicFinance. Based on the initial analysis from the malicious tx, our initial analysis shows the root cause comes from the new CurveLPOracleV2 contract. FWIW, our audit identifies a similar read-only reentrancy issue. However, the same issue is introduced in the newly introduced CurveLPOracleV2 contract, which was not part of the audit scope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Curve has also been following up with Conic Finance, stating that the primary issue had been identified and only the ETH Omnipool was impacted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have funds on @ConicFinance please remove! There seem to be an attack, which though doesn't drain all in one go&rdquo;</p>

<p>Conic later tweeted a detailed version of events, stating that they were alerted of an exploit impacting the $crvUSD Omnipool, adding they had taken all possible safety measures to limit the attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roughly four hours ago, we were alerted of an exploit affecting the $crvUSD Omnipool. In response to this and given today&rsquo;s ETH exploit, we immediately enforced maximum safety measures and temporarily shut down all Omnipools.&rdquo;</p>
DeFi Hacks A Major Problem&nbsp;
<p>The decentralized finance ecosystem has been plagued by a series of high-profile hacks impacting several major projects. A report by Web3 portfolio application De.Fi highlighted the scale of the problem. The reports stated that DeFi hacks and scams resulted in attackers stealing over $200 million in the second quarter of 2023 alone. However, losses to DeFi hacks were smaller in Q2 when compared to Q1 of 2023, with CertiK reporting that protocols lost over $320 million between January and March.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conic Finance had only recently gone live, allowing users to deposit tokens into their Omnipools. Omnipools allowed users to diversify their exposure across the Curve ecosystem and also increased rewards. After going live, Conic Finance was able to attract millions of dollars in capital, highlighting the huge demand for such a product. Conic&rsquo;s Omnipools work by allocating the liquidity of a single asset across multiple Curve pools. Curve liquidity provider (LP) tokens are staked on Convex, boosting CRV rewards.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Following Ripple&rsquo;s victory against SEC, XRP&rsquo;s price skyrocketed on the same day but hasn&rsquo;t seen much more growth over the past week.</p>
XRP Price Boom after Ripple&rsquo;s Partial Win Against SEC
<p>Last week, XRP experienced an incredible price surge, growing by over 100% in value in just one day. The rise was a direct consequence of Ripple's partial win in a long battle against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s (SEC).</p>
<p>SEC first sued Ripple for its supposed breach of the U.S. Securities laws back in 2020 which started the 3-year-long crusade. Finally, on July 13, 2023, judge Analisa Torres of District Court of the Southern District of New York pronounced in her ruling that XRP does not qualify as a security, at least regarding programmatic sales and &ldquo;other distributions&rdquo; (it is considered a security in regard to institutional sales).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The remarkable Ripple victory sent a bullish wave not only to XRP but to the whole crypto market. Besides, the XRP token was relisted on many big exchanges such as Coinbase and Gemini after the announcement of the court ruling.&nbsp;</p>
XRP Network Usage Data Indicates a Short Pullback
<p>Traders have clearly shown much interest in XRP over the past week, with the coin&rsquo;s spot trading volumes even exceeding that of Bitcoin and Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet, according to the recent data, the network&rsquo;s activity hasn&rsquo;t seen much increase. Ripple&rsquo;s blockchain-based distributed ledger technology XRP Ledger has maintained about the same number of transactions for over a year. This means that there&rsquo;s still a lack of new entities entering the network.</p>
New Bullish Trend for XRP
<p>Following the court&rsquo;s ruling in favor of Ripple on July 13, the price of XRP has been consistently growing during the whole week, hitting a mark of $0.84 on July 19. The growth could mark an end to the bearish trend that the token has been witnessing since its 2018 peak.</p>
<p>Despite the huge surge in value XRP saw last week, it still hasn&rsquo;t managed to reach the price of $1 and pulled back a little bit in the last couple of days. At the time of writing the token&rsquo;s value is $0.7831.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Amid a rebounding In the midst of a rebounding crypto market, Ethereum's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has hinted at a forthcoming upgrade to the Ethereum network, which could potentially reduce costs by a factor of 100.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">During his presentation at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Paris, Buterin unveiled plans for introducing account abstraction to Ethereum. He described the proposed upgrade as "super elegant" due to its implementation not necessitating modifications to Ethereum's underlying protocol, unlike prior upgrades.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Smart Contracts, Smarter Protocols</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Account abstraction envisages transitioning externally owned wallets to smart contract-based wallets, enhancing users' control over their private key seed phrase, akin to resetting an email password. This could also translate into lower transaction fees through "signless transactions."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Buterin elaborated on the potential benefits:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"The idea here is if there are these techniques that allow you to take mold many signatures from any transactions, combine them into one object which is much smaller and which can be much more quickly verified than verifying all of the account abstraction transactions individually and by doing so you can save data [and] computation becomes 100 times cheaper."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The smart contract wallet upgrade would further enable Ethereum users to receive various cryptocurrencies and pay network fees without conversion to Ethereum.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">However, the announcement comes with an acknowledgment of the challenges that lie ahead. Account abstraction, expected to attract a billion users to Ethereum, is not without its hurdles.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In his discussion, Buterin acknowledged that upgrading existing Ethereum externally-owned accounts into smart contracts and ensuring the protocol works similarly in layer-2 solutions would be significant challenges. Additional difficulties include integrating with existing technologies such as biometrics and wallets.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite these hurdles, Buterin expressed enthusiasm for the project's progress. The introduction of account abstraction could revolutionize the Ethereum experience, allowing users and decentralized applications (DApps) to sponsor transactions more efficiently. It could also enable more economical data use and faster verification times.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The news comes at a time when the crypto market, including Bitcoin and Ripple's XRP, is experiencing a resurgence, highlighting the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of this space.</p>
Account Abstraction And The Future of Ethereum
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While the implementation of account abstraction is heralded as a technical breakthrough, the intricate process of this upgrade warrants careful exploration. On a practical level, account abstraction means the transformation of externally owned wallets to those driven by smart contracts. This transition could simplify the recovery of private key seed phrases, lower transaction fees, and even enable Ethereum users to accept multiple types of cryptocurrencies without the necessity for conversions. This means that it could become 100 times cheaper in terms of data savings and computational costs.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p"> &ldquo;This is actually especially a big deal on rollups because in a rollup a big or on because a big part of the size of a transaction is the signature on a rollup," Buterin said.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite this, however, as Buterin notes quite sharply, navigating this transition won't go forth without its requisite challenges. Key upgrades to the Ethereum ecosystem, such as transitioning existing externally-owned accounts into smart contracts, and ensuring the protocol's compatibility with layer-2 solutions are hurdles that must be surmounted. The integration of this new system with existing technoliogies, like biometrics and present-day wallets, presents further complexities.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Yet, the air of optimism surrounding account abstraction is tangible. Buterin's enthusiasm signals that despite the challenges, the potential rewards could be transformative, propelling Ethereum to new heights of user accessibility and network efficiency. As Ethereum prepares for this innovative leap, the industry watches in anticipation, ready for the potential advent of an even more dynamic era in the Ethereum saga.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>After months of anticipation, the Indonesian government has finally launched its crypto bourse and clearing house in an effort to regulate digital assets in the country.</p>
<p>In its official statement from Thursday, the Indonesian Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (also known as Bappebti) reported that its new national crypto exchange has been operational since July 17. Along with the bourse, Indonesia has also established a futures clearing house to ensure secure transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The state-backed crypto market has been in development since December 2021 and was initially planned to be released by December 2022. However, Bappebti had delayed the launch of the exchange several times until finally announcing it was ready to go live earlier this month.</p>
The Only Space to Legally Exchange Crypto in Indonesia
<p>Indonesia has previously banned the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment but has allowed investment in digital assets. Following the investment boom during the pandemic, the recent data shows that over 17 million citizens of Indonesia had invested in crypto.</p>
<p>The opening of the national crypto exchange comes as an effort to strengthen crypto regulation in the country. Bappebti has made it clear that the newly established platform will be the only space in the country where the legal exchange of cryptocurrencies is allowed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The establishment of exchanges, clearing houses and managers of crypto asset storage is proof that the government is present in an effort to create a fair and fair crypto asset trading ecosystem to guarantee legal certainty and prioritize protection for the public as customers," head of Bappebti Didid Noordiatmoko said in the statement of July 20.</p>

What Will Be Featured on the Indonesian Exchange?
<p>The national crypto bourse is expected to list licensed crypto companies, such as Binance's Tokocrypto and Indodax, and others as traders. At least five hundred digital assets have already been approved to be traded on the exchange.</p>
<p>Earlier reports stated that Bappebti intended to limit cryptocurrency sales to local transactions while aligning them with global market trends. Licensed traders will be granted a one-month window to join the new exchange.</p>
<p>According to the statement by Didid Noordiantmoko, PT Bursa Komoditi Nusantara will oversee the crypto bourse, while PT Kliring Berjangka Indonesia will handle transaction clearing. Additionally, PT Tennet Depository Indonesia has been designated as the manager responsible for crypto asset storage.</p>

<p>"The establishment of exchanges, clearing houses and managers of crypto asset storage is proof that the government is present in an effort to create a fair and fair crypto asset trading ecosystem to guarantee legal certainty and prioritize protection for the public as customers," head of Bappebti Didid Noordiatmoko said in the statement of July 20.</p>

What Will Be Featured on the Indonesian Exchange?
<p>The national crypto bourse is expected to list licensed crypto companies, such as Binance's Tokocrypto and Indodax, and others as traders. At least five hundred digital assets have already been approved to be traded on the exchange.</p>
<p>Earlier reports stated that Bappebti intended to limit cryptocurrency sales to local transactions while aligning them with global market trends. Licensed traders will be granted a one-month window to join the new exchange.</p>
<p>According to the statement by Didid Noordiantmoko, PT Bursa Komoditi Nusantara will oversee the crypto bourse, while PT Kliring Berjangka Indonesia will handle transaction clearing. Additionally, PT Tennet Depository Indonesia has been designated as the manager responsible for crypto asset storage.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">The cryptocurrency market is in a state of constant evolution, with shifting dynamics and emerging trends. One such trend is the declining exchange volumes of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency. While this may raise concerns for some investors, it also presents an opportunity for emerging tokens like Borroe Finance to capture attention and gain traction. As the market diversifies and investors seek the best crypto to invest in now, alternative tokens have the potential to shine and offer lucrative investment prospects.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Bitcoin's Declining Exchange Volumes
<p class="s5">Bitcoin has long been the dominant force in the cryptocurrency market, serving as the benchmark for other digital assets. However, recent months have seen a decline in Bitcoin's exchange volumes. This trend is driven by various factors, including market cycles, regulatory uncertainties, and increasing competition from alternative cryptocurrencies. While some may interpret this decline as a sign of Bitcoin's waning influence, it also opens up space for emerging tokens to step into the spotlight.</p>
Opportunity for Emerging Tokens
<p class="s5">As Bitcoin's exchange volumes decline, emerging tokens have the opportunity to showcase their potential and attract investors. One such token making waves is Borroe Finance. BorroeFinance is an AI-powered funding marketplace that leverages Web3 principles to offer innovative solutions for content creators and businesses. This emerging token presents a compelling investment opportunity, especially in the context of Bitcoin's shifting landscape.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Why Borroe Finance Stands Out:
<p class="s5">1. Innovative Approach: Borroe Finance disrupts traditional financing systems by providing a platform where content creators and Web3 participants can generate instant cash flow. By selling future earnings through discounted NFTs, Borroe Finance aligns with the principles of Web3, emphasizing equitable value sharing among creators and users.</p>
<p class="s5">2. AI Risk Assessment and Blockchain Technology: Borroe Finance incorporates AI risk assessment and blockchain technology, ensuring a secure and efficient fundraising process. This integration enhances transparency, mitigates risks, and fosters trust among users.</p>
<p class="s5">3. Streamlined Funding Process: Borroe offers a streamlined funding process, allowing businesses to raise capital by minting NFTs representing future or outstanding invoices. The platform's user-friendly interface and efficient payment solutions make it an attractive choice for content creators and businesses seeking immediate funding.</p>
<p class="s5">4. Deflationary Token Model: Borroe Finance implements a deflationary token model, creating a potential for long-term value appreciation. The scarcity of tokens and the growing demand for the platform's services contribute to the token's value preservation and growth potential.</p>
<p class="s5">5. Market Potential: As the crypto market diversifies and investors seek opportunities beyond Bitcoin, tokens like Borroe Finance gain visibility. The platform's unique value proposition and alignment with Web3 principles position it as a strong contender for investors looking for promising alternative tokens.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Don&rsquo;t Miss Out On Borroe Finance 
<p class="s5">Borroe Finance has launched its presale which allows anyone to purchase $ROE tokens at the cheapest available price. The presale is a great opportunity to invest into this emerging ecosystem and the entire process is designed to give investors the best experience. There are multiple payment methods available including BTC,ETH,BNB,USDT and traditional fiat credit card payments.</p>
Final Thoughts
<p class="s5">Bitcoin's declining exchange volumes open up opportunities for emerging tokens like Borroeto capture attention and gain traction in the cryptocurrency market. As investors diversify their portfolios and seek alternative investment options, tokens with innovative features, such as Borroe's AI-powered funding marketplace, become increasingly appealing.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>An expert on crypto has recently postulated that criminals are leaving Bitcoin in order to use stablecoins, which are considered to be an easier go-to for illegal financial activities.</p>
From Bitcoin to Stablecoins
<p>It has often been suggested, especially in the mainstream media, that&nbsp; Bitcoin was one of the main currencies in which to transact illicit activities. However, recent insights suggest a shift in this trend. Originally reported by CoinTelegraph, Tara Annison, the former head of technical crypto advisory at Elliptic, stated that the criminal underbelly of the crypto world is now leaning more towards stablecoins, particularly USD Coin (USDC), over Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Annison, during her presentation at EthCC in Paris, delved into the changing dynamics of crypto-related crimes. She pointed out that Bitcoin's decreasing popularity among criminals can be attributed to the rise of decentralised finance protocols, mixing services, and most notably, stablecoins. These digital assets, especially those pegged to the dollar, offer new, more discreet avenues for illicit transactions.</p>
Why the shift to stablecoins?
<p>Annison explains that assets like USDC offer easy access and can be effortlessly laundered through decentralised exchanges (DEXs). She remarked that in her view the deep liquidity and substantial volume on these platforms make them ideal for such activities.</p>
<p>However, it's not all gloomy. Annison highlighted a potential advantage for law enforcement agencies. Centralised issuers, such as Circle, have the capability to freeze specific USDC tokens. This means that before these criminals can convert their assets into fiat currencies through DEXs or centralised platforms, their funds can be halted. Annison commented that in her opinion we are witnessing a rise in blacklisted USDC and USDT accounts, effectively freezing assets that criminals can't access.</p>
$7.8 billion in scams
<p>Annison went on to say that stablecoins aren't the only concern. Ponzi and pyramid schemes continue to plague the crypto sector. A staggering $7.8 billion has been syphoned off from unsuspecting victims through these scams. Moreover, criminals are constantly innovating, employing techniques like chain swapping and asset swapping to obscure their tracks, using a myriad of tools, from DEXs to mixers, in order to muddy the trail for blockchain analytics firms.</p>
<p>In the light of crypto scams decreasing by 46% compared to previous years, Annison believes the current bear market in crypto is a significant factor, suggesting that with reduced hype and lower prices, the sector becomes less lucrative for criminals.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Seoul, South Korea, July 21st, 2023, Chainwire</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Superblock, a contributor to Over Protocol, has raised $8 million from prominent companies and VCs in South Korea across two funding rounds. Investors included SK, Netmarble, DSC, E&amp;Investment, Schmidt, SpringCamp, and NaverZ.</p>
Ben (Jae-Yun) Kim, the founder of Superblock, said: "We are deeply diving into the South Korea market with the best local partners and looking to meet global partners accelerating us all over the world."
<p>As layer 1 blockchains have become faster and more established over time, the costs of bootstrapping and maintaining nodes have become increasingly expensive. As a consequence, blockchain applications have become challenging to operate without the use of costly equipment.</p>
<p>Over Protocol is a new layer 1 blockchain based on a protocol named "Ethanos" that only considers active accounts valid, enabling full nodes to discard obsolete data and operate with less storage, thus allowing for reduced storage requirements. With Over, anyone will be able to run a node and become a validator on their PCs at home. Ethanos has been published at EuroSys&rsquo;21.</p>
"With the ability for anyone to run a validator, individuals can earn potentially passive income through a process called home staking, enabling them to embrace a new lifestyle with new payment options, enhanced credit, and innovative finance opportunities," Ben added.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Proof Collective is trying to rekindle interest in its Moonbirds NFTs with a brand new 20,000-piece Mythics collection, released almost a year after its initial mention in August 2022.</p>
Proof Collective Drops New Collection
<p>Moonbirds, the once-celebrated NFT brand, is making a comeback with the launch of its 20,000-piece collection, Mythics, which is also the latest Ethereum profile picture (PFP) collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proof Collective, the company behind Moonbirds, aims to rekindle interest among NFT collectors after facing a significant decline in sales since its first release in April 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mythics collection is the result of nearly a year of development and will be introduced gradually. Proof revealed that it will unveil 100 new NFTs today, followed by an additional 100 NFTs daily for the next 200 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Half of the 100 new NFTs revealed daily would be randomly selected claimed eggs, while the other half would be 50 Oddities chosen to be burned. The slow rollout is a strategic move to enrich the underlying intellectual property and keep the community engaged.</p>
More About The Mythics Collection
<p>The upcoming Mythics collection is considered a more genuine follow-up to Moonbirds than its predecessor, Oddities. The team at Proof Collective delved deep into the lore of the Moonbirds world to ensure that the new collection offers an engaging and entertaining experience for collectors.</p>
<p>The new collection has been classified into three categories, depending on their functionality and power - the stone eggs, legendary eggs, and runic eggs. The first two types are rarer as they consist of only 20% of the collection each. All these eggs can spawn a specific number of Mythic forms; for legendary eggs, it is three; for runic eggs, it is two; and a stone egg can only spawn one. The person who is minting the NFT gets to choose which form of Mythic to spawn from each type of egg.</p>
Change In Licensing Model&nbsp;
<p>Once minted and in possession of a Mythic NFT, the holder will have complete commercial rights over the artwork and even be able to use the characters&rsquo; IP. This is a major change from the two earlier Moonbirds collections, which followed a Creative Commons CC0 licensing model. As a result, anyone could commercially reproduce and use the NFT artworks from those collections, even without owning the NFT.&nbsp;</p>
Will Moonbirds Regain Their Popularity?&nbsp;
<p>The cooling interest in the NFT market has impacted Moonbird sales, with average sale prices plummeting almost tenfold from their initial high.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Led by co-founder and CEO Kevin Rose and supported by top crypto venture capitalist a16z, the Proof is expanding the Moonbirds brand lore to rekindle interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rose said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With Mythics, we&rsquo;re really trying to give our community a new experience that links together the Proof ecosystem and expands the storytelling that started with Moonbirds. I&rsquo;m so proud of how hard our teams have been working on this launch, with the goal of expanding Moonbirds' storytelling both through art and technology.&rdquo;</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>The UK government rejected lawmakers&rsquo; proposal to treat crypto trading and related investment assets as it does gambling instruments.</p>
<p>The House of Commons Treasury Committee argued that unbacked, mainstream crypto assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) should be held to the same standards as gambling. In its report, the Committee said:</p>

<p>With no intrinsic value, huge price volatility and no discernible social good, consumer trading of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin more closely resembles gambling than a financial service, and should be regulated as such.</p>

<p>Andrew Griffith, the UK Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said it &ldquo;firmly disagrees&rdquo; with the &ldquo;Committee&rsquo;s recommendation to regulate retail trading and investment activity in unbacked cryptoassets as gambling rather than as a financial service.&rdquo;</p>
Regulating Crypto as Gambling Would Drive Crypto Offshore
<p>In its response to the Committee&rsquo;s concerns, Griffith stated that such an approach to regulation would defy the globally agreed-upon standards and potentially drive crypto activity offshore.</p>
<p>The government also opined that such a law would fail to address certain risks associated with crypto trading, such as market manipulation.</p>
Regulating Crypto in the UK
<p>The government further stated it is already working on crypto asset regulation, and proposed rules were put before parliament and debated last month. In its response, the government said:</p>

<p>HM Treasury and the FCA [Financial Conduct Authority] will work with the industry to ensure crypto firms are made fully aware of the standards required for approval at the FSMA gateway.</p>
<p>Further communications will be provided in due course to ensure standards for approval are clearly available to crypto firms operating in the UK.</p>

<p>Regulators in the UK have made strides in crypto regulation to address global concerns over the industry&rsquo;s risks.</p>
<p>The House of Lords recently passed the Financial Services and Markets Bill, which aims to regulate Bitcoin and crypto in the country.</p>
<p>Deemed a &ldquo;Rocket Boost for the UK economy,&rdquo; the bill seeks to make a &ldquo;technologically advanced financial services sector&rdquo; that is &ldquo;open&rdquo; and will &ldquo;grow the economy.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The recently uncovered personal diaries of Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison could be used as key evidence in the upcoming trial of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;</p>
Ellison&rsquo;s Diaries Could Be Used In Court
<p>The diaries, both handwritten and private Google documents, contain the rantings and ramblings of the 27-year-old CEO and will provide an insight into the events leading up to the FTX calamity. Bankman-Fried is facing charges of misusing billions of dollars from customer accounts, with eight counts of fraud and election law violations against him.</p>
<p>As the CEO of FTX's sister concern Alameda Research, Caroline Ellison was a significant member of the SBF business empire. The New York Times has recently uncovered and reviewed her private Google docs, which have shed light on her mental state during the final months at FTX. The documents, previously unreported, reveal that she was going through a breakup with Sam Bankman-Fried and was plagued with self-doubt about her ability to lead Alameda Research effectively.</p>
A Star Witness Against SBF
<p>After the collapse of the FTX exchange, Ellison pleaded guilty to fraud charges and agreed to cooperate with authorities in building a case against Bankman-Fried. She is being considered a &ldquo;star witness&rdquo; primarily because of her close insight into the FTX ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Legal experts believe that Ellison's testimony could be the ace up the prosecution's sleeve in Bankman-Fried's trial. The power differential between Ellison and Bankman-Fried makes her a compelling voice, and her candid admissions could hold significant weight in the case against him.</p>
<p>Other FTX executives, like Nishad Singh and Gary Wang, have also pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate.</p>
Doubting Her Abilities As CEO
<p>The entries in Ellison's diaries revolve around her turbulent relationship with Bankman-Fried, the stress, anxiety, and how it affected her perception of Alameda and its work. She expressed feeling hurt and rejected during their toxic breakups, leading to a decreased excitement about Alameda, as it felt closely associated with him in a painful way. Moreover, she confessed to doubting her own abilities to justify her position at the company, feeling disadvantaged and unsure of her suitability for the role.</p>
SBF Lost Confidence In Alameda
<p>In April 2022, she wrote that a previous breakup with Bankman-Fried had significantly diminished her enthusiasm about Alameda. Court records show that during this time, Bankman-Fried invested over $400 million in Modulo Capital, a trading company led by someone he had previously dated, indicating his waning faith in Alameda Research. Ellison's writings revealed jealousy and resentment toward Modulo, as she felt sidelined.</p>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried's trial is scheduled to begin in October in Manhattan. As the proceedings approach, all eyes are on Caroline Ellison and the potential impact of her testimony in bringing the accused founder to justice.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Will governments across the world inflict their CBDCs on their unsuspecting populations?</p>
Poor knowledge of CBDCs
<p>It was reported by Crypto Daily a year ago that 83% of respondents to a Crypto.com survey on digital currencies that was carried out by Economic Impact thought that &ldquo;greater international cooperation&rdquo; was needed in order to &ldquo;legitimise&rdquo; CBDCs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the questions asked in the survey was about the&rdquo;barriers to CBDC adoption&rdquo;. Here, only 27% of respondents said that a barrier was that they are &ldquo;not well understood&rdquo;.</p>
<p>However, probably the most concerning data that came out of the survey was the following:</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than nine in ten (93%) now say they agree that issuance of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) is necessary to establish a functioning market for new financial instruments such as digital bonds or other forms of digital assets,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If one adds that executives were very &ldquo;pro CBDCs&rdquo; and that &ldquo;nearly 87% of all respondents strongly agreed that consumer demand for CBDCs has increased in their country&rdquo;, then a clearer picture emerges (if the survey is to be believed) that at least among the respondents at the time, the idea of a central bank digital currency was actually welcomed.</p>
Where is the government educational material on CBDCs?
<p>Therefore, the question has to be asked: Where are all the mainstream media articles or televised debates on the advantages or disadvantages of implementing CBDCs nationwide, or even as is being talked about by some international financial agencies - worldwide?</p>
<p>The most important change to the monetary system since Bretton Woods is already being implemented in several countries across the world, and is being developed in many others, and there is hardly a ripple of discussion in mainstream channels.</p>
CBDCs - a technology to cancel wealth
<p>Rick Rule, CEO of Rule Investment Media, and ex-president and CEO of Sprott U.S. Holdings, had the following to say on CBDCs in a YouTube interview with Mike Maloney:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The idea that your cash, your savings, exist as a licence from your government, is terrifying to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He added:</p>

<p>If you combine the idea of a technological cancellable currency, however it&rsquo;s held, with artificial intelligence and the Chinese technology around so-called social scoring or social credit, you come to a circumstance where your savings, which are the result of the utility that you created in society, can be cancelled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rick Rule went on to cite the recent example of how Trudeau&rsquo;s government had seized the bank accounts of Canadians who were supporting the truckers with donations. The seizures were illegal and without recourse to the courts. Rule&rsquo;s fear is that CBDCs would make this kind of action incredibly easy to implement.</p>
<p>Given the lack of any educational content from governments to citizens on the roll-out of CBDCs it would behove the citizens to make their own investigations into the matter. Time is of the essence.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Uniswap founder Hayden Adam&rsquo;s Twitter account suffered a breach, with hackers sending out several tweets leading users to scam websites and phishing links.</p>
<p>Crypto Twitter was quick to warn users of the hack and urged them not to click on any links tweeted by the compromised account.&nbsp;</p>
Back In Control&nbsp;
<p>Adams was able to regain control of his Twitter account a few hours after the attack was first reported. After regaining access to his account, Adams thanked the community for their assistance and warned others of the malicious links tweeted from the account. He also stated that he will share more updates soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In control of my Twitter again. Appreciate everyone who helped out tonight and the effort people put in to help with takedowns, warnings, etc. Will follow up with updates when ready.&rdquo;</p>

Details Of The Hack&nbsp;
<p>The hack was first reported on the &ldquo;Web3 Security Alerts&rdquo; channel on Telegram, which notified its followers that the Twitter account belonging to the Uniswap founder was compromised. Hackers used the account to tweet that Uniswap&rsquo;s Permit2 contract was affected by an unknown exploit and user tokens were at risk. The tweet then encouraged users to click on a malicious link to secure their tokens. However, the scam tweet, the first of many, was online only for a few minutes before being removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, after the first tweet, several more malicious tweets from the account were reported, with one tweet asking UniswapX users to check their eligibility to receive gifted $UNI tokens by clicking a link to a website hosted in Russia. A Twitter user was quick to notice that the website in question was registered on the day the hack had been orchestrated, suggesting considerable planning behind the entire episode. The official Uniswap Twitter handle was quick to step in, warning users of the hack and asking them not to click on any of the links, urging them to wait for updates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;@haydenzadamsTwitter account has been hacked. Please do not click on any links. There is no giveaway, airdrop, or bounty. The Protocol has not been hacked or exploited. We will let you know when the issue is resolved.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hack did not impact the Uniswap protocol or any of its functions.&nbsp;</p>
An Age Old Problem&nbsp;
<p>Hackers have long been using social media platforms to exploit user accounts and seize control of their assets. Meta&rsquo;s new Twitter Rival, Threads, saw over 100 million sign-ups in days. However, hackers quickly appeared on the platform, promoting fake non-fungible token projects and impersonating prominent crypto personalities. However, social media organizations have taken notice of the growing menace and have taken steps to curb such attempts. On the 1st of July, Elon Musk announced that Twitter would be introducing a temporary limit on the number of posts users could read in a day as it looked to detect and eliminate bots and other bad actors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security experts have also highlighted the importance of SIM card-based 2FA and also recommended options such as Authy or Google Authenticator to secure their accounts. Both platforms utilize time-sensitive codes on user devices, minimizing the risks of a hack occurring through SIM swaps.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Sam Altman-founded Worldcoin has completed its migration to the Optimism ecosystem, with critical components such as the World ID and World App technology stack already migrated to the OP mainnet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project announced the news on Twitter, adding that user migration is currently ongoing.&nbsp;</p>
A Significant Step&nbsp;
<p>The Worldcoin Foundation (Worldcoin&rsquo;s initial steward) and other early contributors, such as Tools for Humanity (Lead Software Contributor), had announced a collaboration with the Optimism Collective. As part of the partnership between the organizations, the World App and the World ID protocol would migrate from Polygon to the Optimism mainnet. Worldcoin Foundation and Tools for Humanity had stated at the time,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With more than 1.6 million sign-ups in beta and 500,000+ monthly active World App users, the deployments on OP Mainnet will expand access and help Worldcoin reach a values-aligned ecosystem of developers and users.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the World App and World ID migration to Optimism complete, World App has now begun the process of user migration from Polygon to Optimism, intending to scale Web3 identity and governance on the Optimism Superchain. World App users and World ID holders will see a plethora of changes, such as the Worldcoin protocol migrating to Ethereum to support World ID. Additionally, a majority of Safe wallets have been deployed on the OP mainnet, with the remainder set to be deployed on user-initiated migration. Following the migration, World App also supports Uniswap on the OP mainnet.&nbsp;</p>
A Boost For Optimism&nbsp;
<p>Worldcoin believes that the migration of World ID to the OP mainnet could significantly boost the capabilities of Optimism&rsquo;s Citizen House. Citizen House works in tandem with the Token House to govern the larger Optimism Collective. World ID could also help enhance Optimism Collective&rsquo;s AttestationStation, a shared database designed to make the verification of information easier, and creates a strong network of trust on OP chains within the Superchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>World ID SDK Publicly Available&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worldcoin has also made its World ID software development kit (SDK) publicly available to developers through a limited waitlist. Worldcoin&rsquo;s World ID software development kit has been critical in building over 100 projects, including flagship integrations such as Okta&rsquo;s Auth0 and Talent Protocol. The former is a global authentication and authorization platform, while the latter is a social and economic platform designed for Web3 builders based in Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The World ID software development kit includes a developer portal, web widget (JS), development simulator, and a comprehensive guide. Thanks to its permissionless architecture, it can support open identity standards and currently supports OAuth 2.0 and OIDC (OpenID Connect). There are plans to introduce support for Verifiable Credentials (VCs), Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), and Sign in with Ethereum (SIWE) in the near future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just last week, Worldcoin hit a significant milestone, registering 2 million World ID signups in its beta phase. The signups are an indication of World ID&rsquo;s global reach and appeal, with users registering from several cities, such as Buenos Aires, New York, Berlin, Barcelona, Tokyo, and Seoul.&nbsp;</p>
Optimism&rsquo;s Superchain
<p>Optimism&rsquo;s Superchain is a network of Layer 2 solutions that share security and communication layers. Worldcoin began its collaboration with Optimism almost a year ago when they jointly contributed to EIP-4844. This Ethereum improvement proposal looked to improve Ethereum&rsquo;s scalability beyond what was achievable with current Layer 2 networks. According to Worldcoin, EIP-4844 would reduce Layer 2 fees by a factor of 10. At the time, Worldcoin had noted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;EIP-4844 is now expected to be included in the next hard fork of Ethereum. Its potential to accelerate adoption in the Optimism ecosystem could also enable a significant boost in World App transactions across Ethereum L2s with the World App wallet&rsquo;s migration to OP Mainnet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>World ID and World App&rsquo;s migration to the OP mainnet is the latest step in realizing Optimism&rsquo;s Superchain vision.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) possess immense potential to reshape the future landscape of the internet, ushering in a revolutionary approach to verifying our digital identities. The path to achieving this transformation remains ambiguous as we witness the emergence of Web3, a paradigm shift from platform-centric to user-centric networking. The crucial aspect of a user-centric network lies in users defining their identities and determining the information they wish to share with others.</p>
<p>After years of unwavering dedication, the MetaBlox team has released a breakthrough protocol that uses DIDs to provide a decentralized groundwork for creating a user-centric network. The team is diligently working to build the foundation for a web3 user-centric network that can support web3 native apps.</p>
<p>The MetaBlox Network mobile app represents a major step toward this lofty goal. With this software, users may take the first necessary step toward gaining access to a Free Privacy Protected WiFi Network by registering a DID and automatically uploading it to the blockchain and, in the process, earn mPoints that can be used on the further development of the network.</p>
<p>The platform has a lot of benefits that make it stand out. First and foremost, the team believes that the most compelling aspect of MetaBlox is that it is a user-centric network supported by a rewarding system for its users and builders. MetaBlox hopes to model itself after the prosperous Web 2.0 period, during which prominent corporations gave away their services for free to demonstrate the efficacy of their monetization schemes.</p>
<p>In Web 3.0, MetaBlox seeks to replicate this prosperity with a significant distinction. Instead of profits accruing solely to private entities, MetaBlox positions itself as a decentralized solution, enabling users and network maintainers to reap the rewards. Unlike the Helium Network, which employs LORA technology, MetaBlox operates as a WiFi Network, affording the bandwidth necessary to accommodate many users, thus substantially expanding monetization opportunities for all stakeholders involved.</p>
Powering the User-Oriented Web3: MetaBlox's OpenRoaming Initiative and Decentralized Connectivity
<p>MetaBlox's decentralized OpenRoaming WiFi Network made great strides toward creating a user-oriented Web3. Several major Web3 investment businesses and organizations contributed over $2 million to the initiative. The OpenRoaming Network expanded the worldwide WiFi network by deploying hundreds of MetaBlox Miners as blockchain nodes, allowing for secure, password-free, automated connections using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).</p>
<p>To create an OpenRoaming network with over a million access points, MetaBlox collaborated with the Wireless Broadband Alliance (WBA). The WBA Wireless Global Congress also saw a successful demonstration of their technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users may now create their own WiFi OpenRoaming profiles and have access to Web3 capabilities with the newly released software. Notably, MetaBlox teamed up with other initiatives such as Harmony, Caldance, Memolabs, and Deeper Network to accomplish its goals.&nbsp;</p>
MetaBlox Network's Blockchain Integration for DeFi, GameFi, and NFTs
<p>MetaBlox Network uses blockchain technology to improve the quality of its products and services significantly. Because of Blockchain technology, users' hotspot routers may double as crypto miners, earning them tokens in exchange for giving WiFi access. With this decentralized deployment approach, MetaBlox Network can steadily increase its worldwide presence and reach as an incentive for network development.</p>
<p>In addition, combining the MetaBlox Network with blockchain technology unleashes many novel possibilities. Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, game finance (GameFi) ecosystems, and NFT markets may all be accessed confidentially and safely by users. Individuals may make money with digital assets by participating in farming and staking activities on DeFi networks. At the same time, the system provides unhindered entry to the increasing universe of GameFi and Play-to-Earn games, with strong security provided by blockchain-held credentials in place of the more archaic passwords.</p>
<p>MetaBlox Network was developed in response to the rapidly growing NFT sector, and it provides users with simple access to NFT markets and wallets by use of their DIDs. The firm has established its collection of utility-based NFTs, seen on major platforms like OpenSea, as evidence of its dedication to the blockchain ecosystem. MetaBlox Network aims to offer a genuinely user-centric experience that adapts to the new digital environment by integrating Web3, the Metaverse, 5G rollout, DeFi, and DID-based technologies.</p>
MetaBlox's $MBLX Token and Its Role in Decentralized Network Development
<p>MetaBlox is hard at work creating a user-focused, open, and free system for anyone who wants to use it. To encourage the development of a native Web3 network, which is in accordance with this goal, the $MBLX token has been introduced.</p>
<p>Businesses that want to sell goods or provide services inside the MetaBlox ecosystem are the primary target users of the $MBLX token. These companies actively contribute to developing decentralized ownership inside the next generation of wireless networks by earning and using $MBLX tokens.</p>
<p>The $MBLX token's main benefit over competing tokens is that it was made with Web3 users' insatiable curiosity about the platform's features in mind. These customers can take advantage of all the Web3 ecosystem offers once they adopt $MBLX.</p>
MetaBlox's Founding Members and Their Remarkable Technological Achievements
<p>The first MetaBlox team mostly comprises employees from the leading organizations that make up the alliance's founding members, which are located in North America and Asia. These businesses focus on developing and implementing state-of-the-art technologies, including blockchain, IoT, Telco, AI, and financial services. The alliance members range from large, publicly traded corporations to small, innovative startups, but they all have one thing in common: a desire to build a Web3 network that puts users' wants and needs first.</p>
<p>The founding coalition has made great progress and accomplished outstanding feats during the previous four years. They collaborated with the Canadian federal government on the first blockchain program, among other pioneering endeavors. Further distinguishing themselves, they were the first group to combine blockchain technology with eSIM and Bluetooth chips.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the alliance members are active contributors to the Decentralized ID Foundation. This shows their dedication to spreading the use of decentralized identification systems. WiGig is a broadband version of WiFi, and the alliance members are among the few businesses in the world that have access to this technology. Their proficiency with WiGig technology enables them to provide reliable and fast wireless network options.</p>
<p>Their work in the development of AI is another significant achievement of the original alliance members. They are pioneers in AI edge computing, having designed and produced one of the earliest system-on-a-chip (SOC) devices. This technological advancement provides high-performance and smart computing capabilities at the network's periphery, allowing for instantaneous data processing and analysis.</p>
<p>Members of the alliance have made significant investments in several high-profile initiatives throughout the decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming finance (GameFi), and non-fungible token (NFT) spaces, demonstrating their commitment to the development of these industries beyond just technological means. Investing in promising startups like 1inch and Axie Infinity demonstrates their dedication to fostering growth and development in the nascent blockchain industry.</p>
Final Thoughts
<p>The advent of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) has the potential to reshape the future of the internet by revolutionizing the way we verify our digital identities. As Web3 emerges, shifting from platform-centric to user-centric networking, the MetaBlox team has made remarkable progress in developing a protocol that leverages DIDs to establish a decentralized foundation for a user-centric network. Their commitment to building a web3 native network that supports user-centric applications is evident in the MetaBlox Network mobile app.</p>

The team is diligently working to build the foundation for a web3 user-centric network that can support web3 native apps.</p>
<p>The MetaBlox Network mobile app represents a major step toward this lofty goal. With this software, users may take the first necessary step toward gaining access to a Free Privacy Protected WiFi Network by registering a DID and automatically uploading it to the blockchain and, in the process, earn mPoints that can be used on the further development of the network.</p>
<p>The platform has a lot of benefits that make it stand out. First and foremost, the team believes that the most compelling aspect of MetaBlox is that it is a user-centric network supported by a rewarding system for its users and builders. MetaBlox hopes to model itself after the prosperous Web 2.0 period, during which prominent corporations gave away their services for free to demonstrate the efficacy of their monetization schemes.</p>
<p>In Web 3.0, MetaBlox seeks to replicate this prosperity with a significant distinction. Instead of profits accruing solely to private entities, MetaBlox positions itself as a decentralized solution, enabling users and network maintainers to reap the rewards. Unlike the Helium Network, which employs LORA technology, MetaBlox operates as a WiFi Network, affording the bandwidth necessary to accommodate many users, thus substantially expanding monetization opportunities for all stakeholders involved.</p>
Powering the User-Oriented Web3: MetaBlox's OpenRoaming Initiative and Decentralized Connectivity
<p>MetaBlox's decentralized OpenRoaming WiFi Network made great strides toward creating a user-oriented Web3. Several major Web3 investment businesses and organizations contributed over $2 million to the initiative. The OpenRoaming Network expanded the worldwide WiFi network by deploying hundreds of MetaBlox Miners as blockchain nodes, allowing for secure, password-free, automated connections using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).</p>
<p>To create an OpenRoaming network with over a million access points, MetaBlox collaborated with the Wireless Broadband Alliance (WBA). The WBA Wireless Global Congress also saw a successful demonstration of their technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users may now create their own WiFi OpenRoaming profiles and have access to Web3 capabilities with the newly released software. Notably, MetaBlox teamed up with other initiatives such as Harmony, Caldance, Memolabs, and Deeper Network to accomplish its goals.&nbsp;</p>
MetaBlox Network's Blockchain Integration for DeFi, GameFi, and NFTs
<p>MetaBlox Network uses blockchain technology to improve the quality of its products and services significantly. Because of Blockchain technology, users' hotspot routers may double as crypto miners, earning them tokens in exchange for giving WiFi access. With this decentralized deployment approach, MetaBlox Network can steadily increase its worldwide presence and reach as an incentive for network development.</p>
<p>In addition, combining the MetaBlox Network with blockchain technology unleashes many novel possibilities. Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, game finance (GameFi) ecosystems, and NFT markets may all be accessed confidentially and safely by users. Individuals may make money with digital assets by participating in farming and staking activities on DeFi networks. At the same time, the system provides unhindered entry to the increasing universe of GameFi and Play-to-Earn games, with strong security provided by blockchain-held credentials in place of the more archaic passwords.</p>
<p>MetaBlox Network was developed in response to the rapidly growing NFT sector, and it provides users with simple access to NFT markets and wallets by use of their DIDs. The firm has established its collection of utility-based NFTs, seen on major platforms like OpenSea, as evidence of its dedication to the blockchain ecosystem. MetaBlox Network aims to offer a genuinely user-centric experience that adapts to the new digital environment by integrating Web3, the Metaverse, 5G rollout, DeFi, and DID-based technologies.</p>
MetaBlox's $MBLX Token and Its Role in Decentralized Network Development
<p>MetaBlox is hard at work creating a user-focused, open, and free system for anyone who wants to use it. To encourage the development of a native Web3 network, which is in accordance with this goal, the $MBLX token has been introduced.</p>
<p>Businesses that want to sell goods or provide services inside the MetaBlox ecosystem are the primary target users of the $MBLX token. These companies actively contribute to developing decentralized ownership inside the next generation of wireless networks by earning and using $MBLX tokens.</p>
<p>The $MBLX token's main benefit over competing tokens is that it was made with Web3 users' insatiable curiosity about the platform's features in mind. These customers can take advantage of all the Web3 ecosystem offers once they adopt $MBLX.</p>
MetaBlox's Founding Members and Their Remarkable Technological Achievements
<p>The first MetaBlox team mostly comprises employees from the leading organizations that make up the alliance's founding members, which are located in North America and Asia. These businesses focus on developing and implementing state-of-the-art technologies, including blockchain, IoT, Telco, AI, and financial services. The alliance members range from large, publicly traded corporations to small, innovative startups, but they all have one thing in common: a desire to build a Web3 network that puts users' wants and needs first.</p>
<p>The founding coalition has made great progress and accomplished outstanding feats during the previous four years. They collaborated with the Canadian federal government on the first blockchain program, among other pioneering endeavors. Further distinguishing themselves, they were the first group to combine blockchain technology with eSIM and Bluetooth chips.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the alliance members are active contributors to the Decentralized ID Foundation. This shows their dedication to spreading the use of decentralized identification systems. WiGig is a broadband version of WiFi, and the alliance members are among the few businesses in the world that have access to this technology. Their proficiency with WiGig technology enables them to provide reliable and fast wireless network options.</p>
<p>Their work in the development of AI is another significant achievement of the original alliance members. They are pioneers in AI edge computing, having designed and produced one of the earliest system-on-a-chip (SOC) devices. This technological advancement provides high-performance and smart computing capabilities at the network's periphery, allowing for instantaneous data processing and analysis.</p>
<p>Members of the alliance have made significant investments in several high-profile initiatives throughout the decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming finance (GameFi), and non-fungible token (NFT) spaces, demonstrating their commitment to the development of these industries beyond just technological means. Investing in promising startups like 1inch and Axie Infinity demonstrates their dedication to fostering growth and development in the nascent blockchain industry.</p>
Final Thoughts
<p>The advent of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) has the potential to reshape the future of the internet by revolutionizing the way we verify our digital identities. As Web3 emerges, shifting from platform-centric to user-centric networking, the MetaBlox team has made remarkable progress in developing a protocol that leverages DIDs to establish a decentralized foundation for a user-centric network. Their commitment to building a web3 native network that supports user-centric applications is evident in the MetaBlox Network mobile app.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s4">Joe (JOE) and Uwerx are two emerging crypto platforms fastly approaching their launch date. </p>
<p class="s4">As both roll out exciting features ahead of their launch, it is crucial to understand what exactly they are and how their innovative approaches may be the revolution their respective industry needs at this time.</p>
<p class="s4">In this article, we have carefully examined these two significant potential tokens, understanding their use cases, price predictions, and how beneficial they could be for investors. </p>
Joe (JOE) Price Prediction
<p class="s4">Trader Joe is an innovative DeFi platform looking to offer an automated yield farming strategy for Liquidity Providers, consequently eliminating the traditional strenuous position management system. </p>
<p class="s4">Joe (JOE), the native token of the Trader Joe platform, is currently preparing to launch an exciting feature to augment its current value proposition, the Auto Pool. </p>
<p class="s4">Auto Pool is set to provide the best user experience and capital efficiency for DeFi users, ultimately helping the protocol generate more liquidity. This is a largely untapped area in the DeFi market, and with Joe (JOE) pioneering this aspect, you can be sure its adoption would be massive. </p>
<p class="s4">Joe&rsquo;s (JOE) first offering, The General, will be launched soon, making the token&rsquo;s future growth worth keeping an eye on. </p>
Uwerx (WERX): Championing a New Era for Freelancers
<p class="s4">Like Joe (JOE) is doing in the world of DeFi, Uwerx is also set to revolutionize the freelancing industry, serving as a threat to the progression of existing freelancing platforms. </p>
<p class="s4">While &ldquo;threat&rdquo; may sound somewhat exaggerated, it is actually the reality, considering the multiple advantages Uwerx has over these existing platforms, especially the incredibly lower transaction commission. </p>
<p class="s4">Unlike Fiverr, which charges 20%, and Upwork, which charges 10% per transaction, Uwerx will only deduct a flat fee of 1% as commission, allowing freelancers to enjoy their money while fostering a healthy client-freelancer relationship. </p>
<p class="s4">Beyond their transaction fee, the Uwerx team has also unveiled the &ldquo;Uwerx Vault,&rdquo; a central hub where users can stake (store their token for as long as they want while getting rewarded for it). </p>
<p class="s4">SolidProof and InterFi Network have audited the platform to confirm its credibility and have also been listed by CoinSniper and awaiting Uniswap listing on Tuesday, August 1, 2023. The team has also promised to renounce all contracts and reduce taxes to zero before launching the project on centralized exchanges.</p>
<p class="s4">The Uwerx platform currently boasts 1,600+ subscribers on Telegram, 1,600+ Twitter followers, and 5,500 sign-ups on the platform. </p>
Uwerx (WERX) is Enjoying an Incredible Presale Run
<p class="s4">The WERX token is enjoying an unbelievable adoption rate, with the token&rsquo;s stage 1 to stage 4 presales getting completed in record time. Although currently at stage 5 of the presale at $0.041 per token with a 15% bonus.</p>
<p class="s4">Thanks to this high demand, the Uwerx team has modified WERX token allocations and will lock liquidity before all presales end on Monday, July 31, 2023. </p>
<p class="s4">In a more recent update, the team has also disclosed their plans to send tokens to holders immediately after the end of the presale in a 6-week vesting period. This vesting period will follow a defined vesting schedule: 8% on week 1, 10% on week 2, 14% on week 3, 18% on week 4, 22% on week 5, and 28% on week 6. Similarly, after the presale ends, they also plan to host a Test Airdrop, as voted by the community. </p>
<p class="s4">Beyond the Uwerx platform enjoying a brilliant presale run, the Uwerx team has also released the first version of the Alpha platform as a PDF while waiting to transition from Alpha into Beta in the coming weeks. The published PDF features ten (10) pages, including but not limited to the Sign in Page, Log In Page, Forgot Password Page, Hiring Dashboard Page, My Activity Page, Client or Freelancer Initiation Page, etc. </p>
<p class="s4">In a bid to create an inclusive community, the team has also created a dedicated feedback email, feedback@uwerx.network, to receive comments and suggestions about the published PDF pages. </p>
<p class="s4">Tokens in the fifth stage of the presale are currently available at a favorable price of $0.05245, accompanied by an appealing 15% bonus. This creates a highly advantageous opportunity for potential participants. However, it is important to be aware that the price will rise to $0.06294 on Tuesday, February 25th, 2023, at 18:00 UTC.</p>
