The company&#x2019;s blog post specifically mentions switching the stablecoin asset tether over to usd coin, and the firm is offering &#x201C;zero fees&#x201D; to swap these two tokens.</strong></p>
<h2>Coinbase Offers Users Zero Fees to Switch From Tether to Usd Coin, Crypto Community Questions Motive</h2>
<p>On Thursday, Dec. 8, 2022, Coinbase shared a new blog post and <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1600997059770736641">tweeted</a> the statement: &#x201C;Switch to a trusted stablecoin: usd coin (USDC). Now convert tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>) to USDC with zero fees.&#x201D; The company&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/switch-to-the-trusted-and-reputable-digital-dollar-usdc">blog post</a> goes into more detail as it notes that customers can swap tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>) for usd coin (USDC) &#x201C;with zero fees.&#x201D; The blog post notes that events that have taken place during the last few weeks have shaken the crypto industry&#x2019;s trust.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The events of the past few weeks have put some stablecoins to the test and we&#x2019;ve seen a flight to safety,&#x201D; Coinbase&#x2019;s blog post explains. &#x201C;We believe that [usd coin] (USDC) is a trusted and reputable stablecoin, so we&#x2019;re making it more frictionless to switch: starting today we&#x2019;re waiving fees for global retail customers to convert <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> to USDC.&#x201D;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-563278 size-full" title="Coinbase Entices Users to Switch From USDT to USDC, Crypto Firm Says Recent Events 'Put Some Stablecoins to the Test'" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/dec8.jpg" alt="Coinbase Entices Users to Switch From USDT to USDC, Crypto Firm Says Recent Events 'Put Some Stablecoins to the Test'" width="1280" height="900" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/dec8-300x211.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/dec8-1024x720.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/dec8-768x540.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/dec8.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>Coinbase&#x2019;s statements gave crypto proponents the perception that the blog post was indirectly questioning Tether&#x2019;s stablecoin, the current largest stablecoin asset by market cap today. &#x201C;Shots fired. Bang bang,&#x201D; the Twitter account known as Autism Capital <a href="https://twitter.com/AutismCapital/status/1601045444020535297?s=20&t=zaXLuX5FLcsGdBOzwK2Jew">replied</a> to Coinbase&#x2019;s tweet about the subject. A number of other crypto supporters disagreed with Coinbase&#x2019;s statements. The strategy advisor at Vaneck, Gabor Gurbacs, opined that it was more likely people would choose <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Tether was the first stablecoin in the world and has been trusted by millions around the world since its inception,&#x201D; Gurbacs <a href="https://twitter.com/gaborgurbacs/status/1601020841135071233?s=20&t=zaXLuX5FLcsGdBOzwK2Jew">said</a> in a response to Coinbase&#x2019;s tweet on Thursday. &#x201C;In fact if you ask people outside a narrow group in the U.S. they&#x2019;d pick tether over USDC,&#x201D; Gurbacs added.</p>
<p class="p1"></p>
<p>The Twitter account known as the Byzantine General <a href="https://twitter.com/ByzGeneral/status/1601022831118389248?s=20&t=zaXLuX5FLcsGdBOzwK2Jew">wrote</a>: &#x201C;Not a good look. Also looks desperate. Makes me trust USDC a little less.&#x201D; The operators of the decentralized finance (defi) platform Curve Finance found a humorous silver lining in the situation when the defi platform&#x2019;s Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1601016335676608512?s=20&t=zaXLuX5FLcsGdBOzwK2Jew">tweeted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, let&#x2019;s shift back and forth really often. Loving it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The statements from Coinbase follow the recent auto-conversion from USDC to BUSD events at Binance and Wazirx. Furthermore, USDC&#x2019;s market valuation has dropped a great deal during the past few months. USDC&#x2019;s market cap tapped a high of more than 56 billion nominal U.S. dollars in June 2022.</p>
<p>Today, the USDC market cap is 23.57% lower at $42.80 billion. Tether&#x2019;s market cap, however, has shrunk a great deal as well, sliding from a high of more than 83 billion nominal U.S. dollars to today&#x2019;s $65.86 billion. Tether&#x2019;s market cap hit the $83 billion high in April 2022 and now it&#x2019;s 20.65% lower according to statistics recorded on Dec. 9, 2022.</p>

The ZOGI token is a wrapped version of the primary BEZOGE token optimized for the Zogi Labs decentralized ecosystem. From day one of launch, ZOGI will be available on Cronos, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> Chain & Ethereum, rapidly boosting the exposure of the token which can now be wrapped and moved between chains instantly, with very low gas fees using the upcoming Zogi Bridge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#x201C;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the launch of ZOGI on Cronos, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> Chain & Ethereum, we&#x2019;re taking our native token BEZOGE to the next level by allowing users to wrap their BEZOGE into ZOGI and bridge it quickly and securely between chains. ZOGI expands our ecosystem to multiple chains, and we expect to see massive growth and exposure, giving our dedicated community the flexibility they need to increase the utility of their BEZOGE & ZOGI tokens</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#x201D; Steve Murray, CEO, Zogi Labs</span></p>
<p><b>Wrap & bridge in Zogi Hub</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Zogi Hub acts as a portal for everything Zogi. Within the decentralized application, users will be able to access all Zogi products in one place, with the Wrapper and Bridge being available first. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrapping allows BEZOGE holders to wrap their tokens into ZOGI at a 1 to 1 billion ratio. ZOGI can then be bridged to one of the new chains (Cronos / Ethereum / <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> Chain) using the fast & secure Zogi Bridge. The bridge, developed in-house gives Zogi holders total control over the bridging process, maximizing security and transparency with every transaction, letting customers bridge between chains with ease and comfort in a single click.</span></p>

<p><b>Why ZOGI is good for BEZOGE holders</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The launch of ZOGI gives current and new BEZOGE holders the flexibility to hold their tokens on three different chains, as opposed to just one. With the goal of being chain agnostic, multi-chain ZOGI presents holders with the following benefits:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower gas fees. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enhanced flexibility.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to new ecosystems, each chain has its own unique user base.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More chains to be supported in the near future. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only way to mint ZOGI is by locking BEZOGE into the wrapping contract, ZOGI can also be unwrapped at the same rate so that users can reap the benefits of both tokens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about how </span><b>ZOGI</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> works by reading the</span><a href="https://whitepaper.bezoge.com/token-overview/what-is-zogi"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> full whitepaper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

The global crypto market cap is 2.28% higher as of writing, as markets prepared for the release of U.S. consumer sentiment data. Quant was another big mover, as prices surged for a second straight day.</strong></p>
<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) was a notable mover on Friday, as the token surged to its highest point since Monday.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.9062 on Thursday, MATIC/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.9324 earlier today.</p>
<p>As a result of this, the token moved closer to a key resistance level of $0.9540, which was last hit December 4.</p>

<p>Whilst prices near a ceiling, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has also moved towards its own point of support at 53.00.</p>
<p>The 10-day (red) moving average is also trending higher, with it remaining above its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>
<p>Despite recent turbulence, this is a sign of bullish momentum in the market, with some expecting further surges in price this weekend</p>

<h2>Quant (QNT)</h2>
<p>Quant (QNT) was another token to surge on Friday, with prices rising for a second straight session.</p>
<p>QNT/USD moved to a high of $124.88 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after hitting a bottom at $120.70.</p>
<p>Today’s move sent QNT past a recent resistance point at $122.00, with bulls now appearing to take price to a higher ceiling.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, this point of resistance seems to be the $132.00 mark, which is where quant started the week.</p>
<p>In order to recapture this mark, QNT bulls will first need to overcome the upcoming resistance on the RSI of 52.00.</p>

Since then, bitcoin is 75% lower in value against the U.S. dollar and the leading crypto asset&#x2019;s market capitalization has dropped down to the 26th largest position among the most valuable assets and companies worldwide.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#x2019;s Market Cap Is Just Below Chevron&#x2019;s and Just Above the Home Depot&#x2019;s Market Valuations</h2>
<p>Just over a year ago in Nov. 2021, bitcoin&#x2019;s (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) market capitalization was the eighth largest out of a myriad of companies and assets traded globally. At the time, on Nov. 9, 2021, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211109060650/https://companiesmarketcap.com/assets-by-market-cap/">archive.org snapshot</a> collected from companiesmarketcap.com shows <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s market valuation was $1.289 trillion as each unit was swapping for just over $68K.</p>

<p>On that day, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s market cap was below the precious metal silver&#x2019;s overall valuation, which was $1.380 trillion on Nov. 9, 2021. The leading crypto asset was just above Tesla&#x2019;s $1.167 trillion market valuation recorded 395 days ago. Additionally, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was situated in the top 20 positions of assets ranked by market capitalization as <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> held the 15th largest market cap on Nov. 9, 2021.</p>

<p>At the time, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>&#x2019;s market valuation was around $570.45 billion as ether was swapping for $4,839 per unit. Ethereum&#x2019;s market cap was below the company Tencent which had a market valuation of around $588.07 billion. The second leading crypto asset&#x2019;s market cap was above JPMorgan Chase&#x2019;s valuation which was $499.61 billion 395 days ago.</p>

<p>Today, on Dec. 9, 2022, the top two leading crypto assets <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> have much lower valuations than they did a year ago. Bitcoin is not represented in the top ten standings of assets ranked by market capitalization as it&#x2019;s now within the top 30 positions and ranked at 26. The $331.76 billion market cap <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> holds today is just below Chevron&#x2019;s market cap of around $335.56 billion.</p>
<p>Further, bitcoin&#x2019;s market capitalization is just above the overall market valuation of Home Depot, which is valued at $330.30 billion on Dec. 9. Ethereum has slid a great deal from the 15th largest position as it now holds the 72nd spot with a market cap of around $155.25 billion. Ether&#x2019;s market cap is below the United Parcel Service (UPS) which is $155.36 billion, and it&#x2019;s just above the valuation of Adobe ($154.61B).</p>

<p>Ethereum&#x2019;s current market price is roughly 73.7% lower than it was 395 days ago on Nov. 9, 2021. Though <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> have seen their market caps drop lower during the last year, the same can be said for a large number of different assets and companies. Some assets, like gold&#x2019;s overall market valuation, conversely recorded increases over the last 12 months. Gold&#x2019;s cap in Nov. 2021 was around $11.605 trillion, and today it&#x2019;s worth $11.910 trillion.</p>
<p>Microsoft was the second-largest asset a year ago, but it&#x2019;s now in the third position as Microsoft&#x2019;s valuation dropped from $2.53 trillion to today&#x2019;s $1.844 trillion. Google&#x2019;s or Alphabet&#x2019;s market cap was around $1.98 trillion and in the fifth position 395 days ago on Nov. 9, 2021, and on Dec. 9, 2022, it&#x2019;s down to $1.213 trillion. Silver&#x2019;s position in the top ten list moved up from the seventh to the fifth position, but the precious metal&#x2019;s market cap still dropped from $1.38 trillion to today&#x2019;s $1.316 trillion.</p>

Cryptocurrencies were mostly higher in today&#x2019;s session, as prices rebounded from recent losses. Ethereum also surged earlier in the day, climbing closer to the $1,300 level.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) climbed higher in today&#x2019;s session, with the coin surging back above the $17,000 level.</p>
<p>Following a low of $16,788.78 on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD raced to an intraday high of $17,274.60 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The move saw bitcoin rally beyond its resistance level at $17,200, hitting a five-day high in the process.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has since retreated from earlier highs, as bullish momentum faded soon after the breakout.</p>
<p>As of writing, the relative strength index (RSI) is now tracking at 50.93, which is marginally below a ceiling at 52.00.</p>
<p>Should the index continue to move higher, then the next target for bulls will likely be the $17,600 point.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>In addition to bitcoin, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also edged higher in today&#x2019;s session, with prices rebounding from recent losses.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD moved to a peak of $1,286.23 on Friday, less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $1,227.50 during Thursday&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>As a result of today&#x2019;s move, the coin neared a key resistance level of $1,305, rising to its highest point since Monday in the process.</p>

<p>Currently, it appears as though ethereum bulls are targeting a move beyond the $1,300 mark, however a ceiling on the RSI seems to be in the way.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 52.00, which has also been a key point of resistance in the past.</p>
<p>Bulls would need to overcome this hurdle first, in order to send prices towards the targeted $1,300 level.</p>

According to the proposal, all crypto service providers, regardless of where they are based, will have to abide by the new rules. </strong></p>
<h2>EU to Consider New Reporting Requirements for Crypto Platforms Serving European Users</h2>
<p>The executive power in Brussels intends to push through new “tax transparency rules” for the crypto industry. The proposal announced on Thursday concerns all service providers facilitating transactions in crypto assets for customers residing in the EU, not only those that are based there.</p>
<p>At the moment, tax authorities in the bloc lack the information needed to monitor proceeds obtained by using cryptocurrencies, the European Commission (EC) insisted. They are limited in their ability to ensure levies are paid effectively while Europeans lose tax revenues, it stated.</p>
<p>The new regulations, meant to complement the Markets in Crypto-assets (<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-makes-deal-on-mica-legislation-to-regulate-crypto-markets/">MiCA</a>) legislation and the anti-money laundering rules <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-agreement-reached-on-anti-money-laundering-rules-for-cryptocurrencies/">agreed</a> upon earlier this year, should improve the ability of member states to detect and counter tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance, the Commission elaborated.</p>
<p>The reporting requirements will apply to all crypto service providers, regardless of their size and location, which process transactions of clients residing in the EU. “Serious non-compliance” will trigger penalties with a set minimum level valid across the Union.</p>

<p>“Our proposal will ensure that member states get the information they need to ensure that taxes are paid on gains made in trading or investing crypto assets,” commented Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni. “It is also fully consistent with the OECD initiative on the Crypto Asset Reporting Framework,” he added.</p>
<p>The plan is to impose the new obligations on the crypto sector through amendments to the Directive for Administration Cooperation (DAC). The EC also suggested extending them to cover e-money and other digital currencies.</p>
<p>The draft proposal will be submitted to the European Parliament for consultations and to the Council of the European Union for adoption. The European Commission expects the updated Directive to be enforced on Jan. 1, 2026.</p>

<p>Different game modes of Spider Tanks present different strategic and team-based challenges to always keep gameplay fresh. TEAM DEATHMATCH is an all-out brawl style match where the team with the most kills gets the victory. Players need to create killer destructive combinations with their teams, and let the chaos ensure. CAPTURE THE CHICKEN is a mode where player&#x2019;s team&#x2019;s goal is to capture as many moving chickens as possible and become a Spider Tanks chicken master. And in CAPTURE THE FLAG, the team who holds the only one flag in their possession the longest will be victorious in the match.</p>

The bitcoin mining firm is reportedly planning to use the capital raised to fund its expansion into other African countries. </strong></p>
<h2>Using Revenue Generated From <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> Sales to Subsidize the Cost of Power</h2>
<p>A Jack Dorsey-owned digital payments firm, Block, and Stillmark, a bitcoin-focused venture firm, are reported to have led a $2 million seed investment in African crypto mining company Gridless. According to a report, Gridless, which currently operates in Kenya&#x2019;s rural areas, plans to fund its expansion into other African countries with the capital raised.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kenyan-firm-using-wasted-energy-to-mine-bitcoin-business-model-said-to-potentially-help-decentralize-mining/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News in October, Gridless harnesses excess electricity generated by mini-hydropower plants to mine bitcoin. The bitcoin is then sold and the revenues generated are used to subsidize the cost of electricity to users in Kenya&#x2019;s rural areas. At the time, Gridless said it was harnessing electricity from power plants that generated less than 100 kilowatts (KW).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/06/jack-dorseys-block-backs-bitcoin-mining-firm-bringing-affordable-electricity-to-africa.html">report</a> by CNBC states that the crypto mining company&#x2019;s founders, Erik Hersman, Philip Walton, and Janet Maingi, have spent the past few months launching pilot mining projects. In January 2023, Gridless plans to launch a 50KW hydro-mine in Malawi and a 30KW solar-powered site in West Africa.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Power and Connectivity</h2>
<p>Commenting on Gridless&#x2019; reported dual mission of bringing power and connectivity to Africa&#x2019;s rural areas, Walton, who is also the mining company&#x2019;s chief financial officer, said:</p>
<p>&#x201C;We had spent years building internet connectivity infrastructure in rural and urban Africa and realized that you cannot have a 21st-century economy without both power and connectivity together. As we looked at the next problem to solve, we realized that bitcoin mining solved a major problem for renewable mini-grid energy developers, in that we could be their industrial off-taker for stranded power, no matter where they were located, thereby making them more sustainable and increasing electrification across Africa.&#x201D;</p>
<p>To demonstrate the effectiveness of Gridless&#x2019; business model, the CNBC report revealed that at one of the pilot sites, a mini hydropower plant had effectively reduced the price of electricity from 35 cents to 25 cents per kilowatt hour.</p>

The bill introduced by senator Ed Markey (D-MA) alleges that crypto mining &#x201C;strains the grid&#x201D; and the industry &#x201C;undermines U.S. climate goals.&#x201D; </strong></p>
<h2>3 U.S. Bureaucrats Believe Crypto Miners Need to Report Carbon Emissions and Environmental Assessments</h2>
<p>Senators Ed Markey (D-MA), Jeff Merkley (D-ORE), and Jared Huffman (D-CA) have <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-introduces-legislation-to-combat-energy-intensive-cryptomining-as-it-strains-grid-undermines-us-climate-goals">introduced</a> a bill that would require &#x201C;an interagency study on the environmental and energy impacts of crypto asset mining.&#x201D; Markey&#x2019;s press release concerning the &#x201C;Crypto Asset Environmental Transparency Act&#x201D; details that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would lead the study.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the EPA would assess crypto mining activity in the U.S. and operations would be required to report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Crypto mining companies required to report GHG emissions would be &#x201C;operations that consume more than 5 megawatts of power,&#x201D; the press release details.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Big-money [crypto mining] companies are undermining decades of progress in our fight against climate change by putting profits over the promise of our clean energy future &#x2013; jeopardizing the reliability and safety of our grid in the process and making it all the more likely for utilities to raise energy prices on working families,&#x201D; senator Markey said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Representative Jared Huffman said the bill would finally pull &#x201C;the curtain back on this industry.&#x201D; Huffman added:</p>
<blockquote><p>The time for transparency, oversight, and accountability is now.</p></blockquote>
<p>The bureaucrats&#x2019; bill aims to combat so-called climate change, a narrative that U.S. politicians and leaders worldwide have been pushing for years. Markey&#x2019;s opinions follow a number of studies and research reports that indicate operations like <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> mining are actually advantageous, not only for relieving the grids leveraged but also removing carbon emissions.</p>
<p>For instance, the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) analyst, Daniel Batten, published a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/esg-study-shows-bitcoin-minings-potential-to-eliminate-0-15-of-global-warming-by-2045-claims-no-other-technology-can-do-better/">report</a> that claims bitcoin mining could eliminate the world&#x2019;s carbon emissions by 5.32%. On Nov. 29, 2022, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) published a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/applied-direct-response-ercot-study-shows-bitcoin-mining-is-beneficial-to-the-texas-grid/">report</a> that shows bitcoin mining is beneficial to the Texas grid. ERCOT&#x2019;s study indicates that bitcoin mining operations in Texas could curtail 1.7 gigawatts (GW) of energy during the Texas winter.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining is also known to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-gas-giant-exxon-is-running-a-gas-to-bitcoin-mining-pilot-program-in-north-dakota/">mitigate flare gas</a> (the release of raw gas into the atmosphere) and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/landfill-gas-mitigation-firm-vespene-energy-gas-to-bitcoin-solutions/">landfill gas</a>. In the press release published on Thursday, however, U.S. senator Merkley argued that &#x201C;Crypto asset mining consumes massive amounts of electricity&#x201D; and stressed &#x201C;most of which is generated by burning fossil fuels.&#x201D; However, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/74-of-the-worlds-bitcoin-mining-operations-driven-by-renewable-energy-says-report/">various studies</a> over the years <a href="https://coinshares.com/research/bitcoin-mining-network-2022">indicate</a> that a majority of bitcoin mining operations are driven by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/japanese-city-cryptocurrency-miners-renewable-energy/">renewable</a> energy <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/solar-powered-crypto-farm-in-australia-to-prove-bitcoin-mining-can-be-green/">sources</a>.</p>

<p>The bureaucrats&#x2019; act is endorsed by the Sierra Club, Earthjustice, Environmental Working Group, and Seneca Lake Guardian. &#x201C;Digital assets that rely on proof-of-work are wasteful by design,&#x201D; Scott Faber, the senior vice president for government affairs at the Environmental Working Group said in a statement. &#x201C;Strong federal regulations must address&#x201D; the situation, Earthjustice&#x2019;s clean energy attorney Mandy DeRoche added.</p>

The document, which sought to bring order to crypto mining and exchange activities in Paraguay, was ultimately dropped after failing to obtain the votes needed to reject the presidential veto it received.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Paraguayan Crypto Law Dropped After Support Wanes</h2>
<p>The Paraguayan cryptocurrency law that was introduced in Congress in 2021 was finally <a href="http://www.diputados.gov.py/index.php/noticias/archivan-proyecto-de-ley-que-regula-comercializacion-y-administracion-de-criptomonedas#:~:text=Se%20trata%20del%20Decreto%20N,permitan%20el%20control%20sobre%20criptoactivos%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shelved</a> after not receiving the support it needed in the Deputy Chamber. The project, which was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/president-of-paraguay-mario-abdo-vetoes-cryptocurrency-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetoed</a> in September by President Mario Abdo, failed to gather the votes needed in order to reject this veto.</p>
<p>The veto had previously been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/paraguayan-senate-rejects-presidential-veto-to-cryptocurrency-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejected</a> by the Paraguayan senate, which aimed to approve and pass the law without presidential support. The veto had the support of the Commission for Industry, Commerce, Tourism, and Cooperatives; while the Economic and Financial Affairs, and the Fight against Drug Trafficking, Related and Serious Illicit Activities commissions rejected the motion.</p>
<p>Some deputies questioned the veto, stating that the cryptocurrency issue must be studied and regulated due to its importance. In this vein, deputy Sebastian Garcia criticized this outcome, stating that with this move, the cryptocurrency subject will remain in an &#8220;absolute informality.&#8221;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Reasons for Supporting the Veto Motion</h2>
<p>One of the biggest reasons wielded by President Mario Abdo and other deputies to exert a complete veto on this bill has to do with the determinations it makes about the power delivered to cryptocurrency miners. Abdo stated that cryptocurrency mining was an activity featuring &#8220;high consumption of electrical energy, but little use of labor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, the law established limits for the fees that crypto miners pay for the power delivered to their operations. This would clash with the method of determining power tariffs by the National Power Administration (ANDE), an organization that also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/national-power-administration-will-propose-a-special-cryptocurrency-mining-fee-in-paraguay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported</a> the veto measure after having found several cryptocurrency farms that were connected illegally to the power network.</p>
<p>Deputy Arnaldo Samaniego argued that rejecting the veto motion would put ANDE in a tight spot, facing potential losses of up to $30 million. Deputy Jose Rodriguez also supported this position, explaining that the organization could not operate with losses derived from this law.</p>
<p>This development puts the cryptocurrency regulation efforts in Paraguay back at square one, with legislators having to once more propose and discuss a hypothetical new cryptocurrency law.</p>
