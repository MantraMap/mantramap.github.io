<p>Arbitrum has been experiencing high levels of volatility, after the recent rally lost momentum, and the coin is now trading at a 20% loss on the two weekly.&nbsp; XRP is also down by 20%, this time over the 30 day chart, as the SEC vs XRP case drags on.&nbsp; Tradecurve, a new decentralized trading platform, in the first stage of presale, is out to challenge the big centralized exchanges, offering unparalleled access to financial products in a truly anonymous way.</p>

<p>Arbitrum&rsquo;s airdrop affects ARB&rsquo;s price</p>
<p>Arbitrum is yet another layer 2 based on Ethereum, and many are bullish on the blockchain due to its speed and low fee transactions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Stargate finance was the most used DApp on Arbitrum over the last 30 days, overtaking Uniswap, and suggesting that many people are bridging their funds in or out of Arbitrum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data from Defilama suggests that more money is going into Arbitrum, since the total value locked (TVL) has more than doubled since the start of the year. GMX and Uniswap account for about half of Arbitrum&rsquo;s TVL. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Arbitrum recently airdropped ARB tokens to early adopters, and so selling pressure from this may account for the recent volatility, drop in ARB price and also the increase in TVL.</p>

<p>SEC vs XRP continues their seemingly never ending war</p>
<p>About a month ago, XRP&rsquo;s lawyers were feeling confident that the SEC v XRP case would soon be wrapped up and settled in Ripple&rsquo;s favor, due to findings leaked from the case.&nbsp; The crypto community echoed the bullish sentiment and new people bought into the coin. &nbsp;</p>
<p>While presumably most, if not all, of the crypto world would like to see XRP win this case, it should be remembered that SEC have never lost yet.&nbsp; Perhaps in a wish to maintain that record, the SEC seem to be deliberately delaying the XRP case, and so far costing Ripple over $200 million in legal fees. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Several crypto lawyers have publicly criticized the SEC for their contradictory statements on what does and does not count as a security, but only time will tell if XRP can come out victorious.</p>

<p>Tradecurve is on a mission to become the biggest and broadest decentralized trading platform</p>
<p>Tradecurve describe themselves as a &ldquo;Hybrid exchange where you can trade multiple asset classes all from one account.&rdquo; According to their whitepaper, customers will be able to trade US and European equity CFDs, forex, indices, commodities, options, ETFs, bonds and of course, crypto.&nbsp; Although some CEX&rsquo;s and traditional trading platforms allow this, Tradecurve is the first decentralized solution to offer all these products.&nbsp; This is important because it allows for anonymity and access regardless of who you are or where you live, and KYC is not required.</p>
<p>Tradecurve have many exciting features planned, such as AI algorithmic trading, copy trading (where people can pay a subscription fee to traders with a good success rate), and access to high leverage. This is all possible due to the blockchain and using crypto deposits as collateral. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Tradecurve team are aware that not everyone in the crypto space knows how to trade efficiently, and so they plan to have a metaverse trading academy, where people can meet and learn strategies from experts.</p>
<p>TCRV is the native token and is currently for sale at $0.01.&nbsp; They aim to raise $20 million in the presale in order to be able to challenge the likes of Binance and Kraken.&nbsp; TCRV is predicted to do a 50x in the presale and another 100x when it is listed on a tier 1 CEX.&nbsp; Given that Binance&rsquo;s BNB ICO began at $0.11, and BNB, at time of writing, trades for $309, the growth potential of TCRV is massive.</p>
