			            <description><![CDATA[The defendant got his victim through an ad for the fake OpenSea website on a popular search engine.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">US prosecutors have charged Soufiance Oulahya, presently in legal custody in Morocco, with stealing cryptocurrencies and NFTs worth $450,000 from a victim in Manhattan by creating a fake OpenSea marketplace in 2021.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A release from the United States Attorney’s Office Southern District of New York said the defendant illegally obtained the seed phrase of the victim by spoofing and used it to steal their collection of digital art. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Details of the Case</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Oulahya stole four NFTs from the victim’s OpenSea account. These were one each from Bored Ape Yacht Club, Meebit, Bored Ape Kennel Club, and Crypto Dad series. Besides, the defendant also stole cryptocurrencies from the Manhattan victim’s compromised wallet. The indictment said the victim had paid approximately $448,923 to obtain these digital assets.  </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“As alleged, Soufiane Oulahyane used a common cybercrime technique to steal victim cryptocurrency and NFTs. ‘Spoofing’ is one of the oldest tricks in the criminal playbook. Oulahyane adapted this old tool for use in a new and developing arena – the crypto space,” Attorney Damian Williams said in the release.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to the indictment, prepared by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Oulahyane used paid advertisement on a popular search engine to entice the victim to the spoofed OpenSea website. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The moment the victim entered the seed phrase on the spoofed website, it got transferred to an email id controlled by Oulahyane, who immediately accessed the former&#8217;s wallet and transferred the NFTs and cryptocurrencies to his wallet. The prosecutors have not named the victim or the search engine where Oulahyane put out the advertisement. </span></p>
<h2>Cyber Attacks on the Rise</h2>
<p>Spoofing is one of the many social engineering techniques where cybercriminals launch a malicious attack by enticing and convincing potential victims to click links, reveal passwords, download attachments, etc.</p>
<p>In April 2022, a BYAC owner was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/how-a-bayc-owner-was-tricked-into-swapping-his-bored-ape-nft-worth-570k-for-worthless-jpegs/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">cheated</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> of BAYC #1584, MAYC #13168, and MAYC #13169 — worth $570K in a swapping deal on the Swap Kiwi platform. The scammer used weak verification and anti-spoofing features in its checkmarks to create fake BAYC NFTS. But they were nothing more than photoshopped Jpegs. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In October 2022, the BNB Chain suffered a security breach and compromised cryptocurrencies worth millions of dollars. While freezing, recovering, and normalization were still going on, a fresh spoofing <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bnb-hack-inu-how-someone-stole-60-eth-following-the-bnb-chain-hack/" data-wpel-link="internal">attack</a> made the network suffer a loss of 60 ETH. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The affected wallets were reportedly created using an old and weak pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) algorithm. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A crypto wallet service &#8211; Klever &#8211; revealed that an already known exploit caused by low entropy mnemonic affected several users. The incident first came to light when users reported suspicious activity within their wallets earlier this week.</p>
<p>As per the company&#8217;s update, the algorithm called Random Generation, used by Bip39 implementation, was previously used by numerous cryptocurrency wallet providers. However, a flaw in the algorithm compromised the security and unpredictability of the generated keys, thereby making wallets susceptible to unauthorized access or malicious activities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Addressing the incident, Klever <a href="https://twitter.com/klever_io/status/1679267565434986501" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">said</a> all affected wallets were imported into Klever Wallet K5.</li>
<li>These wallets had not been originally created using Klever Wallet K5 but were previously built using an outdated and ineffective pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) method as their entropy source.</li>
<li>According to the company, this algorithm was widely used in early versions of various crypto wallet providers, which relied on the Javascript platform.</li>
<li>It also highlighted that such a weak PRNG algorithm can significantly compromise the security and unpredictability of the generated keys, potentially making them more vulnerable to attacks or unauthorized access.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>On the Klever platform, the core codes responsible for entropy and mnemonic generation that utilize the PRNG algorithm are implemented with robust security measures and are native to the operating system.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Klever said the incident is similar to the one reported by the TrustWallet explorer extension earlier in April.</li>
<li>The company advised users currently possessing any old wallets that were created before Klever Wallet to promptly move to new ones created on Klever Wallet K5 or Klever Safe.</li>
<li>Initial investigation <a href="https://klever.org/en/blog/klever-alert-external-security-incident" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">suggested</a> that the suspicious activity was not exclusive to Klever and that users of multiple wallet providers are affected.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[The author of the Rich Dad, Poor Dad outlined the recent US crisis about the debt ceiling.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert Kiyosaki, the author of several best-seller books, continues to display his support for bitcoin, gold, and silver above all other assets.</p>
<p>In his latest tweet on the matter, he praised the aforementioned three assets while warning that the rich will get richer in the wake of the US government&#8217;s policies.</p>
<h2>Sticking With BTC</h2>
<p>The largest US stock market indexes registered some gains over the week, with the Dow jumping by over 3% and the S&amp;P 500 by just shy of that percentage. The renowned author, businessman, and entrepreneur commented on the matter, as he believes these increases are only because of the removal of the US debt ceiling.</p>
<p>Recall that the world&#8217;s largest economy faced a major crisis until June when President Biden <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-signs-bill-lifting-us-debt-limit-2023-06-03/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">signed</a> a bill that suspended the country&#8217;s $31.4 trillion debt ceiling, thus avoiding the nation&#8217;s first-ever default.</p>
<p>Kiyosaki, though, who recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-will-explode-to-120k-in-2024-the-us-dollar-will-die-rober-kiyosaki/" data-wpel-link="internal">predicted</a> that BTC will tap $120,000 soon, believes the government&#8217;s decision will only benefit the rich and harm America because the US national debt will increase, just like the stock market. As such, he doubled down on his support for what he referred to as &#8220;real assets&#8221; &#8211; bitcoin, silver, and gold.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">WHY is stock market taking off? Because “Debt Ceiling” removed. Means national debt to rise with stock market. Rich get richer as America gets poorer. Sad. Sticking with real money &amp; real assets: Gold, Silver, Bitcoin.</p>
<p>— Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) <a href="https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1679915869340848129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">July 14, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>BTC Vs. Gold Vs. Silver YTD</h2>
<p>Although Kiyosaki keeps praising the two precious metals as well as BTC, it&#8217;s worth exploring their performance as of late, especially on a year-to-date basis.</p>
<p>Silver entered the new year at $23,75 per ounce and jumped to over $26 at one point. However, it since retraced to $22 before climbing back to $24.9 to close on Friday, which gives it a modest 4.84% YTD increase.</p>
<p>Gold&#8217;s performance has been rather identical as it started 2023 at $1,827 before it shot up to a yearly peak at $2,080 on May 4. However, it couldn&#8217;t maintain its run and fell back down to $1,955 as of Friday&#8217;s closing hours. As such, the yellow metal is up by 7% so far this year.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, on the other hand, started the year on a positive note after the devastating 2022 bear market. It quickly surged from its January 1 price of $16,700 to over $20,000 and just this week tapped a 13-month peak at $31,850.</p>
<p>Despite losing some ground and currently trading at $30,300, the cryptocurrency&#8217;s YTD gains stand at just over 80%, making it the best-performing asset so far this year.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Multichain's CEO and his sister have reportedly been detained by Chinese police. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recently hacked cross-chain router protocol Multichain announced it is shutting down its operations, citing a lack of operational funds and information about its CEO Zhaojun, who is in the custody of Chinese police. The latest update provided by the team confirmed the rumors about the exec&#8217;s arrest.</p>
<p>On July 14, Multichain took to Twitter to reveal that Zhaojun has been out of contact with the team since being apprehended by the Chinese police from his home. His sister was taken into custody as well.</p>
<h2>Multichain Shuts Down</h2>
<p>Upon contacting the MPC node operators, the team was made aware that their operational access keys to MPC node servers had been revoked. They explained that the MPC node servers in question were running under the CEO&#8217;s personal cloud server account and that he had sole access to it.</p>
<p>The team also learned that all of Zhaojun&#8217;s computers, phones, hardware wallets, and mnemonic phrases were confiscated by the authorities.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Since the inception of the project, all operational funds and investments from investors have been under Zhaojun&#8217;s control. This also means that all the team&#8217;s funds and access to the servers are with Zhaojun and the police.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Multichain team said they refrained from disclosing unauthorized information about the case to the public as per the lawyers&#8217; suggestion.</p>
<p>Daily operations were conducted with the help of existing access to servers that had not been revoked, as well as with assistance from Zhaojun&#8217;s sister, who reportedly transferred the remaining user assets in the router pool and subsequently notified the team and several project parties of this asset preservation action.</p>
<p>With Zhaojun&#8217;s sister also out of contact, the Multichain team said the status of the preserved assets remains uncertain.</p>
<h2>$130M Exploit and Subsequent Unravelling</h2>
<p>Multichain &#8211; previously known as Anyswap &#8211; suffered an $8 million exploit in 2021.</p>
<p>But problems with first surfaced in late May this year, which involved <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/gate-io-dispels-rumors-about-its-demise-amid-multichain-fiasco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">rumors</a> about the protocol’s management team being arrested in Shanghai after the CEO went missing. This later escalated after the $130 million exploit earlier this week.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Ripple's victory has far-reaching implications for the broader crypto ecosystem, especially for tokens like SOL, ADA, MATIC, and others.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On July 13, Ripple scored a big win in its nearly three-year-long legal battle against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after a court ruled that the majority of XRP sales do not fall under the classification of securities transactions.</p>
<p>This has raised questions about the potential implications for cryptocurrencies, such as Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and other tokens facing similar allegations of being unregistered securities. Let&#8217;s examine the implications of Ripple&#8217;s victory for these tokens.</p>
<h2>Ripple Wins SEC After Three Years</h2>
<p>In December 2020, the SEC <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-charges-ripple-with-1-3-billion-unregistered-security-offering/" data-wpel-link="internal">filed</a> a lawsuit against Ripple Labs and its founders, Brad Garlinghouse and Christian Larsen, alleging that the company and its executives conducted an unregistered securities offering through the sale of XRP.</p>
<p>The SEC argued that XRP should be classified as a security, placing it under the agency&#8217;s regulatory purview. However, Ripple boldly refuted the allegations and mounted a robust legal defense.</p>
<p>On July 13, 2023, after nearly three years of intense legal battle, Ripple <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripples-secondary-sales-of-xrp-not-an-investment-contract-judge-rules-following-over-3-year-long-legal-battle/" data-wpel-link="internal">scored</a> a landmark victory as Judge Analisa Torres, presiding over the case, ruled that most of the tokens in XRP sales do not constitute securities transactions.</p>
<h2>What Does Ripple&#8217;s Win Mean for Other Tokens?</h2>
<p>The ruling has far-reaching implications for the broader crypto ecosystem, especially for tokens like SOL, ADA, MATIC, and others that have faced similar allegations from the SEC.</p>
<p>Recall that the agency claimed that at least 12 tokens, including Binance Coin (BNB), Binance USD (BUSD), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Filecoin (FIL), Cosmos Hub (ATOM), The Sandbox (SAND), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), Axie Infinity (AXS), and COTI (COTI), are securities in its lawsuits against leading crypto exchanges <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/3-most-serious-claims-in-the-sec-lawsuit-v-binance/" data-wpel-link="internal">Binance</a> and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-was-aware-it-violated-us-securities-laws-claims-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">Coinbase</a>.</p>
<p>However, the outcome of the Ripple-SEC case could have a ripple effect (pun intended) on these tokens facing scrutiny. These projects might draw inspiration from Ripple&#8217;s successful defense strategy. They may be motivated to challenge regulatory allegations, potentially strengthening their positions and asserting their tokens&#8217; non-security status.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Ripple&#8217;s legal triumph could pave the way for increased clarity and regulatory certainty in the industry. Judge Torres&#8217; ruling could provide a legal precedent that helps establish a clearer framework for distinguishing between securities and non-securities in the digital asset space. This would thus benefit other tokens that have been grappling with regulatory uncertainty.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ripple&#8217;s win over the SEC is undoubtedly a positive development for the entire crypto industry. However, this does not mean that regulatory scrutiny will dissipate entirely. The agency will likely continue scrutinizing other tokens and projects for potential securities violations.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Ripple case could prompt regulators to refine their approach, conduct more nuanced investigations, and provide clearer guidelines for token issuers to ensure compliance.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Aside from XRP, MATIC, LTC, and BCH are the other big losers on a daily scale.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After marking a new 13-month high yesterday at almost $32,000, bitcoin has been rejected once again and even dipped below $30,000 hours ago.</p>
<p>Most altcoins are also in the red today following the recent gains, except for DOGE, SHIB, OP, and a few others.</p>
<h2>BTC Stopped</h2>
<p>Most of the working week went by <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-tumbles-toward-30k-kava-crashes-12-daily-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">quietly</a> for the primary cryptocurrency as the asset spent it trading sideways in a tight range between $30,000 and $31,000. All that, however, changed on Thursday evening when Judge Torres, presiding over the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/history-in-the-making-with-ripple-scoring-massive-win-in-court-in-xrp-security-case-this-weeks-recap/" data-wpel-link="internal">ruled in favor</a> of the blockchain company in regard to its native cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>BTC, along with the rest of the market, went on the offensive and spiked to just under $31,900 (on Bitstamp), which became the asset&#8217;s highest price tag in over a year.</p>
<p>However, bitcoin couldn&#8217;t maintain that run and quickly retraced by a grand. The landscape <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-slides-back-to-30k-amid-245-million-in-liquidations/" data-wpel-link="internal">worsened</a> yesterday evening as BTC dumped hard and slipped below $30,000 for the first time in a week.</p>
<p>Despite bouncing off that level and currently sitting a few hundred dollars above it, bitcoin is still 3% down on the day. Its market capitalization has tumbled to $590 billion after exceeding $610 billion yesterday. Its dominance over the alts sits at almost the same spot as yesterday at 48.4%.</p>

<h2>XRP Loses Some Momentum</h2>
<p>As expected, Ripple&#8217;s native token was the most significant gainer after the judge&#8217;s ruling. It skyrocketed by almost 100% at one point and tapped $0.95 for the first time since December 2021, leaving millions of shorts <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/220m-in-shorts-liquidated-as-ripple-xrp-explodes-to-19-month-high-following-victory-over-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">liquidated</a>.</p>
<p>However, it couldn&#8217;t maintain its run, either, and fell back down to $0.8 yesterday. Another 8% daily retracement has pushed it back down to $0.72 as of now. Similar losses come from Litecoin, Polygon, Bitcoin Cash, Polygon, and others.</p>
<p>ETH, BNB, ADA, SOL, DOT, and TRX are also in the red from the larger-cap alts. The two largest memecoins are among the few exceptions in the green, as both DOGE and SHIB are up by around 5% daily.</p>
<p>Optimism&#8217;s OP has soared by 7.5% in the past 24 hours and has reclaimed $1.5.</p>
<p>The total crypto market, though, is down by over $30 billion since yesterday to $1.220 trillion on CMC.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lawyers representing Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) requested Judge Lewis Kaplan to issue an order permitting certain people to visit their client without the necessity of security checks.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite being allowed to reside at his parents&#8217; house, the former CEO of FTX is subject to strict restrictions. He must wear an electronic monitoring bracelet, while a security guard must be present should he invite guests.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SBF&#8217;s Wish</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bankman-Fried&#8217;s attorneys sent an official </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66631291/174/united-states-v-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">letter</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to New York District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan, asking the magistrates to enable people from their client&#8217;s inner cycle, dubbed as &#8220;close friends,&#8221; to meet him at his parents&#8217; house in Palo Alto, California. They insisted that such gatherings could happen without a security guard being constantly around:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;On behalf of our client, Samuel Bankman-Fried, we write to respectfully request that the Court issue an order permitting the people on the attached list to visit his parents&#8217; house without the need for a security guard to be present.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Apart from &#8220;close friends,&#8221; the list of individuals includes colleagues of Barbara Fried and Joseph Bankman (SBF&#8217;s parents). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The lawyers also requested that the names of those people remain a secret for broad society out of security reasons. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Here, even assuming that the list of people can be considered a &#8220;judicial document,&#8221; the individuals&#8217; privacy and safety interests greatly outweigh any presumption of access to the list and justify protecting their identities from public disclosure,&#8221; the letter reads.</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Not so Peaceful Life for the Family</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Keeping the people&#8217;s identities &#8220;under seal&#8221; might be appropriate since SBF and his parents have previously become a target of violence and harassment. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CryptoPotato</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/a-car-crashed-into-the-barricade-of-sbfs-current-home-lawyers-said/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in January, three men crashed their car into the barricade of the house, telling a security officer:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;You won&#8217;t be able to keep us out.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Subsequently, they got back in the vehicle and drove away without being recognized. The incident happened two months after <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-fall-of-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-a-timeline-of-ftxs-collapse/" data-wpel-link="internal">the implosion of FTX</a>, and shortly after, a New York federal judge </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/sam-bankman-fried-released-on-a-250m-bail-can-stay-at-parents-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">permitted</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> SBF to live with his family under a $250 million bond.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It remained unclear whether the men in the car were fallen investors from the once-prominent exchange looking for revenge for their potential losses. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bankman-Fried faces multiple fraud charges and, according to many regulators and agencies, is the main culprit behind the crash. The October trial will decide whether he was guilty and his eventual punishment. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[This is the last phase before the public launch in early August that will aim to amass more builders. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The team behind Base &#8211; an Ethereum Layer 2 chain built on OP Stack in collaboration with Optimism &#8211; said its mainnet is available for builders to deploy their products. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The entity will release a &#8220;Genesis Builder&#8221; NFT to commemorate those who entered the ecosystem from the get-go. However, it has no intentions of issuing a network token.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Latest Step</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Base </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://base.mirror.xyz/hwNwqXHVoLlO8s4DZppog4DfGvM34tigaDjOWuEJQfY" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">announced</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> its testnet launch in February, which allowed it to connect with &#8220;incredible builders and have watched their projects start to thrive&#8221; on the network, enabling on-chain games, restaurants, communities, and advocacy. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Base mainnet aims to double down on the previous success, providing &#8220;hands-on support&#8221; for developers who deploy products into the ecosystem. The entity revealed that builders could bridge ether (ETH) to Base for gas during this phase by employing the portal proxy contract. &#8220;Do not send any asset other than ETH to the portal proxy contract,&#8221; the team warned. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Various tools, including smart wallet infrastructure, node providers, data indexers, and more, are already live on the mainnet and aim to support the builders&#8217; efforts.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Base highlighted its most recent achievement, assuring it has completed all necessary criteria, such as demonstration of the testnet&#8217;s stability, Optimism&#8217;s successful upgrade of Bedrock, and completion of internal and external audits. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;We&#8217;re grateful for the community&#8217;s patience as we worked through these criteria, and we&#8217;re excited to welcome everyone on to a secure, scalable, and builder-friendly Base,&#8221; it stated.</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What&#8217;s Next?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Base is preparing for a public launch in early August when more users will be permitted to onboard the network. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;With our mainnet GA launch in early August, we&#8217;ll welcome everyday users to feel how on-chain is the next online with a seamless, easy, secure experience across hundreds of products on Base,&#8221; it stated.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Base is empowered by the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. One of its advantages is that it lets users build decentralized apps with access to the platform&#8217;s products, clients, and tools. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The network leverages the underlying security of Ethereum alongside Coinbase&#8217;s experience in the industry to enable consumers to onramp layer 1 and layer 2 blockchain protocols. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Torres raised concerns over the circumstances Prometheum was granted a special purpose broker-dealer license and SEC's role in it. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple&#8217;s partial victory in its fight with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a court ruling paved the way for small but significant regulatory clarity that the cryptocurrency industry was deprived of for so long. Now all eyes are on the security regulator who, according to Congressman Ritchie Torres, is acting like &#8220;an overzealous traffic cop arbitrarily ticketing drivers while keeping the speed limit a secret.&#8221;</p>
<p>As such, Torres wants the SEC to be investigated for its approach to the digital asset industry and accused the regulatory agency&#8217;s boss Gary Gensler of &#8220;politicizing&#8221; the registration process by granting a controversial license to Prometheum.</p>
<h2>SEC Under Scanner for &#8216;Unusual Backroom Deal&#8217;</h2>
<p>Representative Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) drafted requests for two investigations into the license granted by the SEC to Prometheum Ember ATS under unusual circumstances. In the two letters <a href="https://twitter.com/RepRitchie/status/1679534903661301761" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">addressed</a> to &#8211; SEC Inspector General Deborah Jeffrey and Comptroller General Gene Dodaro &#8211; Torres questioned if the issuance of Prometheum&#8217;s Special Purpose Broker-Dealer (SPBD) license was a political ploy by the financial regulator.</p>
<p>Torres wrote,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Prometheum appears to be nothing more than a Potemkin platform, operating as a timely talking point for crypto critics rather than a true trading platform for crypto customers. The dubious decision to license a deceptive digital assets platform reflects the latest attempt by Chair Gary Gensler to politicize the registration process to an extent seldom seen in the SEC’s history.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The SEC has received severe backlash from crypto firms that feel the regulator has tried to aggressively police the market. Apart from a few failed petitions asking for clarity on crypto regulations, the agency has not been yet implicated for its alleged behavior. But that could change.</p>
<p>Torres&#8217; letters highlighted that the watchdog may have acted arbitrarily with its approach to crypto regulation; hence his call for an &#8220;independent review&#8221; of the financial regulator&#8217;s &#8220;haphazard and heavy-handed&#8221; approach to digital assets could prove beneficial in expediating necessary regulation.</p>
<h2>Prometheum Controversy</h2>
<p>The letter follows the issuance of a similar request by the United States-based crypto advocacy group, Blockchain Association, that called for an investigation into crypto firm Prometheum.</p>
<p>Besides pointing out the SPBD license approval, the group requested SEC Inspector General Deborah Jeffrey to look into raised concerns about how the firm&#8217;s CEO, Aaron Kaplan, secured a seat testifying before the US House Financial Services Committee last month.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Eric Adams &#8211; the mayor of New York City &#8211; has reportedly pledged to amend his annual financial disclosure form after failing to include his cryptocurrency stash. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The former police officer is an outspoken proponent of bitcoin and received some of his salaries in BTC instead of fiat currency. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fixing the Mistake</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/14/nyc-mayor-eric-adams-did-not-report-crypto-holdings-in-disclosure-form.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reported</a> by CNBC, Adams asked if he could correct the document filed with the Conflicts of Interest Board since he misunderstood one of the questions.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Asked whether he held any securities, including bonds, stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, or digital currencies with a market value of over $1,000, he responded &#8220;no.&#8221; A spokesman of the mayor, though, said Adams thought the question referred only to securities, which is why he did not mention his bitcoin and ether holdings.<br />
