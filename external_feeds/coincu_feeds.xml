<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Revolut halts U.S. cryptocurrency services due to regulatory changes.</em></li>



<li><em>The suspension starts on September 2, full ban from October 3.</em></li>



<li><em>Revolut responds to evolving U.S. crypto regulations and delists ADA, MATIC, and SOL.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://decrypt.co/151272/revolut-shutter-us-crypto-operations-due-regulatory-environment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Decrypt</a></em>, British digital bank Revolut has declared the suspension of its cryptocurrency services in the United States due to regulatory shifts and uncertainties within the U.S. crypto market.</strong></h5>

<p>Effective September 2, 2023, U.S. customers will no longer be able to place cryptocurrency orders on the platform. The delisting process will conclude by September 18, followed by more extensive restrictions beginning October 3, 2023.</p>



<p>This subsequent stage will enforce a complete ban on U.S. customers accessing cryptocurrencies via <a href="https://coincu.com/198279-exciting-revolut-slashes-trading-fees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Revolut</a>. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that this decision doesn&#8217;t impact Revolut&#8217;s operations outside of the United States. All U.S. crypto customers were notified of this decision through emails from Revolut. </p>



<p>The move reflects the company&#8217;s response to the regulatory environment, particularly the stance of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has categorized many cryptocurrencies as securities, subjecting them to investor protection rules.</p>



<p>The SEC has intensified its stance, asserting that a significant portion of cryptocurrencies are to be treated as securities, thus making them subject to investor protection regulations. </p>



<p>This regulatory push reached a turning point in early June when the <a href="https://coincu.com/206974-sec-and-binance-unite-to-thwart-eeon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a> took legal action against major crypto exchanges <a href="https://coincu.com/208303-coinbase-seek-full-dismissal-of-sec-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> and <a href="https://coincu.com/208039-binance-may-be-accused-of-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a>. </p>



<p>The regulatory body accused them of neglecting to register multiple cryptocurrencies as securities. It&#8217;s noteworthy that both exchanges have refuted these allegations.</p>



<p>Revolut&#8217;s quick response included the removal of Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC) after the SEC&#8217;s classification of these tokens as securities. The company&#8217;s actions are aligned with broader industry discussions and actions in response to evolving regulatory pressures.</p>



<p>While Revolut&#8217;s cryptocurrency services suspension applies solely to the U.S. market, the decision underscores the intricate challenges faced by companies navigating the evolving regulatory landscape of the cryptocurrency sector.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>South Korean prosecutors seized two companies linked to the alleged counterfeit circulation of virtual asset WEMIX by game company WeMade.</em></li>



<li><em>Accusations involve large-scale WEMIX sales without user disclosure.</em></li>



<li><em>Probe highlights regulatory challenges in the virtual asset sector amid concerns about fraud.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.digitalasset.works/news/articleView.html?idxno=3719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Asset</a></em>, South Korea&#8217;s Seoul Southern District Prosecutor&#8217;s Office has taken action against two companies on August 3 and 4 as part of an ongoing investigation into the alleged counterfeit circulation of virtual asset WEMIX.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-278.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-278.png" alt="WEMIX Scandal Escalates: South Korean Authorities Seize 2 Companies Involved" class="wp-image-208390" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-278.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-278-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-278-768x404.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-278-750x394.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="WEMIX Scandal Escalates: South Korean Authorities Seize 2 Companies Involved 2"></a></figure></div>


<p><a href="https://coincu.com/206801-wemade-investigated-for-wemix-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WeMade</a>, a listed game company, is at the center of the probe. The companies implicated in the large-scale liquidation of WEMIX have not been officially disclosed.</p>



<p>The Prosecutor&#8217;s Office is looking into accusations that WeMade sold substantial amounts of <a href="https://coincu.com/151067-korea-participating-in-listing-delisting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WEMIX</a> through these companies, potentially without proper user disclosure. </p>



<p>This follows a previous search and seizure operation involving WeMade and its CEO Jang Hyun-Duk, on June 30, indicating a significant escalation in the investigation.</p>



<p>The companies under scrutiny are Company A, affiliated with Algorith Capital, a virtual asset management firm with an office in Seoul&#8217;s Gangnam-daero, and another virtual asset investment company in Jung-gu, Seoul. </p>



<p>Notably, Algorith Capital&#8217;s Korean corporation is not a government-registered virtual asset manager.</p>



<p>WeMade&#8217;s alleged large-scale liquidation of WEMIX between November 2020 and January 2022 without informing users and subsequent use of funds for mergers and acquisitions raised concerns. The controversy underscored the necessity of effective virtual asset regulation.</p>



<p>According to the previous report, South Korean authorities have initiated a <a href="https://coincu.com/185781-korean-investigated-800k-wemix-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full mandatory investigation</a> into the market maker of WeMade. </p>



<p>The search and seizure were carried out in response to a complaint filed with prosecutors on May 12 by WEMIX investors, who accused the firm of fraud, embezzlement, and breach of trust.</p>



<p>The investigation&#8217;s scope broadened due to a complaint by WEMIX investors, accusing WeMade of fraud, embezzlement, and breach of trust. The case highlights the ongoing challenges associated with ensuring transparency and accountability in the virtual asset sector.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bitwise files for two Ethereum futures ETFs, joining twelve total applications.</em></li>



<li><em>ETFs offer Bitcoin and Ether exposure through market cap and equal-weight strategies.</em></li>



<li><em>Six other companies also apply for Ethereum futures ETFs, reflecting rising demand.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitwise has recently filed for two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) related to Ethereum futures, adding to the growing count of such applications.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-268.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-268-1024x538.png" alt="Bitwise Joins The Race With 2 Ether Futures ETFs, SEC Now Has Totaling 12 Applications" class="wp-image-208369" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-268-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-268-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-268-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-268-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-268-1140x599.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-268.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bitwise Joins The Race With 2 Ether Futures ETFs, SEC Now Has Totaling 12 Applications 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>The company&#8217;s latest products include the &#8220;Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Market Cap Weight Strategy ETF&#8221; and the previously announced &#8220;Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF,&#8221; according to an <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1687307603922055168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement</a> by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart.</p>



<p>The &#8220;Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Market Cap Weight Strategy ETF&#8221; aims to offer exposure to Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts based on their respective market capitalization, without directly investing in the cryptocurrencies themselves. </p>



<p>Managed by Bitwise Investment Manager and Vident Advisory, the ETF&#8217;s allocation between Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts is determined by their market cap and rebalanced monthly.</p>



<p>Both ETFs primarily invest in cash-settled, front-month futures contracts, with potential inclusion of back-month contracts. The filing highlights the standardized, cash-settled nature of these futures contracts, traded on the <a href="https://coincu.com/199001-cme-group-provides-single-trade-solution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)</a>.</p>



<p>With the addition of Bitwise&#8217;s applications, the total number of Ethereum futures ETF filings reaches twelve, indicating the continued interest in this financial product. </p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://coincu.com/208301-surge-of-ether-futures-etf-floods-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, Proshares and Bitwise have jointly submitted three futures ETF applications related to &#8220;Bitcoin and Ethereum&#8221; to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). </p>



<p>Additionally, Direxion has submitted its own &#8220;Direxion Bitcoin Ether Strategy ETF&#8221; application. Six other companies have also filed applications for Ethereum futures ETFs, including Volatility Shares, Roundhill, VanEck, <a href="https://coincu.com/206678-grayscale-sec-concurrent-approval-bitcoin-etfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grayscale</a>, and Proshares. </p>



<p>The SEC is expected to make a decision on these applications by October 16, with a separate deadline of October 11 for the Volatility Shares application. </p>



<p>The surge in applications reflects the growing demand for cryptocurrency-related investment products and the continued development of the crypto-financial market.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Offchain Labs has released BOLD, permissionless validation for Arbitrum chains.</em></li>



<li><em>BOLD is a huge technical achievement that makes the Arbitrum chain more secure than ever.</em></li>



<li><em>There are a few more steps to complete before the BOLD is ready for production.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to the official <a href="https://offchain.medium.com/bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum-chains-9934eb5328cc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog</a>, the Arbitrum Offchain Labs development team announced the launch of a permissionless verification protocol Bounded Liquidity Delay (BOLD) to resolve Rollup disputes. </strong></h5>

<p>BOLD enables the <a href="https://coincu.com/206210-arbitrum-goerli-testnet-launched-on-substancex/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arbitrum</a> technology chain to ensure the security and vitality of the chain, minimizing delays in condition resolution and preventing dishonest parties from increasing the costs of honest parties. This verification method provides a fixed upper limit of 7 days for additional confirmation delays without being subject to delay attacks.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BOLD is a massive technical accomplishment, making Arbitrum chains more secure than ever.<br><br>But it&#39;s an equally bold statement about what we value at <a href="https://twitter.com/OffchainLabs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@OffchainLabs</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://t.co/n2Qz2QYnWm" target="_blank">https://t.co/n2Qz2QYnWm</a></p>&mdash; Steven Goldfeder (<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f499.png" alt="💙" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />,<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9e1.png" alt="🧡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) (@sgoldfed) <a href="https://twitter.com/sgoldfed/status/1687199191204798464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August 3, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>BOLD code and specs are now available on Github. There are a few more steps that need to be completed before the BOLD is ready to use:</p>



<ol>
<li>Share instructions for running Arbitrum Nitro development with the BOLD challenge in the coming weeks;</li>



<li>Publish official proof-of-concept code for BOLD written in the Isabelle programming language and Complete the academic paper;</li>



<li>A new test network environment will be made available to BOLD for community participation;</li>



<li>If there is positive feedback from the community, plan to prepare the AIP so that the DAO can decide whether to adopt this new protocol in Arbitrum One and Nova.</li>
</ol>



<p>As stated by Offchain Labs, Arbitrum Technology has always been built with security as a top concern. And that&#8217;s why they invest a lot of resources to build and improve the fraud proof system.</p>



<p>The protocol can help securely validate the Arbitrum chain without permission, taking them up the ladder of decentralization. This approach allows a single, honest validator to win Ethereum disputes against any opponent.</p>

</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) continues to assert that FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried should be &#8220;detained pending trial&#8221; due to his sharing of former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison&#8217;s diary with the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>CoinDesk</em> <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/04/sam-bankman-fried-likely-faces-jail-as-doj-pushes-for-incarceration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>.</strong></h5>

<p>In their latest filing, the DOJ emphasizes that Bankman-Fried&#8217;s defense does not deny the act, and they view it as an attempt to &#8220;corruptly influence witnesses.&#8221;</p>



<p>The ongoing legal battle between Bankman-Fried&#8217;s attorneys and the prosecutors centers around the extent of his actions and their implications.</p>



<p>The DOJ <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939.188.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contends</a> that Bankman-Fried went beyond a mere &#8220;fair comment&#8221; when sharing the diary, and they cite his use of a VPN to watch the Super Bowl and reaching out to FTX.US General Counsel Ryne Miller as additional evidence of his misconduct.</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s defense has <a href="https://coincu.com/207851-bankman-fried-fights-against-jail-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued</a> that the government is mischaracterizing his actions, stating that he sought to defend his reputation in the press and did not initially contact Miller.</p>



<p>However, the DOJ maintains its position, suggesting that <a href="https://coincu.com/206847-sam-bankman-fried-seeks-seal-caroline-ellisons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bankman-Fried</a> may have orchestrated media attention around <a href="https://coincu.com/204571-former-alameda-co-ceo-admits-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ellison</a> ahead of her acting as a witness.</p>



<p>The filing also reveals that he had set up Signal groups to delete messages after a week, raising further concerns about potential evidence tampering.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939.187.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">objected</a> to gag orders imposed on Bankman-Fried, arguing that such restrictions must adhere to legal standards and protect the public&#8217;s First Amendment right to be informed about FTX&#8217;s collapse and alleged mismanagement.</p>



<p>The case, overseen by Judge Lewis Kaplan in the Southern District of New York, remains a subject of ongoing discussion, with the possibility of further hearings to address the filings. </p>



<p>The legal battle highlights the complexities and potential consequences surrounding the sharing of sensitive information and its impact on the judicial process.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Curve Finance, Metronome, and Alchemix give hacker ultimatum after DeFi platform attack.</em></li>



<li><em>The hacker offered a 10% reward for returning stolen funds before the August 6 deadline.</em></li>



<li><em>Legal action and public reward are promised if the hacker does not comply.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Curve Finance, together with Metronome and Alchemix, has taken an unconventional approach to dealing with the recent attack on their platform that sent shockwaves through the DeFi community.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-263.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="676" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-263.png" alt="Curve, Metronome, And Alchemix Issue Ultimatum To Hacker With 10% Bounty" class="wp-image-208328" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-263.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-263-300x198.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-263-768x507.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-263-750x495.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Curve, Metronome, And Alchemix Issue Ultimatum To Hacker With 10% Bounty 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>In an unprecedented move, they sent an on-chain ultimatum to the attacker responsible for the breach.</p>



<p>Through a <a href="https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1687180381714358272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter announcement</a>, <a href="https://coincu.com/208104-curve-finance-stops-crv-rewards-pools-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Curve</a> offered the attacker a <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc45e47f6e7d3e74763032e2fb991fa9a003d8ed55c13c93c6a5368ff322d7742" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deal</a> &#8211; they would reward the hacker with 10% of the lost assets if they agreed to return the remaining 90% of the hacked funds to the project. </p>



<p>The proposal came with a deadline, set for August 6 at 08:00 UTC, giving the hacker a limited window to respond and return the funds.</p>



<p>In the event that the hacker fails to comply with the ultimatum, Curve, Metronome, and Alchemix <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6264cc2827b0598ec7d8c0f549238c2a96a795cfde8c5ac4dcf77021c75adf0c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made</a> it clear that they would take legal action to pursue the culprit and retrieve the stolen money. </p>



<p>Additionally, they pledged to publicly offer a reward to anyone who can provide information leading to the hacker&#8217;s arrest and conviction.</p>



<p>To assure the attacker, the trio promised no further legal actions or involvement of law enforcement if the funds were returned as per their offer. The goal is to recover the majority of the funds and hold the hacker accountable without resorting to traditional legal channels.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“You will have no risk of us pursuing this further, no risk of law enforcement issues, etc.,&#8221; says the message.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The attack on Curve Finance, which occurred within the past 24 hours, <a href="https://coincu.com/207193-curve-finances-liquidity-pools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targeted</a> a series of stablepool pools using the Vyper 0.2.15 programming language. The seriousness of the attack prompted this unconventional response from the affected projects.</p>

<p>OpenSea has been a mainstay of the NFT industry, historically accounting for the majority of organic NFT transaction volume. Although it was overtaken by rival Blur earlier this year and its encrypted trading offers, with its reputation, Opensea remains the top NFT platform of choice for traders.</p>



<p>The Layer 2 Network from Coinbase has announced that the launch of the common access mainnet will take place on August 9.</p>



<p>Base says its network will host more than 50 &#8220;top brands, platforms, markets, artists and creators&#8221; at launch, including Coca-Cola, Atari and OpenSea. The team will also celebrate the launch with the &#8220;Onchain Summer&#8221; campaign, which includes daily NFT rewards for users.</p>



<p>The memecoin transaction boom <a href="https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">propelled</a> Base to 3rd place in the most active Layer 2, processing almost 7.6 transactions per second (TPS). However, a series of drag disasters &#8211; including from the network&#8217;s top memecoin, BALD &#8211; have since caused activity to drop, with Base now ranked eighth with an average TPS of 2.2 over the past day.</p>



<p>LeetSwap, the network&#8217;s most popular DEX, also briefly halted trading after losing $625,000 in a single mine on Tuesday, causing volumes on the network to continue to decline.</p>

<p>In addition to these filings, <a href="https://coincu.com/101707-proshares-bitcoin-etf-trades-for-35-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ProShares</a> has lodged four separate applications for Ether-based ETFs, which include a dual Bitcoin and Ether futures strategy ETF, a short Ether Strategy ETF, and an Ether Strategy ETF.</p>



<p>The trend of Ether-related ETF applications commenced with Volatility Shares, which filed for the &#8220;Volatility Shares Ether Strategy ETF&#8221; on July 28. </p>



<p>Subsequently, several other prominent players like Bitwise Asset Management, Roundhill Financial, Van Eck, and <a href="https://coincu.com/206678-grayscale-sec-concurrent-approval-bitcoin-etfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grayscale Investments</a> have also jumped on board and filed new Ether futures applications on August 1.</p>



<p>In a span of less than a week, a total of 11 filings for Ether-based ETFs have been submitted, signaling the growing interest in crypto investment products.</p>



<p>Currently, the U.S. only permits investment in Bitcoin futures ETFs, which are backed by bitcoin derivatives. </p>



<p>The flurry of recent filings indicates the increasing desire for a <a href="https://coincu.com/207975-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-odds-surge-to-65/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spot Bitcoin ETF</a> to be approved, sparking excitement within the crypto investment community.</p>



<p>As the SEC navigates through these applications, market participants eagerly await the potential approval of Ether-based ETFs, which could further fuel the adoption and accessibility of cryptocurrencies for investors.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Coinbase to file for lawsuit dismissal, confident of winning.</em></li>



<li><em>SEC sued Coinbase for unregistered securities trading.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange beats revenue expectations and aims for regulatory clarity.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coinbase is set to <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1687197491098492928" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take action</a> against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by filing an order seeking dismissal of the lawsuit on August 4.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/coinbase-header-1024x576.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/coinbase-header-1024x576.jpg" alt="coinbase header" class="wp-image-208307" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/coinbase-header-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/coinbase-header-300x169.jpg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/coinbase-header-768x432.jpg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/coinbase-header-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/coinbase-header-750x422.jpg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/coinbase-header-1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/coinbase-header.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Coinbase Plans To Seek Full Dismissal Of SEC Lawsuit From Court This Friday 9"></a></figure></div>


<p>The company&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, conveyed confidence in their defense during the second-quarter earnings call held on August 3.</p>



<p>Grewal emphasized that <a href="https://coincu.com/207917-coinbase-promises-to-integrate-lightning-network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> would argue against the allegations, asserting that they did not list securities on their platform. </p>



<p>Additionally, he highlighted that the SEC lacks regulatory authority over cryptocurrency exchanges and had not indicated any requirement for registration when Coinbase&#8217;s registration statement was deemed effective in April 2021.</p>



<p>The company&#8217;s Chief Executive, <a href="https://coincu.com/186979-coinbase-ceo-made-million-security-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brian Armstrong</a>, also spoke out against the SEC&#8217;s approach, criticizing its regulation by enforcement tactic instead of participating in rulemaking.</p>



<p>Despite the ongoing legal battle, the exchange reported impressive second-quarter earnings on Thursday, exceeding analysts&#8217; expectations with a revenue of $708 million. However, the company did report a loss of $0.42 per share for the same period.</p>



<p>The legal battle between Coinbase and the SEC ensued in June when the regulator accused the exchange of trading at least 13 crypto assets without proper registration as securities. </p>



<p>Along with its rival <a href="https://coincu.com/208211-binance-reaches-150-million-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a>, Coinbase allegedly operated as an unregistered securities exchange, leading to the SEC&#8217;s legal action.</p>



<p>Looking forward, the exchange aims to collaborate with the SEC and lawmakers to establish clearer regulatory guidelines in the cryptocurrency space. The exchange hopes to emerge victorious in the court case and subsequently work towards a more transparent and compliant ecosystem.</p>



<p>As Coinbase prepares to submit its motion for dismissal, the court is expected to review the arguments put forth by the company in October. </p>



<p>This development comes amidst the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulations, which remains a critical area of concern for market participants and regulators alike.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Asset allocation in Curve 3pool was unbalanced as a series of traders sold off USDT in favor of USDC and DAI.</strong></h5>

<p>Massive traders sold off Tether in key stablecoin pools on Curve and UniSwap yesterday. Shortly after, USDT recoiled to $0.9976 and was <a href="https://coincu.com/198455-tusd-depeg-trueusd-reserves-audited-by-ftx-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">depeg</a> below the $1 anchor for a long time.</p>



<p>Many people have exited/sold USDT to run to other stablecoins, causing the pools to fall into a severe imbalance. According to 3pool data, the USDT balance has now skyrocketed to 59.3% in Curve 3pool, which includes USDT, USDC, and DAI, while USDC and DAI account for only 20.3% and 20.8% of total assets in the pool.</p>

<p>Right after USDT went strong, Paolo Ardoino, Tether&#8217;s Chief Technology Officer, suggested that this may be a foul play. The community is also eyeing Hong Kong-based First Digital&#8217;s new stablecoin FDUSD, which Binance quickly backed recently.</p>



<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it interesting that USDt is being pressured down (slightly, within 10bps, just to push market makers to react), and USDc, the main competitor that you would expect to gain from the situation, is redeemed nevertheless heavily, while suddenly a competitor born 2 hours ago is getting it all? Exactly! It feels definitely organic and not manipulative at all. Some people never learn.&#8221; He wrote.</p>



<p>The Curve and Uniswap pools are popular places for traders to swap stablecoins quickly. Most of the time, the tokens are balanced in the pool. The imbalance shows that the market is in trouble as investors seek to dump an asset in bulk. Similar imbalances occurred when Terra crashed in May 2022 and the Silicon Valley banking crisis hit USDC Circle Issuers in March of this year.</p>
