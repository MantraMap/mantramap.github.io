A noteworthy development has occurred in regulating the United States’ crypto space as a House Committee has approved a bill to bring clarity into the industry.  On July 26, the U.S House Financial Services Committee approved the Financial Innovation and Technology Act for the 21st Century Act, popularly known as FIT21. #PASSED: In a historic first, the House Financial Services Committee just advanced the BIPARTISAN FIT for the 21st Century Act to protect consumers and provide clear rules of the road for the digital asset ecosystem.

Although Armstrong believed the bill would likely be modified as it passes the complete legislative process, its approval by the House Committee was vital to safeguard the crypto space, “American innovation and national security.” Related Reading: New Crypto Bill Demands SEC And CFTC To Draft Rules For Trading Platforms The FIT21 Act &#8211; A  Landmark Legislation For U.S. Crypto Space?  The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Act was recently introduced to the House on July 20.  In the Act’s introductory statements, Representative French Hill, who serves as Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion, referred to the bill as a “landmark legislation” critical to creating an efficient regulatory framework to safeguard crypto users&#8217; interests. The U.S. House Representative further stated that this bill would have prevented the FTX crisis and provided much-needed clarity in crypto. Hill said: This legislation would not only have prevented FTX from stealing billions of customer funds, but also establishes robust consumer protections and clear rules of the road for market participants.  In addition, the FIT21 Act will enhance cooperation between the two financial regulators trying to assume control of the U.S. crypto market. U.S. Representative Dusty Johnson, another sponsor of the bill, emphasized this motion saying: The crypto industry wants clarity and our collaborative bill gives both the CFTC and SEC a seat at the table. Our bill establishes clear principles to ensure financial security and certainty as digital asset developers continue to innovate.
