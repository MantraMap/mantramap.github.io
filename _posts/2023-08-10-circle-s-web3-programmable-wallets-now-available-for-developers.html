<p>Prominent stablecoin issuer Circle announces the launch of its Web3 Programmable Wallets public beta version for developers on three blockchains.</p>
The First Product of Circle&rsquo;s Web3 Services Line
<p>On Tuesday, August 8, 2023, global fintech company Circle, known for its USDC stablecoin, announced the launch of Programmable Wallets, the first product of the platform&rsquo;s Web3 Services product line. The public beta version of Programmable Wallets is now available for businesses, developers, and builders. The product currently supports Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche networks, with other chains coming soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Programmable Wallets allows developers to seamlessly integrate secure crypto wallets into any application, thus expediting the adoption of Web3 and blockchain technologies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;​​Programmable Wallets bridge the gap between today&rsquo;s internet and blockchain networks by abstracting complexities such as private key security, blockchain node operations, transaction management, interoperability across blockchains, and many others to enable developers to iterate on applications faster,&rdquo; reads the statement on the Circle&rsquo;s website.</p>

<p>One of Programmable Wallets&rsquo; key features is that it gives developers the freedom to customize the crypto wallet experience to best fit their use case. This helps greatly increase customer satisfaction because different types of apps (DeFi, games, e-commerce, etc.) will use their crypto wallet in different ways.</p>
<p>Programmable Wallets offers a self-service, end-to-end solution, enabling developers to register, build, and implement their first wallets and transactions within minutes. The developer console provides all the necessary tools for debugging, launching, and scaling Web3 applications.</p>
<p>According to the company&rsquo;s press release, these are the core features of Programmable Wallets:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">User-controlled wallets: gives end-users full control of their assets;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Developer-controlled wallets: allows developers manage assets on behalf of users;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">REST APIs manage both user-controlled and developer-controlled wallets;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">iOS and Android SDKs speed up development processes and facilitate wallet UI customization;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Webhooks keep users updated on their incoming or outgoing transactions;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Wallet operations dashboard enables developers to monitor transactions;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Multiparty computation (MPC) is a built-in cryptographic security configuration;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Blockchains Agnostic allows to build a wallet once and use it across different blockchains;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Pay-as-you-grow provides a rebate on USDC usage, starting at $0.05/Monthly Active Wallet.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Other features such as Gas Abstraction and Smart Contract Wallets should be rolled out shortly.</p>
Circle Expands the Range of Its Web3 Solutions
<p>Earlier this year, Circle launched a Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) to allow permissionless transfers of USDC natively across supported blockchains. A couple of months later, the platform announced the operationalization of its CCTP on Arbitrum, a Layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum network, with the aim to make the USDC transfers faster and more secure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With USDC, CCTP, Programmable Wallets, and our broader Web3 Services offering, our goal is to make it easy for developers to rapidly build, deploy, and scale blockchain-powered apps for a variety of use cases, regardless of the blockchain network they choose to build on,&rdquo; the Senior Director of Product Management at Circle, Gagan Mac, wrote in the statement. </p>
