										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The past June has been quite a smooth journey for the crypto market as Bitcoin has regained its important $30,000 mark. However, altcoins do not seem to show signs of a strong recovery like in April. Besides, some upcoming unlocking of some tokens could cause price fluctuations. Let&#8217;s find out with Coincu about the major token unlocks that will take place in July.</strong></h5>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">DYDX</h2>



<p>DYDX is still hanging onto its gains from the June lows. This suggests that you are likely to see more gains, particularly if you can increase investor confidence. 6,520,128 tokens will be unlocked in July corresponding to $13,170,659 and 0.652% of total supply.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">APE</h2>



<p>Notwithstanding the uncertainty that APE investors are experiencing, there is newfound optimism for them as a new hybrid token offers incredible potential for big returns. This has piqued the interest of APE investors, who are now reducing their losses and shifting their focus to the hybrid meme currency, which is expected to provide a 20,000% Return for investors by the end of 2023. This large outflow of APE whales is a big contributor to the APE coin&#8217;s continuous price decline. 15,601,326 tokens will be unlocked in July corresponding to $34,322,917 and 1.56% of total supply.</p>

Nonetheless, the positive impetus seems to be fading. 3,425,625 tokens will be unlocked in July corresponding to $20,793,544 and 1,269% of total supply.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">An attacker exploiting Huobi’s mistakes would have had the opportunity to carry out the largest crypto theft in history. The company has previously reported handling over a billion dollars a day in trading volume. If Huobi hadn’t taken action, this breach could have been leveraged to steal user accounts and assets. The company deleted the compromised account and their users are no longer at risk.</p>
<cite>Aaron Phillips wrote in a blog <a href="https://phillips.technology/blog/huobi-crypto-aws/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://phillips.technology/blog/huobi-crypto-aws/" rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Huobi has confirmed the incident and stated that it was caused by the irregular operation of relevant personnel in the S3 barrel of the test environment of the Japanese station. The relevant user information was completely isolated on October 8, 2022.</p>



<p>After the incident was discovered by the white hat team, Huobi&#8217;s security team took action on June 21, 2023, and immediately closed the relevant file access permissions. The vulnerability has been fixed, and all relevant user information has been deleted. Huobi has thanked the White Hat team for their contributions to its security.</p>



<p>Huobi’s updated response stated that the OTC data mentioned in the article is not real transaction data, but test data. The user information leak only involves 4,000 users. The log shows that only the white hat team has downloaded the data, and the team has also stated that they have deleted it. Therefore, no actual leakage has occurred.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Coinbase will also supply services for Valkyrie and Bitwise's bitcoin spot ETF, according to individuals familiar with the situation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Coinbase partners with Valkyrie, Bitwise, and others for Bitcoin ETF services, potentially boosting revenue amid low crypto-exchange volumes.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange&#8217;s role as custody and market monitoring provider addresses fraud concerns, crucial for SEC approval of Bitcoin ETFs.</em></li>



<li><em>Fidelity and other firms include Coinbase in revised filings, highlighting the significance of monitoring mechanisms for SEC approval and increasing token values.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-30/fidelity-leads-flurry-of-bitcoin-btc-etf-refilings-to-answer-sec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>, Coinbase will also supply services for Valkyrie and Bitwise&#8217;s bitcoin spot ETF, according to individuals familiar with the situation.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1_cCe3FwIHV9YzyALH0znmKg.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1_cCe3FwIHV9YzyALH0znmKg-1024x682.jpeg" alt="Coinbase To Support Valkyrie And Bitwise Bitcoin Spot ETFs: Report" class="wp-image-199351" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1_cCe3FwIHV9YzyALH0znmKg-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1_cCe3FwIHV9YzyALH0znmKg-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1_cCe3FwIHV9YzyALH0znmKg-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1_cCe3FwIHV9YzyALH0znmKg-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1_cCe3FwIHV9YzyALH0znmKg-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1_cCe3FwIHV9YzyALH0znmKg.jpeg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Coinbase To Support Valkyrie And Bitwise Bitcoin Spot ETFs: Report 9"></a></figure></div>


<p>Coinbase&#8217;s partnership with the planned ETFs might result in an increase in income at a time when the crypto-exchange sector is experiencing low volumes. Coinbase&#8217;s revenue last year was less than half of what it was in 2021, when the sector was booming. The announcement also comes amid Coinbase&#8217;s legal fight with the SEC, which accused the company of operating an unlawful exchange.</p>



<p>Coinbase will become the custody-sharing agreement partner of Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, according to <a href="https://coincu.com/199318-cboe-updates-bitcoin-etf-spot-profile-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent reporting</a>.</p>



<p>Fidelity Investments led a flurry of corporations that submitted a second batch of applications for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund on Friday afternoon to add additional information after the US Securities and Exchange Commission suggested that the earlier files were inadequate.</p>



<p>The companies are among eight that are attempting to establish the first generation of US spot Bitcoin ETFs. In mid-June, BlackRock Inc. surprised the market by registering for such a fund.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-12.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-12-1024x682.png" alt="Coinbase To Support Valkyrie And Bitwise Bitcoin Spot ETFs: Report" class="wp-image-199353" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-12-1024x682.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-12-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-12-768x511.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-12-750x499.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-12-1140x759.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-12.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Coinbase To Support Valkyrie And Bitwise Bitcoin Spot ETFs: Report 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>All five that refiled on Friday said that Coinbase Global Inc. would offer market monitoring in support of their funds, which was not included in prior revisions.</p>



<p>Crypto market monitoring might be crucial in obtaining SEC clearance for a spot Bitcoin ETF. The monitoring may significantly minimize fraud and market manipulation, which have been the primary reasons the SEC has rejected about 30 spot Bitcoin ETF applications so far.</p>



<p>According to a source familiar with the subject who was not allowed to talk publicly about the arrangements, Coinbase is also in line to supply different services for the other planned fund issuers. These firms, in addition to BlackRock, include Valkyrie and Bitwise. In a recent filing, 21Shares said that Coinbase would also offer custody services.</p>



<p>The crypto community is ecstatic at the possibility of cryptocurrency possibly becoming more accessible to average investors, and the surge of filings has boosted token values.</p>



<p>Bitcoin reclaimed the $30,000 mark in June and is trading at nearly its highest levels in almost a year. The coin is now worth roughly $30,400.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The publisher of the CryptoZoo NFT scam project, Logan Paul, has yet to fulfill his promise to return $1.8 million to investors over the past six months.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Logan Paul still hasn&#8217;t refunded the buyer of his scam NFT project after six months of promises.</em></li>



<li><em>In January, Logan Paul pledged to burn ZOO tokens and refund $1.8 million to CryptoZoo NFT buyers.</em></li>



<li><em>In 2021, CryptoZoo NFT was released with ZOO token, but this game has yet to come to fruition.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The publisher of the CryptoZoo NFT scam project, <a href="https://coincu.com/158092-logan-paul-sue-coffeezilla-cryptozoo-scam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Logan Paul</a>, has yet to fulfill his promise to return $1.8 million to investors over the past six months.</strong></h5>



<p>YouTuber Logan Paul faced intense backlash six months ago for allegedly scamming his audience with an NFT gaming project called CryptoZoo, which was proposed in 2021. Paul and his crew were given ZOO tokens and sold NFT, but the game was never completed.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Paul posted a video on 13 outlining his &#8220;three-step plan&#8221; right after receiving criticism to set things from YouTube investigators in January like Stephen &#8220;Coffeezilla&#8221; Findeisen became true. A month later, a class-action complaint was filed against the influencer, alleging that Paul and his crew had duped and taken advantage of CryptoZoo purchasers.</p>



<p>In Coffeezilla&#8217;s latest video, he shared a screenshot of an email communication with Paul&#8217;s attorney, Jeffrey Neiman of the law firm MNR, which seems to suggest that a specific plan has yet to be established. No refunds have yet been made to the affected investors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="jeg_video_container jeg_video_content"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Logan Paul&#039;s Scam Isn&#039;t Over" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uYYiypp6WaY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>&#8220;According to the victims, there [have] been zero payments. There&#8217;s no excuse for this. Logan made a public statement about this, took credit for it, and has ghosted the victims,&#8221; Coffeezilla said.</p>



<p>As alleged by Coffeezilla, Paul once promised to deposit all of their ZOO tokens into a burning wallet so that the tokens would be effectively destroyed. After that, they can only profit from their ZOO tokens. However, upon examining the official ZOO contract detailed in the token&#8217;s white paper, there is no clear evidence that Paul or Levin burned any of their ZOOs. According to BSC Scan data, no significant ZOO token burns from one or two wallet addresses have occurred since January 2023.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Paul has yet to post a response on YouTube or Twitter.</p>

<p>In a June 30 announcement, fintech firm GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corporation said its shareholders approved the merger so that the company would act as a special-purpose acquisition company for Bitcoin Depot. The deal, first reported in August 2022, is worth $885 million.</p>



<p>The combined company will be renamed Bitcoin Depot Inc. and will be led by the current management team. Bitcoin Depot common stock and public warrants are scheduled to begin trading on July 3, 2023 on Nasdaq under the tickers &#8220;BTM&#8221; and &#8220;BTMWW,&#8221; respectively.</p>



<p>Bitcoin Depot was founded in 2016 with a mission to connect those who prefer to use cash with the broader digital financial system. The company provides users with simple, efficient, and intuitive means to convert some money into Bitcoin, which users can deploy in the payments, spending, and investing space. The company has the largest market share in North America, with approximately 6,440 kiosks as of March 31, 2023.</p>

<p>Bitcoin Depot will install thousands of crypto ATMs at Circle K-branded convenience stores in the US and Canada amid the cryptocurrency market boom.</p>



<p>But this year, the number of users of these machines has decreased significantly as the virtual currency market enters a &#8220;hibernation&#8221; period, with the average transaction value at each ATM globally reducing by about 75% compared to the previous year, early 2021.</p>



<p>In May, the American provider of Bitcoin ATMs announced that it would cease operations in Connecticut after the state&#8217;s Department of Banking said the company did not have the appropriate license.</p>

However, she expects the SEC to develop laws and regulations that support cryptocurrencies soon.</p>



<p>Franklin Templeton views the crypto ecosystem as a collection of digital nations. Each of these blockchain ecosystems is its own country.</p>



<p>Other members include executives from crypto companies like Coinfund, Crypto.com, and Uniswap and representatives from traditional Wall Street financial institutions like BlackRock, DRW, and Goldman Sachs.</p>



<p>GMAC was established to help the regulator analyze issues related to the US capital markets, and make policy recommendations associated with financial instruments such as derivatives and companies that support their trading support such as exchanges and brokers.</p>



<p>New members have been added to the CFTC&#8217;s Global Market Structure group&#8217;s subcommittee on digital assets, according to Commissioner Caroline Pham. There are now 128 people involved in its GMAC group and relevant subcommittees.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cboe updated the filings for the spot bitcoin ETF on its website shortly after the SEC said that the spot bitcoin ETF filings were not clear and comprehensive.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cboe re-filtered five spot bitcoin ETF proposals on Friday following reports that the SEC had requested more information.</em></li>



<li><em>Cboe said it expected to sign a custody-sharing agreement with Coinbase.</em></li>



<li><em>Previously, the Exchange Operator, on behalf of five issuers of a spot bitcoin ETF filed it back with the SEC on Friday.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exchange operator Cboe Global Markets Inc. <a href="https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/regulation/rule_filings/pending/2023/SR-CboeBZX-2023-028-Amendment-No-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updated</a> the filings for the spot bitcoin ETF on its website shortly after the SEC said that the spot bitcoin ETF filings were not clear and comprehensive.</strong></h5>

<p>Cboe, on behalf of five issuers of a spot bitcoin ETF filed with the SEC on Friday. Updated filings have been submitted to the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust, and Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust.</p>



<p>The refreshed filing is intended to address concerns raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to these people, the agency <a href="https://coincu.com/199277-sec-says-bitcoin-etf-inadequate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notified </a>exchanges Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets, which had submitted applications for asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, that the files needed to be more precise and thorough.</p>



<p>One key issue is that the exchanges did not name the cryptocurrency trading platforms they plan to enter into custody-sharing arrangements to help detect fraud in the underlying Bitcoin market.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-3.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="375" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-3.png" alt="Cboe Immediately Updates Bitcoin ETF Spot Profile After SEC Complaint" class="wp-image-199321" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-3.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-3-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-3-360x180.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" title="Cboe Immediately Updates Bitcoin ETF Spot Profile After SEC Complaint 17"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The filings, in the second iteration, named Coinbase as part of a custody-sharing agreement for ETF applications by Wise Origin, WisdomTree, VanEck, and Invesco Galaxy.</p>



<p>The updated document states that the product, The Spot BTC SSA, will show signs of a custody-sharing agreement split between the two. The filing says that setup will allow additional access to data related to spot Bitcoin transactions on Coinbase if the exchange determines it is necessary as part of a monitoring program.</p>



<p>Following the wave of BlackRock is a wide range of traditional and crypto asset managers. In recent days, Fidelity Investments, Cathie Wood&#8217;s Ark Investment Management, Invesco, WisdomTree, Bitwise Asset Management, and Valkyrie have all revived or revised their applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Kraken has been ordered to provide certain user information to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS).</em></li>



<li><em>The IRS wants to identify accounts with more than $20,000 in crypto transactions annually between 2016 and 2020.</em></li>



<li><em>The judge said the government had a legitimate purpose to search the documents.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to The Block,<a href="https://coincu.com/195499-20-liquidity-drop-kraken-emerges-as-winner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Kraken</a> was ordered by a judge on Friday to provide certain user information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="674" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1024x674.png" alt="Kraken Is Requested By The IRS For Customer Information From $20,000" class="wp-image-199314" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1024x674.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-300x197.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-768x505.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-750x493.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Kraken Is Requested By The IRS For Customer Information From $20,000 18"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The IRS wants the exchange to identify accounts with more than $20,000 in crypto transactions annually between 2016 and 2020. Kraken has previously objected to the IRS subpoena partly because its concerns will create a great burden. The exchange called the agency&#8217;s summons an &#8220;irrational treasure hunt,&#8221; arguing that it crossed the line.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The Government has a legitimate purpose for seeking the materials described in the summon. As discussed above, the summons was issued in connection with an investigation by the IRS to determine the identity and correct federal income tax liability of US persons who conduct transactions in cryptocurrency during the period 2016-2020,&#8221;</p>
<cite>Judge Joseph C. Spero said in the court document.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Kraken will have to disclose information such as name, date of birth, physical address, phone number, and tax identification number.</p>



<p>Friday&#8217;s ruling in favor of the government comes amid a deepening US crackdown on cryptocurrencies. The Securities and Exchange Commission this month filed a lawsuit accusing Coinbase of operating an illegal exchange and alleging that Binance.US mishandled customer funds, misled investors and agencies&#8217; regulatory authorities as well as violations of securities rules.</p>

<p>Kraken is a leading cryptocurrency exchange with a daily trading volume of around $650 million globally, according to CoinMarketCap. The company did not immediately respond to an email request for comment on the ruling.</p>



<p>Kraken currently only offers US Forms 1099-MISC, 1099-INT, and 1099-NEC, which are filed with the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and a copy will be provided to you (if you qualify). This could change in the coming years as tax reporting laws constantly change.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>QuickNode adds support for XRP Ledger, boosting Web3 adoption.</em></li>



<li><em>XRPL offers reliability, fast transactions, and diverse use cases.</em></li>



<li><em>QuickNode simplifies infrastructure for developers, enabling high-quality dApp development.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>QuickNode, a leading provider of blockchain infrastructure solutions, has <a href="https://blog.quicknode.com/xrp-ledger-xrpl-blockchain-quicknode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> an interesting platform announcement. It supports the XRP Ledger (XRPL), making it the company&#8217;s 23rd blockchain technology.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="529" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318-1024x529.png" alt="Blockchain Development Platform QuickNode Now Adds Support For XRP Ledger" class="wp-image-199306" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318-1024x529.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318-300x155.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318-768x396.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318-1536x793.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318-750x387.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318-1140x588.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2318.png 1860w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Blockchain Development Platform QuickNode Now Adds Support For XRP Ledger 20"></a></figure></div>


<p>QuickNode claims that XRPL may be used for a variety of purposes, including tokenization, CBDC, DeFi, and stablecoins. This integration intends to enable developers within the XRPL ecosystem and boost Web3 technology adoption via dependable and efficient blockchain solutions.</p>



<p>The XRPL offers developers significant utility and flexibility, allowing them to write in Python, Java, and JavaScript. The XRPL is appropriate for any independent developer or organization looking to create a wide range of use cases.</p>



<p>The XRPL is a very beneficial blockchain platform for developers looking to construct enterprises. Throughout the last decade, the protocol&#8217;s capabilities have been enhanced to allow for scalable blockchain development. This allows developers to begin on creative projects and applications in a variety of use cases, including as payments, tokenization, decentralized finance (DeFi), and others.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320-1024x576.png" alt="Blockchain Development Platform QuickNode Now Adds Support For XRP Ledger" class="wp-image-199308" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2320.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Blockchain Development Platform QuickNode Now Adds Support For XRP Ledger 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>A Proof-of-Association (PoA) consensus method underpins the XRPL&#8217;s functionality. Validators, or network servers, achieve consensus every 3-5 seconds, assuring the sequence and result of XRP transactions. The XRPL&#8217;s robust encryption assures the system&#8217;s integrity, while transaction openness provides public accountability.</p>



<p>The addition of XRPL infrastructure to QuickNode&#8217;s platform expands the potential for developers globally. With rapid access to full blockchain capability, developers may tokenize assets, explore sophisticated payment systems, and exploit a variety of XRPL features without having to study, construct, and manage smart contracts.</p>



<p>QuickNode&#8217;s support for XRPL strengthens its position as a premier blockchain infrastructure provider. QuickNode enables developers to concentrate on creating high-quality decentralized apps (dApps) while easing their Web3 strategy by simplifying node management, synchronization, and providing a full platform. It has demonstrated its dependability and scalability in serving industry-leading projects by processing over 200 billion requests per month across 14+ locations globally.</p>

<p>QuickNode <a href="https://coincu.com/162220-quicknodes-series-b-round-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> $60 million in Series B fundraising in January of this year, valuing the company at $800 million. Dan Tapiero&#8217;s 10T Holdings led the round, and Tapiero will also join QuickNode&#8217;s board of directors. According to The Block, other Series B backers included Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian&#8217;s Seven Seven Six, Protocol Labs, Tiger Global, and QED Investments.</p>



<p>The addition of XRPL to the QuickNode platform marks yet another step forward in the evolution of Web3 technologies. QuickNode helps the development and acceptance of blockchain solutions by offering developers with easy access to the established XRPL infrastructure, stimulating creativity, and increasing the possibilities within the XRPL ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Celsius can now sell altcoins and plans to pay creditors in Bitcoin and Ethereum.</em></li>



<li><em>The decision was made after discussions with the SEC regarding regulatory requirements for less popular cryptocurrencies.</em></li>



<li><em>Celsius holds altcoins worth $218 million but filed for bankruptcy and is focusing on paying off debts while customer withdrawals remain on hold.</em></li>

<p>Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn of the Southern District of New York accepted the action, which Celsius suggested following conversations with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has said that a spectrum of less-used crypto coins needs regulatory permission.</p>



<p>On July 1, 2023, Celsius will be able to sell or convert any non-BTC and non-ETH cryptocurrency into BTC or ETH. Celsius has $70.5 million in CEL, $51.8 million in MATIC, $26.2 million in ADA, $17.3 million in LINK, and $14.4 million in LTC, among other investments.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrencies owned by Celsius amount to $218 million, according to an alleged balance sheet that went viral in April and include CEL, MATIC, ADA, LINK, LTC, DOT, BCH, AAVE, UNI, XLM, SOL, EOS, FIT, SRM, and BNB. Celsius&#8217; native token is CEL, while the remainder is largely MATIC and ADA.</p>

<p>The company has been in regular contact with the SEC and certain state regulatory agencies regarding the proposed distribution of cryptocurrency under the plan to ensure that all such distributions are in full compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations, according to the filing.</p>

<p>Celsius revealed on July 13, 2022, that it has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The organization said that it intends to continue functioning during the restructuring, albeit withdrawals will remain halted for the time being.</p>



<p>They have aggressively paid off project debt since then. In particular, the company spent about $800 million on Aave, Maker, and Compound.</p>



<p>Paying clients, on the other hand, is more challenging; a year has passed and many customers are still unable to take their funds. Nevertheless, insolvent cryptocurrency firms like BlockFi and Voyager Digital have declared that consumers would be able to withdraw their cash this summer.</p>
