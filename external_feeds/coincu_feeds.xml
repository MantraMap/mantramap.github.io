<p>The SEC first sued Ripple Labs in December 2020, alleging that<strong> XRP was issued as an unregistered security and continues to be one</strong>.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Garlinghouse stated that the prospects of Ripple <strong>settling with the SEC are virtually zero</strong> and that the issue might be resolved this year.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">We expect a decision from the judge certainly in 2023. But you don’t really have any control over when a judge makes their decisions. I’m optimistic that sometime in the coming single-digit number of months we will have closure.</p>

<li><em>The digital yuan (e-CNY) is already available in some regions in 17 Chinese provinces.</em></li>



<li><em>The Central Bank of China is still actively promoting activities to develop e-CNY to optimize payment methods.</em></li>



<li><em>Since 2022, the piloting of a e-CNY has made breakthroughs in many ways.</em></li>

<h5><strong>The Central Bank said many places have piloted the digital yuan and will continue to implement innovative applications of the digital yuan in the future.</strong></h5>

<p>On January 30, according to <a href="https://www.guandian.cn/article/20230130/328871.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CCTV news</a>, since 2022,<strong> the e-CNY&#8217;s piloting has made many breakthroughs.</strong></p>



<p>Up to now, the People&#8217;s Bank of China has piloted the digital yuan in some areas of 17 provinces. By 2022, <strong>nearly 30 digital yuan consumer red envelope activities</strong> will be carried out in each pilot area around the themes of <strong>&#8220;promoting consumption&#8221; </strong>and<strong> &#8220;low-carbon tourism.&#8221;</strong></p>



<p>The People&#8217;s Bank of China stated that in the future, they would continue to implement innovative applications of e-CNY to realize the connection between the digital yuan system and traditional electronic payment tools so that <strong>consumers can &#8220;scan with a code&#8221;</strong> and merchants can <strong>support various transactions without increasing costs as much as possible.</strong></p>



<p>As updated in an earlier Coincu News article, The Soochow Securities mobile application now allows investors to <a href="https://news.coincu.com/161200-e-cny-now-accessible-for-securities-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>purchase securities using the e-CNY</strong></a>. The e-CNY payment feature of Soochow Securities, which was introduced in collaboration with the Bank of China, enables investors to buy wealth management products with the digital yuan.</p>



<p>Earlier in July 2022, China also <a href="https://news.coincu.com/108840-china-increase-number-of-e-cny-test-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increased</a> the number of <strong>e-CNY testing locations from 11 to 23</strong> to make the e-CNY more widespread.</p>

<p>By launching its national digital currency, China hopes to reshape the way its government-backed currency works with standards different from cash and digital deposits.</p>



<p>Unlike Bitcoin, which is designed to be decentralized so that no company or government can control it, central banks will issue digital currencies to give them the advantage of financial control. These currencies are a cash alternative and can make it easier for governments to track financial transactions to prevent money laundering, financial fraud, and terrorist financing.</p>

<p>The DOJ requested in a recent court <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.50.0.pdf" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.50.0.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener">filing </a>that Bankman-access Fried&#8217;s to all current and past workers of the troubled crypto companies be restricted because they might be easy targets for intimidation.</p>



<p>In particular,<strong> the Government wants to restrict the defendant&#8217;s communication to only current and former FTX and Alameda employees </strong>because they are the most susceptible to intimidation because they were the defendant&#8217;s subordinates up until recently and were paid and compensated accordingly.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">The Government does not consider it administrable to identify a more limited subset of former and current employees whom the defendant may not contact – the Government has not completed its investigation and is still identifying individuals with information relevant to the charges who may be potential trial witnesses.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bankman-Fried has already sought to contact a witness, asking whether <strong>they might reconnect and use each other as resources, according to the DOJ.</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">It has recently come to the Government’s attention that the defendant has been in direct communication with the current General Counsel of FTX US who may be a witness at trial (‘Witness-1’), and who is represented by counsel. Specifically, on January 15, 2023, the defendant contacted Witness-1 over the encrypted messaging application Signal, as well as by email.</p>

<p>After their original asset failed, FTX declared bankruptcy in November and was obliged to halt customer withdrawals. <strong>Bankman-Fried, the company&#8217;s founder, is accused of cheating investors and mishandling user funds by lending billions to Alameda, FTX&#8217;s trading branch, to make bad bets</strong>. He is currently free on bail until his trial.</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried may face more than 100 years in prison if convicted.</p>

<h5><strong>Despite the positive performance of numerous cryptocurrencies this month, Polygon&#8217;s native currency is set to end January as a noticeable standout.</strong></h5>



<p>According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/dexscan/ethereum/0x290a6a7460b308ee3f19023d2d00de604bcf5b42" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coinmarketcap.com/dexscan/ethereum/0x290a6a7460b308ee3f19023d2d00de604bcf5b42" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinmarketcap </a>data, <strong>MATIC is up 19.28% in the last week to $1.19, bringing the token&#8217;s gains in January 53%</strong>. This comes as the value of Bitcoin and Ethereum has surged by almost 44% and 38%, respectively, in the last 30 days.</p>

<p>MATIC is the tenth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization at the time of writing, <strong>having a total value of $10.06 billion.</strong></p>



<p>Polygon is a sidechain that operates alongside Ethereum and aims to outperform it by providing faster transactions and lower costs, as well as serving as a foundation for interoperable blockchains.</p>



<p>As <strong>the currency continues to rise in value</strong>, the pseudonymous Twitter account Lookonchain highlighted one wallet address that made significant gains with MATIC.</p>

<p>In September 2020, <strong>the Polygon whale received 4 million MATIC from cryptocurrency exchange Binance for approximately $84,000</strong>, or slightly more than 2 cents per token. According to <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x7d1afa7b718fb893db30a3abc0cfc608aacfebb0?a=0x1c6b316f16ee3ec37dda1cd5affba8c6d5980bfd" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://etherscan.io/token/0x7d1afa7b718fb893db30a3abc0cfc608aacfebb0?a=0x1c6b316f16ee3ec37dda1cd5affba8c6d5980bfd" rel="noreferrer noopener">Etherscan</a>,<strong> the wallet exchanged its MATIC holdings for $5.2 million in stablecoins two days earlier.</strong></p>



<p>However, the current surge is still far away from the token&#8217;s all-time high of<strong> $2.92 in December 2021</strong>. The token is <strong>still roughly 60% lower than its all-time high</strong>. The 4 million in MATIC purchased in 2020 would have been worth $11.7 million at its peak price.</p>

<p><strong>MATIC&#8217;s price movement coincides with Polygon&#8217;s preparations to implement an upgrade</strong> first announced in July of last year. Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal recently tweeted that the <strong>zkEVM</strong> upgrade has an official release date and will be available soon.</p>



<p><strong>Polygon&#8217;s zkEVM is a scaling solution</strong> <strong>that is compatible with existing Ethereum smart contracts</strong> and employs the cryptographic method of zero-knowledge proofs to more effectively validate huge batches of transactions known as rollups.</p>

<p>Highstreet&nbsp;(HIGH) is an MMORPG game that blurs the boundaries between physical and virtual worlds. All the in-game items are represented on the platform as&nbsp;ERC-721&nbsp;non-fungible tokens&nbsp;(NFTs) divided into two fractions. While purchasing the digital fraction <strong>allows players to use the thing within the metaverse, buying the NFT will enable gamers to receive the item in real life.</strong></p>



<p>With that, the price of the Metaverse Highstreet project <strong>HIGH Token has increased by almost 170% in 24 hours, and the current price is $3.49</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>HIGH Token&nbsp;(Highstreet) is a native token</strong> of a&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;commerce-centric&nbsp;<strong>play-to-earn&nbsp;metaverse built with virtual reality (VR) support</strong>. Apart from realizing a two-way currency flow within physical and virtual worlds,&nbsp;Highstreet&nbsp;(HIGH) introduces a market where in-game items can be redeemed for real-life products. During gameplay, users can explore the metaverse, fight monsters, and complete quests while acquiring goods that have both digital and real-world utility.</p>



<p>According to information on the project&#8217;s official website, <strong>Highstreet completed a $5 million funding in August 2021</strong>, with participation from Binance Labs, Shima Capital, Animoca Brands, and others.</p>

<p>The project sponsor, Binance, yesterday also made a statement regarding the development of Metaverse projects. Specifically, Binance CEO CZ stated in the latest Binance AMA that if Binance builds a metaverse, it will undoubtedly be backed by BNB, but since Binance (yet) is not a game builder. Without a game-building team, CZ wants to invest in other VR or metaverse games.</p>

<p><strong>SkyPeople</strong> plans not to appeal in the lawsuit for canceling the refusal of the rating for <strong>Five Stars for Clayton</strong>. Previously, <strong>SkyPeople</strong> lost the first trial judgment held at the <strong>Seoul Administrative Court </strong>on <strong>January 13</strong>. The<strong> Game Management Committee</strong> refused to classify<a href="https://news.coincu.com/161041-korea-banned-p2e-games-five-stars-rejected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Five Stars</a> for speculative reasons in 2021, and SkyPeople filed an administrative lawsuit against the <strong>Game Committee</strong> in <strong>July 2021.</strong></p>



<p>The reason <strong>SkyPeople</strong> made this decision was that it judged that there was little possibility of official service of P2E games under the current <strong>Game Industry Promotion Act. </strong></p>



<p>The current law prohibits game operators from promoting speculative behavior by providing prizes, etc., but the first trial judge viewed NFT items in Five Stars as prizes. This is because item ownership is permanently vested in the user and is freely traded through an exchange outside the game. <strong>SkyPeople</strong> argued that it could not be regarded as a gift, but the court judged differently.</p>



<p>The results of the first trial judgment on <strong>Natris</strong>, another P2E game lawsuit to be held on<strong> January 31</strong>, are expected to be similar. Natris also filed an administrative lawsuit against the Game Board for canceling the rating of <strong>Infinite Breakthrough: Three Kingdoms Reverse</strong>.</p>

<p>It is an observation that it is highly likely to see it as a prize because it pays out <strong>Mudolcoin</strong>, a cryptocurrency that can be exchanged at the exchange during the gameplay process. Unless the current game law is revised, it is expected that it will be virtually difficult to service P2E games normally in <a href="https://news.coincu.com/162920-south-korea-will-implement-crypto-tracking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Korea</a>.</p>



<p>In contrast, domestic P2E games in global service are producing results. According to <strong>Sensor Tower,</strong> a mobile app data analysis company, among P2E games last year, Netmarble&#8217;s<strong> Second Country: Cross World </strong>ranked first in global sales combined with Google Play and Apple&#8217;s App Store, and WeMade&#8217;s <strong>Mir 4 </strong>ranked second. </p>

<p>Most of the domestic game companies servicing P2E games are developing the business only overseas, and the two games also introduced it only in the global version. In terms of profits earned in regions other than Korea, the second country and <strong>Mir 4</strong> kept first and second place.</p>

<p>On-chain games for developers use a novel technique by concentrating on strategy games in which participants program their plans using smart contracts. To succeed in <strong>0xMonaco</strong> and similar games in the future, players will need strong technical aptitude, originality, and agility. Through video simulations that show the exact code logic used throughout the round, <strong>MatchBoxDAO</strong> claimed to provide developers with a pleasurable experience and amuse spectators.</p>

<p>Developers participated in a <strong>Mario Kart-style racing game</strong> that rewarded technological prowess and used smart contracts for the vehicles on each team.</p>



<p>While it&#8217;s becoming more common for <strong>Web3</strong> <strong>games</strong> to merely have their assets on-chain and not the actual gameplay, <strong>0xMonaco</strong> is a completely on-chain game.</p>



<p>In order to effectively use resources for accelerating, shooting shells, super shells, or purchasing a shield, each of which costs coins, teams must develop a plan for each car before the race. <strong>17,500 coins </strong>are given to each player at the start of the game.</p>



<p>Game developers are increasingly moving beyond play-to-earn and concentrating more on the gameplay side of their platforms as a result of the Web3 ecosystem&#8217;s continued influence and evolution on the gaming scene.</p>

<p>Ghana&#8217;s central bank has invited registered financial institutions and unlicensed fintech businesses to apply for entry into its regulatory sandbox. In a press<a href="https://www.bog.gov.gh/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/PRESS-RELEASE-BANK-OF-GHANA-REGULATORY-SANDBOX-INVITATION-TO-APPLY-26-01-23.pdf" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bog.gov.gh/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/PRESS-RELEASE-BANK-OF-GHANA-REGULATORY-SANDBOX-INVITATION-TO-APPLY-26-01-23.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener"> release</a> issued on January 26, the bank stated that <strong>the process for admitting the first cohort of participants will begin on February 13 and end on March 14.</strong></p>

<p>On August 22, 2022, Ghana&#8217;s central bank introduced the sandbox, which was built in conjunction with Emetech Solutions Inc. The bank described the introduction of the sandbox as evidence of <strong>its commitment to creating an enabling environment for innovation to promote financial inclusion and enable Ghana&#8217;s digitalization and cash-lite agenda.</strong></p>



<p>Meanwhile, the BOG&#8217;s Nigerian equivalent, the Central Bank of Nigeria, recently announced the launch of its own regulatory sandbox. Innovators interested in participating in the regulatory sandbox to explore novel applications of technology and innovation on behalf of our customers and stakeholders can now submit <strong>expressions of interest.</strong></p>

<p>Although perpetual futures are the most widely used crypto primitive, the following issues have not yet been addressed by current exchanges:</p>



<ul>
<li>High obstacles to listing on the market. Because their procedures can&#8217;t adjust to difficult market situations, current exchanges are hesitant to list long-tail markets. As a result, there is no fresh exposure to long-tail assets, and the same markets are continually included in DEXs.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Insufficient risk management. Multiple protocols were shut down, and DeFi lost millions of dollars in 2022 alone as a result of market manipulation and oracle assaults.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Risk/returns for liquidity providers are unclear (LPs). LPs are subject to a variety of risks, including adverse selection and bankruptcy. Exchanges try to make up for this by charging large trading commissions.</li>
</ul>



<p>Vest Exchange hopes to solve the problems of high listing threshold, lack of risk management, and unclear risk/reward of LP. The exchange will soon announce a testnet.</p>

<p>Vest is a risk-first, non-custodial protocol that empowers users to trade <em>perpetual</em> futures on almost any asset. It unlocks new illiquid markets quicker than any other centralized or decentralized exchange by combining coherent risk metrics with the microstructure of perpetual future markets.</p>



<p>Vest Labs is a crypto research firm building useful primitives to enable a fairer system for all traders. The team aims to do just that for traders. They will make the first stride by building a decentralized perpetual futures exchange (Vest Exchange) where traders can speculate on almost any asset.</p>

<p>According to Dave the Wave&#8217;s chart, <strong>BTC appears to be continuing its technical setup from the second quarter of 2019</strong>, when BTC rose from about $4,000 to $14,000 in a few months. </p>



<p>The <strong>MACD</strong>, a trend reversal indicator, is <strong>currently circling in the same area as it did before the 2019 BTC spike</strong>, claims the analyst. Similar to Bitcoin&#8217;s Q2 2019 setup, the histogram, which gauges the convergence or divergence of the moving averages, is likewise trending upward.</p>



<p>According to the crypto strategist&#8217;s logarithmic growth curve (LGC) model, <strong>the value of Bitcoin might increase by 676% by 2024.</strong></p>

<p>The LGC is the analyst&#8217;s attempt to forecast the boom-and-bust cycles of <strong>Bitcoin in the face of shifting macroeconomic circumstances. </strong>The LGC concept is intended for long-term Bitcoin investors, claims Dave the Wave.</p>
