<p>BTC/USD Gives Back Recent Gains:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 17 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) extended its ongoing depreciation early in the Asian session as the pair traded below the psychologically-important 17000 figure, reaching the 16924.99 area following increasing risk aversion. &nbsp;&nbsp;Selling pressure intensified around the 17525 area, just above the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 18385.36 to 17222.09.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were elected below the 17267.87 area as the downturn intensified, a level that represents the 38.2% retracement of the appreciating range from 15460 to 18385.36.&nbsp; &nbsp;Strong selling pressure around the 18385 and 17525 areas could result in tests of downside price objectives around the 16849, 16375, 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD is able to reclaim some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 17110.39 and the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 17286.61.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bearishly below MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bearishly below MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
