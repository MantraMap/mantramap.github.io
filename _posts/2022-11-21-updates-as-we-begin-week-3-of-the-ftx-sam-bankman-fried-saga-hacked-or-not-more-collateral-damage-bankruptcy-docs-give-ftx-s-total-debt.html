The largest single loan listed in the document is over $226 million, with the rest of the total debt owed falling somewhere between $21 million and $203 million.</p><p style="color: #252525;"></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">The "hack"...</h3><p></p><p><span style="color: #252525;">As things unfolded last week a significant number of tokens were moved from the official storage wallets of FTX. It's not surprising that some would suspect a "inside job," but former FTX employees are spreading rumors that the same authorities from the Bahamas government who are investigating the company for possible legal violations are also the thieves.</span></p><p><span style="color: #252525;">Analytics firm Chainalysis is tracking the funds&nbsp;that&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #252525;">originated from the FTX exchange&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #252525;">and say the funds are now being traded from Ethereum to Bitcoin. The FTX hacker once held 228,523 ETH, making them one of the top Ether wallets globally.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #252525;">...but was there actually no hacker at all?!</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #252525;">To be fair, the rumors started because no one was coming forward to say otherwise.&nbsp; Millions in crypto gets moved, with no legitimate entity claiming responsibility, the logical conclusion is a hack.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #252525;">After coming forward, the Bahamas government confirmed they were indeed behind it - but it wasn't corrupt officials stealing funds. Regulators in the Bahamas officially state they are in possession of the funds which were taken as part of a seizure&nbsp;of assets - to prevent anyone at FTX from doing anything with them.<br /><br />It all seemed settled, then we learned - this isn't what happened either.</span></p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #252525;">The actual story with the FTX "hack"...<br /><br /></span></h3><span style="color: #252525;">Basically "all of the above".<br /><br />Some funds were sized&nbsp;by regulators in the Bahamas.&nbsp; Some funds were stolen.&nbsp; <br /><br />Chainalysis tweeted this summary:<br /><i><blockquote>"Reports that the funds stolen from FTX were actually sent to the Securities Commission of The Bahamas are incorrect. Some funds were stolen, and other funds were sent to the regulators."</blockquote></i>This was confirmed again as FTX tweeted to alert other exchanges to keep an eye out for hacked funds hitting their platforms, so they could then freeze the account before the hackers can make any trades.&nbsp;<br /></span><p></p><p style="color: #252525;"></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Collateral Damage...<br /><br /></h3>In related news, Solana is "facing difficulties" following the collapse of FTX, due to their strong ties with FTX and its sister company, Alameda Research, which invested in nine Solana projects since December 2020.<p></p><p style="color: #252525;">So far, Solana has lost over 60% of its value since the FTX saga began, and users have removed about an equal percentage from the total staked supply. In response, Tether announced they will be taking $1 billion USDT it had on the Solana blockchain and moving it to the Ethereum blockchain, as they don't foresee the supply being needed on the Solana blockchain in the near future.</p><p>   </p><p style="color: #252525;">While there's no shortage of die-hard Solana supporters posting that they're taking this opportunity to load up on SOL tokens at a discount, others are saying there's still a big hit to come, with FTX rumored to a large amount of Solana tokens that they will probably be forced to put on the market.&nbsp;</p><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Sam Bankman-Fried...<br /><br /></h3>Last week he was direct messaging journalists, claiming he has plans to raise billions to make FTX customers 'whole' again - causing the newly appointed FTX CEO (installed to oversee the bankruptcy) to come out clarifying Sam has no role with the company, and isn't authorized to raise funds or speak on FTX's behalf, even calling Sam 'delusional'.&nbsp;<br /><br />It seems he caught on that he was doing himself more bad than good, today is day 5 of silence.&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">-----------------------<br /></span></span><i style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; color: red; font-weight: bolder;">Author:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #333333;">Mark Pippen<br /></span></i><i style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;"><span style="color: #0b5394;">London News Desk&nbsp;<br /></span></span></span></i><i style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;"><a href="https://www.globalcryptopress.com/"><span style="color: #444444;">Breaking Crypto News</span></a>&nbsp;</span></span></i><p></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"><img src="//feedburner.google.com/fb/images/pub/feed-icon32x32.png" alt="" style="border:0"/></a><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">Subscribe to GCP in a reader</a></div>
