<p>New York, United States, May 24th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Following months of battle-testing by partner projects, developers, and community, production-ready Nautilus Chain graduates from testnet.</p><p>Zebec, a pioneer in streaming finance, announced today the launch of Nautilus Chain - soon to be Zebec Chain - on mainnet, an important milestone in building its continuous payments infrastructure and global ecosystem. The first of its kind as an L3, Nautilus Chain offers the fastest EVM environment in web3 capable of parallel transaction processing, combining the speeds of Solana with the stability and functionality of EVM-based Solidity smart contracts, paving the way to the next generation of DeFi and consumer applications with a continuous stream of transactions or payments.</p><p>Nautilus Chain&rsquo;s settlement layer is currently built on Solana node, its execution layer on Neon EVM and Solidity smart contract, with data availability hash stored off-chain in order to keep Nautilus&rsquo; modular blockchain architecture. With plans to transition settlement layer to optimistic roll-up and data availability stored on layer 1 chains such as Etherium, BSC or Bitcoin to further maximize throughput while remaining stable and reliable to support high-throughput payment applications such as payroll, DeFi applications, and on-chain gaming.</p><p>The mainnet upgrade brings over 80 projects, such as Coral Finance, Witnet, and PoseiSwap to name a few, with dozens more in the process of onboarding and a track record of seamlessly processing over 40 million transactions on testnet to date.</p>"Zebec is helping to create a future where money is able to move more freely; giving individuals, businesses, investors, and teams faster and easier access to funds and tokens," said Sam Thapaliya, Founder of Zebec. "The launch of Nautilus on mainnet is another breakthrough on the path towards this vision."<p>Key features of the Nautilus Chain</p><p>High Throughput</p><p>Through parallelizing transactions instead of processing them linearly, Nautilus delivers an initial TPS of 2,000 with much higher rates soon to come.</p><p>Developer-friendly</p><p>Solidity developers are able to build high-throughput applications in an EVM environment. While the chain's modular structure supports customization and gives developers control of the tech stack &mdash; or chain stack &mdash; in building dApps. The chain is highly interoperable and extensible and, with app-specific rollups, enables projects to strike the perfect balance between decentralization, throughput, performance, cost, and efficiency.</p><p>Reliable</p><p>The high speeds and performance of the Nautilus chain, because it is a sovereign rollup, do not compromise the overall reliability and security of the infrastructure. Its robust design ensures optimal uptime and resilience, even under the most demanding conditions.</p><p>Built for the real world</p><p>With its core innovation in performance and security, Zebec&rsquo;s technology has transformative potential in the world of traditional finance, blockchain adoption and smart contract-based digital financial applications.</p>"Zebec&rsquo;s progress with Nautilus Chain development has the potential to bridge the gap between traditional finance and web2 payroll applications and the emerging web3 ecosystem." - said Steve Chen, Head of Blockchain Development for Nautilus"By harnessing the unparalleled speed, security, and interoperability of Nautilus, Zebec&rsquo;s technology is poised to revolutionize traditional finance, bringing the benefits of blockchain technology to mainstream industries. As we continue to explore the potential of Zebec&rsquo;s L3 chain, we foresee a future where seamless integration between web2 and web3 applications leads to the eventual replacement of conventional financial systems with blockchain technology and creating a more inclusive and efficient global economy."- Chen continued.<p>As Zebec continues to innovate and expand its ecosystem, it invites developers, companies, and projects from around the world to join it in creating a more connected, efficient, and accessible financial future.&nbsp;</p><p>About Zebec</p><p>Zebec enables real-time and continuous streams of payments and financial transactions for payroll, investments and more.&nbsp;Founded in 2021, with investments by Circle, Coinbase, Solana Ventures, Breyer Capital, Republic, and Lightspeed Venture Partners among others, Zebec services hundreds of companies, running thousands of continuous payment streams and bringing the blockchain to everyday lives.</p><p>For more information about Zebec: Official Website | Twitter | Discord | Telegram</p><p>About Nautilus</p><p>Nautilus is a high-performance modular blockchain built for real-world DeFi and Web3 applications delivering high speed and low cost of processing transactions within a highly secure and stable decentralized system.</p><p>For more information about Nautilus: Official Website | Twitter | Telegram</p>ContactElena SolovyovZebecelena@zebec.io
