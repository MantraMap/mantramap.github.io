Earlier, CoinGape <a href="https://coingape.com/just-in-cardano-founder-charles-hoskinson-cuts-ties-with-the-xrp-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Hoskinson had cut ties with the XRP community by blocking Twitter accounts he claimed to be targeting him. In the wake of the back to back lawsuits by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against two of the top crypto exchanges in the world, Binance and Coinbase, this will be a welcome move to maintain unity in the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a>.</p>

<p>Things got heated up in October 2022, when the Cardano founder claimed that he was target of trolling and harassment by members of the XRP community. This eventually led to his blocking of several Twitter accounts. In this context, Hoskinson offered to regain &#8216;peace&#8217; with the community, although it is not clear yet as what could be the action plan.</p>
<h2>Cardano ($ADA) Founder Patching Up With XRP Supporters?</h2>
<p>In a surprise statement, the Cardano founder asked the XRP holder community if they were willing to find peace. A section of the crypto market participants viewed it as Hoskinson&#8217;s way of uniting the crypto community in the wake of the SEC&#8217;s recognition of Cardano (ADA) as a security. Many suggested that Hoskinson hold a Twitter space with the XRP community to officially put an end to the public criticism.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">XRP Community, peace?</p>
<p>&mdash; Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1667325696585216000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Interestingly, the two tokens are taking head on in fight for the market share among top 10 cryptocurrencies. While <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP price</a> is currently trading at just above half a dollar, <a href="https://coingape.com/price/cardano/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cardano ADA price</a> is at $0.28, with XRP and ADA ranked 6th and 7th respectively in terms of market value.</p>

<p><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/vitalik-buterin/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Vitalik Buterin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the visionary mind behind the world&#8217;s second-largest crypto, recently outlined these transitions in a </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/06/09/three_transitions.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, highlighting their significance in enhancing scalability, security, and privacy within the Ethereum ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the most pressing challenges for </span><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ethereum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> has been its scalability. As the network gained popularity, the increased demand for transactions caused congestion and high fees, hindering its usability. To address this issue, Buterin </span><a href="https://coingape.com/ethereum-ceo-discusses-scalability-solution-for-ethereum-network/"><span style="font-weight: 400">points</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to the transition to Layer 2 scaling solutions as the first transition, specifically rollups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The second transition pointed by Buterin is the wallet security transition, specifically smart contract wallets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By adopting smart contract wallets, users can have greater confidence in the security of their assets. Without the second transition, Buterin highlighted that Ethereum fails because users are hesitant to save their funds (and non-financial assets), and everyone migrates to centralized exchanges. Buterin believes that social recovery wallets are important for greater security and user experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Additionally, the Ethereum co-founder also stressed the significance of privacy as the third transition. Buterin acknowledges the need for privacy-preserving features within the Ethereum network, specifically focusing on funds transfers and the development of related tools such as social recovery, identity, and reputation systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To enable privacy features for Ethereum users, Buterin suggested implementing stealth address methods.</span></p>
<h2><b>Challenges Involved with the Transitions</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Achieving scalability, security, and privacy improvements on Ethereum requires more than just protocol upgrades, according to Buterin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As with any new project, Buterin highlighted some challenges that may be involved in these transitions. He highlighted that the successful implementation of these transitions requires coordination among various stakeholders in the Ethereum community, including developers, miners, users, and application builders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the Ethereum co-founder, Transitioning to these new solutions necessitates educating and encouraging users to adopt the changes. This is because users need to understand the importance of these transitions and feel confident in adopting them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By recognizing the importance of coordination, facilitating changes in application design, and prioritizing user education and adoption, the Ethereum community can navigate these challenges and ensure the successful resolution of these transitions.</span></p>

<h2><strong>LUNC Price Daily Chart</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the market sentiment remaining volatile, the LUNC price has respected the converging trendline of the wedge pattern</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bearish reversal from the resistance trendline has set the coin price on a potential 26% drop</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the LUNC coin is $82 Million, indicating a 27% gain.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 5th, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/terra-luna-classic/">LUNC price</a> turned down from the resistance trendline of the wedge pattern. This reversal triggers a bear cycle within the pattern and sets a significant downfall to the lower trendline.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By press time, the coin price trades at the $0.000098 mark and continues to walk sideways, indicating no clear initiation from market participants. However, If the bearish momentum persists, a breakdown below the 20-day EMA could plunge the prices 25-30% to hit the lower trendline located near $0.000065.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, if the LUNC price rises higher, the buyers may rechallenge the overhead trendline. A breakout above the trendline will be a key signal to kickstart a new recovery rally.</span></p>
<h2><b>Will LUNC Price Rise to $0.00012?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the influence of a <a href="https://coingape.com/education/falling-wedge-pattern-what-to-do-if-it-appears-on-a-crypto-chart/">falling wedge pattern</a>, the LUNC price stays in a negative trend. The aforementioned reversal has set the coin price for a potential downfall, which may pull the price to the next significant support situated at $0.000082, $0.00007, followed by a lower trendline. Alternatively, the coin price only attains a recovery above the $0.00012 if the buyer breaks the above trendline.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reclaimed 20-and-50-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> offers strong support to the coin buyers to rechallenge the overhead trendline.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Relative Strength Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely to sideways action, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> rising indicates the growth in underlying buying pressure.</span></li>

For example, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/ico-initial-coin-offering/">Initial Coin Offering</a> (ICO) which was considered a risk-bearing investment is gradually being replaced by Initial Exchange Offerings (IEO).</p>
<p>Potential investors can purchase tokens during the fundraising phase with money directly from their exchange wallets thanks to the Initial Exchange Offering (IEO).</p>
<p>IEOs first appeared in January 2019 with the launch of Binance Launchpad&#8217;s BitTorrent Token (BTT). Interestingly, within 15 minutes of its release, the initial offering raised over $7.1 M in funding. In this article, we are taking a deep dive into the world of Initial Exchange Offering (IEO). Let’s first start by understanding exactly what an <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/ieo/">Initial Exchange Offering</a> (IEO) is.</p>
<h3>What is IEO?</h3>
<p>The Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) is a way for blockchain projects to raise funding by offering utility tokens on a crypto exchange platform. Unlike ICOs, in which organizations sell tokens to investors directly, IEOs include the participation of a trusted exchange that handles the token sale.</p>
<p>IEO offers a range of benefits to investors. They gain confidence from the association with trusted platforms, while projects receive extensive assistance and exposure to a large user base. Participating in an IEO is easier and more user-friendly than participating in a traditional ICO. Though IEO has a lot of positive sides, there are also negatives, including listing costs and possible risks from exchanges that do not do appropriate due diligence.</p>

The defunct <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchange</a> has recently been in news over the deadline for repayments to its creditors. The new deadline for the repayments has been extended until October 31, 2023. With the news of repayment, it was earlier <a href="https://coingape.com/mt-gox-to-commence-repayment-bitcoin-price-danger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speculated</a> that the added Bitcoin could actually have a negative impact on the BTC price.</p>

<p>The Justice Department explained that two Russian nationals have eventually helped cyber criminals in laundering funds worldwide. The two individuals have been charged with conspiring to launder huge amounts of Bitcoin.</p>
<h2>DOJ Charges Mt Gox Hackers</h2>
<p>Not only did the two Russians were charged with conspiring to launder Bitcoin, one of them was also charged with conspiring to operate BTC-e, another defunct cryptocurrency trading platform that was shut down in 2017. The Department <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-nationals-charged-hacking-one-cryptocurrency-exchange-and-illicitly-operating-another" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alleged</a> that since 2011, Alexey Bilyuchenko, 43, and Aleksandr Verner, 29, stole a massive amount of cryptocurrency from Mt. Gox, contributing to the exchange’s ultimate insolvency.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Bilyuchenko and Verner are charged with conspiring to launder approximately 647,000 bitcoins from their hack of Mt. Gox. Bilyuchenko is also charged with conspiring with Alexander Vinnik to operate BTC-e from 2011 to 2017.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As and when the Mt Gox creditors start getting their payout, whether the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin price</a> will have a significant reaction remains to be seen.</p>

Gox</a>, as well as the operation of the illicit crypto exchange BTC-e. The Department of Justice (DOJ) made the announcement on Friday, shedding light on the extent of the criminal activities and their financial implications.</p>
<h2>Justice Department Takes Action Against Mt. Gox Hackers</h2>
<p>According to the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/russian-nationals-charged-hacking-one-cryptocurrency-exchange-and-illicitly-operating" rel="nofollow">statement</a> released by the DOJ, Bilyuchenko, 43, and Verner, 29, are accused of conspiring to launder approximately 647,000 Bitcoins that were stolen during the Mt. Gox hack. As reported earlier on CoinGape, Mt. Gox &#8212; once the largest Bitcoin exchange globally &#8212; faced a catastrophic collapse in 2014 after losing around $500 million worth of the digital currency. At the current <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">Bitcoin price</a>, the value of the stolen Bitcoins amounts to over $17 billion.</p>

<p>The incident came to light when Ryan Selkis, the founder of Messari, published an internal document in February 2014, revealing the loss of nearly 750,000 BTC by Mt. Gox. This disclosure led to a halt in the exchange&#8217;s operations and sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community.</p>
<h2>Russian Nationals Face Charges For Money Laundering Scheme</h2>
<p>Additionally, the DOJ has charged Bilyuchenko with conspiring with Alexander Vinnik, another individual linked to BTC-e, to operate the illicit <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a> between 2011 and 2017. However, BTC-e was subsequently shut down by U.S. authorities in 2017 and Vinnik was extradited to the United States last year in connection with the investigation into BTC-e.</p>
<p>While speaking on the latest development, DOJ Assistant Attorney Kenneth Polite was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Armed with the ill-gotten gains from Mt. Gox, Bilyuchenko allegedly went on to help set up the notorious BTC-e virtual currency exchange, which laundered funds for cyber criminals worldwide.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a further development, the DOJ alleged that Bilyuchenko, Verner, and other unidentified co-conspirators utilized an undisclosed New York-based Bitcoin brokerage service to launder funds, ultimately transferring more than $6.6 million into overseas bank accounts. The DOJ claimed that the brokerage facilitated the laundering of over 300,000 BTC, shedding light on the scale of the illicit financial activities.</p>

<p><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/NorthmanTrader/status/1667168631564779521"><span style="font-weight: 400">According</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to Henrich, the new bull market has just begun and while he gave no detailed fundamental basis to back this very bold claim, he advised his more than 452,000 followers on Twitter to “Please buy now.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The new bull market has just begun.</p>
<p>Please buy now. <a href="https://t.co/yUXnYvWApM">pic.twitter.com/yUXnYvWApM</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Henrich is the founder of NorthTrader and his analytics remain one of the most revered for both the digital currency ecosystem and the broader financial market. The claims that a new bull run is brewing is however, currently been keenly contested by some of his followers who believe the fundamentals and technical realities in either market does not support the claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Using Bitcoin (BTC) as a standard, the premier digital currency is currently trading at a price of $26,607 with a counter-balanced bear-bull action over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency fell as low as $25,700 following the indictment of key assets in the Binance and Coinbase charges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the coin has managed to maintain a 60% growth in the Year-to-Date (YTD) period, the regulatory headwinds makes the prediction of a steady bull run a very far-fetched push at this time.</span></p>
<h2><b>Bull Run and Unmatched Investor Fears</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the call for a bull run, investors in the crypto ecosystem are very weary of what the next couple of weeks and months holds in store. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the much anticipated summary judgment that </span><a href="https://coingape.com/whales-turn-bullish-on-ripple-xrp-as-sec-case-likely-to-conclude-by-july/"><span style="font-weight: 400">will put an end</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to the legal battle between Ripple Labs Inc and the US SEC yet to be passed, investors are at a crossroads as to whether or not to buy or sell XRP, the token indicted in the suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Binance and Coinbase set to go to court, more uncertainties are now being introduced that can largely upset any potential growth in the near term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exchanges like Robinhood are also beginning to advise their customers of the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-robinhood-becomes-first-exchange-to-delist-ada-matic-and-sol/"><span style="font-weight: 400">imminent delisting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC) and Solana (SOL), three of the new assets the SEC has labeled a security. All these inconsistencies have caused a growing debate to validate the potentials of the declaration of a new bull run by Henrich.</span></p>

The financial dog filled back to back lawsuits against the world’s two biggest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase.

<h2>XRP lawsuit Ruling Will Present Clarity</h2>
<p>Attorney James Murphy, a crypto legal expert <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/MetaLawMan/status/1666864200147251201" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that a ruling in the XRP lawsuit has become more crucial for digital asset linked firms. He added that Judge appointed in Binance and Coinbase lawsuits will likely keep an eye on the Ripple case.</p>
<p>He suggested that if the U.S. District District Court Judge Analisa Torres decides to rule that Ripple’s native crypto, XRP, trading in the secondary market is not “Security”. This will completely undermine the entire basis for the commission’s case against Coinbase. However, some impact this ruling could also put an impact on Binance’s case.</p>
<p>The attorney mentioned that in the Coinbase case, the SEC claims that around 13 tokens traded on the U.S. biggest crypto exchange are securities. However, if these 13 tokens are judged not to be “Security” then the commission holds no case. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More XRP Lawsuit News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>
<h2>Will Conbase Judge Follow Ripple Lawsuit Ruling?</h2>
<p>It is important to note that a district court would not qualify as a “binding precedent” in other cases. This directs that judges in other cases will not be bound to issue ruling in the same manner.</p>
<p>Murphy highlighted that Jennifer Rearden, the judge assigned to the Coinbase case became a Judge recently. He added that the Coinbase judge works in the same court as Judge Analisa Torres. The attorney believes that Judge Rearden will be paying close attention to Judge Torres’s legal reasoning in analyzing whether XRP is a “Security” or not.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Binance coin price shows the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/symmetrical-triangle-pattern/">symmetrical triangle pattern</a> in the daily time frame chart. This pattern consists of two converging trendlines that create a shrinking range and eventually lead to massive upon on the breakout side.</span></p>

<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rise in bullish momentum could lead to a bullish reversal and surge the coin price back to a higher level.

This reversal could offer a short-term trade opportunity and lead the price back to $300 to meet the above trendline.

As the commission-free trading platform </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/cardano-polygon-solana-update/"><span style="font-weight: 400">detailed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the support for these three tokens will end on June 27th, making it the first exchange/brokerage that will delist these digital currencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The announcement shared today confirmed the rumors surrounding Robinhood and the likelihood of it delisting the assets designated as investment contracts by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In light of the update, the trading platform has advised its users to transfer their assets before the due deadline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The exchange said while users will still be able transfer the affected cryptos until the said date, users who refuse to move their funds will have them liquidated at the market rate and the funds will be credited to their Robinhood buying power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Robinhood confirmed that besides these digital currencies, no other crypto trading on its platform will be affected. The trading outfit also reassured its users that their assets are safe on its platform, a confirmation that is necessary to prevent panic selling.</span></p>
<h2><b>Robinhood to Stay on the Right Side of the Law</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not unusual considering the history of the cryptocurrency ecosystem for exchanges to boldly delist tokens that the SEC has tagged as a security. Coinbase exchange which is now under intense scrutiny by the market regulator has also once found itself in this dilemma when it concerns XRP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back in December 2020 when the regulator filed the lawsuit against Ripple Labs, Coinbase exchange </span><a href="https://coingape.com/coinbase-delists-xrp-trading-binance/"><span style="font-weight: 400">delisted the indicted XRP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> coin at the time, coming off as one of the many trading platforms that turned their backs against the digital currency at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For Robinhood, staying on the right side of the law remains its goal and as a brokerage that adopted digital currencies just a few years ago, the loyalty to the affected tokens appears not to have run too deep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What remains to be seen now is the number of exchanges that will join Robinhood in delisting the three tokens.</span></p>

<p>Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta had earlier revealed a text update based platform to rival Twitter soon after Elon Musk’s expensive purchase. Now, a Meta spokesperson confirmed to the BBC that the platform was in development.</p>
<h2>Meta’s Twitter Rival Could Launch This Month</h2>
<p>As per the BBC report, Meta&#8217;s chief product officer Chris Cox said coding was under way on the platform. The tech giant aims to release it soon, although no date was given. However, there is some speculation that it could be as early as the end of June.</p>
<p>Screenshots are circulating on social media which were shown internally to employees, potentially giving an idea of what the text-based app will look like.</p>
<p>Sources within the company confirmed the authenticity of the screenshots to the BBC. If they are, the layout of this new platform will be familiar to anyone who has spent time on Twitter.</p>
<h2>Meta’s new platform may challenge Twitter</h2>
<p>Meta’s text based &#8211; which has a working title of P92 &#8211; could turn out to be a greater rival to Elon Musk&#8217;s Twitter than either <a href="https://coingape.com/jack-dorsey-beta-testing-decentralised-social-app-bluesky-to-rival-twitter/">BlueSky</a> or Mastodon.</p>
<p>While Mastodon and Jack Dorsey’s BlueSky have attracted users that left Twitter, Meta could have an easier time building a huge community for its text-based platform in a shorter time.</p>
<p>Meta claims it has around two billion users, compared to just 300 million of Twitter- although its figures can no longer be verified.</p>
<p>Even if one-fourth of Meta&#8217;s users are coaxed to use its text-based platform, it could easily surpass its rival. However, Elon Musk is also making efforts to scale Twitter by incoprating it into his ambitous everything app called X corp.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto Market News: In what could most likely be an effect of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) lawsuits against two of the top crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase recently, American financial services company Robinhood announced on Friday it would end support to some of the crypto market tokens it is currently offering on <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="https://coingape.com/robinhood-to-delist-cardano-ada-polygon-matic-solana-sol/" title="Robinhood To Delist Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL)"></a></p>

The company said its review of the crypto offerings led to the decision of ending support for Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL), all of which are coincidentally top 10 coins in terms of market size. It remains to be seen if the platform would extend the delisting to some other coins.</p>

<p>All three coins, Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL), however, did not show any immediate reaction to the news of Robinhood delisting, while the crypto market more or less shows a sideways movement, ahead of the US Federal Reserve&#8217;s interest rate decision on June 14, 2023.</p>
<h2>Robinhood Crypto Delisting</h2>
<p>Although the company did not explicity mention that the reason for delisting is the Coinbase and Binance lawsuits, it is speculated that it is most likely the case. On many occasions in the past, the US SEC had recognized several crypto tokens as securities. In the recent lawsuits, the regulatory agency <a href="https://coingape.com/us-sec-calls-these-67-cryptocurrencies-worth-100-billion-as-securities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> as many as 16 new cryptocurrencies to the list of what it deems to be securities, making it a total of 67 tokens. The three cryptocurrencies will no longer be supported on Robinhood crypto from June 27, 2023, the company announced in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/cardano-polygon-solana-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Based on our latest review, we’ve decided to end support for Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL) on June 27th, 2023 at 6:59 PM ET. No other coins are affected and your crypto is still safe on Robinhood.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the platform will continue to support trading of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, among others.</p>

According to Wood&#8217;s analysis, the flagship cryptocurrency could surge to a staggering $1 million by 2030, with its base price currently hovering around $600,000.</p>
<h2>Cathie Wood Maintains Bullish Stance On Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Despite the regulatory challenges and <a href="https://coingape.com/sec-sues-coinbase-exchange-day-after-binance-lawsuit/">lawsuits</a> targeting crypto platforms operating in the United States, Wood remains steadfast in her optimistic outlook. She views Bitcoin as a perfect hedge against inflation and counterparty risk, highlighting its unique attributes. Wood describes Bitcoin&#8217;s creation as a &#8220;very big idea&#8221; and refers to it as the &#8220;first global, private, no government oversight, digital, rule-based monetary system.&#8221;</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Wood has made audacious price predictions for <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>. In a May 2021 interview with Bloomberg, she forecasted that Bitcoin would reach $500,000 by 2026. In early 2022, she further raised the bar, setting the target at $1 million by 2030. Wood&#8217;s unwavering confidence stems from its ability to withstand financial crises, highlighting the recent banking turmoil where Bitcoin&#8217;s price remained resilient, thereby acting as a &#8220;flight to safety&#8221; according to Woods.</p>
<h2>Woods Optimistic Take On Coinbase &amp; Regulations</h2>
<p>Wood has also expressed bullish sentiments regarding Coinbase, the leading cryptocurrency exchange in the United States. In light of recent legal challenges faced by <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/coinbase/">Coinbase</a> and the <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/binance-exchange-review/">Binance exchange</a> amid the U.S. SEC&#8217;s wild crypto crackdowns, Wood differentiated between the two &#8212; asserting that the crypto heavyweights did not belong to the same category. Moreover, Wood maintained her optimism surrounding <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-stocks/COIN/">COIN&#8217;s stock price</a> as evidenced by her recent purchases of the equities.</p>

<p>While speaking about the <a href="https://coingape.com/us-house-releases-stablecoin-bill-bring-clarity-giving-fed-authority/">ongoing proposals</a> and bills presented by Congress to legitimize cryptocurrencies including stablecoins, the 67-year-old investor was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>We now have the Judicial system and the Legislative system getting involved in this topic and I think it&#8217;s great&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, Woods was of the opinion that recent events would eventually pave the way for more regulatory clarity on digital assets and pathways for businesses to register with the concerned authorities.</p>

<h2><strong>Ethereum Price Daily Chart</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethereum fear and greed index at 49% reflect a neutral sentiment in the market </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the influence of the rising support trendline, the ETH price remains bullish in the long term</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $4.47 Billion, indicating a 29% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/a5C1dmZL.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the June 5th sell-off, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">Ethereum price</a> managed to rebound from the muti-month support of $1775 indicating the buyers continue to defend this level. On the flip side, the coin price has recently formed a new lower high of $1915 in its existing downtrend creating a major resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aforementioned level can greatly influence the ETH price and thus created a narrow range. By the press time, this altcoin trades at $1847, with an intraday gain of 0.1%. So far the coin projects no dominance from buyers and sellers for trend control, suggesting the sideways trend is likely to continue for a few more sessions.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, if the market trend turns bearish, a breakdown below $1775 may plunge the prices below $1700 to meet the long-coming support trendline.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, a breakout above $1915 will sign an early sign of a trend change.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Will the Ethereum Price Rise to $2000?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the crypto market showed no improvement in its sentiment, the Ethereum price could carry this range for a week or two. Only a breakout from either level of this range could offer trades a better conviction for potential trends. A possible breakout above $1915 could boost the buying pressure and surge prices above $2000.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Directional Movement Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bearish alignment in which the DI-(orange) slope stays above and DI+(blue) reflects market sentiment in the current negative.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Bollinger Band: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bands of the <a href="https://coingape.com/education/bollinger-band/">BB indicator</a> moving sideways highlight high volatility in the market.</span></li>

Recently, the trend of ICOs (<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/ico-initial-coin-offering/">Initial Coin Offerings</a>) has grabbed the limelight in the crypto space. Crypto ICOs have captured the attention and curiosity of people all around the world, developing as a very intriguing phenomenon. Their potential for huge returns has become the focus of interest for a large crowd. Crypto ICOs have altered the traditional fundraising setting by enabling everyone to dip their hands into innovative ideas and projects without regard for geographical constraints or traditional investment mechanisms.</p>
<h3>What Are Crypto ICOs?</h3>
<p>A crypto initial coin offering (ICO) is a kind of cryptocurrency-based crowdfunding. Companies trade tokens for money from investors. These tokens can be utilized to access the company&#8217;s products or services, or they can be exchanged for profit on exchanges. ICOs have lately emerged as the roads for startups to raise capital, but they have also been criticized for being risky and susceptible to fraud.</p>
<p>Here are some of the major features of ICOs:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are the doors for startups to raise funds without using traditional channels such as venture capital or banks.</li>
<li>As they are based on <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a>, encryptions add a layer of security.</li>
<li>They are frequently utilized as a source to fund new blockchain initiatives.</li>
<li>They can be a bit more risky since there is no certainty that the initiative will succeed.</li>
<li>Overall, crypto ICOs are a unique and creative approach to raising funds. However, they can be titled a high-return investment.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have compiled some of the most exciting crypto ICO that includes upcoming crypt ICOs and new crypto ICOs.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) released a report on Friday (June 9) stating that it is preparing to start establishing a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC). Reportedly, the HKMA has been researching the development of a digital Hong Kong dollar, known as &#8216;e-HKD, since the year 2017.

<p>Reportedly, the HKMA has been researching the development of a <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-btc-supply-moving-fast-to-the-east-will-the-west-pay-for-heavy-regulations/">digital Hong Kong dollar</a>, known as &#8216;e-HKD, since the year 2017.</p>
<p>However, a recent study and feedback obtained from two rounds of market consultation have convinced the authority to initiate the groundwork for potential future implementation of a retail digital currency.</p>
<p>The report said that to explore the implementation and practical applications of a retail <a href="https://coingape.com/coinbase-binance-lawsuit-sec-amicus-crypto-news/">CBDC</a>, the HKMA will reportedly commence its activities to establish the necessary foundations, conduct studies, and initiate pilot programs.</p>
<p>Moreover, this move of HKMA aligns with a global trend, as central banks worldwide are increasingly exploring design options and potential use cases for digital versions of their respective sovereign currencies.</p>
<p>According to the report, the Bank of International Settlements has emphasized that it is important to investigate the digitization of financial systems to preserve stability in the dynamic landscape.</p>
<p>&#8220;While it appears that e-HKD might not have an imminent role to play in the current retail payment market, we believe prospective use cases for e-HKD can emerge quickly out of the rapid evolution, or even revolution, in the digital economy,&#8221; HKMA&#8217;s report further said, according to a portal.</p>
<p>Although the exploration of the blockchain solutions for the e-HKD was proposed in HKMA&#8217;s study, the regulator in its Friday&#8217;s report mentioned that it will be considering &#8216;various factors&#8217; such as policy objectives to steps taken by other jurisdictions&#8217; and further explore feasible solutions technically.</p>

<p>The massive unstaking of Shiba Inu tokens raised speculation in the community about whether the SHIB price to witness another liquidation.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB) Tokens Worth $32 Million Transferred to Binance</h2>
<p>Whale monitoring system Whale Alert in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1667105180020531200" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> on June 9 revealed that 4,000,379,151,023 Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens worth $31,709,005 were released from staking and transferred to Binance.</p>
<p>The Shiba Inu community reacted to the massive transfer to Binance, speculating whether a price drop is coming. Typically, unstaking events of millions of SHIB tokens are normal. However, trillions of SHIB unstaking in a single transaction raise uncertainty as SHIB tokens could be dumped to exchange.</p>
<p>The Shiba Inu community currently awaits the Layer-2 blockchain <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/shibarium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shibarium</a> mainnet launch, expected at the end of the year. Lead developer <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/shytoshi-kusama" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shytoshi Kusama</a> has hinted at the Shibarium launch soon but a lack of updates on the major event impacted SHIB and BONE prices.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, developers are working on other related projects including Shiba Inu Metaverse, cold wallet, and SHIB burn.</p>

The biggest of the cryptocurrencies has printed red indexes over the past 30 days. However, Ripple’s native crypto, <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP price</a> has managed to record a whopping surge over the same period of time, decoupling from the recent market sentiments.</p>

<h2>XRP Beats Bitcoin, Ethereum</h2>
<p>The global crypto market cap took a major hit this week as the U.S. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/securities-and-exchange-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) filed <a href="https://coingape.com/coinbase-us-sec-lawsuit-crypto-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charges against Binance and Coinbasse</a>, two of the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchanges, for allegedly violating operational rules. The cumulative market cap stands at around $1.1 trillion.</p>
<p>However, XRP Token which is also facing legal complications from the U.S. SEC has managed to perform a decoupling trick in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>XRP price registered a surge of almost 25% over the past 30 days outperforming the world’s two biggest crypto Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). As per the data, Bitcoin and Ethereum prices declined by 4% and 1%, respectively. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More XRP News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>

<h2>Ripple Lawsuit Updates Backs Price Rally</h2>
<p>Ripple’s native crypto is riding on an upward trend posting huge gains since the beginning of 2023. XRP price surging by 44% in the last 90 days depicts the investors’ positive sentiments toward the token. However, this massive price rally for the token comes after the U.S. District Court produced several rulings in favor of Ripple in the U.S. SEC lawsuit.</p>
<p>After the recent U.S. SEC attack on the crypto market, industry experts and leaders are eagerly waiting for the release of crucial Hinman Speech documents and emails which allegedly concluded that Ether (ETH) is not a security.</p>

Thus, the largest cryptocurrency-Bitcoin may see a temporary consolidation, but the short-term downtrend is still intact. This downward trajectory is governed by a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wedge-pattern/">wedge pattern</a> indicating the coin price could plunge lower before a significant upswing. </span></p>

<h2><b>Bitcoin Price Daily Chart</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The formation of a falling wedge pattern reflects a gradual decrease in bearish momentum.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakout above the overhead resistance trendline is needed to trigger a bullish recovery.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $12.2 Billion, indicating a 22% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/n/nEJPsNrc.png" alt="Bitcoin Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last few days, the buyers and sellers attempted to overthrow each other but failed to attain complete domination. Amid this uncertainty, it is valid to rely on short-term trends to determine the near future projection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the influence of a falling wedge pattern, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">Bitcoin price</a> has witnessed a correction phase over the past months, constantly wobbling between two converging trendlines. Thus, until the pattern’s downsloping trendline is intact, the coin may see a further correction and could plunge to the $24000 mark this month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the flip side, buyers can rely on these two factors to maintain a bullish outlook first, the wedge pattern which is known as an uptrend continuation setup and could offer a considerable recovery upon the breakout of the resistance trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, the long-coming support trendline can offer significant pullback opportunities.</span></p>
<h2><b>Will Bitcoin Price Plunge to $24000?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the broader market sentiment remains indecisive, the BTC price gradually slides to lower levels. The potential downfall will likely hit the next significant support at $25000, followed by $24000.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Moving Average Convergence Divergence: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narrow swings and several crossovers between the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) and signal(orange) line reflect current market uncertainty.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Super trend: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The red film projected by this daily indicator accentuates the bearish market trend.</span></li>
