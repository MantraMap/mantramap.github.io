<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>The SEC’s claims that SOL, ADA, and MATIC are securities were met with stiff disagreement by the development foundation of each token.</li><li>Following their statements last week, investors seemed to steady their feet as prices rebounded slightly on Monday.</li><li>SOL, ADA, and MATIC market values initially dropped after the SEC sued Binance and Coinbase for violating U.S. securities laws.</li></ul>



<p>Crypto Foundation to the SEC’s claim that tokens Solana’s SOL, Cardano’s ADA, and Polygon’s MATIC are Securities, saying that they are in fact not securities at all. </p>



<p>Following the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase for offering unregistered securities trading to American investors, the market prices of these tokens slumped amid a broader decline in the crypto market last week. </p>



<p>Crypto and Equities trading provider Robinhood <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/robinhood-delist-ada-matic-sol-sec/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/robinhood-delist-ada-matic-sol-sec/" rel="noreferrer noopener">delisted</a> SOL, ADA, and MATIC after the U.S. financial watchdog classified the tokens as securities, shaking investor confidence in these assets. </p>



<p>Market makers and institutional investors like Jump Trading and Cumberland transferred millions of dollars in Polygon&#8217;s MATIC to trading venues, further prompting fears of a sell-off that triggered a further price drop.</p>



<p>These tokens have since recovered slightly in price along with crypto asset values as proponents and development foundations push back against the SEC&#8217;s war on crypto. </p>



<h2>SOL, ADA, AND MATIC Are Not Securities, Foundations Fight Back</h2>



<p>On June 11, MATIC developer Polygon Labs refuted the SEC&#8217;s claims without directly addressing the watchdog. &#8220;developed outside the US, deployed outside the US&#8221;, the startup said concerning MATIC in a bid to debunk allegations that the token is a security. MATIC was up 3% at press time and traded around $0.63 on markets. </p>

<p>The Solana Foundation &#8220;disagrees with the characterization of SOL as a security&#8221;, a thread <a href="https://twitter.com/SolanaFndn/status/1667578529612017666?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/SolanaFndn/status/1667578529612017666?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published</a> on June 10 reads. In addition, the SOL Foundation does not expect the SEC&#8217;s claims will disrupt developer activity. The Foundation also called on U.S. policymakers to focus clearer rules for the benefit of investors and providers alike.  The coin was down 1.02% on Monday, per CMC data.</p>



<p>&#8220;Under no circumstances was ADA a security,&#8221; said Cardano developer IOG on June 9. IOD added that the SEC&#8217;s claims were riddled with inaccuracies. ADA exchanged hands for $0.27, up over 4% over a 24-hour period, TradingView data showed.</p>



<p>SOL, ADA, and MATIC are three tokens in a basket of cryptos classified as securities by the U.S. SEC in lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase. Aside from the price dip that followed the news of the suits and delisting on Robinhood, it&#8217;s yet unclear the ramifications of the SEC&#8217;s claims that certain cryptocurrencies are securities and must be registered with the commission. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Data from Blockchain Intelligence startup Nansen shows a steady increase in the number of staked ETH.</li><li>So far, users and entities have locked over 22 million coins which amount to about 18% of the token’s supply.</li><li>At the same time, balances in crypto exchanges are declining and now sit below 30 million tokens. </li><li>Analysts say the Shapella upgrade eliminated concerns around withdrawals and triggered a boom in locked tokens since stakers can earn rewards as opposed to just holding their coins.</li></ul>



<p>The number of staked ETH continues to increase following the release of Shapella which enabled withdrawals for locked coins on Ethereum’s Beacon chain.</p>



<p>Following the Merge &#8211; Ethereum’s massive technological transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake &#8211; proponents were concerned about withdrawal functionality and possible selling pressure on the market.</p>



<p>Both concerns were rendered non-events, said Nansen’s Martin Lee as Shapella galvanized users and entities alike to stake more tokens. </p>



<p>At press time, the number of staked coins crossed 22 million tokens. This amounts to around 18% of the available supply. The Merge also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ether-daily-issuance-dips-ethereum-merge/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ether-daily-issuance-dips-ethereum-merge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slashed emissions</a> meaning that fewer tokens are released per block as <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/2billion-ethereum-rewards-unlock-shapella/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/2billion-ethereum-rewards-unlock-shapella/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rewards</a>, taking ETH into a deflationary state.</p>



<h2>ETH On Exchanges </h2>



<p>At the time when staked tokens continue on the upswing, token balances on crypto exchanges have steadily declined. Balances in crypto exchanges have dropped below 30 million, per Nansen data.</p>



<p>One reason for this could be that entities are more likely to stake their token now that withdrawals are enabled rather than simply hodl the asset. </p>



<p>Analysts opine that the staking incentive is greater now since withdrawals are possible and stakers can earn yield or rewards for locking their tokens. In contrast, holding the token on crypto exchanges earns no yield.</p>

<p>Following lawsuits from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against Binance and Coinbase, crypto prices fell across the board. Traders were able to scoop up tokens around $1,740 a pop during trading hours on Monday. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Venture Capital behemoth Andreessen Horowitz announced its first office outside the U.S. set to open later this year.</li><li>The A16z office led by General Partner, Sriram Krishnan will be stationed in London as a strategic investment point for growing the UK’s web3 ecosystem.</li><li>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak praised the move as the nation looks to develop into a global hub for blockchain innovation and Web3 businesses.</li></ul>



<p>Andreessen Horowitz (A16z) <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/announcement/expanding-uk-andreessen-horowitz/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/announcement/expanding-uk-andreessen-horowitz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> a London office scheduled to open later in the year amid growing crypto regulatory uncertainty in the U.S.</p>



<p>The London office is A16z&#8217;s first office outside the U.S. and will be led by general partner Sriram Krishnan. According to the venture capital heavyweight, London serves as an aqueduct for funding and growing the UK’s burgeoning Web3 ecosystem.</p>



<p>A16z also noted the UK’s efforts towards introducing clear rules for crypto and bringing Web3 innovation under the purview of financial regulatory oversight. </p>



<p>“We believe that the UK is on the right path to becoming a leader in crypto regulation,” A16z said, adding that there is still work to be done to achieve this vision. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The UK also has deep pools of talent, world-leading academic institutions, and a strong entrepreneurial culture. It is home to more “unicorns” than Germany, France, and Sweden combined; to some of the world’s largest financial markets and pools of capital; and to highly-sophisticated, world-class regulators. All of these make the UK strongly positioned to lead in web3.</p></blockquote>



<p>The Venture Capital giant already opened its pockets to UK Web3 projects, recently leading a $43 million Series A for Gensyn. Gensyn provides computing power for artificial intelligence (AI) projects by harnessing blockchain technology.</p>



<p>Notably, A16z’s expansion to the UK does not mean the company plans to abandon the U.S. Instead the venture capitalist plans to explore other markets while lobbying for clearer crypto rules in the U.S.</p>



<h2>Be Welcome A16z, Prime Minister Sunak Praises UK Expansion</h2>



<p>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hailed the move as a step toward growing the UK into a global Web3 innovation hub. </p>



<p>Last year, PM Sunak <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/rishi-sunak-appointed-as-uk-pm-could-be-the-next-step-towards-uk-becoming-the-crypto-hub/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/rishi-sunak-appointed-as-uk-pm-could-be-the-next-step-towards-uk-becoming-the-crypto-hub/" rel="noreferrer noopener">pushed</a> for crypto regulations in a bid to position the UK as a leader in blockchain and crypto development. Policymakers in the UK have since <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/uk-fca-unveils-stricter-rules-for-crypto/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/uk-fca-unveils-stricter-rules-for-crypto/" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviewed advertising rules</a> and licensing regimes to protect investors without stifling growth within the local Web3 economy. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We must embrace new innovations like Web3, powered by blockchain technology, which will enable start-ups to flourish here and grow the economy.</p></blockquote>

<p>The judge overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings of <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/judge-extends-genesis-mediation-period/">FTX </a>has ruled that the identity of the defunct crypto exchange’s customers will remain undisclosed. The ruling addressed the repeated demands by leading media houses, including Bloomberg and the Financial Times to get the names of the exchange’s customers out to the public, arguing that they had a legitimate and compelling interest in knowing the names of those affected by the exchange’s collapse. </p>



<h2><strong>Revealing FTX Customers&#8217; Names May Hurt Asset Sales Process</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ftx-customer-names-will-not-be-revealed-by-bankruptcy-court-2023-06-09/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a>, U.S Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey has granted FTX’s request to permanently redact the names of individual customers from its bankruptcy filings. During the hearing, lawyers representing the exchange argued that publishing the names of customers would jeopardize them by exposing them to potential identity theft, among other risks. The latest ruling came six months after the bankruptcy judge initially allowed FTX to keep the names of its 9 million customers hidden. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;It is the customers who are the most important issue in this case. We want to make sure that they are protected and they don&#8217;t fall victim to any types of scams.&#8221; </p><cite>U.S Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey</cite></blockquote>



<p>Judge Dorsey also allowed FTX to hide the names of companies and institutional investors temporarily. However, the exchange would have to make a new request after 90 days in order to keep those names undisclosed. Perella Weinberg Partners, the investment bank hired to sell the bankrupt crypto exchange’s remaining assets, told the judge that disclosing customers’ names would hurt the sales process. “My belief is that disclosure of the names, regardless of who disclosed them, would degrade value,” said Kevin Cofsky, a partner at Perella Weinberg.</p>

<ul><li>The CFTC has won a lawsuit against OokiDAO through a default judgment in its favor.</li><li>The regulator’s victory sets a critical precedent for DeFi that DAOs could be held liable for violations as a person.&nbsp;</li><li>OokiDAO has been ordered to pay a penalty of $643,542 and cease all operations.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In a major blow to the decentralized finance space, OokiDAO has lost the lawsuit filed against it by the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-official-settlement-binance-lawsuit/">CFTC</a>). A federal judge handed the victory to the CFTC by entering a default judgment against the decentralized autonomous organization after it failed to respond to the commodities regulator’s enforcement action. </p>



<h2><strong>OokiDAO’s Loss Set A Critical Precedent For Lawsuits Against DAOs</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8715-23" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> by the CFTC earlier today, the Commission’s victory in the lawsuit set a critical precedent for decentralized autonomous organizations that attempt to evade liability and regulatory scrutiny for their actions. The ruling by U.S. District Judge William H. Orrick paved the way for DAOs to be held liable for legal violations as a &#8220;person&#8221; under the Commodity Exchange Act. The judgment will likely be cited in future lawsuits against decentralized entities. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This decision should serve as a wake-up call to anyone who believes they can circumvent the law by adopting a DAO structure, intending to insulate themselves from law enforcement and ultimately putting the public at risk.” </p><cite>Ian McGinley, Director of CFTC’s Division of Enforcement</cite></blockquote>



<p>Judge Orrick has ordered OokiDAO to pay a monetary penalty of $643,542 and immediately suspend all operations and shut down its website. The DeFi exchange has also been banned from conducting business with any CFTC-registered entity. The CFTC sued OokiDAO in September last year for operating an illegal trading platform and unlawfully acting as a futures commission merchant. The regulator’s complaint accused the DeFi exchange of offering leveraged and margined commodities transactions without ensuring compliance with KYC rules.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>The U.S. Department of Justice has charged two Russian nationals for hacking Mt Gox and laundering the stolen crypto.&nbsp;</li><li>The two Russians have been accused of stealing some 647,000 BTC between 2011 and 2014.&nbsp;</li><li>The Russians are facing two charges, conspiracy to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money service business.&nbsp;</li><li>If convicted, the defendants could be sentenced to a combined penalty of 45 years in prison.</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Department of Justice’s Criminal Division, along with the Southern District of New York and the Northern District of California, has filed charges against two Russian nationals in connection with the hacking of Mt Gox and the subsequent theft of BTC from the exchange. Charges against Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner were unsealed earlier today. </p>



<h2><strong>Mt Gox Hackers Face Over 25 Years In Prison</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/russian-nationals-charged-hacking-one-cryptocurrency-exchange-and-illicitly-operating" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, the case against the two Russian nationals has been divided into two, namely, the SDNY case and the NDCA case. As per the allegations in the indictment unsealed in the Southern District of New York, the two Russians and their accomplices gained unauthorized access to Mt Gox’s servers in 2011. This was followed by fraudulent transactions where BTC was transferred to wallets controlled by Verner and Bilyuchenko. </p>



<p>The illegal transfers took place between September 2011 and May 2014, during which the Russians along with their accomplices, transferred at least 647,000 BTC out of Mt Gox. As per today’s rates, the stolen BTC would be valued at $17 billion. The Russians managed to launder more than 300,000 BTC through a New York-based <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-nfts-added-to-binance-marketplace/">Bitcoin</a> Broker. As per the allegations in the indictment unsealed in the Northern District of California, Bilyuchenko worked with Alexander Vinnik and other accomplices to run an illegal Bitcoin exchange between 2011 and 2017. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>These indictments highlight the department’s unwavering commitment to bring to justice bad actors in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and prevent the abuse of the financial system.” </p><cite>Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr.</cite></blockquote>



<p>In the SDNY case, both Russian nationals have been charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted, they face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. The NDCA charged Bilyuchenko with conspiracy to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money services business, which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison.</p>

<p>Robinhood Markets Inc. has decided to delist three crypto tokens from its online trading platform in light of recent developments in the crypto market. The tokens, Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL), were named in the lawsuits filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gary-gensler-crypto-firms-flouting-rules/">SEC</a>) against Binance and Coinbase earlier this week. All three tokens were described as securities in the complaints. </p>



<h2><strong>Robinhood Will Delist The Tokens on June 27</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/cardano-polygon-solana-update/?irclickid=Xm0VJJ0DHxyPTb52F0Qo3RxnUkF0tBVsZ2m52g0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;utm_source=impact&amp;utm_campaign=10078&amp;utm_content=Skimbit%20Ltd.&amp;utm_term=1375188" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> by Robinhood, the decision to end support for ADA, MATIC, and SOL was taken after conducting a review of the platform’s crypto offerings. The tokens will be removed from the online trading platform on June 27, 2023, at 6:59 PM ET. The discount brokerage assured its customers that the extent of the delisting was limited to just those three tokens. </p>



<p>In the meantime, the platform’s customers will be allowed to buy, sell and hold ADA, MATIC, and SOL. Following the June 27 deadline, all ADA, MATIC, and SOL will be sold at market value. The proceeds will be transferred to the customers’ wallets. Earlier this week, Robinhood’s Chief Legal Compliance testified before the U.S. House Committee for Agriculture where he revealed that when the firm attempted to register itself with the SEC as a special purpose broker-dealer, they were met with unhelpful conduct. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The legislative branch needs to lead by passing commonsense, consumer-oriented legislation to restore clarity and integrity to the US crypto markets.” </p><cite>Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano </cite></blockquote>



<p>Commenting on Robinhood’s decision to delist ADA, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson told Fox Business that the blame goes to the country’s regulators for creating an environment of fear where there is a lack of clarity and contradictory guidance instead of collaboration with rule makers. According to Hoskinson, entities will leave markets if regulators continue their hostile stance towards crypto.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Binance US is suspending USD deposits on its trading platform effective immediately. The crypto exchange has revealed that its banking partners are preparing to pause fiat (USD) withdrawal channels as early as June 13, 2023. The American arm of the world’s largest crypto exchange blamed the deposit and withdrawal suspension on the enforcement action initiated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance US Blames SEC’s Extremely Aggressive and Intimidating Tactics</strong></h2>



<p>Binance US took to <a href="https://twitter.com/BinanceUS/status/1666996908651323393" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> a little while ago to inform its customers about the latest developments regarding its online trading platform. The exchange accused the SEC of using extremely aggressive and intimidating tactics in pursuit of its “ideological campaign against the American digital asset industry.”. According to the crypto giant’s American arm, the legal troubles and complications stemming from the securities regulator’s actions have led to challenges with the banks that the exchange works with. </p>



<p>The crypto exchange stated that in the interest of consumer protection, it will suspend USD deposits today and transition to a “crypto-only” exchange. All customers are being encouraged to withdraw their fiat assets from the American exchange before June 13, 2023. The exchange warned that due to elevated volumes and weekend bank closures, the withdrawal process may take longer than usual. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-changpeng-zhao-summoned-dc-court/">Binance</a> US will start delisting USD trading pairs, including BTC/USD starting next week.

<p>Leading crypto custodian BitGo has reached a preliminary agreement to acquire rival firm Prime Trust.

The funding round saw participation from Kraken Ventures, Fin Capital, FIS, and Mercato Partners.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>BitGo’s Deal To Acquire Prime Trust Subject To Regulatory Approval </strong></h2>

The crypto <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-sings-licensing-deal-bitpanda/">custody</a> firm signed a term sheet to acquire Prime Trust’s parent firm,<em> </em>Prime Core Technologies Inc. This acquisition made BitGo the first global digital asset company to provide a full suite of solutions for institutions and fintech platforms. The deal is subject to regulatory approval. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>No other company will have the breadth of product and services nor depth of experience that this combined company would have. We are excited to offer our world-class infrastructure within a broader ecosystem and revolutionize the future of crypto.” </p><cite>Jor Law, Prime Trust’s Interim CEO, and President</cite></blockquote>



<p>BitGo, which is backed by the likes of Goldman Sachs, Digital Currency Group, DRW, and Galaxy Digital Ventures, processes approximately 20% of all global Bitcoin transactions by value and caters to over 1500 institutional clients around the world. As per the acquisition deal, Prime Trust’s Nevada Trust Company will join BitGo’s existing global network of regulated trust companies in multiple jurisdictions, including Germany and Switzerland.

<p>Gary Gensler, Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has responded to the crypto industry’s backlash in light of recent enforcement actions initiated by his agency. Gensler defended the actions of the SEC and blamed crypto firms in the country for “flouting” rules. The SEC Chair also responded to the industry’s claims of having no way to register with the securities regulator.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Gary Gensler Denies Allegations of Crushing the Crypto Industry</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-sec-chair-says-crypto-companies-made-calculated-decision-flout-rules-2023-06-08/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a>, Gary Gensler has accused the crypto firms of making a “calculated economic decision” to flout the rules set by his agency. The SEC chair alleged that crypto firms decided to take the risk of enforcement as the cost of conducting business in the United States. Gensler believes that crypto entities that got hit with enforcement actions had legal trouble coming. He indicated that firms that don’t comply with the rules will attract enforcement action. </p>



<p>SEC Chair Gensler’s comments came during the Piper Sandler Global Exchange and Fintech Conference earlier today. During his speech, he pushed back against the crypto industry’s allegations of him using the agency to crush them. He also stated that contrary to the industry’s repeated demands, there was no need for legislation from Congress for regulating the crypto space.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We’ve issued a reopening release that reiterated the applicability of existing rules to platforms that trade crypto assets securities, including so-called DeFi systems, that’s already the law. That’s already the rule. Not liking the law, not liking the rules is different than not hearing it or not getting it.”  </p><cite>Gary Gensler, Chairman of the SEC</cite></blockquote>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gary-gensler-us-no-more-digital-currency/">Gary Gensler</a> reiterated his long-standing controversial stance on crypto securities and stated that the majority of the crypto tokens out there qualified as security. For those who claimed that there was no way to comply with the SEC’s rules, Gensler detailed how crypto firms could register themselves with the regulator and highlighted potential exemptions that may be granted to operators who meet certain criteria. </p>
