<li>The price is now trading above $0.300 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $0.30 on the 4-hours chart (data feed via Coinbase).</li>

</ul>
<p><em>Cardano’s price is rising above $0.300 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-restart-rally-above-this-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. ADA price could resume its rally if there is a clear move above the $0.335 resistance.</em></p>
<h2>Cardano Price (ADA) Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, Cardano’s price started a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cardano-ada-price-analysis-is-the-recovery-just-getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steady increase above the $0.335 resistance zone</a> against the US Dollar. The ADA/USD pair gained pace for a move above the $0.350 and $0.365 levels.</p>
<p>The price tested the $0.380 zone. A high was formed near $0.3801 and the price is now correcting lower. There was a move below the $0.350 support zone. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2850 swing low to the $0.3801 high.</p>
<p>However, ADA price is now trading above $0.30 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.320 zone.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $0.335 zone. A clear move above the $0.335 resistance might start a strong increase toward $0.365. Any more gains above the $0.365 resistance might send Cardano toward the $0.380 resistance or even $0.40.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support is near the $0.305 level. It is near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2850 swing low to the $0.3801 high.</p>
<p>The next major support is near the $0.300 level. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $0.30 on the 4-hours chart. A clear move below the $0.30 level might send Cardano toward the $0.275 level. Any more losses might send the price toward the $0.250 support.</p>

<li>ETH price is now trading near $1,900 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,890 on the 4-hour chart (data feed from Coinbase).</li>

</ul>
<p><em>Ethereum price is consolidating above the $1,850 level against the US Dollar. ETH/USD could rise again if it clears the $1,950 resistance zone.</em></p>
<h2>Ethereum Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, Ethereum saw a bearish wave from the $2,030 zone against the US Dollar. ETH price declined below the $1,950 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>The bears even pushed the price below the $1,900 level. A low was formed near $1,873 and the price is now attempting a fresh increase. There was a move above the $1,900 resistance level. The price broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,029 swing high to the $1,873 low.</p>
<p>It is now trading near $1,900 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-aims-fresh-run-to-2000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $1,920 level. The next major resistance is near the $1,950 zone.</p>
<p>The 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,029 swing high to the $1,873 low is also near the trend line. A clear move above the $1,950 level could send the price toward $1,975. Any more gains could even send the price toward the $2,030 resistance zone or $2,080 in the near term.</p>
<p>On the downside, initial support is near the $1,890 level. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,890 on the 4-hour chart. The next major support is now near the $1,880 level. A break below the $1,880 support could push the price to $1,822. Any more losses could lead the price toward $1,780 or even $1,720 in the coming days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin bull and hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz is again in <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-and-ether-may-be-better-bets-than-jp-morgan-stock-on-a-risk-adjusted-basis-says-michael-novogratz/ar-AA1bZKZl">the news trying to tell</a> everyone that bitcoin and Ethereum are the best long-term investments anyone can take part in.</p>
<h2>Mike Novogratz Still Loves Bitcoin</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, Novogratz took issue with the trading volumes for both cryptocurrencies, which appear to be somewhat down at the time of writing. He said bitcoin and Ethereum are the best items a person can invest in over the next several years, and he believes both digital currencies are going to put major stocks for big-time financial firms like JPMorgan to shame. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>You shouldn’t buy as much bitcoin as you do JPMorgan stock, but volatility adjusted, it’s been a much better bet than JPMorgan.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s interesting that Novogratz would bring up volatility in the above quote <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/report-bitcoin-volatility-lowest-in-three-years/">given volatility for bitcoin</a> has allegedly sunk to its lowest point in roughly three years. The currency has been on something of a roll since the start of 2023, and while there have been little hiccups along the way, the asset is up about 65 percent from where it ended 2022 (arguably the worst year on record for crypto).</p>
<p>Still, this doesn’t change the fact that a lot of room for healing remains. The currency, back in November of 2021, was trading for about $68,000 per unit (a new all-time high), but it fell into the mid-$16K range just over a year later. While the asset may be up more than 60 percent from where it was at the end of 2022, there’s still another 60 percent to go if it wants to be back where it was two Novembers ago.</p>
<p>The good news, according to Novogratz, is that bitcoin has endured something of a tight range over the past few months. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>You could pierce either side of the range and have a quick move.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also said he’s certain bitcoin will endure another major rally as soon as the Fed agrees to end its rate hikes to curb inflation. However, his one serious complaint was that many institutions are still refusing to get involved in bitcoin, claiming:</p>
<blockquote><p>That’s stopped by a combination of Sam and Gary.</p></blockquote>
<p>He is, of course, referring to Sam Bankman-Fried – the disgraced executive of fallen crypto exchange FTX – and Gary Gensler, the persecuting leader of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<h2>An AI Bubble Has Hit the U.S.</h2>
<p>He also pointed out another problem and said the U.S. is trapped in an AI bubble, something he thinks will last a while. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bubbles always happened around things that fundamentally changed the way we live. They’ve almost happened around the real thing. The story is so powerful, and people buy way in advance and get caught up in the frenzy.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cheelee.io/">Cheelee</a>, a GameFi short video platform, emerged as a game-changer by introducing a groundbreaking concept – the delivery of basic income to people all over the globe by watching feed.</p>
<p>What sets Cheelee apart from traditional social media is its unique approach to distributing revenue. Instead of distributing solely to content makers, Cheelee introduced an innovative economic model that redistributed wealth back to its users, who watch feed. This concept harnessed social networks&#8217; potential to propel financial empowerment.</p>
<h4>Web3 Social Media Landscape</h4>
<p>In the constantly changing Web3 social network ecosystem, several crypto startups have emerged as notable players, including Cheelee, Steemit, Minds, Akasha, Synereo, and Indorse. Cheelee stands out nonetheless because of its original concept. While other SocialFi platforms require content production for monetization, Cheelee has revolutionized the landscape by allowing ordinary users to become beneficiaries.</p>
<p>By adhering to the philosophy of the Attention Economy, Cheelee compensates its participants for their active engagement and time spent consuming the platform`s content. With the help of this ground-breaking strategy, Cheelee is gaining more and more prominence because it has made it possible for a larger proportion of social media users to profit financially from their involvement.</p>
<h4>Cheelee Pays You For Watching Feeds</h4>
<p>Unlike its competitors, Cheelee thanks to its well-developed GameFi mechanics, allows users to earn on watching feeds. By purchasing and upgrading Digital (formerly NFT) glasses, everyone can get X2 income in tokens.</p>
<p>Cheelee&#8217;s introduction of basic income has far-reaching socioeconomic implications. By ensuring a minimum level of income for all its users, Cheelee addresses issues such as poverty, unemployment, and economic instability.</p>
<p>“We want Cheelee to be the tool that enables every mobile phone owner to make money from their attention,” Cheelee CEO and founder Ruslan Sharov says. “We see our mission as some kind of countering the trend when AI takes jobs from people. We&#8217;ve created an app where any user can start earning money steadily. You can support a household, study, or start your first business with this income. In our app, high technologies are applied in the interests of humanity”.</p>
<h4>How to Start Earning in Cheelee</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sign up and get free Digital Glasses;</li>
<li>Watch the feed and get boxes with LEE tokens;</li>
<li>Buy Digital Glasses and get LEE tokens while watching the feed;</li>
<li>Upgrade Digital Glasses and choose the best strategy for earning.</li>
</ul>
<p>The marketplace lists the Digital glasses for between $51.5 and $1854. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/Cheelee_Tweet/status/1664290755567841283?s=20">reports</a> from Cheelee users on the project&#8217;s social networks, the revenue generated while utilizing this tool may be x1,8-2,2. Users may earn quite a substantial income after investing their initial earnings into leveling up their existing glasses and purchasing additional ones. When their glasses reach high levels, their earnings in Cheelee can eventually become their basic income.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Cheelee&#8217;s breakthrough highlights social media&#8217;s enormous potential as a force for positive change. By merging technology, connectivity, and economic empowerment, Cheelee has paved the way for a future where SocialFi platforms can serve as catalysts for socioeconomic progress. The success of Cheelee&#8217;s approach also provides a chance for legislators and governments to reassess the notion of basic income and look for ways to implement it outside of the digital realm.</p>
<p>Cheelee&#8217;s advent in 2023 marked a groundbreaking moment in the evolution of social networks and economic empowerment. By reinventing the income distribution paradigm, Cheelee has transformed social media from a source of mere entertainment into a tool for socioeconomic progress.</p>

<h2>Nansen Says Goodbye to Many Employees</h2>
<p>2022 was marred by news of many large crypto firms and companies laying off employees. Big names like Gemini in New York and Coinbase joined the ranks, with the latter initially putting off plans to triple its workforce. Originally, Coinbase had the goal to become bigger than ever in 2022 and hire loads more people. Sadly, the state of bitcoin and its many altcoin cousins brought <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-says-its-freezing-all-2022-hiring-plans/">about a quick end to</a> those plans.</p>
<p>When things got even worse in the market, Coinbase said it <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-says-its-laying-off-several-employees/">would be laying</a> off roughly 18 percent of its staff. Several months went by, but eventually, a time came when Coinbase <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-forced-to-release-1000-more-people-from-employment/">was forced to let go</a> of even more people.</p>
<p>Gemini also engaged in <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/gemini-exchange-engages-in-more-layoffs/">two separate layoffs</a>. The first was in the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/gemini-exchange-says-major-layoffs-are-coming/">summer of last year</a>. The company announced it was going to let go of roughly ten percent of the people that it had employed. News spread quickly that the headcount with Gemini fell from about 1,000 people (per its LinkedIn page) to around 900.</p>
<p>However, many people took issue with the idea that Gemini was going to be engaging in the layoffs through Zoom calls rather than through in-person meetings. The company was still having many staff members work remotely following the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/coronavirus/">coronavirus pandemic</a>, and many of the layoffs were to occur via video screens.</p>
<p>2022 was arguably the worst year on record for BTC and crypto. The world’s number one digital currency by market cap initially surged beyond $68,000 per unit in November of 2021, a new all-time high, though about a year later, the currency had fallen into the mid-$16K region.</p>
<p>Several other digital assets followed in its footsteps, thus causing the crypto arena to lose more than $2 trillion in valuation in less than 12 months.</p>
<p>Nansen has suddenly joined the ongoing layoff ranks. The firm, like Coinbase, has also said that all plans to hire additional souls have been put on hold. CEO Alex Svanevik explained in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>We wanted to invest and build in a tough market when others needed to scale back. This organic growth led the organization to taking on surface area that&#8217;s not truly part of Nansen&#8217;s core strategy. The new org will do fewer things but do them extremely well.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The News Follows Heavy Growth</h2>
<p>The news comes as somewhat of a shock given that Nansen – per its LinkedIn profile – has grown rapidly over the past few years.</p>
<p>The company currently has about 155 people working under its roof. This is a 180 percent surge from where it stood just a little over a year ago.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Louis and Arlene Byrd are a married couple that bought a home a few years back. The trouble was that their purchase didn’t satisfy them. This led <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/husband-wife-bought-home-lemon-164228206.html">them to create</a> their own real estate company on the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/blockchain/">blockchain</a>.</p>
<h2>Louis and Arlene Byrd Establish Blockchain Real Estate Firm</h2>
<p>Known as Kataba, the company came about after the couple said their home was too “racially segregated.” They dealt with several bad contractors and other issues that caused them to sell the property at a huge loss. Louis Byrd commented in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>We also ended up dealing with one of the nation’s largest mortgage servicers that violated a lot of things related to that loan product, and we’re in an ongoing litigation with that right now as we speak. We were able to sell that house in the ‘as is’ condition, meaning that we weren’t able to actually benefit from the housing.</p></blockquote>
<p>They eventually bought a separate home which they felt was solid, but within two weeks, the property had turned into a nightmare for the couple. Louis said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Long story short, we ended up buying a lemon. We did everything right. We did the inspections. We toured the house. We looked at the seller’s disclosure. The seller basically said that they did all this work, and we ended up finding out two weeks in we had a major leak coming from our third floor. It turned out to be a simple repair that could have easily cost about $15, and maybe 20 minutes of time to fix, but [it] turned into a $2,500 repair.</p></blockquote>
<p>After six months, the pair had spent over $10K on repairs. This led them to believe that the real estate industry was in desperate need of change, and they had the initiative to create that change. Louis said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We said there has to be a better way to do real estate with more transparency and more honesty in the process.</p></blockquote>
<p>The goal of their new firm Kataba is to erase all doubts about a property’s state or condition. The company also seeks to make homebuying considerably easier. The closing process can be completed within mere minutes instead of hours. There are also larger opportunities for financing granted someone can’t pay for a home in cash.</p>
<h2>Boosting Access for All</h2>
<p>Louis said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our digital ledger, that’s probably the most important part because the goal for Kataba is for it to be doing the full experience for home buying where you can shop, buy, sell, and then upkeep. We’re launching with the upkeep aspect because since it is a marketplace, you [must] have people there for people to come and buy. So, we’re starting with existing homeowners so they can have this ledger block system where they can go in and input this data.</p></blockquote>

<li>The pair could start a major increase if there is a clear move above the $0.1420 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Stellar lumen price is trading above $0.1250 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-restart-rally-above-this-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. XLM price must clear $0.1420 to start a fresh increase.</em></p>
<h2>Stellar Lumen Price Analysis (XLM to USD)</h2>
<p>This past week, Stellar lumen price saw a major rally above the $0.10 resistance against the US Dollar. The XLM/USD pair rallied above $0.150 before it started a downside correction.</p>
<p>It traded as high as $0.1970 before the price dipped below $0.1500. A low is formed near $0.1254 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is now trading above $0.120 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/stellar-lumen-xlm-price-eyes-another-increase-above-0-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.134 on the 4-hour chart.</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $0.134 zone and the trend line. The next major resistance is near the $0.1420 level. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1970 swing high to the $0.1254 low.</p>
<p>A clear move above the $0.1420 level might send the price toward the $0.160 level. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1970 swing high to the $0.1254 low.</p>
<p>Any more gains could lead the price toward the $0.180 level or even $0.1950. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1250 level. The main support is near the $0.120 zone. Any more losses could lead the price toward the $0.1085 level in the near term, below which the price might even retest $0.100.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Ripple price is consolidating near $0.750 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-restart-rally-above-this-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. XRP price must stay above the $0.70 support to start a fresh increase.</em></p>
<h2>Ripple Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, Ripple price started a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ripple-price-analysis-xrp-could-struggle-above-0-485/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major rally</a> above the $0.50 resistance. It even rallied toward $1.00 before it saw a downside correction against the US Dollar. The XRP/USD pair declined below the $0.850 level.</p>
<p>There was a drop below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4681 swing low to the $0.9479 high. However, the price found support near the $0.70 zone. It is now trading above $0.650 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance near $0.775 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair. The bulls seem to be protecting the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4681 swing low to the $0.9479 high.</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is facing resistance near $0.775. The next major resistance is near the $0.780 level. A clear move above the $0.780 resistance zone might start a strong increase.</p>
<p>In the stated case, the price could even surpass the $0.80 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.850 resistance.</p>
<p>Initial support on the downside is near the $0.7250 level. The next major support is near the $0.70 level. Any more losses could lead the price toward the $0.650 level, below which the price might even test the $0.580 support zone in the near term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Binance – the world’s largest and most popular digital currency exchange in the world – has announced it’s pausing all <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/binance-shuts-down-privacy-coins-is-this-the-end-of-cryptocurrency-anonymity/ar-AA1bXmEN">trading of privacy-centered cryptocurrencies</a> indefinitely.</p>
<h2>Binance Says No More Privacy-Focused Trading</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Binance customers will no longer be able to trade or invest in a wide array of anonymous coins focused on full user privacy. The names include Decred, Secret, Verge, BEAM, Monero, Firo, and Zcash, to name a few. <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/binance/">Binance</a> explained in a recent statement that the decision was made following new regulatory concerns in several European countries including France, Poland, and Italy.</p>
<p>The news comes as a shock and raises several questions, a big one being, “Is this the end of the crypto space as we know it?” While the industry is still in play and still has lots to offer, one of the big clinchers was that individuals could flock to it in the hopes they could engage in financial activity without being spied on.</p>
<p>Right now, the world of centralized finance (banks, etc.) requires that third parties, middlemen, and prying eyes constantly monitor what customers are doing. If you’re looking to open a standard checking account, for example, you cannot do so unless the offering institution agrees with the terms and circumstances surrounding your situation. It will look at your job history, financial history, and several other elements of your life to decide if providing services or products to you is “risky.”</p>
<p>If it feels you’re not a threat, you’ll get access to the account. Otherwise, you may be denied and shoved unceremoniously out the door. With crypto, assets don’t care about your past. They don’t care if you haven’t always had a high-paying job or if you’ve missed a bill payment here and there. All it cares about is if you have access to the internet. From there, you can download a wallet and begin trading or investing in certain cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2>What Does This Mean for Crypto?</h2>
<p>This has been the main idea behind the crypto arena, and there have been many anonymous and privacy-focused digital assets that have come along since then as a means of taking this ideology to the next level. However, with the ceasing of trading these assets on the world’s most prominent crypto exchange, the outlook isn’t great, and one can’t help but wonder if other exchanges and similar platforms will follow suit, thus leading these assets to their doom.</p>
<p>The death of privacy and anonymity in the crypto arena will mean the death of the original ideals of crypto. While it can be said that these assets have been used to engage in illicit activity, these cases are arguably in the minority, and one must believe that most of the people who use these coins are simply doing so because they don’t want vultures breathing down their necks.</p>
