<h5><strong>The Securities Commission of the Bahamas has rejected claims that it cooperated with FTX CEO John Ray&#8217;s SBF in the bankruptcy of crypto exchange FTX. The agency said that the edited emails as evidence would be highly misleading.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1018.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1018.png" alt="Bahamas" class="wp-image-151787" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1018.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1018-300x158.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1018-768x404.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1018-750x394.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bahamas Denies Allegations Of Cooperation With SBF During FTX Bankruptcy 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>According to The Block, <strong>the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Bahamas has denied the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/151456-sbf-opened-withdrawals-users-in-bahamas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accusations</a> made by the current CEO of FTX, John Ray III</strong>. The charges allege that the country&#8217;s officials <strong>worked with the SBF to protect the assets of the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX from US bankruptcy proceedings.</strong></p>



<p>The Bahamas regulator released a statement saying Ray cited redacted email communications between the SBF and Bahamian officials to create the communication form between the SBF and the Commission. Ray was aware of the entire email showing the SBF admitting that he had failed to notify the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;These redactions are disturbing as Mr. Ray is aware that the full email reveals Mr. Bankman-Fried&#8217;s acknowledgment that he had &#8216;not briefed the Securities Commission,&#8221;</p>
<cite>The commission said</cite></blockquote>



<p>The regulator also said that the major errors made by John J Ray III appear to have nothing to do with reality, but <strong>&#8220;to create a false impression of communications between Mr. Bankman-Fried and the Commission&#8221;</strong>. This is considered very dangerous and causes great confusion about their actions in this regard.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1019.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="620" height="349" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1019.png" alt="FTX

<p>The Bahamas Securities Commission also noted that it continues to investigate the failures of FTX and is cooperating with regulators and law enforcement at home and abroad, and those found to have engaged in misconduct will be held accountable under Bahamas law.</p>



<p>As previously reported, in a court document, FTX&#8217;s restructuring team in the US accused the Bahamian government of interfering in the US restructuring process.</p>

<p><strong>The ex-FTX SBF CEO&#8217;s bail application was rejected</strong> by a judge in the Bahamas. <strong>SBF&#8217;s attorneys had previously requested his release on a $250,000 bond</strong>. The judge said the SBF would be sent to the Bahamas Department of Corrections.</p>

<p>The grounds for bail were that the <strong>SFB was &#8220;depressed&#8221; and &#8220;insomniac&#8221;.</strong> Since <strong>Sam is considered a fugitive risk,</strong> he will be held in custody until at least February 8 next year.</p>

<p>In the new announcement, the market leading exchange said it has reopened the USDC withdrawal service for its users. This move caused rumors of an impending crisis on Binance to be quashed.</p>

<p>As mentioned in an earlier Coincu News article, on the same day, Binance saw over $3 billion taken out of the exchange in 24 hours. What worried users was the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/151570-binance-pauses-usdc-withdrawal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sudden halt of USDC withdrawals</a> following a token swap issue where the exchange was unable to convert funds due to the New York bank, the liquidity provider for the swap, is closed.</p>

<p>This led to rumors that the largest exchange in the market could be in a crisis similar to the recent crash of FTX.</p>

<p>However, amid the rumours, CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has said it&#8217;s a good time for the<a href="https://news.coincu.com/151716-binance-ceo-says-good-idea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> &#8220;Stress Test Withdrawals&#8221; for the CEX</a>. Indeed, this is also a number that investors expect is not too large and can affect the floor with the largest trading volume in the market today.</p>

<p>The resumption of Binance&#8217;s smooth operation has strengthened user confidence during a time of market turmoil due to the collapse of giants Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX.</p>



<p>The market also had more positive signals about the result that<a href="https://news.coincu.com/151675-bitcoin-recovers-to-18000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the US CPI in November 2022</a> was only <strong>7.1%</strong> higher than the same period last year, down from <strong>7.7% in October</strong> and lower than the <strong>7.3%</strong> expected by financial analysts.</p>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC) price surged 4.83% in 24 hours to $17,866, its biggest value threshold since November 9, when the FTX market started showing liquidity problems at the time of the news. Currently the price sustains at $17,700.</p>

<p><strong>Soulbound tokens (SBTs)</strong> might have a completely different function. Instead of having a token that can be exchanged to multiple wallets, <strong>Soulbound NFTs</strong> assist users in developing a personal identity, which allows them to be acknowledged for their assets and achievements. It also allows organizations to form long-term relationships with their customers.</p>

<p>Owners of the NFT will also have access to an exclusive quarterly research report that includes DeFi strategies, trends, and opportunities in the market, conducted by award-winning researchers and Cobo&#8217;s security and investment team, as well as exclusive access to various in-person and online masterminds and events.</p>

<p>The CFTC filed a complaint in the Southern District of New York on December 13 seeking injunctive and other equitable relief, as well as civil monetary penalties, against Bankman-Fried, FTX Trading, and Alameda Research.</p>



<p>According to the complaint, SBF directly told CFTC officials to put up features that would enable Alameda to utilize the crypto exchange as a line of credit for its lenders.</p>

<p>“Contrary to representations and without disclosure to FTX customers, Alameda and FTX comingled funds and freely used FTX customer funds as if they were their own, including as capital to deploy in their own trading and investment activities.”</p>

<p>The CFTC <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8638-22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> in its lawsuit that Bankman-Fried made false assertions regarding the health of his enterprises and the usage of client cash, which had a significant price impact on commodities like <strong>Bitcoin (BTC) </strong>and <strong>Ether (ETH)</strong>.</p>



<p>The document reiterates SEC charges that Bankman-Fried improperly combined client assets and blurred the boundary between Alameda and FTX, with money spent on private planes and furtively used to fund a Super Bowl ad and sports stadium sponsorship.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/140702-binance-never-used-bnb-as-collateral/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Changpeng Zhao</a>, the CEO of Binance, sees this as a test for the exchange. And that is <strong>&#8220;simple.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>Earlier, the exchange announced that it would be suspending USDC withdrawals for a few hours. The volume of withdrawals from <strong>Binance</strong> has skyrocketed in the past 24 hours. As <a href="https://news.coincu.com/151570-binance-pauses-usdc-withdrawal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted</a>, more than <strong>$2.3 billion</strong> have been withdrawn from the largest exchange in the market.</p>

<p>The collapse of FTX probably raised investor doubts about the exchange. However, at the <strong>&#8220;most panicked&#8221;</strong> moment of the market in early <strong>November</strong>, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/151500-73-million-ftx-may-be-withdrawn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a> used to have a net outflow of <strong>$6 billion within 72 hours after CZ said it would sell FTT.</strong></p>



<p>It can be seen that this number is not as worrisome. However, it is also a testament to the expectations of investors with the exchange that can be considered the leading market today.</p>

<p>The former FTX executive has stressed that his attitude doesn&#8217;t make much sense now, not knowing if he will make customers happy.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;I know that it doesn&#8217;t mean much to say that I&#8217;m sorry. And so I&#8217;m dedicating as much of myself as I can to do right by customers. When all is said and done, I&#8217;ll judge myself preeminent. by one metric: whether have eventually been able to make customers whole. If I fail our customers in this regard, have failed myself.</p>



<p>Last year, my net worth was valued at $20b.</p>



<p>Today, I would be wrong to say that I have nothing: I have a loving family, and food on my plate, and that&#8217;s more than life has given billions of people.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then blamed the inclusion of <strong>FTX US</strong> in the <strong>Chapter 11 bankruptcy</strong> on <strong>John J. Ray III</strong>, a restructuring lawyer who took over as FTX CEO following the bankruptcy filing.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;I have reached out to Mr. Ray and the Chapter 11 team numerous times. Sometimes I&#8217;ve been requesting access to my own data, but other times I&#8217;ve been attempting to alert them to potentially important information for their jobs and duties to bond and customers of FTX.</p>



<p>I have sent five emails to Mr. Ray. Mr. Ray has never responded, nor has he reached out to me to communicate in any other ways.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Ray</strong>, on the other hand, has been harshly critical of the previous FTX CEO&#8217;s leadership abilities. </p>



<p><strong>Ray</strong> stated in his testimony for the FTX investigation hearing that in his years of working as a restructuring lawyer, he has never seen such a complete failure of corporate controls at every level of an organization, from the lack of financial statements to the complete failure of any internal controls or governance whatever.</p>

<p>According to the testimony, the disgraced CEO intended to <strong>blame the phantom demise of his $32 billion enterprise on everyone but himself.</strong></p>



<p>It can be seen that SBF&#8217;s apologetic attitude does not seem to go anywhere, <strong>Bankman-Fried</strong> is currently being <a href="https://news.coincu.com/151419-sbf-receives-multiple-charges-from-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targeted</a> by many agencies and authorities.</p>
