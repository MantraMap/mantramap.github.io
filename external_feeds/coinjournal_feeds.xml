<li dir="ltr">Chainlink (LINK) traded to highs of $8.44 before retreating amid broader market uncertainty.</li>
<li dir="ltr">A top crypto analyst says LINK seeing a weekly close below the macro downtrend line portends fresh losses.<em>&nbsp;</em></li>
<li dir="ltr">The &ldquo;Macro Breakout is postponed&rdquo; the analyst noted on Monday.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Chainlink posted an impressive run in the week of July 13-21, notching a +20% gain in a single day on July 20 as it hit a three-month high of $8.44. On-chain volume spiked to over $347 million as traders poured into the altcoin amid positive network developments.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Chainlink price analysis</h2>
<p dir="ltr">LINK bulls appeared to be on the way to retesting a key technical level just under $10, with price poised to break a multi-year macro downtrend.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Crypto analyst Rekt Capital highlighted this on Friday, identifying a potential weekly close above the macro downtrend line as a likely indicator of bullish strength.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As can be seen in the chart below, Chainlink price has recoiled from the crucial hurdle with a weekly close below. According to the analyst, the scenario where the would-be macro breakout has fizzled out (at the moment.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>$LINK has ultimately performed its new Weekly Close below the Macro Downtrend. As a result, the Macro Breakout is postponed. Unless #LINK is able to reclaim this Macro Downtrend as support, price is positioning itself up for a rejection from here</em>,&rdquo; Rekt Capital <a href="https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1686074433058799616" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shared</a> on X (fka Twitter).</p>

Source: Rekt Capital.</em></p>
<div class="fr-img-space-wrap">LINK currently trades near $7.60, largely flat in the past 24 hours. Investors have seen gains recorded over the past week cut to just 1%. LINK/USD is up 20% in the past 30 days.</div>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p dir="ltr">If prices fall below $7.00, the next major support zone could be around $5.00. On the upside, $8.50 and $10 are key supply zones.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here&rsquo;s something else the analyst points out about Chainlink price performance.</p>

</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Bald (BALD), a recently launched meme coin that went live on the Base blockchain, plunged on Monday as sell-off pressure mounted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As CoinJournal <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bald-token-records-astounding-40000-upside-after-launch-on-base/">reported</a> on July 30, the price of the meme token had skyrocketed as its market cap jumped from near $0 to $70 million in hours. It continued its meteoric rise to hit a market cap of over $85 million and see multiple traders report astounding gains.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But on July 31, with market uncertainty hitting the roof around the actions of the BALD developer, the token&rsquo;s price plummeted.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">BALD price</h2>
<p dir="ltr">According to data from <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bald" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CoinGecko</a>, BALD nosedived by nearly 90% as traders reacted to the development that saw Bald&rsquo;s deployer remove millions of dollars&rsquo; worth of token liquidity. The token quickly fell from highs of $0.09 to $0.004, bleeding more than 94% from that peak.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Smart money on-chain account Lookonchain highlighted that the BALD deployer had earned $5.7 million in two days.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Richard Heart was charged with allegedly raising over $1B through unregistered securities offerings.</li>
<li>The SEC also charged PulseChain, PulseX, and Hex, alongside Richard Heart.</li>
<li>In addition, Heart and PulseChain have also been charged for using part of the offering proceeds to buy luxury goods.</li>
</ul>
<p>The US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) has charged the founder of the crypto project Hex, Richard Heart, with allegedly raising more than $1 billion through unregistered securities offerings. The SEC has also included three unincorporated businesses (PulseChain, PulseX, and Hex) in the charges.</p>
<p>PulseChain and Richard Heart are also both facing charges for purportedly using $12 million from the funds raised through the securities offerings to buy luxury goods, including a 555-carat black diamond christened &ldquo;The Enigma.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Details of SEC&rsquo;s charges against Hex</h2>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.</p>
<p>The SEC complaint states that the HEX founder started marketing Hex in 2018 claiming that &ldquo;it was the first high-yield &lsquo;blockchain certificate of deposit,&rdquo; and started endorsing Hex tokens as an investment designed to make people &ldquo;rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC is particularly wary of a staking function on Hex that Heart claimed would provide returns of 38% and claims that Heart intentionally tried to break the law by advising Hex investors to &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo; their cryptocurrency holdings rather than invest in them.</p>
<p>Director of the Fort Worth regional office, Eric Werner, also weighed into the matter saying that Heart urged investors to purchase securities backed by cryptocurrency in offerings that he neglected to register and then went ahead to use some of the cryptocurrency assets to purchase extravagant luxury items.</p>
<h2>HEX price reaction</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://coinjournal.net/hex/">price of the HEX token</a> had dipped by more than 27% to trade at $0.006461 at press time following the news of the charges.</p>
<p>The Hex charge came as the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/sec-asked-coinbase-to-delist-altcoins-trade-only-bitcoin-before-lawsuit-report/">SEC also asked Coinbase to only offer Bitcoin (BTC)</a> stating that all the other cryptocurrencies are securities.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Crypto volatility has been dropping all year, with Bitcoin&rsquo;s volatility now at three-year lows</li>
<li dir="ltr">Volume is also dropping, as the calm markets are not welcomed by traders</li>
<li dir="ltr">Despite downward-trending volatility, crypto remains highly volatile when compared to other asset classes</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">Crypto markets are known for violent volatility, capable of both spiking and collapsing in the blink of an eye.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thus far this year, however, that hasn&rsquo;t been the case. Volatility has been trickling steadily downward across the space. Assessing the realised volatility of Bitcoin over a rolling one-month window, the metric is currently at a three-year low.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/14599345">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">This comes despite Bitcoin having had a bumper year thus far, the asset currently up 76%, treading water around the $30,000 mark. In the past, Bitcoin has oscillated wildly, but this run-up from the low of $15,500 late last year has been distinguished by a steady climb rather than the turbulent ups and downs we have come to expect.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The pattern is not unique to the world&rsquo;s biggest crypto, either &ndash; volatility is falling across the board. The easy way to illustrate this is by looking at Ether. Historically, the price of ETH has been more volatile than BTC, but the divergence has narrowed this year, and Ether is now trading with similar volatility to its big brother.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/14599418">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">This relative calm in crypto markets is good on one level, given one of Bitcoin&rsquo;s most-cited criticisms is its extreme volatility, which most agree it will need to overcome should it ever take the status of a reputable store of value.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Not everyone is a winner, though. Traders rely on volatility and hence these serene times are not exactly a boon. If we look at spot trading volume, the drawdown has been steep. Granted, there are myriad factors at play here, including regulation, a drawdown in prices, lockdowns ending, scandals (FTX and the SEC lawsuits) and so on, but the lack of volatility is not helping.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The below chart from The Block shows quite how far spot volume has fallen.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/06/31/1690817822136-c3695e50-8fca-4898-b65e-bbb14aa7ca1f.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="314"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Even derivatives trading volume, which had been more stout, has fallen off since April &ndash; likely a better gauge for traders than assessing spot volume. Liquidity is not as much of a concern in derivatives markets as it has become in spot markets, but the last few months have begun to see some thinning out there, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the falling volatility is notable, it should be noted that crypto remains a league above trad-fi markets with regard to this metric. Even this three-year low still translates to an annualised volatility of 25% for Bitcoin, which would not be deemed low-risk by any stretch of the imagination.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">To put this up in lights, comparing Bitcoin to gold is always illustrative. Gold is the store of value which has been around for thousands of years, the shiny metal known for its inflation-hedging abilities and lack of correlation to risk assets. For many, Bitcoin&rsquo;s vision is to claim the title of some sort of digital gold.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The below chart displays the current gulf between these assets &ndash; even after the dampening down in crypto volatility this year, it&rsquo;s on a completely different planet to gold.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/14599713">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">Alternatively, one can simply compare the daily returns of the assets, which conveys the same thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/14599828">

<p dir="ltr">Thus, while crypto volatility is currently sluggish, it has a long way to go before it matches gold. More importantly, there is no guarantee that this volatility will stay low. Quite the opposite &ndash; given the low liquidity in the space, less capital is needed to move crypto markets than has been the case previously.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In light of this, it feels like the downward trend in volatility (exacerbated in the last couple of months by a classic summer lull in trading) should return. Not to mention the fact that with the interest rate hiking cycle coming to a close, markets could be at an inflection point. It is always hard to predict the future in crypto, but it feels unlikely that digital assets&rsquo; volatility will stay at these uncharacteristically low levels for long.&nbsp;</p>

<li dir="ltr">Cardano&rsquo;s network will benefit from more efficiency and fast bootstrap after Mithril went live on mainnet.</li>
<li dir="ltr">ADA price was flat, but could benefit from new bullish momentum across the market.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/cardano/">Cardano</a> has achieved another milestone with the mainnet launch of the highly anticipated Mithril upgrade.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On July 30, an <a href="https://twitter.com/LEADStakePool/status/1685495036337856512" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announcement</a> by Cardano stake pool operator (SPO) Banksy revealed that Mithril was now live on the mainnet.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Network efficiency</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Mithril is a stake-based network of nodes that enable the creation of snapshots and certificates of the Cardano Node, allowing for a fast bootstrap and restoration.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The development promises to bring several benefits to network users, particularly in boosting the efficiency of Cardano full node clients. The upgrade will also enhance user access to Daedalus and other network applications, with increased decentralisation achieved via the ability for any number of pools attesting to transactions through an aggregator and signer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>With Mithril, SPOs give you regular certified snapshots of the Cardano state (more precisely the UTXO set i.e. the leaves of the graph formed by its transactions over time), so you can build services without running a node. Fast bootstrap is a first use case</em>,&rdquo; Romain Pellerin, the CTO of Cardano R&amp;D company Input Output, <a href="https://twitter.com/rom1_pellerin/status/1685706326314524672" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a> via X (fka Twitter).</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">ADA price outlook</h2>
<p dir="ltr">A reaction to the protocol&rsquo;s launch saw the price of Cardano&rsquo;s native token ADA jump to near $0.32. While broader malaise across crypto sees ADA hover within a tight range above $0.30, the potential for a sharp flip higher has been added to with the new network milestone.</p>
<p>Other network activity metrics, as <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1684430107925176322" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shown</a> by the count of github commits, suggests a breakout for ADA amid a wider market rally could see bulls target year-to-date highs of $0.45.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Binance announced on Monday it had received the Operational Minimum Viable Product (MVP) license issued by Dubai&rsquo;s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA).</li>
<li dir="ltr">The exchange secured the landmark license via its subsidiary Binance FZE.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Binance will now offer cryptocurrency exchange services to qualified institutional and retail customers.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/">Binance</a> has become the first cryptocurrency exchange to secure the Operational Minimum Viable Product license in Dubai.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to an <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-is-the-first-virtual-asset-exchange-to-receive-an-operational-mvp-license-in-dubai-7342057061995039467" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announcement</a> the company published on Monday, the milestone was achieved through Binance FZE, the exchange&rsquo;s Dubai-based subsidiary.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Binance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Binance</a> FZE, our Dubai based subsidiary, is the world's first exchange to receive the Operational Minimum Viable Product licence in Dubai.</p>
<p>Eligible users can now access regulated virtual asset services, such as fiat on and off ramp services via Binance FZE.</p>
<p>More here &#128071;</p>
<p>&mdash; Binance (@binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1685879347578802176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">VARA-approved crypto license</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The operational MVP license is issued by Dubai&rsquo;s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) and will allow Binance to offer virtual asset exchange services to qualified customers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>We are honored to be the first exchange to be granted an operational Minimum Viable Product License by VARA &mdash; a result of over a year of due diligence, collaboration, and consistent demonstration of responsible intent &ndash; that now allows us to be able to leverage the potential of a progressive regulatory framework, enabling innovation while furthering user protection</em>,&rdquo; Richard Teng, Head of Regional Markets at Binance, said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">VARA issued the operational MVP license to the world&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange by trade volume after approving the provisional and preparatory MVP licenses in March and September 2022 respectively.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Binance has underscored the importance of the license by noting that its commitment to the onboarding remediation outlined in the VARA regulatory framework, including in stringent Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and customer due diligence.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>With this operational MVP license, all users onboarded through this platform can expect access to a trusted and regulated service that prioritizes security alongside compliance with highly specialized, tier-one virtual asset regulations under VARA</em>,&rdquo; Alexander Chehade, the General Manager at Binance Dubai, said in a statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The strong footing Binance has in Dubai and the UAE adds to the exchange&rsquo;s recent efforts to expand its services across the globe within the context of regulatory compliance. But the company has also been in the crosshairs of several regulatory bodies, including in the United States where the SEC filed a securities violations lawsuit against it and the CEO Changpeng Zhao.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Binance has also had to exit from a number of jurisdictions, including Canada and <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-exchange-binance-announces-exit-from-the-dutch-market/">the Netherlands</a> due to various regulatory hurdles.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says the pressure left it no choice but to fight it out in court.</li>
<li dir="ltr">SEC chair Gary Gensler has previously noted that almost every other cryptocurrency was a security.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/coinbase/">Coinbase</a> CEO Brian Armstrong has revealed that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wanted it to delist every other cryptocurrency and only offer <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1f873dd5-df8f-4cfc-bb21-ef83ed11fb4d" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> the Financial Times published on Monday claims that this happened before the regulator sued the US-based cryptocurrency exchange in June. Per the FT report, Armstrong saiys that the SEC&rsquo;s demands left Coinbase with no other option but to defend itself in court.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">SEC&rsquo;s plans could have &ldquo;ended&rdquo; crypto in the US</h2>
<p dir="ltr">When the SEC filed a <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/the-sec-strikes-again-first-binance-now-coinbase/">lawsuit against Coinbase</a> in early June, complaints included the offering of unregistered securities.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Commission named several altcoins listed on Coinbase as unregistered securities, with those singled out being the likes of Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL) and Polygon (MATIC).</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>We really didn&rsquo;t have a choice at that point. Delisting every asset other than bitcoin, which by the way is not what the law says, would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the US. It kind of made it an easy choice &hellip; &lsquo;let&rsquo;s go to court and find out what the court says</em>&rsquo;,&rdquo; Armstrong said according to details in the FT report published on Monday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The SEC also <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/sec-sues-binance-and-cz-for-breaking-us-securities-rules/">filed</a> a similar lawsuit against Binance in June, part of a recent regulatory crackdown that elicited sharp criticism against the agency and its Chair, Gary Gensler.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While Coinbase has vowed to battle SEC&rsquo;s allegations in court, the Financial Times has quoted the government agency as noting that no such requests have been made by the securities watchdog. Gensler has however noted on numerous occasions that most crypto tokens were securities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the regulator suffered a noticeable loss earlier this month when a judge <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ripple-wins-sec-case-xrp-not-a-security/">ruled in favour of the XRP creator Ripple Labs</a>. Coinbase, which had delisted XRP, announced the relisting of the altcoin following the ruling that effectively declared it not a security.</p>

<li>BNB/USD forms a possible bearish flag pattern</li>
<li>The US dollar strength is not responsible for the BNB/USD bearishness</li>
<li>$200 provides support for now</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Bitcoin rallied in 2023 and holds onto its gains. Most other major cryptocurrencies did so too, but some exceptions exist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One is Binance Coin (BNB).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure enough, it rallied at the start of the year, following Bitcoin&rsquo;s lead. But then it gave up all of its gains &ndash; and some more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One cannot blame the US dollar&rsquo;s strength as the cause for the BNB/USD decline. After all, the dollar&rsquo;s strength is not visible in other cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, it appears to be the Binance Coin that trades with a bearish tone. That is particularly true if one looks at the technical picture, which shows the bearish pressure building as the market nears the $200 support level.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/06/31/1690795805358-33990981-1363-45c9-b174-de5755b09c5c.jpg" style="width: 1800px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="1800" height="470"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BNBUSD/?exchange=CRYPTO" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Binance Coin chart by TradingView</a></p>
<h2>A bearish flag pattern suggests that BNB/USD will break the $200 support level</h2>
<p>A bearish flag pattern is a continuation pattern forming in a downtrend. The consolidation area follows a steep decline, and the breakout or the measured move equals the distance that the market traveled prior to the consolidation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If, indeed, BNB/USD formed a bearish flag pattern, then the support in the $200 area should give way. The pattern&rsquo;s measured move, seen in orange above, points to $150 and lower.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What should worry investors is the inability of the market to bounce while other cryptocurrencies hold near their yearly highs. It points to other factors weighing on the market, different than the US dollar&rsquo;s strength.&nbsp;</p>
