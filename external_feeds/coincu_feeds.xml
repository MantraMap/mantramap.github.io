<p>In a Medium post earlier this week, the business stated that a playable sample will be released later this year. <strong>MMORPG is an abbreviation for massively multiplayer online role-playing games,</strong> a form of video game that mixes features of role-playing games (RPGs) with a large number of players.</p>

<p><strong>The transition will bring new features for the Tiny Colony ecosystem</strong>, known as “the Tinyverse,” including a built-in crypto wallet and the choice to buy in-game items in cash. The game was originally created on Solana.</p>



<p><strong>Emergent Games is led by Simon Rutter, a former Sony PlayStation EVP, while CCO Russ Harding spent nearly a decade as Sony Interactive Entertainment Europe&#8217;s games director</strong>.

<h5><strong>On January 26, a brand-new lawsuit was launched against the cryptocurrency mining company Argo Blockchain and a number of its executives and board members.</strong></h5>

<p>Investors in <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156558-argo-blockchains-share-skyrockets-over-100/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Argo</a> have launched a class-action complaint, alleging that the miner misled them and omitted important details during its <strong>2021 initial public offering (IPO)</strong>. According to the complaint, the company omitted information about its vulnerability to cash limits, power prices, and network issues.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The offering documents were negligently prepared and, as a result, contained untrue statements of a material fact or omitted to state other facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading,” the lawsuit read.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The investors contend that <strong>this made the company &#8220;less sustainable&#8221; than it had appeared to be to them</strong>, which caused an overestimation of the miner&#8217;s financial prospects. The lawsuit <a href="https://assets.law360news.com/1569000/1569805/https-ecf-nyed-uscourts-gov-doc1-123119695867.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a>:</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Had Plaintiff and the other members of the Class known the truth, they would not have purchased or otherwise acquired said securities, or would not have purchased or otherwise acquired them at the inflated prices that were paid.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A few days after <strong>Argo Blockchain</strong> resumed compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirement, which requires a business to maintain a minimum closing bid price of<strong> $1</strong> for 10 consecutive trading days, on <strong>January 23</strong>, the company filed a recent complaint.</p>

<p>On <strong>September 23, 2021</strong>, Argo made the material in issue public by filing paperwork pertaining to its first IPO with the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States (SEC).</strong></p>



<p>On the same day, <strong>7.5 million shares </strong>were sold to the general public for <strong>$15 each</strong>, netting <strong>$105 million</strong> before expenditures. The miner&#8217;s stock price has fallen significantly since that time.</p>



<p>According to reports, <strong>Argo Blockchain </strong>sold<strong> Galaxy Digital </strong>their <strong>Helios</strong> facility as a result of the protracted bear market. As a result, its mining income decreased to <strong>$2.49 million</strong>, and as of the end of <strong>December 2022</strong>, it owed <strong>$79 million.</strong></p>

<p>A crypto whale unexpectedly transferred an astonishing <strong>3,312,307,240,798 SHIB</strong>, worth at <strong>$38,257,148</strong> at the time of writing, from one unknown wallet to another, according to new data from the whale-surveying platform WhaleAlert.</p>

<p>The cost for the transaction was <strong>0.000664 Ethereum (ETH)</strong>, or $1.06.</p>



<p>According to Etherscan statistics, <strong>the transmitting wallet received about the same amount of SHIB 14 days previously from another unknown wallet and today has a zero SHIB balance</strong>. At the time of writing, the mystery receiving wallet still had the 3.3 trillion SHIB.</p>



<p>The meme token began the year at<strong> $0.00000803</strong> and reached a high of <strong>$0.00001293</strong> on January 18th, representing a 43% growth. SHIB has retraced to a value of <strong>$0.00001156</strong> at the time of writing.</p>

<p>The Dogecoin (DOGE) competitor is presently the <strong>15th most valuable crypto asset by market capitalization</strong>.</p>



<p>With the launching of <strong>the layer-2 blockchain Shibarium</strong> later this year, SHIB is likely to <strong>receive a significant improvement</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Ledger</strong>, a famous cryptocurrency hardware wallet provider, and <strong>Trezor</strong>, another hardware wallet vendor, have recently <strong>announced intentions to support Shibarium.</strong></p>

<p>On the same day, Coincu reported an enormous <strong>Ethereum whale has acquired almost $228 million worth of SHIB</strong>, according to blockchain tracking firm WhaleStats, and presently has more than 18 trillion tokens.</p>



<p>Shibarium is intended to provide<strong> scalability,</strong> <strong>quicker transaction speeds</strong>, and <strong>lower gas prices</strong> by running on top of the Ethereum network. It is also intended to simplify the development of decentralized applications on the Shiba Inu blockchain.</p>



<p>The Shibarium blockchain will <strong>use Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) as the primary token for paying gas costs</strong>, according to developers.</p>

<p>The price of Tron (TRX) in the last day was $0.062, hardly increased. The administration of the island of St. Maarten in the eastern Caribbean may shortly legally adopt Tron.

<p>The Tron protocol has now been proposed as the nation&#8217;s blockchain infrastructure, and TRX has been declared legal tender for everyday use. Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, tweeted about the milestone: </p>

<p>The Commonwealth of Dominica recognized Tron as its national blockchain and declared seven cryptocurrencies built on the Tron platform to be legal money in an official statement in October 2022.</p>

<p>In order to maintain &#8220;a highly liquid balance sheet with a strong capital position as it navigates recent volatility in the digital asset business,&#8221; the company stated it is working to preserve money.</p>



<p>Following the company&#8217;s announcement of a <strong>$1 billion fourth-quarter loss and a 20% employee reduction</strong>, Silvergate&#8217;s price has been erratic this month. Although they have recently increased, cryptocurrency values are still far below their 2021 highs. The demise of 3AC and FTX has had an impact on the entire business.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We were surprised by the announcement, to be frank, as SI hadn&#8217;t previously indicated it was contemplating pausing the dividend payment in recent public commentary,&#8221; KBW analysts led by Michael Perito wrote in a note. &#8220;The bank indicated it still has more cash than deposits as of the date of the announcement (1/27), and we continue to have no liquidity concerns.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The company said it <strong>&#8220;continues to maintain a cash position in excess of its digital asset customer related deposits,</strong>&#8221; and the board will re-evaluate the payment of quarterly dividends as market conditions evolve.</p>
