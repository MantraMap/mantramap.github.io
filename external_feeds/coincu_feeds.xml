<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/F1f9BgHWIAAmnoX-1024x684.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="684" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/F1f9BgHWIAAmnoX-1024x684.jpeg" alt="MetaMask Unleashes Snaps Protocol To Empower Web3 Wallet Customization" class="wp-image-204823" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/F1f9BgHWIAAmnoX-1024x684.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/F1f9BgHWIAAmnoX-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/F1f9BgHWIAAmnoX-768x513.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/F1f9BgHWIAAmnoX-1536x1026.jpeg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/F1f9BgHWIAAmnoX-750x501.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/F1f9BgHWIAAmnoX-1140x761.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/F1f9BgHWIAAmnoX.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="MetaMask Unleashes Snaps Protocol To Empower Web3 Wallet Customization 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>Snaps are essentially isolated JavaScript programs that customize users&#8217; wallet experiences based on specific permissions granted by the users themselves. These snaps are composable, which means users can create modular snap-stacks, combining different snaps to tailor the functionality of their wallet to their preferences. This level of customization empowers users to curate their own wallet experience and access features that matter most to them.</p>



<p>Moreover, snaps offer a powerful way to enhance security within the wallet. For instance, a snap can provide warnings and alerts to users when attempting to interact with potentially malicious smart contracts, thereby safeguarding them from potential scams or attacks. This additional layer of protection is invaluable in an increasingly complex and rapidly evolving blockchain landscape.</p>



<p>The MetaMask team has been proactive in supporting snap developers through grants and hackathons organized by the MetaMask Grants DAO. While the grants might not cover developers&#8217; entire expenses, they are intended to provide a solid foundation for them to build, deploy, and have their snaps audited. The goal is to encourage innovation and creativity among developers, fostering a thriving ecosystem of snap-based applications that ultimately benefit MetaMask users.</p>



<p>MetaMask is committed to maintaining Snaps as an open platform, allowing developers to create snaps that are useful and valuable to users. The more popular and impactful these snaps become, the greater the benefit to the entire user base. This open approach aligns with the spirit of decentralization and community collaboration that underpins the web3 movement.</p>



<p>With Snaps on the horizon, MetaMask is once again solidifying its position as a leading player in the blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) space. As the protocol prepares for its launch in Q4, the community eagerly awaits the exciting new experiences that Snaps will bring to the world of <a href="https://coincu.com/193298-metamask-integratesn-with-fireblocks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Web3</a> and decentralized applications.</p>



<p>MetaMask is not only gearing up for the launch of its Snaps protocol but also introducing another exciting feature, the MetaMask Portfolio. This new addition aims to revolutionize how users manage and explore the world of Web3, providing a comprehensive view of their digital assets in one centralized Dashboard.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Optimism is adding zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enable secure and efficient cross-chain communication between its Layer 2 solution and Ethereum.</em></li>



<li><em>The ZKPs will be provided by O(1) Labs and RISC Zero, enhancing security and reducing latency in the network.</em></li>



<li><em>Optimism aims to improve its ecosystem&#8217;s performance and compatibility with existing systems, paving the way for more accessible development using Solidity and EVM.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution, Optimism, is making strides in improving cross-chain communication with the integration of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). The initiative aims to enable secure and efficient communication between layers and directly between OP chains, enhancing privacy and security in blockchain transactions.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1498.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="840" height="630" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1498.png" alt="Optimism To Launch ZKPs To Boost Cross-Chain Communication" class="wp-image-204811" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1498.png 840w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1498-300x225.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1498-768x576.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1498-750x563.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" title="Optimism To Launch ZKPs To Boost Cross-Chain Communication 4"></a></figure></div>


<p><a href="https://coincu.com/192902-optimisms-layer-2-network-upgrade-faster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Optimism</a> recently <a href="https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> that they will be moving forward with proposals from O(1) Labs and RISC Zero, both offering innovative solutions to bring ZKPs to the platform. ZKPs are cryptographic concepts that allow one party to prove the truth of a statement to another party without revealing any additional information. This implementation will revamp Optimism&#8217;s tech stack, ensuring faster and more secure transactions.</p>



<p>RISC Zero&#8217;s proposal seeks to upgrade Optimism&#8217;s existing fault protocol, using ZKPs to validate state changes on the platform. Users can prove the correctness of state changes with ZKPs, while also challenging any incorrect state changes with supporting proofs.</p>



<p>On the other hand, O(1) Labs, known for incubating the <a href="https://coincu.com/179253-mina-protocol-launched-its-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mina Protocol</a>, is proposing a new fault-proof solution using Kimchi, a ZK-proof system used in Mina. This solution allows efficient proof of correct transaction execution, which is then used to update the Ethereum network&#8217;s state via smart contracts, enhancing performance, security, and compatibility.</p>

<p>Former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky was arrested in July and charged with defrauding customers at the now-bankrupt crypto lender. His former colleague, Celsius’s chief revenue officer, and longtime lawyer Roni Cohen-Pavon have also been charged with aiding in some of Mashinsky’s alleged crimes. </p>



<p>Prosecutors allege that Cohen-Pavon was key to one of Mashinsky’s schemes, manipulating Celsius’s native token CEL to mislead customers and line the executives’ pockets. While Mashinsky was the public face of Celsius, Cohen-Pavon operated behind the scenes. He allegedly took home $3.6 million from selling his CEL holdings, while Mashinsky allegedly pocketed $42 million.</p>



<p>Cohen-Pavon had a strong interest in crypto and helped architect the Celsius initial coin offering in 2018. In 2020, he allegedly helped craft a doomed deal with the decentralized finance app KeyFi, which compounded Celsius’s financial woes. Despite concerns about Celsius internally, Mashinsky used his weekly Q&amp;As to create a much rosier picture for customers. For instance, he claimed the ICO was a huge success. Celsius raised $50 million, Mashinsky claimed and sold all the CEL tokens it had offered. But in reality, prosecutors say, Celsius underperformed, raising only $32 million and failing to sell one-third of its tokens.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1496.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="340" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1496.png" alt="Celsius Network: A Story Of Greed And Deception By CEO And Lawyer" class="wp-image-204805" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1496.png 600w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1496-300x170.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="Celsius Network: A Story Of Greed And Deception By CEO And Lawyer 8"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cohen-Pavon</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>By early 2021, Mashinsky discovered a sizable hole in Celsius’s balance sheet, partly from using customer deposits to purchase CEL. Prosecutors say he kept the problem under wraps and handpicked Cohen-Pavon to oversee Celsius’s frenzied CEL purchases on the open market. Publicly, Celsius claimed to buy CEL to meet its promise of customer rewards. Still, prosecutors allege it was buying well above that amount to prop up the price of the cryptocurrency artificially.</p>



<p>Cohen-Pavon was still on the payroll after the company filed for bankruptcy, and he was even in line to receive up to $239,000 to help restructure the company, according to documents in the bankruptcy case. He wasn’t placed on administrative leave until after the US Attorney’s office in Manhattan announced charges against him and Mashinsky. Celsius attorney Christopher S. Koenig said during a bankruptcy hearing days after the arrests that Cohen-Pavon would be fired “in short order.”</p>



<p>While announcing charges against Cohen-Pavon, US Attorney Damian Williams wouldn’t say whether the office would seek his extradition. Israel has historically erred against extraditing its citizens to face charges in other jurisdictions, said Michael Zweiback, an attorney who worked on two cases involving extradition with Israel as a federal prosecutor. In 2007, the country changed its treaty with the US to send its citizens to America if any prison sentence is served back in Israel, but Zweiback says the process is still difficult.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Uniswap introduces a new DEX Aggregator solution called UniswapX</h2>



<p>Uniswap, the world&#8217;s largest decentralized crypto exchange, has introduced its latest open-source protocol, <a href="https://coincu.com/203440-uniswapx-launches-empowering-traders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UniswapX</a>, designed to revolutionize trading across automated market makers (AMMs) and various liquidity sources. Founder Hayden Adams made the announcement at the EthCC conference in Paris.</p>



<p>UniswapX aims to address common pain points of on-chain trading and self-custody swapping. The protocol&#8217;s key features include &#8220;better prices&#8221; achieved by aggregating liquidity sources, gas-free swapping, protection against the maximal extractable value (MEV), and zero costs for failed transactions.</p>



<p>The system also introduces a process known as &#8220;Dutch orders,&#8221; in which the price of a trade order steadily decreases until it is filled. It also provides gas-free transactions, no-cost unsuccessful transactions, and MEV protection.</p>



<p>UniswapX is currently in opt-in beta on the Uniswap Labs interface for Ethereum, with plans to expand to other chains and the Uniswap wallet in the near future. Notably, the protocol introduces a third entity called &#8220;Filler,&#8221; responsible for using on-chain liquidity to support swaps. Users can now place orders off-chain without consuming gas, and Fillers will cover the gas fees to fulfill these trading orders.</p>



<p>The new protocol also offers protection against MEV activity, enhancing transaction prices without being vulnerable to attacks like sandwich trades. To make operations more convenient, Fillers will utilize a Transaction Relay layer when routing orders onto the on-chain.</p>



<p>UniswapX&#8217;s design includes a transaction fee re-sharing feature, pending approval through a Uniswap vote in the future.</p>



<p>Adams emphasized the immutability of UniswapX, assuring that the code cannot be altered or moved, and Uniswap Labs will not possess the authority to modify or suspend smart contracts. Users will retain full control of their wallet balance when executing swap operations.</p>



<p>With its innovative features and commitment to user empowerment, UniswapX is set to further solidify Uniswap&#8217;s position as a leading force in the decentralized exchange landscape.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Chainlink announced the official launch of the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol</h2>



<p>Chainlink, the leading oracle solution, has officially <a href="https://coincu.com/203471-chainlink-new-protocol-is-now-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) on several blockchain networks, including Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon. CCIP is designed to enable seamless and secure interaction between different chains, allowing users to transfer tokens and data between blockchains with minimal slippage and maximum security.</p>



<p>The protocol leverages Chainlink&#8217;s oracle technology, providing a unified interface for cross-chain communication. It operates under a &#8216;lock and mint&#8217; or &#8216;burn and release&#8217; mechanism, allowing users to move tokens from one chain to another and trigger smart contract logic on the chain using random data commands.</p>



<p>One of the significant features of CCIP is its locked gas fee payment mechanism, ensuring transaction execution regardless of network congestion or gas price increases. It offers scalability and is considered future-proof, with plans to expand to other chains in the near future.</p>



<p>CCIP brings several utilities to the blockchain ecosystem, including cross-chain swaps, cross-chain deposits to open liquidity positions, and cross-chain lending to mortgage assets and borrow stablecoins in other chains. Additionally, CCIP includes an extra layer of risk management to detect potential vulnerabilities in cross-chain activities.</p>



<p>Another notable improvement of CCIP is its integration with SWIFT, a cross-border payment system, bridging the gap between traditional assets and digital assets.</p>



<p>Currently, CCIP is available on two DeFi platforms, Aave and Synthetix, with other DeFi projects encouraged to integrate the protocol. Furthermore, Chainlink plans to support CCIP on various testnets, including Arbitrum Goerli, Avalanche Fuji, Ethereum Sepolia, Optimism Goerli, and Polygon Mumbai. The protocol&#8217;s successful deployment across multiple networks marks a significant milestone in enhancing interoperability and expanding the utility of decentralized finance.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Starknet announces Appchains framework</h2>



<p>Starknet, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, has <a href="https://coincu.com/204036-starknet-starknet-appchains-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> &#8220;appchain,&#8221; a framework that empowers developers to create application-specific blockchains within Starknet. This innovative project aligns with the rising trend of modular networks in the Layer 2 ecosystem, seen in projects like Optimism, Polygon, zkSync, and Arbitrum.</p>



<p>Appchain refers to blockchains designed exclusively for individual Dapp applications, processing transactions solely for that application rather than sharing them across the entire ecosystem. This marks a significant development in Ethereum&#8217;s scaling roadmap.</p>



<p>Starknet&#8217;s app chains utilize STARK proofs technology to ensure security and are programmed in StarkWare&#8217;s Cairo language.</p>



<p>The introduction of appchains has been a long-awaited need in the blockchain space and is now receiving the attention it deserves. Other major layer-2 solutions on Ethereum have also initiated similar child blockchain-building toolkit initiatives, following Optimism&#8217;s OP Stack, Arbitrum Orbit, zkSync Era&#8217;s ZK Stack, and Polygon Supernets.</p>



<p>Using Starknet Stack, the native developer toolkit of Starknet&#8217;s ecosystem, developers can create these appchains, leveraging STARK proofs to enhance security. The toolkit&#8217;s core component is Cairo, a programming language developed by the StarkWare team, akin to Rust.</p>



<p>Appchains offer enhanced performance, as evidenced by Starknet&#8217;s recent v0.12.0 upgrade on the mainnet, which reported amplified network performance.</p>



<p>An intriguing aspect of appchains is their ability to support features not present on Starknet&#8217;s main network, such as custom fee market logic and consensus mechanisms. This flexibility empowers developers to tailor their application&#8217;s configurations and functionalities, providing greater control over their projects.</p>



<p>Starknet&#8217;s introduction of appchains represents a significant milestone in the blockchain landscape, increasing developers&#8217; capacity for customization and making the ecosystem more versatile and adaptable to specific application requirements. This move signifies a key step towards a more decentralized, diversified, and performance-oriented blockchain environment.</p>

<p>Spacebase is the on-chain community of caches. You can use STAR to create a space base, 90% of STARs are burned and 10% of STARs are allocated to NFT bounties and DAO funds. Both creators and members can get more rewards as they earn coins on the farm.</p>



<p>To create a room, users need a SPACE token, by default the room will have a maximum of 10 participants. If you want to increase the number of members of the room, the creator needs to pay the corresponding SPACE token.</p>

<p>SPACE Bridge is specially designed for transferrin SPACE/xSPACE/Planet NFT between different chains, currently Evmos and zkSync Era.</p>



<p><strong>Transfer Rate</strong></p>



<p>When chains transfer transfer SPACE/xSPACE, there&#8217;ll be a bridge fee (5%, adjustable), marked as Transfer Rate, to maintain the balance of different. Planet NFT won&#8217;t. An amount of SPACE will be charged as the gas fee for bridging. The token in the original chain will be burned and a corresponding amount of token will be issued in the target chain as native token.</p>



<p><strong>Burn and Bonus</strong></p>



<p>90% of bridge fee will be burned and 10% will be allocated to NFT Bonus (70%) &amp; DAO (30%) in the original chain.</p>

<p>SpaceFi community co-built a validator on Evmos named spacefi.io. We encourage the community to participate in Evmos and zkSync ecosystem building and governance. There&#8217;ll be delegator points for stakers, based on staked amount, time and number of voting.</p>



<p>spacefi.io validator has a co-building and sharing mechanism for stakers and SpaceFi community.</p>



<ul>
<li>For Delegators: there will be extra airdrop, WL and NFT as incentive.</li>



<li>For SpaceFi community: 50% of validator commission will be redistributed to planet NFT holders, community contributors, buyback and burning $STAR.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Tokenomics</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SPACE</strong></h3>



<p>SPACE is the utility and governance token of SpaceFi. The Max Supply of SPACE token is 50M on zkSync Era mainnet, with an initial supply of 10M SPACE at genesis for incentive, IDO and strategic reserves. This will balance early contributors and future development needs to pursue long-term benefits with the community.</p>



<p>SPACE Token has a &#8216;thirdening&#8217; allocation schedule, with the distribution of tokens to the market according to a deflationary mechanism. In particular, with each passing year, the amount of SPACE Token distributed out will be reduced by one third (a deflationary mechanism similar to Bitcoin Halving).</p>



<p>Token Allocation:</p>



<ul>
<li>80%, to the community
<ul>
<li>70%, allocated to mining rewards, for liquidity rewards, staking, trading mining, etc.</li>



<li>10%, allocated to DAO treasury, through governance, for ecological construction, strategic cooperation, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>20%, to the dev team</li>
</ul>



<p>If certain individuals on the initial development team are no longer part of the network, the community may choose to reclaim any unpublished tokens and redirect them to the new program.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>xSPACE TOKEN</strong></h3>



<p>xSPACE is a non-transferable escrow management token, converted with a 1:1 SPACE key with a 30-day non-binding term. If you choose to unlink xSPACE immediately, 50% of SPACE will be converted back and the remaining 50% will be burned.</p>



<p>It can be earned from farming or converting SPACE directly. xSPACE can be staked on the farm to earn more xSPACE and used in future SpaceFi administration.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>xEVMOS TOKEN</strong></h3>



<p>Evmos was approved on January 25, 2023 to grant 1 million EVMOS to SpaceFi as a liquidity incentive.</p>



<p>As in the proposal, the project will launch a non-tradable reward token, xEVMOS, which is 1:1 converted from EVMOS issued by the Evmos community team. The reward earned on the farm is xEVMOS, which can be converted back to EVMOS with a 30-day non-union period.</p>



<p>Users can also choose to immediately unlink xEVMOS, which will only convert back to 50% in EVMOS. The remaining 50% will be sent back to the requested EVMOS multi-signature address, which can make the offer last longer.</p>



<p>With xEVMOS, we are able to reduce reward spending and dumping while maintaining an attractive APR and incentivizing long-term holders. The liquidity offer can last for more than 90 days if some users choose to unlink xEVMOS immediately.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>SpaceFi is connecting the Cosmos and Ethereum Layer2 ecosystems, exploring on-chain solutions and interoperability of assets. As a first step, SpaceFi will start from DEX+NFT+Starter+Spacebase, aiming to become a tool in the Evmos ecosystem. It will then launch on the zkSync mainnet and other EVM chains in the future.</p>



<p>Space has created a fully integrated system that strives to create sustainable chemistry between the products. In the Space universe, you can earn DeFi rewards through liquidity mining, trading mining or minting Star tokens into NFTs for higher revenue, transaction fee dividends, premium trading, and governance rights, etc. At the same time, you can also create a Spacebase, invite fans and friends to join, both sides get additional rewards. Space will also be on the Starter platform to incubate and support outstanding ecological projects, and jointly build Space.</p>

<p>Binance France recently published its first audited financial statements covering a 14-month period from November 8, 2021, to December 31, 2022. The statements revealed that Binance France held approximately €1bn in crypto assets on behalf of its French resident users and 7M USDT on its own account. </p>



<p>The company also recorded a €4M loss in 2022 due to the accounts covering 14 months of expenses but only six months of revenue. Binance France only received revenue after it was able to serve users on receipt of regulatory approval from the AMF, approximately halfway through 2022. Meanwhile, the firm incurred operating costs starting in November 2021. The audited financial statements were audited by RSM Paris.</p>



<p>Binance France&#8217;s income primarily consists of trading fees, and the company projects that it will be in profit in its 2023 accounts with a combined 12 months of income and expenses. The audited financial statements also revealed that the company&#8217;s operating expenses of €14m consisted of staff costs and related payroll charges, marketing expenses, professional fees, administrative expenses, and taxes.</p>



<p>Binance France&#8217;s financial year started in November 2021, when the company was established and ended in December 2022. Financial reporting for 2023 will cover January to December. The company&#8217;s VASP registration was granted in May 2022, and French resident users signed new terms and conditions in July 2022, becoming clients of Binance France. The entity started to receive the revenues generated from these clients in its accounts. In contrast, expenses (including the costs associated with its registration) started from the creation of Binance France in November 2021.</p>



<p>Binance chose RSM as its independent auditors due to the firm&#8217;s strong reputation, global presence, and a team of 57,000 people. Local laws and regulations generally drive audit requirements, and any Binance entity required to be audited complies with its obligations. Binance France is not the only Binance entity that has been audited.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cB7IRtUO.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cB7IRtUO-1024x538.jpeg" alt="Conic Finance Investigates Vulnerability After $3.2 Million Attack on ETH Omnipool" class="wp-image-204775" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cB7IRtUO-1024x538.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cB7IRtUO-300x158.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cB7IRtUO-768x403.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cB7IRtUO-750x394.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cB7IRtUO-1140x599.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cB7IRtUO.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Conic Finance Investigates Vulnerability After $3.2 Million Attack on ETH Omnipool 31"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The platform disabled ETH Omnipool deposits on its frontend while the team continues to investigate the root cause of the vulnerability. They are also in communication with relevant parties to address the issue.</p>



<p>Blockchain security organization PeckShield conducted an analysis of the attack and identified the new CurveLPOracleV2 contract as the root cause. According to their preliminary findings, the attack was related to read-only reentrancy issues in the contract. Interestingly, PeckShield&#8217;s audit had previously flagged similar issues, but the newly launched CurveLPOracleV2 contract was not included in the scope of the audit.</p>



<p>Conic Finance is actively working on resolving the situation and has taken measures to prevent further exploitation. However, as a precautionary step, they have temporarily disabled <a href="https://coincu.com/204250-bankless-report-ethereum-q2-revenue-plunges-33-3/">ETH</a> Omnipool deposits on the frontend to safeguard user funds.</p>

<p>The incident highlights the importance of thorough security audits and constant vigilance in the DeFi space. It also emphasizes the significance of including all relevant contracts in security assessments to prevent potential vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>As Conic Finance continues its investigation and collaborates with relevant stakeholders, users are advised to stay updated on the platform&#8217;s official communications for further developments and security updates. Investors and users should remain cautious and refrain from making any deposits or transactions until the issue is fully resolved.</p>



<p>Despite this setback, the DeFi community&#8217;s response to such incidents is a testament to its resilience and commitment to addressing security challenges. As the investigation progresses, the incident is likely to spark further discussions about security best practices in the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape.</p>



<p>Overall, Conic Finance&#8217;s prompt action in addressing the vulnerability and conducting a thorough investigation reflects the commitment of DeFi platforms to safeguarding user assets and maintaining trust in the ecosystem. However, users must remain vigilant and exercise caution while the situation unfolds.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/banque-de-france.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="634" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/banque-de-france-1024x634.jpeg" alt="Bank Of France Finds Wholesale CBDC Improves Cross-Border Payments" class="wp-image-204768" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/banque-de-france-1024x634.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/banque-de-france-300x186.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/banque-de-france-768x476.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/banque-de-france-750x464.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/banque-de-france-1140x706.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/banque-de-france.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bank Of France Finds Wholesale CBDC Improves Cross-Border Payments 33"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The Bank of France&#8217;s testing of wholesale CBDC (wCBDC) using distributed ledger technology (DLT) has shown promising results. The experiments, launched in March 2020, included 12 tests that demonstrated the operational feasibility of issuing wCBDC directly on DLT. Three models were tested: interoperability, distribution, and integration. These models covered financial tokenization and cross-border transactions, offering valuable insights.</p>



<p>Key conclusions from the experiments include the benefits of wCBDC as a complement to retail CBDC, ensuring the stability and convertibility of central bank money. International cooperation and public-private partnerships are vital to creating a globally inclusive and interoperable wholesale CBDC framework.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tai-xuong-2.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="446" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tai-xuong-2.jpeg" alt="Bank Of France Finds Wholesale CBDC Improves Cross-Border Payments" class="wp-image-204769" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tai-xuong-2.jpeg 800w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tai-xuong-2-300x167.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tai-xuong-2-768x428.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tai-xuong-2-750x418.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="Bank Of France Finds Wholesale CBDC Improves Cross-Border Payments 34"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Interoperability is crucial for seamless data and transaction exchange between DLT-based and conventional infrastructures. Climate concerns have highlighted the need for energy-efficient solutions in designing wCBDCs. Technological advancements offer central banks various means to maintain control over their wholesale CBDC while remaining technologically neutral and adopting common standards.</p>



<p>DLT can enhance straight-through processing of trade and post-trade activities, contributing to overall financial stability. Continued experiments at domestic and international levels are essential for further analysis and the development of an operational framework through a learning-by-doing approach. <a href="https://coincu.com/203975-societe-generales-granted-license-crypto-service/">The Bank of France</a> plans to support the Eurosystem and explore cross-border payment improvements based on these findings.</p>



<p>The report also highlights the importance of energy-efficient solutions and continued experiments to advance the operational framework for wholesale CBDCs. The results of the wCBDC experiment indicate promising prospects for using distributed ledger technology to improve cross-border payments and establish a more efficient and inclusive wholesale CBDC ecosystem. As the exploration continues, it may pave the way for transformative changes in the global financial landscape.</p>

<p>Recently, Ripple&#8217;s European managing director, Sendi Young, disclosed that the company has applied for an encryption license with the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and a payments license in Ireland.</p>



<p>The application for the encryption license in the UK aims to establish Ripple as an encrypted asset company, while the payments license in Ireland will facilitate its payment services in the region. These moves signal Ripple&#8217;s commitment to strengthening its presence and services in the European market.</p>



<p>While Young refrained from providing specific growth targets, she confirmed that Ripple is actively increasing its workforce in the UK and Europe. The company has witnessed a remarkable 75% growth in its workforce over the past 18 months in the region. Presently, more than 100 out of Ripple&#8217;s approximately 900 global employees are based in offices located in London, Dublin, and Reykjavik, Iceland.</p>

<p>Despite its expansion efforts in Europe, <a href="https://coincu.com/203962-ripple-jumps-over-10/">Ripple</a> emphasizes that the US remains its global hub and there are no indications of a shift in that status. The expansion in Europe is seen as a strategic move to better serve customers and engage with the growing crypto and blockchain community in the region.</p>



<p>The firm move to obtain regulatory licenses aligns with its commitment to compliance and legal adherence. By seeking approval from the UK FCA and Ireland&#8217;s regulatory authorities, Ripple aims to operate within the legal framework of the respective countries and ensure a smooth and secure platform for its users.</p>



<p>As the firm&#8217;s expansion plans unfold in the UK and Europe, the company&#8217;s vision for growth and innovation in the crypto and blockchain industry gains momentum. The developments will be closely monitored by the market and users, as they continue to play a significant role in shaping the future of global payments and encrypted assets.</p>
