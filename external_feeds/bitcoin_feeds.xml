At a meeting with China’s top diplomat for the region, the leader of the war-torn Middle Eastern country called for using the Chinese yuan for cross-border trade.</strong></p>
<h2>Economic Clash With West Requires Discarding Dollar, BRICS Leadership, Syrian President Says</h2>
<p>Confrontation with the United States and the West in general has been taking place mainly in the economic field and that makes it increasingly necessary to ditch the U.S. dollar as a currency for global transactions, President Bashar Assad of Syria was quoted as saying by Sana, the Syrian state-controlled news agency.</p>
<p>Assad emphasized that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BRICS</a> bloc, through the adoption of the Chinese yuan for trade transactions between nations, can play a leading role in that regard. He made the comments during a meeting with the Chinese government’s Special Envoy for the Middle East, Zhai Jun, whom he received on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Syrian leader also praised the Chinese mediation that resulted in the rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran, both of which are applying for membership in BRICS. He believes the improvement of their relations will positively impact the stability of the whole region.</p>

<p>According to Assad, the entire world today needs the Chinese presence, politically and economically, to rebalance the global situation. The BRICS alliance constitutes a strong international space capable of creating an international multipolar order, he added. His comments come after his foreign minister recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/syrian-official-says-us-imposes-sanctions-to-steal-nations-assets-and-exert-control/">accused</a> the United States of imposing sanctions on Syria in order to steal its assets and keep it under its hegemony.</p>
<p>The Chinese official assured Bashar Assad that Beijing will continue to support Damascus in international forums and “it&#8217;s battle against hegemony, terrorism and external interference.” Zhai Jun also said that China backs the rapprochement between Syria and the other Arab countries.</p>
<p>Chinese diplomacy has been quite active in the region and beyond in an attempt to expand the influence of the People’s Republic on the global stage. China initiated talks about the potential <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-getting-applications-to-join-every-day-attracts-19-requests-before-summit/">enlargement</a> of BRICS and has been trying to promote the use of the yuan in international trade while <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/china-ready-to-talk-asian-monetary-fund-to-cut-dollar-dependence-malaysia-says/">supporting</a> efforts to reduce dependence on the U.S. currency.</p>

Stating that the Fed “is criminal,” he warned that its actions “will bring down” the United States.</strong></p>
<h2>Robert Kiyosaki Says the Fed Is Criminal</h2>
<p>The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, warned in a series of tweets this week that the Fed is wiping out regional banks by supporting only the big banks, such as JPMorgan Chase. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.</p>
<p>Kiyosaki tweeted Wednesday: “WTF. What The Fed? Why is Fed destroying regional banks across America? Regional banks are [the] heart and soul of [the] economy. Fed via the Repo Market [is] killing regional banks. Is this intentional? Is a depression intentional? WTF is Fed up to? Get $ out of regionals.”</p>
<p>The renowned author followed up with a tweet Thursday, stating that even online retail giant Amazon is affected by the Fed’s actions. “Without credit flowing, Amazon is cutting 18,000 jobs,” he stressed, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>The ripple effect from WTFed will bring down USA … WTFed wiping out regional banks.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a separate tweet, Kiyosaki cautioned that by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmaker-urges-government-to-guarantee-all-deposits-to-avoid-runs-on-smaller-banks/">supporting only the big banks</a>, such as JPMorgan Chase, the Fed is wiping out regional banks. Calling the Fed&#8217;s action “Cruel,” Kiyosaki reiterated his previous statement that regional banks are the heart and soul of America. Calling the Fed &#8220;criminal,&#8221; he then urged his 2.4 million Twitter followers to support small banks and small businesses.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-585722 aligncenter" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kiyosaki-tweet-about-banking-crisis.jpg" alt="" width="810" height="235" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kiyosaki-tweet-about-banking-crisis-300x87.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kiyosaki-tweet-about-banking-crisis-768x223.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kiyosaki-tweet-about-banking-crisis.jpg 810w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" /></p>

<p>On Friday, Kiyosaki warned in another tweet about President Joe Biden’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) and went on to recommend his customary choices of investing in additional gold, silver, and bitcoin. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>In his book 1984, George Orwell warned ‘Big Brother is watching.’ Biden’s CBDC is ‘Big Brother.’ Buy more gold, silver, and bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a recent episode of his Rich Dad Show, Kiyosaki discussed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-of-economic-chaos-war-breaking-out-gold-crashing/">economic chaos</a>, war breaking out, and rising starvation. Earlier this month, he said, &#8220;America is dying,&#8221; <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-america-is-dying-warns-of-hyperinflation-death-of-us-dollar/">warning</a> about hyperinflation and the death of the U.S. dollar.</p>

<h2>Agreement on BRICS Currency Could Be Reached in 2023, Says Russian Official</h2>
<p>Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on the Financial Market, discussed BRICS currency and the de-dollarization trend on Wednesday at the press center of Parliamentary Newspaper, the publication of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>Aksakov expects the share of the U.S. dollar in international trade to decline, noting that Americans continuing to destroy the value of the dollar with their own hands shows the whole world that the USD is being used for political purposes. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>By linking its economy and currency to politics, the U.S. is practically undermining the foundations of its dominance. I am sure that the share of the dollar in world trade will steadily decline.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Russian official added that now there is a search for some kind of collective currencies, emphasizing that a discussion on this topic is already on the agenda of the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).</p>
<p>Aksakov further stated that while the negotiations are at an early stage, an agreement can be reached in 2023.</p>

<p>The BRICS nations have been ramping up their de-dollarization efforts and are currently working to create a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-working-on-creating-new-currency-to-be-discussed-at-next-leaders-summit/">common currency</a> that will reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar. State Duma Deputy Chairman Alexander Babakov said last month that BRICS currency is expected to be <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-working-on-creating-new-currency-to-be-discussed-at-next-leaders-summit/">discussed</a> at the next leaders&#8217; summit in August.</p>
<p>The economic bloc is also pushing to expand its <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-push-to-expand-global-influence-to-counter-the-wests-destructive-actions/">global influence</a>. A Russian official said this week that Russia is actively <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-actively-discussing-brics-expansion-with-member-nations-official-reveals/">discussing BRICS expansion</a> with member countries. So far, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-getting-applications-to-join-every-day-attracts-19-requests-before-summit/">19 nations</a> have either applied to join the group or have expressed interest to join. However, multiple people have warned that a BRICS currency will <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currency-will-erode-us-dollars-dominance-former-white-house-economist-warns/">erode</a> the U.S. dollar&#8217;s dominance.</p>

<p>Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/pepe-token-surges-77-in-24-hours-leading-the-top-10-meme-coins-market-gains/">reported</a> on PEPE and several other meme coin assets eight days ago. At that time, PEPE was the sixth-largest meme token asset by overall valuation. Today, PEPE is the fifth-largest, and the market capitalization recorded on April 22 of $141 million has risen to more than $303 million. On April 30, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pepe">PEPE</a> had $149.63 million in global trade volume, hovering just below cardano&#x2019;s (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>) daily volume on Sunday. The meme token is down 10% lower than its all-time high recorded on Sunday at $0.000000813847 per unit.</p>

<p>PEPE is also 1,217% higher than the all-time low of $0.000000055142 per unit recorded on April 18, 2023, or roughly two weeks ago. There are 420.69 trillion PEPE coins in circulation today. According to <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/pepe/richlist/">coincarp.com statistics</a>, there are 55,024 PEPE holders today. The top ten wallets hold 20.64% of the entire supply, and the top 100 PEPE holders control 43.82% of the current supply. While PEPE is hosted on centralized exchanges, the coin&#x2019;s trading activity is mostly on the decentralized exchange (dex) Uniswap (v2).</p>

<p>The market value of the meme coin economy has undergone significant fluctuations in recent months, with <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DOGE/">dogecoin (DOGE)</a> and <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/SHIB/">shiba inu (SHIB)</a> experiencing ups and downs. Meme coin assets have garnered increasing demand from investors and speculation in the cryptocurrency market since their significant rise in value since 2020. The meme coin economy is well-known for its volatility, but DOGE and SHIB have remained at the forefront of the meme coin market for the last two years. While the market value of these meme coins may fluctuate, their impact on the broader crypto economy has not been ignored.</p>

A recent poll of 105 economists revealed that 94 of them predict a 25bps rate hike will occur during the May 2-3 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. While economists are anticipating a rate hike in May, they anticipate that it will be the final one in 2023. The majority of polled economists believe that the Fed will maintain the rate at 5.25% for the remainder of the year.</strong></p>
<h2>Report Says Next Phase of the Tightening Cycle Is Holding Benchmark Rate at Current Levels</h2>
<p>Several reports and surveys indicate that market observers believe the U.S. central bank will increase the benchmark interest rate by 25bps at the FOMC meeting this week. The FOMC meeting is scheduled to take place on May 2-3 and according to the CME Group Fedwatch tool, <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html">83.9%</a> suspect a 25bps rate hike will come to fruition. On the other hand, the Fedwatch tool shows 16.1% predicts no rate hike for the upcoming May meeting.</p>

<p>The most recent predictions ahead of the next FOMC meeting are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economists-expect-the-fed-to-reveal-another-25bps-rate-hike-before-pausing-for-the-rest-of-2023/">similar to the forecasts</a> economists gave at the beginning of April 2023. Additionally, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-29/fed-rates-latest-us-central-bank-seen-hiking-even-as-economic-risks-build">reported</a> on April 29, that economists the publication talked to also believe a 25bps rise is in the cards.</p>
<p>Bloomberg’s economics report states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Signs point to the FOMC raising rates by 25 basis points to 5.25% in the May 3 decision — despite ongoing turmoil in the banking system — and signaling that this will be the last hike for a while. The next phase of the tightening cycle will be to hold rates at that elevated level, while watching to see if inflation trends down.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Survey Shows 90% of Economists Suspect a 25bps Rise in May, BOFA Analyst Says Additional Hikes Beyond May Uncertain</h2>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/fed-deliver-25-basis-point-hike-may-stay-hold-rest-year-2023-04-20/">survey</a> from Reuters, a vast majority (90%) of 105 economists polled suspect a 25bps hike. Additionally, 59 of those economists believe that the federal funds rate will remain unchanged for the rest of the year following the predicted May hike, while 26 participants are forecasting a rate cut. Furthermore, most of the economists surveyed by Reuters do not anticipate the inflation rate in the U.S. to reach the Fed&#8217;s 2% target until 2025. The economists also noted that there’s still a risk of inflation rates spiking again this year.</p>

<p>Michael Gapen, the chief U.S. economist at Bank of America (BOFA) Securities, commented that a whole lot remains to be accomplished before the 2% goal can come to a realization. Gapen also added that it is uncertain whether or not the Fed will hike the benchmark rate after May.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the data front, despite the slowdown in inflation in March, there is still a lot more work to be done to get back to the 2% target,&#8221; Gapen said. &#8220;We maintain the first rate cut in March 2024. Should the stresses in the financial system be reduced in short order, we cannot rule out that stronger macro data will lead the Fed to put in additional hikes beyond May,” the BOFA executive added.</p>

Since then, over 400,000 ether, valued at $763 million, has been added to 17 liquid staking platforms.</strong></p>
<h2>Ethereum Liquid Staking Platforms Continue to Swell</h2>
<p>As of today, April 30, 2023, the total value locked into liquid staking protocols such as Lido Finance, Coinbase&#8217;s Wrapped Staked Ether, Rocket Pool, Frax, Stakewise, Stakehound, Ankr, Ether.fi, and Bitfrost is just over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230430010511/https://defillama.com/lsd">$16 billion</a>.</p>
<p>According to 30-day statistics, six out of the top ten protocols, ranked by value locked, have experienced gains over the past month, with four of them showing double-digit growth. At present, Lido dominates the $16 billion market, holding 73.6% or 6,206,101 of the 8,431,605 ethereum locked in liquid staking protocols.</p>

<p>Data shows that just after the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethereums-shapella-upgrade-unlocks-staked-ether-over-860k-eth-poised-for-withdrawal-price-surges-6/">Shapella upgrade</a>, 400,735 ethereum worth $763,600,542 using today’s ether exchange rates has been added to the liquid staking cache. Lido’s 30-day metrics show an increase of 5.50% while Coinbase’s liquid staking platform saw a loss of 0.64% over the last month.</p>
<p>Rocket Pool’s total value locked (TVL) jumped 29.24% in 30 days while Frax’s TVL rose by 31.65%. Like Lido, Stakewise, the fifth-largest liquid staking protocol saw a modest 30-day increase rising 1.23% higher.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-585681 size-full" title="Ethereum's Liquid Staking Protocols Attract 400,000 Ether After Shapella Upgrade" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/5.jpg" alt="Ethereum's Liquid Staking Protocols Attract 400,000 Ether After Shapella Upgrade" width="1280" height="475" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/5-300x111.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/5-1024x380.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/5-768x285.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/5.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Recent data reveals that following the Shapella upgrade, a notable 400,735 ethereum, totaling $763.6 million in value, has been added to the liquid staking cache. While Lido&#8217;s 30-day metrics depict an increase of 5.50%, Coinbase&#8217;s liquid staking platform suffered a loss of 0.64% over the past month.</p>
<p>In the same period, Rocket Pool experienced a substantial 29.24% jump in total value locked (TVL), while Frax&#8217;s TVL rose by 31.65%. Similar to Lido’s small rise, Stakewise, the fifth-largest liquid staking protocol, witnessed a modest 1.23% increase over the past 30 days.</p>

<p>Binance has thrown its hat in the ring, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-launches-ether-based-liquid-staking-product-wbeth-to-rival-liquid-staking-competitors/">entering the fray</a> with a newly launched liquid staking product, now standing as the tenth largest platform under Bitfrost. As of now, the protocol&#8217;s total value locked (TVL) is approximately $38.69 million, with 20,305 ether staked into the application.</p>
<p>Liquid staking protocols have gained significant traction in recent months providing users with the convenience of earning passive staking rewards while still retaining control of their assets. The addition of 400,000 ether to the liquid staking TVL within just two weeks of the Shapella upgrade underscores the growing interest and attention this sector is receiving.</p>

The first phase of the launch will see the digital tokens being issued for &#8220;investment purposes with a vesting period of 180 days.&#8221; The RBZ also revealed that the gold-backed digital tokens &#8220;would be used both as a means of payment and a store of value.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Gold-Backed Tokens Additional Value-Preserving Instruments</h2>
<p>According to the Zimbabwean central bank, it plans to start issuing the recently mooted gold-backed digital currency on May 8. The digital currency, which will be backed by the gold held at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), is expected to complement the physical gold coins that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gold-coins-help-zimbabwe-achieve-price-and-exchange-rate-stability-central-bank/">went into circulation</a> in July 2022.</p>
<p>The announcement of the digital currency’s issuance date came just a few days after the central bank governor, John Mangudya, was quoted revealing the RBZ’s intention to fight local currency depreciation with gold-backed digital currency. Also, as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-zimbabwes-central-bank-says-upcoming-gold-backed-digital-currency-to-help-reduce-demand-for-us-dollar/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, Zimbabwe&#8217;s central bank hopes to curb the local demand for the greenback with the soon-to-be-launched digital currency.</p>
<p>However, in a <a href="https://www.rbz.co.zw/documents/press/2023/April/Press_Statement_-_Issuance_of_Gold-backed_Digital_Tokens_1.pdf">statement</a> issued on April 28, the RBZ governor revealed that the issuance of the gold-backed digital tokens &#8220;is meant to expand the value-preserving instruments available in the economy.&#8221; The gold-backed tokens are also intended to &#8220;enhance divisibility of the investment instruments and widen their access and usage by the public.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Gold-Backed Digital Currency as a Store of Value</h2>
<p>As per the statement, the issuance of the digital currency will be split into two phases. The first phase will see the digital tokens being issued for &#8220;investment purposes with a vesting period of 180 days.&#8221; According to the RBZ, the gold-backed tokens will be redeemed in the same way as physical gold coins are redeemed. Prospective buyers can acquire digital tokens using local or foreign currency, the statement added.</p>
<p>The RBZ also suggested that current holders of the Mosi-oa-Tunya gold coins will be able to acquire the digital coins using the local banking system.</p>
<p>Under the second phase, residents with digital tokens held in e-wallets or cards will be able to use such funds to settle transactions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The gold-backed digital tokens held in either e-gold wallets or e-gold cards will be tradable and capable of facilitating Person-to-Person (P2P) and Person-to-Business (P2B) transactions and settlements. It, therefore, means that the gold-backed digital tokens would be used both as a means of payment and a store of value,&#8221; the RBZ said in the statement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Fadzayi Mahere, the spokesperson of Zimbabwe’s main opposition party, <a href="https://twitter.com/advocatemahere/status/1651920025383587840g">warned</a> in a tweet that the RBZ’s gold-backed digital currency initiative could be illegal.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Is Still the &#x2018;Most Dominant&#x2019;</h2>
<p>United States Senator Ted Cruz has said he is &#x201C;incredibly bullish on bitcoin&#x201D; and he still believes the &#x201C;insight that led to its creation is still extraordinary.&#x201D; In his remarks at an event organized by the Bitcoin Policy Institute, Cruz insisted bitcoin is the &#x201C;alpha in the crypto sphere&#x201D; because it came first and &#x201C;is the most dominant one.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1651418736123944960?s=20">remarks</a> by Cruz, a Republican from Texas, came at a time when the Biden administration has upped the ante in its fight against the crypto industry. As has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/law-firms-white-paper-claims-us-bank-regulators-are-waging-a-clandestine-financial-war-against-crypto-businesses/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News since the start of 2023, U.S. officials and agencies have targeted crypto entities as part of the so-called Operation Chokepoint 2.0. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charges have ranged from illegally selling securities to American citizens to promoting these without the requisite permissions.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In response to the crackdown which is being spearheaded by the SEC, Republican senators including Cruz have slammed the regulatory body&#x2019;s chairperson Gary Gensler. Others like the pro-crypto U.S. Senator Tom Emmer <a href="https://twitter.com/GOPMajorityWhip/status/1648375157805793292">claimed </a>that Gensler&#x2019;s actions are &#x201C;pushing innovation into the hands of a communist country.&#x201D; Senator Cynthia Lummis, a <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> advocate and investor, also <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/crypto/congressional-republicans-arent-happy-sec-effort-rein-crypto-platforms-rcna73188">voiced</a> her displeasure with the SEC&#x2019;s crypto regulation approach.</p>

<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> a Hedge Against Inflation</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, in his address at the Bitcoin Policy Institute event, Cruz explained why he and many others are attracted to bitcoin.</p>
<p>&#x201C;One of the attractions to bitcoin is as a hedge against inflation and particularly when you have irresponsible politicians in Washington that spend money like drunken sailors,&#x201D; Cruz said.</p>
<p>Cruz added that the printing of trillions of dollars over the past two years had led to what he described as &#x201C;significant inflation.&#x201D; According to Cruz, since <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is less &#x201C;susceptible to government control&#x201D; it can therefore act as an &#x201C;important check&#x201D; against wasting government spending.</p>
<p>The Texas Senator also claimed that he likes <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> for the &#x201C;same reason that the Chinese Communist government doesn&#x2019;t like bitcoin.&#x201D;</p>
