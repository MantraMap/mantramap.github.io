			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Liquidity Remains Muted:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 26 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) extended its multi-session extremely tight trading range early in the Asian session as the pair was unable to trade too far away from the 16880.44 area, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460.&nbsp;&nbsp; A recent rebound saw BTC/USD test the 18469.40 area, a level it could not sustain as elevated risk aversion resulted in more downward pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp; Selling pressure recently intensified around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels and BTC/USD tested downside price objectives related to these levels, including the 16375.18 area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD has depreciated approximately 63% year-to-date, and is off more than 1% month-to-date.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16841.43 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16815.27.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bearishly below MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>2022 and the ongoing bear market have seen a wave of unprecedented losses, bankruptcies, and liquidations. According to a recent report by Forbes, crypto billionaires lost a total of $116 billion during the year. </p>
<p>According to investigations and a report compiled by Forbes, the bear market has seen $116 billion drained from the pockets of investors in the past nine months. Forbes indicates that the loss represents the combined personal equity of 17 persons in the space, with over 15 of those persons losing more than half their fortunes since March 2022, and 10 names were consequently removed from the cryptocurrency billionaires list. Cointelegraph reported that one of the biggest losses was realized by Binance CEO Changpeng &ldquo;CZ&rdquo; Zhao who is March 70% stake in Binance was valued at a whopping $65 billion but is now only worth $4.5 billion.</p>
<p>Post-pandemic economic shock, which triggered waves of inflation and rising interest rates have taken capital out of a speculative cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>
<p>Major losses can also be attributed to the CEOs of other cryptocurrency exchanges. Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, had an estimated net worth of $6 billion in March but is now only worth $1.5 billion. Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen has reduced by more than half, dropping from $4.3 billion in March to $2.1 billion as it stands. The Winklevoss twins of Gemini were valued at $4 billion each earlier in the year but are now each only worth around $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest losses seen in 2022, were seen by FTX co-founders Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang. Their fortunes stood at $24 billion and $5.9 billion respectively but stood at $0 as of December.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">American multinational investment bank and financial services holding firm JPMorgan Chase has published the results of a research project it has engaged in. The report highlights how trends have emerged in the demographic they sampled, reflecting a shift in preferences among U.S. crypto users.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The report, titled "The Dynamics and Demographics of U.S. Household Crypto-Asset Use" was co-authored by the company's President, Chris Wheat, and George Eckerd, the firm's Financial Markets Research Lead. According to the authors, their methodology went through "de-identified data covering a sample of nearly 5 million active checking account customers, over 600 thousand of which have conducted transfers to crypto accounts."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The research details how most crypto users based or registered from the U.S. increasingly made first-time transactions during the height of crypto-asset price surges. The report also points to how crypto usage is skewed towards "men, Asian individuals, and younger individuals with higher incomes."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The report also found that holdings for each wallet tend to be "relatively small" given how median flows are equal to less than a week's worth of earnings. However, this is counteracted by the results that show how roughly 15% of users have net transfers that are over the average monthly income per individual. This points to how cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular among U.S. households, but their use has been relatively small in comparison to other investing options such as stocks and bonds.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite this relative lack of exposure, a small subset of crypto users may have financial risk if the crypto market declines further. About 15 percent of crypto users have transferred over one month's worth of take-home pay into crypto accounts, making them more vulnerable to future price drops, compared than non-crypto investors; this percentage increases as the price of cryptocurrencies drops.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The trend also points to how most of these holders transferred crypto when prices "were significantly higher than recent levels" while the lower-income bracket of the demographic often made purchases at higher levels, compared to holders who had access to more income.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">When the price of a security rises quickly, households typically react by transferring money into that asset. The researchers from JPMorganChase thus concluded that this implies that the "timing" of these transfers is characteristic of "herd behavior". To add, the researchers note that American households tended to make large investments in cryptocurrencies during the period when their value was rising sharply.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Using data on the time of transfers to cryptocurrency accounts as a proxy for investment price, JPMorgan Chase's research found that households with lower incomes tended to purchase cryptoassets at substantially higher prices than other groups. According to the financial firm, this would also mean that at the rates that cryptocurrencies were trading at in late-2022, the majority of U.S. households would have been losing money overall if they had owned any cryptocurrency for more than a few months.Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>When the cryptocurrency market becomes volatile, traders switch from spot platforms where they can buy and hold to derivatives platforms where they can hedge the market, trade long and short, and rely on powerful tactics such as adding leverage to positions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The demand for derivatives has led to an explosion of competition throughout the cryptocurrency industry, making it much more challenging to find a platform with unique differentiators and quality throughout all products and services. The list below represents the top ten best crypto derivatives platforms for 2023, helping you start the year on the right foot and immediately begin making serious profits in the new year.</p>
<p>The Best Crypto Derivatives Platforms By Rank</p>
<p>#10) Bitget</p>
<p>Bitget is among the less popular cryptocurrency derivatives trading platforms on the list but deserves mention among the list due to being ranked in the top five platforms by trading volume globally by CoinGecko. It&rsquo;s been around since 2018, which is a positive sign. Bitget futures are settled in USDT, USDC, or via specific coins for up to 125x leverage.</p>
<p>In addition to cryptocurrency futures, Bitget has spot trading, copy trading, and a launchpad program. Recent coin launches include Revoland, an esports game based on blockchain technology; Kyoko, a DAO-to-DAO credit provider; and Bot Planet, a multichain ecosystem with Play-To-Earn and NFT elements.</p>
<p>#9) Phemex</p>
<p>Phemex is currently celebrating its third anniversary, priding itself in being &ldquo;safe, super, and simple,&rdquo; as well as one of the &ldquo;fastest&rdquo; crypto exchanges around. The company&rsquo;s founders in the past served as senior executives at Morgan Stanley but left the traditional banking system seeking to spread universal financial access globally.</p>
<p>Phemex doesn&rsquo;t offer much more than our number ten pick but does have more prominence in the trading community. Phemex also has a launchpad, spot trading, and of course, derivatives contracts. Derivatives include copy trading and perpetual swaps with up to 100x leverage.</p>
<p>#8) MEXC Global</p>
<p>Another platform launched in 2018, MEXC Global, boasts of its &ldquo;mega transaction matching technology,&rdquo; capable of 1.4 million transactions per second. In 2021, it was awarded the Best Crypto Exchange Asia by Crypto Expo Dubai.</p>
<p>MEXC Global lets users buy crypto with a debit or credit card and trade spot crypto and leveraged EFTs, in addition to a wide range of futures with up to 200x leverage, settled in stablecoins or top crypto assets. MEXC also has a futures leaderboard and copy trading.</p>
<p>#7) ByBit</p>
<p>While Phemex was on its third anniversary, ByBit is now celebrating its fourth year in operation. It has since grown to include a Web3 wallet, high LTV crypto loans, a varied earn program with liquidity mining, crypto savings accounts, and a launchpool for staking new tokens. There&rsquo;s also a launchpad, much like others on the list.</p>
<p>We will start to see a trend among some of the platforms listed. For example, top platforms will each offer the ability to buy crypto. ByBit is known best for its derivatives, with copy trading, options, and perpetual swaps with up to 100x leverage.</p>
<p>#6) Deribit</p>
<p>Although other platforms on the list are much more significant in terms of market share in futures and perpetual swaps, Deribit is the leader in cryptocurrency options. For many, options are the derivative contract of choice, while others prefer futures and perpetual swaps. Deribit offers BTC, ETH, and SOL options.</p>
<p>Because Deribit has the highest open interest out of all options platforms, it utilizes its unique market data through its insights blog, which traders can use to predict cryptocurrency market volatility or possible price movements. For example, when puts are at a record high, higher prices are possible if a contrarian move unfolds.</p>
<p>#5) OKX</p>
<p>OKX recently saw a rebrand that removed the &ldquo;E&rdquo; from its name to diminish the influence of the word exchange on its products and services lineup. OKX seeks to be viewed as a decentralized platform at the center of Web3. The platform offers solutions for developers, and a set of official decentralized applications users can take advantage of.</p>
<p>OKX has it all in terms of derivatives, with futures, options, perpetual swaps, and margin trading at up to 125x leverage. There are also trading bots, a learn program, crypto loans, and a jumpstart program offering access to new projects from around the world.</p>
<p>#4) Huobi Global</p>
<p>Huobi Global is one of the longest-running platforms on the list, with a shocking zero security incidents in the past nine years of operation &ndash; a true testament to the platform&rsquo;s top-tier security and risk management protocols. It commands a massive amount of crypto derivatives trading volume but has lost market share in recent years.</p>
<p>Huobi&rsquo;s longevity has given it time to develop a wide range of products and services, which include crypto loans, passive income, spot trading, and trading bots. In terms of derivatives, there&rsquo;s once again a lot to offer, with futures, copy trading, and both American and European-style options to choose from. Supported leverage reaches 100x at maximum.</p>
<p>#3) KuCoin</p>
<p>KuCoin does everything it can to compete with Binance, complete with biting its logo and feature set. Others have also sought to go toe-to-toe with Binance regarding products and services, but the carbon copy is less blatant elsewhere. But being on par with Binance isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing &ndash; and market leaders are often copied.</p>
<p>What KuCoin does offer is reliable and proven, with the ability to buy crypto, earn interest on crypto, trade spot, and access a web3 wallet. It also includes an NFT platform. Leveraged tokens are offered in addition to crypto futures at up to 100x leverage.</p>
<p>#2) Binance</p>
<p>You might be surprised to find that Binance is no longer the number one cryptocurrency derivative platform in the market. The ongoing drama and close distance to the FTX fallout have tarnished the cryptocurrency platform&rsquo;s reputation and made it a target of the US SEC and Department of Justice. World-renowned financial analysts call the platform and its CEO a &ldquo;ticking time bomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There has recently been a mass exodus of withdrawals of BTC &ndash; the largest ever recorded &ndash; due to fear over Binance potentially having similar issues as FTX. Fears include the BNB token being worthless in the event of a collapse, much like what occurred with the FTT token. Others believe Binance is too big to fail.</p>
<p>Binance still dominates the cryptocurrency market in terms of overall trading volume, making it a mandatory inclusion in this list. It also has one of the most extensive ranges of products and services, including an NFT marketplace, an earn program, loans, a Binance card, spot trading, and derivatives. Futures, options, and leveraged tokens all max out at 125x leverage.</p>
<p>#1) PrimeXBT</p>
<p>PrimeXBT has become the quintessential platform in the cryptocurrency market because it is the only one on the list to provide access to traditional asset classes like stock indices, commodities, metals, and forex currencies, in addition to a wide variety of popular cryptocurrencies. Using BTC, ETH, USDT, or USDC as collateral, traders can open long and short positions on more than 100 different trading instruments simultaneously.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are becoming an increasingly important asset class, highly sensitive to macro factors such as recessions, inflation, pandemics, and interest rates. This makes the inclusion of assets like gold, the S&amp;P 500, oil, and others more important to consider when trading crypto. With PrimeXBT, you don&rsquo;t need to sell your crypto and can instead use it to margin trade with up to 200x leverage on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other top cryptocurrencies. Leverage on traditional assets runs even higher, up to 500x.</p>
<p>PrimeXBT was also a pioneer in copy trading, making its Covesting service among the most battle-tested, with the largest communities of top traders from around the globe. As of the time of this writing, the leaderboards have traders in the top five ranging from 1,000 to 4,000% ROI. Followers can, with a click, start automatically copying the trades of highly successful traders with proven performance metrics.</p>
<p>Other bells and whistles include an award-winning crypto trading app for Android and iOS, the PrimeXBT Trading Academy educational website, PrimeXBT Contests, interest-bearing yield accounts, the best referral program in finance, and much more. What really put the platform over the edge was the recent award from Crypto Expo Dubai for the Most Trusted Crypto-Asset Trading Platform. Trust in 2023 will be more critical than ever before, giving the platform an advantage with the broader crypto community.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>While you can&rsquo;t go wrong with any of the platforms on this list, PrimeXBT was picked as number one for a reason. For serious profits in 2023, the best crypto derivatives platform is PrimeXBT.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the cryptocurrency market becomes volatile, traders switch from spot platforms where they can buy and hold to derivatives platforms where they can hedge the market, trade long and short, and rely on powerful tactics such as adding leverage to positions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The demand for derivatives has led to an explosion of competition throughout the cryptocurrency industry, making it much more challenging to find a platform with unique differentiators and quality throughout all products and services. The list below represents the top ten best crypto derivatives platforms for 2023, helping you start the year on the right foot and immediately begin making serious profits in the new year.</p>
<p>The Best Crypto Derivatives Platforms By Rank</p>
<p>#10) Bitget</p>
<p>Bitget is among the less popular cryptocurrency derivatives trading platforms on the list but deserves mention among the list due to being ranked in the top five platforms by trading volume globally by CoinGecko. It&rsquo;s been around since 2018, which is a positive sign. Bitget futures are settled in USDT, USDC, or via specific coins for up to 125x leverage.</p>
<p>In addition to cryptocurrency futures, Bitget has spot trading, copy trading, and a launchpad program. Recent coin launches include Revoland, an esports game based on blockchain technology; Kyoko, a DAO-to-DAO credit provider; and Bot Planet, a multichain ecosystem with Play-To-Earn and NFT elements.</p>
<p>#9) Phemex</p>
<p>Phemex is currently celebrating its third anniversary, priding itself in being &ldquo;safe, super, and simple,&rdquo; as well as one of the &ldquo;fastest&rdquo; crypto exchanges around. The company&rsquo;s founders in the past served as senior executives at Morgan Stanley but left the traditional banking system seeking to spread universal financial access globally.</p>
<p>Phemex doesn&rsquo;t offer much more than our number ten pick but does have more prominence in the trading community. Phemex also has a launchpad, spot trading, and of course, derivatives contracts. Derivatives include copy trading and perpetual swaps with up to 100x leverage.</p>
<p>#8) MEXC Global</p>
<p>Another platform launched in 2018, MEXC Global, boasts of its &ldquo;mega transaction matching technology,&rdquo; capable of 1.4 million transactions per second. In 2021, it was awarded the Best Crypto Exchange Asia by Crypto Expo Dubai.</p>
<p>MEXC Global lets users buy crypto with a debit or credit card and trade spot crypto and leveraged EFTs, in addition to a wide range of futures with up to 200x leverage, settled in stablecoins or top crypto assets. MEXC also has a futures leaderboard and copy trading.</p>
<p>#7) ByBit</p>
<p>While Phemex was on its third anniversary, ByBit is now celebrating its fourth year in operation. It has since grown to include a Web3 wallet, high LTV crypto loans, a varied earn program with liquidity mining, crypto savings accounts, and a launchpool for staking new tokens. There&rsquo;s also a launchpad, much like others on the list.</p>
<p>We will start to see a trend among some of the platforms listed. For example, top platforms will each offer the ability to buy crypto. ByBit is known best for its derivatives, with copy trading, options, and perpetual swaps with up to 100x leverage.</p>
<p>#6) Deribit</p>
<p>Although other platforms on the list are much more significant in terms of market share in futures and perpetual swaps, Deribit is the leader in cryptocurrency options. For many, options are the derivative contract of choice, while others prefer futures and perpetual swaps. Deribit offers BTC, ETH, and SOL options.</p>
<p>Because Deribit has the highest open interest out of all options platforms, it utilizes its unique market data through its insights blog, which traders can use to predict cryptocurrency market volatility or possible price movements. For example, when puts are at a record high, higher prices are possible if a contrarian move unfolds.</p>
<p>#5) OKX</p>
<p>OKX recently saw a rebrand that removed the &ldquo;E&rdquo; from its name to diminish the influence of the word exchange on its products and services lineup. OKX seeks to be viewed as a decentralized platform at the center of Web3. The platform offers solutions for developers, and a set of official decentralized applications users can take advantage of.</p>
<p>OKX has it all in terms of derivatives, with futures, options, perpetual swaps, and margin trading at up to 125x leverage. There are also trading bots, a learn program, crypto loans, and a jumpstart program offering access to new projects from around the world.</p>
<p>#4) Huobi Global</p>
<p>Huobi Global is one of the longest-running platforms on the list, with a shocking zero security incidents in the past nine years of operation &ndash; a true testament to the platform&rsquo;s top-tier security and risk management protocols. It commands a massive amount of crypto derivatives trading volume but has lost market share in recent years.</p>
<p>Huobi&rsquo;s longevity has given it time to develop a wide range of products and services, which include crypto loans, passive income, spot trading, and trading bots. In terms of derivatives, there&rsquo;s once again a lot to offer, with futures, copy trading, and both American and European-style options to choose from. Supported leverage reaches 100x at maximum.</p>
<p>#3) KuCoin</p>
<p>KuCoin does everything it can to compete with Binance, complete with biting its logo and feature set. Others have also sought to go toe-to-toe with Binance regarding products and services, but the carbon copy is less blatant elsewhere. But being on par with Binance isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing &ndash; and market leaders are often copied.</p>
<p>What KuCoin does offer is reliable and proven, with the ability to buy crypto, earn interest on crypto, trade spot, and access a web3 wallet. It also includes an NFT platform. Leveraged tokens are offered in addition to crypto futures at up to 100x leverage.</p>
<p>#2) Binance</p>
<p>You might be surprised to find that Binance is no longer the number one cryptocurrency derivative platform in the market. The ongoing drama and close distance to the FTX fallout have tarnished the cryptocurrency platform&rsquo;s reputation and made it a target of the US SEC and Department of Justice. World-renowned financial analysts call the platform and its CEO a &ldquo;ticking time bomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There has recently been a mass exodus of withdrawals of BTC &ndash; the largest ever recorded &ndash; due to fear over Binance potentially having similar issues as FTX. Fears include the BNB token being worthless in the event of a collapse, much like what occurred with the FTT token. Others believe Binance is too big to fail.</p>
<p>Binance still dominates the cryptocurrency market in terms of overall trading volume, making it a mandatory inclusion in this list. It also has one of the most extensive ranges of products and services, including an NFT marketplace, an earn program, loans, a Binance card, spot trading, and derivatives. Futures, options, and leveraged tokens all max out at 125x leverage.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Before filing for bankruptcy, FTX paid its lead lawyers over $12 million to oversee the earliest parts of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. </p>
<p>According to court filings, the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTC paid its lead lawyers, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP a retainer of over $12 million shortly before the firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Sullivan &amp; Cromwell indicated that it had drawn only a little more than $3 million of that, and that was for services rendered in the days leading up to the rushed bankruptcy filing according to reports by Bloomberg Law.</p>
<p>Sullivan &amp; Cromwell is a firm headquartered in New York City that received this retainer from West Realm Shires Service Inc. on behalf of FTX for legal services the firm required.</p>
<p>Available information indicated that FTX paid at least $15.5 million to avail and retain the firm&rsquo;s services. The court filing further revealed that the law firm currently holds $9 million of the retainer.</p>
Developments in the FTX Case
<p>FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 11 the same day that its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried resigned. Following the shutdown of the exchange, FTX investors lost access to the funds they stored on the exchange. Most recently, the judge overseeing the SBF-FTX case, District Judge Ronnie Abrams recused herself from the case after she revealed that a law firm employing her husband as a partner had previously advised FTX in 2021. Abrams further explained that the reason for her recusal was informed by the fact that the law firm represented parties that may be adverse to FTX and its former CEO, SBF, in other legal proceedings.</p>
<p>SBF was also released on a $250 million bail bond secured by his parents who offered up their home in Palo Alto, California as collateral. The conditions of SBF&rsquo;s bail also include a written promise that he appears for future court appearances and he does not engage in any illegal activities. SBF also had to hand over his passport, must wear an ankle monitor, and be confined to his parent&rsquo;s home in Palo Alto.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>INTERNET CITY, DUBAI, 24th December, 2022, Chainwire</p><p>Nigeria has put forward a significant legislation design that will further facilitate cryptocurrency adoption in the country with over 200 million inhabitants.</p>
<p>Why this matters
If the Investments and Securities Act, 2007 (Amendment) Bill passes, the Nigerian securities and exchange commission (SEC) will recognize cryptocurrencies and other digital assets as capital for investment.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Babangida Ibrahim, Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee, shared in an interview with local media outlet Punch, that the proposed bill will specify the roles of the Central Bank of Nigeria and the country's SEC in regard to cryptocurrencies.</li>
  <li>Ibrahim stated that the bill is not a complete shift away from restrictive laws in place, only a review of what could be done within the current legal framework. However, he does believe that Nigeria must keep up with global economic innovations.</li>
  <li>Notably, the Nigerian Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA) stated in a press release in September that it considered partnering with crypto exchange Binance to create a virtual free zone to promote economic growth.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Go Deeper
The legal blueprint comes at a time when Nigeria has spent almost 2 years under a cryptocurrency ban for financial institutes, and the country&rsquo;s CBDC, the eNaira, has failed to reach widespread adoption.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Since the launch of the CBDC in October 2021, it currently sits at an adoption rate of only 0.5% among the population.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Further endorsement of the eNaira could be hampered by the legal blueprint. &ldquo;This bill is basically going to create more adoption of cryptocurrencies. Through regulation of this asset class, we might start to see taxing and legal registration if you want to build something in the blockchain space,&rdquo; says Anointing Aha, Community Manager for Nigeria at global crypto exchange LBank.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>For now, Nigeria seems to be moving towards further adoption, but nothing is set in stone. &ldquo;Nigeria&rsquo;s presidential election is coming up early next year, and a lot will depend on the new president,&rdquo; Aha adds.</li>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors are now tired of the extreme price declines triggered by the broader bearish market, causing them to leave the meme token and place their bets on The Hideaways (HDWY), which ensures profits like no other.</p>
<p class="s6">On the brilliant success of HDWY, the project is set to close its presale at the end of this month, with an offered price of $0.10 per token.</p>
<p class="s8">Shiba Inu (SHIB) Falls Out of Market&rsquo;s Favor</p>
<p class="s6">Shiba Inu (SHIB) has suffered one of the worst slumps this week, leading Ethereum whales to move away from the dog-themed meme coin.</p>
<p class="s6">Accordingly, Shiba Inu has skidded 11.70% to $0.00000815 in the 7-day timeline, resulting in a 75.20% decline from its year-ago level. SHIB&rsquo;s steady decline has caused the whales to exit a good portion of their positions.</p>
<p class="s6">As Shiba Inu (SHIB) loses market favor, The Hideaways (HDWY) marks its name as the current crypto crowd favorite. Experts projected the brand new token to bloom in considerable returns of up to 40X in the next year.</p>
<p class="s9">Can Shiba Inu (SHIB) Hit $1 in 2023?</p>
<p class="s6">Most crypto experts believe that Shiba Inu (SHIB) will unlikely reach the $1 mark next year. A piece of more unfortunate news for SHIB investors is that the meme coin is only set to run around $0.0000134987.</p>
<p class="s6">Analysts explained that Shiba (SHIB) would need to grow its market cap from $4 trillion to $590 trillion, an impossible case for the token. In addition, investors are disappointed with the long-due utility of the Elon Musk-backed crypto.</p>
<p class="s6">Meanwhile, investors believed that The Hideaways (HDWY) could have a higher chance of breaching the dollar mark as the presale superstar is set to produce 40x ROI in 2023.</p>
<p class="s11">The Hideaways (HDWY) Powers Up Over Shiba Inu (SHIB)</p>
<p class="s6">The cryptocurrency market remains in a bearish cycle, and it's best to seek secure yet profitable projects like The Hideaways (HDWY).</p>
<p class="s6">Accordingly, investors' sentiment towards Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains sideways as the utility of the meme token is still on the long way. On the other hand, HDWY has gained media attention thanks to its unique utility.</p>
<p class="s6">The Hideaways (HDWY) unlocks the potential of the high-tier real-estate market by minting non-fungible tokens, a more secure functionality than SHIB.</p>
<p class="s6">This is the best time to join The Hideaways, as the project delivers up to a 100% bonus to all investments. Furthermore, a $100,000 prize draw also awaits you! Never waste a second and join HDWY now!</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cardano (ADA) may be the most underwhelming performer among all crypto majors this year. ADA had just fallen back to base after declining from $0.30, making us question where it heads next.</p>
<p>Due to the recent panic, The Hideaways (HDWY) welcomes an expected influx in demand for its $100,000 prize draw to celebrate the success of its presale event ending on December 31.</p>
<p class="s7">Cardano (ADA) Buying Sentiment Falls</p>
<p>It looks like we will not be seeing a tangible recovery from Cardano (ADA) this year - a disappointment for many analysts who put the token at the top of their buy recommendation list for 2022.</p>
<p>Cardano (ADA)&rsquo;s relative strength index bottomed at $26.72, an oversold territory. This is a level it had not visited since October, which explains why there it caused panic among investors.</p>
<p>Unlike The Hideaways (HDWY) which received a positive long-term forecast from analysts, experts are encouraging holders to dump their remaining ADA. The price continues to record lower lows, bottoming at $0.26 in the latest charts.</p>
<p>Cardano (ADA) fell from the $0.30 zone on December 16. The token continued to trade sideways from there as the buying sentiment declined due to a lack of fundamental strength and weak crypto market performance in the backdrop.</p>
<p class="s7">Cardano (ADA) Price Forecast and Updates</p>
<p>Cardano (ADA) buyers have to double down on their defense to protect the $0.25 level. Failure to gain momentum at this zone could send the price to $0.20 or lower.</p>
<p>This is the weakest ADA has ever been this year. The tokens started the year strong at $1.30 apiece.</p>
<p>Aside from the extended crypto winter, Cardano (ADA) is also facing tough competition for investor attention against newer and better projects like The Hideaways (HDWY).</p>
<p>Amid the recent retracement, the network's founder Charles Hoskinson addressed his ongoing fallout against the Ripple community. Hoskinson said he will never comment on any Ripple-related issues again.</p>
<p class="s7">The Hideaways (HDWY): The Bear Market Saver</p>
<p>The Hideaways (HDWY) will be Cardano (ADA)'s savior in this challenging bear market.</p>
<p>The Hideaways (HDWY) has stability like no other, thanks to its real estate backing. It is the first to see the underlying potential in the trillion-dollar luxury real estate project.</p>
<p>Through selling NFTs backed by real-world assets, investors are guaranteed their money is stable regardless of what happens in the broader crypto landscape. Sudden crashes like Terra Luna and FTX taught us we could only rely on utility-based cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Due to its strong real estate ties, The Hideaways (HDWY) is forecasted to hit $1 by the first quarter of 2023. If you buy it at a current price of $0.10, you will be up with gains you can only imagine throughout your investing career.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) on Friday approved investment funds to hold crypto assets. </p>
<p>On December 23, the Brazilian CVM approved the ability for investment funds to hold cryptocurrency assets. According to the regulator, funds will be allowed to operate in the crypto sector while paying attention to controls related to integrity and ownership of the assets. The approval is however subject to a set of criteria established by a new regulatory framework that was enacted into law by outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro.</p>
Brazil Signs Crypto Regulation into Law
<p>On Thursday, the Brazilian president approved a crypto regulation bill that established a crime of fraud involving virtual assets that will come with a penalty of between four to six years in prison along with a fine. The bill further established a &ldquo;virtual service provider&rdquo; license, which will be required by digital asset firms, including exchanges and trading intermediaries. The bill does not allow Brazilians to use crypto such as Bitcoin as legal tender but does include various digital currencies under the definition of legal payment methods within the country.</p>
Guidelines for Investment Funds to Include Crypto
<p>Investment funds will be allowed to hold crypto assets but will be subject to a set of criteria established by Bolsonaro&rsquo;s newly enacted law. Per this new law, crypto assets may be included in a fund if they are traded entities authorized by the CVM, Brazil&rsquo;s central bank, or by a local supervisor in the case of operations in another country. Under the criteria, supervisory bodies must be legally competent to supervise and inspect the operations carried out, including ensuring that anti-money laundering (AML) guidelines are implemented, and counter-financial terrorism guidelines are adhered to.</p>
<p>Although there was a delay in approving the new regulatory framework, the CVM in October already published a guidance opinion for the market on the crypto sector. According to this guideline, even though crypto assets are not expressly included among securities, market agents must analyze the characteristics of each crypto asset, to determine whether it is a security.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The legal proceedings surrounding former FTX CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, have taken an interesting turn as District Judge Ronnie Abrams had to recuse herself from the case. </p>
<p>Judge Ronnie Abrams, United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, had to withdraw her participation from the case against former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. Abrams revealed that a law firm employing her husband as a partner had previously advised FTX in 2021.</p>
Abram&rsquo;s Decision Removes Conflict of Interest
<p>It was revealed in a filing that Abram&rsquo;s husband, Greg Andres, currently serves as a partner at Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell and has been employed there since June 2019. The filing also indicated that the firm offered legal services to the fallen cryptocurrency exchange in 2021. Abrams further explained that the reason for her recusal was informed by the fact that the law firm represented parties that may be adverse to FTX and its former CEO in other legal proceedings. Judge Abrams said:</p>
<p>My husband has had no involvement in any of these representations. Nonetheless, to avoid any possible conflict, or the appearance of one, the Court hereby recuses itself from this action.</p>
<p>The judge&rsquo;s decision to recuse herself from the case means that no conflict of interest in the FTX case exists as her husband continues to serve as a partner at Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell.</p>
SBF Released on $250 Million Bail
<p>On December 22, the former FTX CEO was released on a $250 million bail bond secured by his parents who offered up their home in Palo Alto, California as collateral. Should SBF decide to flee, his parent would be liable for $250 million. SBF&rsquo;s bail was also based on a written promise that he appear for future court appearances and not engage in any illegal activity. As a further part of his bail conditions, SBF has had to hand over his passport and will be confined to his parent's residence in Palo Alto.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The legal proceedings surrounding former FTX CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, have taken an interesting turn as District Judge Ronnie Abrams had to recuse herself from the case. </p>
<p>Judge Ronnie Abrams, United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, had to withdraw her participation from the case against former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. Abrams revealed that a law firm employing her husband as a partner had previously advised FTX in 2021.</p>
Abram&rsquo;s Decision Removes Conflict of Interest
<p>It was revealed in a filing that Abram&rsquo;s husband, Greg Andres, currently serves as a partner at Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell and has been employed there since June 2019. The filing also indicated that the firm offered legal services to the fallen cryptocurrency exchange in 2021. Abrams further explained that the reason for her recusal was informed by the fact that the law firm represented parties that may be adverse to FTX and its former CEO in other legal proceedings. Judge Abrams said:</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Locked in Tight Range:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 25 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained locked in a tight range early in the Asian session as the pair continued to hug the 16880.44 area, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460.&nbsp;&nbsp; A recent rebound saw BTC/USD test the 18469.40 area, a level it could not sustain as elevated risk aversion resulted in more downward pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp; Selling pressure recently intensified around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels and BTC/USD tested downside price objectives related to these levels, including the 16375.18 area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD has depreciated approximately 63% year-to-date, and is off more than 1% month-to-date.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (hourly) and above the 100-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16838.55 and the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16820.97.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bearishly below MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>TheStandard.io allows investors to unlock liquidity from their assets without handing over custody.</p>
Crypto is disrupting traditional finance
<p>Traditional banking has failed badly. Those who leave their savings in bank accounts are losing their purchasing power at an ever-increasing rate. Depending on which country you live in, you can be losing from 7% to 70%+ a year through inflation, and these are just the government-manipulated figures.</p>
<p>Along came cryptocurrencies, and the innovations that came with them, such as decentralised finance, NFTs, smart contracts etc., and these have disrupted the world of finance in a big way.</p>
<p>However, with all such incredibly disruptive innovations, there have been many ups and downs, just as there were back in the dotcom revolution. Many hacks have taken place and many investors have lost funds in a pretty much unregulated sector.</p>
<p>Be this as it may, plenty of the smartest minds are concentrated in the cryptocurrency space and many more are on the way - regulation permitting.&nbsp;</p>
Standard.io is a leading project in the DeFi space
<p>One of the smartest projects in the DeFi space right now is Standard.io, a lending platform that enables users to lock up traditional, as well as crypto assets such as BTC and ETH, which can then generate fiat-pegged stablecoins.</p>
<p>Users lock up these assets in smart vaults, and then they can use the assets as collateral to mint sEURO, a euro-pegged stablecoin. Many other fiat-pegged stablecoins will be introduced in time.</p>
<p>When a user locks up an asset into their smart vault, that user is the only individual that has the keys to open it. No financial entity, government or any other third party is involved. The user then has a call on up to 85% of the value of the collateral in the smart vault in the form of a stablecoin pegged to fiat currency.</p>
<p>Even a traditional asset such as gold (and eventually silver) can be locked up in a smart vault. Such a thing has never been known in the financial world as gold has generally preserved your wealth but has never earned yield.</p>
Users retain control of their assets and can access liquidity&nbsp;
<p>The system Standard.io has developed offers a host of advantages to prospective users. One such advantage is the avoidance of taxable events. By depositing assets and receiving minted sEUROs there is no sale that takes place. Another advantage is to put minted sEUROs into liquidity pools and earn the fees that arise from this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, probably one of the biggest advantages is the ability to safely keep one's assets and to unlock the liquidity therein. In essence, a user is borrowing from themselves when they take liquidity out of their own assets. The money you needed for a house deposit, or that new car now becomes your money (at 0% interest) and as long as you pay it back, you get to keep your original assets as well.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Whales dump some of their Bitcoin (BTC) as fear dominates the market. Since the crypto major started trading in the market, big holders have dumped the most BTC in the 30-day timeline.</p>
<p>Due to the recent update, Bitcoin (BTC)&rsquo;s price continues to show weakness. Investors are switching over to The Hideaways (HDWY) to recover their losses.</p>
<p class="s7">Bitcoin (BTC) Whales are Migrating Elsewhere</p>
<p>It is another migration season for Bitcoin (BTC) whales. Just before the end of the year, big rollers dumped 280,000 BTC in just 30 days. This is the highest number ever recorded since the crypto major started in 2009.</p>
<p>The recent move has an estimated value of $4.7 billion, immediately affecting BTC&rsquo;s price negatively. Bitcoin (BTC) declined 5.28% to $16,782.49 in the 7-day charts - another setback for crypto gold. </p>
<p>Analysts were expecting a better performance and continued strong buying momentum after bulls pushed the price to $18,000.00 on December 13. </p>
<p>But buyers stopped approaching $18,400.00, outnumbered by sellers wanting to take profit at the $18,390.60 zone.</p>
<p>After their small games on BTC, investors switched over to The Hideaways (HDWY) to get more value for their money.</p>
<p class="s7">Dormant Bitcoin (BTC) Wallets Suddenly Moves Out Funds</p>
<p>While Bitcoin (BTC)'s price is a little over the place, a sudden move from defunct crypto wallets startled spectators.</p>
<p>QuadrigaCX, once the largest crypto exchange in Canada, filed for bankruptcy three years ago after the sudden death of its founder.</p>
<p>The firm&rsquo;s bankruptcy trustee, Ernst and Young, announced they have lost control of an estimated 100 BTC worth $355,000 during that time. </p>
<p>This week, dormant cold wallets tied to QuadrigaCX moved out the missing 100 BTC, which have now grown in value to $1.7 million. </p>
<p>However, the bankruptcy trustee firm said they are not behind the recent movement and attributed it to a suspected theft.</p>
<p class="s7">The Hideaways (HDWY) Celebrates Presale Success</p>
<p>Analysts warned Bitcoin (BTC) will continue trading in volatility until the end of the year.</p>
<p>While the crypto major is having a difficult time, analysts say this is the perfect time to explore different cryptocurrencies that could give better returns than BTC.</p>
<p>The Hideaways (HDWY) is among their top recommendations. The new cryptocurrency is closing its initial presale with a $100,000 prize draw after receiving better-than-expected demand for its native coin.</p>
<p>Investors are willing to put money into stable projects and The Hideaways (HDWY) is steady - thanks to its real estate backing that ensures strong underpinning whatever happens in the broader crypto industry.</p>
<p>HDWY sells at $0.10, an amount that will not only get you a passive income source but also a chance at winning a fortune you could only imagine in your life. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum (ETH) price distances from the negative momentum after two whale addresses moved for the first time in four years. </p>
<p>Investors are getting every opportunity they can to make a profit out of updates like these, with Ethereum (ETH) missing growth expectations in 2022.</p>
<p>The Hideaways (HDWY) has also welcomed big purchases as crypto investors rushed to pile up on their HDWY holdings before it closes its initial presale on December 31.</p>
<p class="s7">Two Ethereum (ETH) Whale Addresses Move</p>
<p>On-chain analysis shows two Ethereum (ETH) addresses moved for the first time in four years. The movements, one with 13,103.99 ETH and another at 9,878.00 ETH, are believed to have come from the Genesis and Poloniex trading platforms.</p>
<p>The collective number of 22,982.00 ETH currently holds a market value of $27.71 million.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum (ETH) price distances from the negative momentum after two whale addresses moved for the first time in four years. </p>
<p>Investors are getting every opportunity they can to make a profit out of updates like these, with Ethereum (ETH) missing growth expectations in 2022.</p>
<p>The Hideaways (HDWY) has also welcomed big purchases as crypto investors rushed to pile up on their HDWY holdings before it closes its initial presale on December 31.</p>
<p class="s7">Two Ethereum (ETH) Whale Addresses Move</p>
<p>On-chain analysis shows two Ethereum (ETH) addresses moved for the first time in four years. The movements, one with 13,103.99 ETH and another at 9,878.00 ETH, are believed to have come from the Genesis and Poloniex trading platforms.</p>
<p>The collective number of 22,982.00 ETH currently holds a market value of $27.71 million.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance has partnered with Kazakhstan state organisations to launch a country-wide blockchain education program. </p>
<p>Crypto exchange Binance this week announced an initiative to qualify university students in the Central Asian nation of Kazakhstan to be able to work in the industry. The exchange entered into an agreement with the government of Kazakhstan to add blockchain courses to the curriculum of higher education institutions across the country. The education program is a trading platform that will prepare and equip more than 40,000 students by 2026 with blockchain training at universities and institutions of higher education.</p>
<p>According to a press release from Binance, the exchange is collaborating on the initiative with the Blockchain Center research lab that was established by the Center for the Development of Payment and Financial Technologies of the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK), the Astana International Financial Centre, the Ministry of Digital Development, and the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Binance entered into a memorandum of cooperation with the above-mentioned organizations and per these agreements, will provide educational materials and support for a basic course on blockchain. The announcement highlights the fact that Kazakhstan now becomes one of the first countries in the world to offer a blockchain program to its educational programs at universities.</p>
Binance Expands into Business in Kazakhstan
<p>Binance has been eagerly expanding its operations into the Central Asian nation. The educational initiative comes from a meeting between Binance CEO Changpeng &ldquo;CZ&rdquo; Zhao and Kazakhstani President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev earlier in the year. In October, the exchange was granted a permanent license by Kazakhstan&rsquo;s AIFC Financial Service Authority to operate as a digital asset platform and provide custody service at the Astana International Financial Center. By receiving this license, Binance now has the status of a regulated platform in the country.</p>
<p>Asia Regional Head at Binance, Gleb Kostarev said:</p>

<p>We support Kazakhstan&rsquo;s goal to become a leading player in digital technologies which would not be possible without increasing education and blockchain adoption around the country. Binance has always valued education, and Binance Academy is one of the largest learning hubs in the blockchain industry. Our partnership with Kazakhstan state organizations is another step in bringing accessible and standard-setting blockchain and crypto education to all.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The deputy governor of the Bank of England (BoE) has warned that cryptocurrency trading is &ldquo;too dangerous&rdquo; to remain unregulated adding that it could pose &ldquo;a systemic problem&rdquo; if action is not taken. </p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with Sky News, Sir Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor of the Bank of England, said that investors and the financial system need to be protected from the &ldquo;casino&rdquo; of cryptocurrency trading. Speaking for the first time since the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX, Cunliffe indicated that the BoE might soon regulate the industry to protect investors from the dangers of crypto trading, as well as the wider financial system against potential fallout associated with cryptocurrencies. Cunliffe said that the BoE&rsquo;s stance is that retail investors should be able to safely speculate on cryptocurrencies, as they do in traditional markets.</p>
<p>Cunliffe said:</p>

<p>I think for the majority of people if they do want to be involved in speculation in [crypto] ... for consumer protection and market integrity, they should have a place to do that where they get the protection they would get in a similar activity in the UK.</p>

Crypto is Becoming Increasingly Integrated into Traditional Financial Systems
<p>The deputy governor added that cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly integrated into the traditional financial system and therefore should be regulated soon rather than later. He noted:</p>

<p>I do not know how that would [have] developed, but we had banks and investment funds and others who wanted to invest in it.</p>

<p>During his interview with Sky News, Cunliffe said the trading of crypto assets has not yet been sizeable enough to destabilise the financial system, &ldquo;but it was starting to develop links.&rdquo; On that note, and commenting on the BoE&rsquo;s future plans to manage digital assets, Cunliffe added:</p>

<p>I think we should think about regulation before it becomes integrated with the financial system and before we could have a potential systemic problem.</p>

UK&rsquo;s Regulatory Efforts
<p>According to the reports by Sky News, in the UK, regulators have attempted to, and failed, &ldquo;to impose their write on crypto exchanges domiciled offshore.&rdquo; When the now Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was chancellor of the exchequer, the government made it clear that its goal was to make the UK a &ldquo;global crypto asset hub&rdquo; &ndash; something which naturally will depend largely on an effective regulatory framework.</p>
<p>Cunliffe, in his role as being responsible for financial stability, said that the BoE&rsquo;s previous regulatory efforts were aimed at protecting individuals and maintaining financial stability &ndash; a common goal of central banks. He said:</p>

<p>There's a lot of activity that's developed over the last 10 years on the trading and sale of crypto assets, assets without any intrinsic value, so they're incredibly volatile. And all of that has grown up outside of regulation.</p>

<p>In an attempt to explain the absolute need for effective regulation, the deputy governor drew upon the collapse of FTX to highlight his point:</p>

<p>What we saw in FTX&hellip; is a number of activities which in the regulated financial sector, would have had certain protections. We saw things like clients' money appears to have gone missing, conflicts of interest between different operations, transparency, audit and accounting. All of the perhaps boring things that happened in the normal financial sector, didn't really happen in that set of activities. And as a result, I think a lot of people have lost a lot of money.</p>

BoE is in the Process of Developing its Own Digital Coin
<p>Cryptocurrencies aside, the BoE does see the value in blockchain technology. The Central Bank is currently consulting on plans to develop its own central bank digital coin, a digital version of its currency that would offer the same security as a pound coin, but with the added benefit of digital flexibility that could see it replace cash. Recognising the value of a digital currency, Sir Jon commented:</p>

<p>Physical cash will always be made available by the bank as long as people want it and many people depend on it. But it's not fully usable in the way we live now. So the question for the Bank of England is that as the way we as society changes, as we live our lives more digitally, should we continue to provide money to the public which is usable across a range of transactions?</p>

<p>He further said:</p>

<p>This would be a digital equivalent of the' I promise to pay the bearer' promise, which in the end underpins confidence in money in the UK. Whenever you want, you can turn that money you hold in the bank into basically Bank of England money backed by the state with that promise to pay the bearer.</p>

<p>Finally, realising that physical cash is becoming less feasible and practical, Sir Jon said:</p>

<p>We want to ensure that as physical cash becomes less usable in many parts of the economy, perhaps we need to offer something digitally to provide that underpinning.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin is a decentralised network that allows anyone to transact with anyone else. CBDCs are issued by a central bank and have controls built into them. Bitcoin offers freedom while CBDCs offer total control.</p>
<p>There is much at stake as world economies look for a way out of the desperate plight that a fiat-backed monetary system has driven them into. Central banks believe that their own digital currencies will put economies back on track. Here are 3 reasons why Bitcoin is eminently preferable.</p>
Decentralisation
<p>decentralised control is a key feature of Bitcoin and other decentralised digital currencies. In a decentralised system, control is distributed among multiple parties rather than being concentrated in a single entity. This means that no single entity has the power to make decisions or exert control over the system.</p>
<p>In the case of Bitcoin, the decentralised control is achieved through the use of a decentralised network of computers, known as nodes, which validate and record transactions on the blockchain. The blockchain is a decentralised, distributed ledger that records all transactions made on the Bitcoin network. Each transaction is recorded on the blockchain in a block, which is then added to the chain of blocks that make up the blockchain.</p>
<p>Because the blockchain is decentralised and distributed, it is not controlled by any single entity. Instead, it is maintained by a network of users who contribute their computing resources to the network. This decentralised structure makes it difficult for any single entity to manipulate the network or the information stored on the blockchain.</p>
<p>In contrast, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are issued and controlled by central banks, which are typically government-controlled financial institutions. This means that CBDCs are subject to the policies and decisions of those central banks, and the central banks have the ability to exert control over the issuance and use of CBDCs.</p>
Limited Supply
<p>One of the key features of bitcoin is that it has a limited supply of 21 million coins. This limit is built into the bitcoin blockchain, which is the underlying technology that supports the bitcoin network. This means that no matter how much demand there is for bitcoin, the total number of bitcoins that will ever exist is fixed at 21 million.</p>
<p>The limited supply of bitcoin is intended to help protect the value of the currency. Inflation occurs when the supply of a currency increases faster than the demand for it, which can lead to a decline in its value. By limiting the supply of bitcoin, its creator hoped to reduce the risk of inflation and protect its value.</p>
<p>In contrast, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are digital versions of traditional fiat currencies, such as the US dollar or the euro. These currencies are issued and backed by central banks, which have the power to create new units of the currency as needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that the supply of CBDCs is not fixed, and the central bank has the ability to increase the supply of the currency if it sees fit. This introduces the risk of inflation if the central bank creates too much of the currency, leading to a decline in its value.</p>
High level of security
<p>Bitcoin uses a combination of advanced cryptographic techniques and a decentralised network to ensure the security of transactions and the integrity of the blockchain.</p>
<p>The blockchain is a decentralised ledger that records all bitcoin transactions. Each transaction is verified by a network of computers, called nodes, that work together to validate the transaction and add it to the blockchain.</p>
<p>These nodes use cryptographic techniques to ensure that the transaction is legitimate and cannot be altered or tampered with once it is added to the blockchain. This makes it extremely difficult for anyone to fraudulently alter the ledger or steal bitcoins.</p>
<p>While CBDCs may also be secure, there is a risk that they could be vulnerable to cyberattacks. This is because CBDCs rely on a centralised system, which means that there is a single point of failure that could be targeted by hackers.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Bears Dominating:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 24 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to suffer from downward pressure early in the Asian session as the pair has been unable to free itself from its orbit around key technical areas including the 16880.44 area, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460.&nbsp;&nbsp; A recent rebound saw BTC/USD test the 18469.40 area, a level it could not sustain as elevated risk aversion resulted in more downward pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp; Selling pressure recently intensified around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels and BTC/USD tested downside price objectives related to these levels, including the 16375.18 area.&nbsp; &nbsp;Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD has depreciated approximately 63% year-to-date, and is off more than 1% month-to-date.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (hourly) and above the 100-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16838.41 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16789.03.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bearishly below MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
