<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/softbank-ai-insurer-tractable/">SoftBank Group Invests Heavily in British AI Insurer Tractable</a></p>
<p>In a significant move that highlights the growing influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the insurance industry, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/softbank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoftBank Group Corp</a> (TYO: 9984) has recently <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/softbank-group-invests-65-million-in-uk-ai-firm/articleshow/101858569.cms" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">invested</a> a staggering $65 million in the British company Tractable Ltd.</p>
<p>The investment from SoftBank Group, a renowned global technology conglomerate, underscores the increasing importance of AI in the insurance sector. Tractable, an insurance technology firm, specializes in leveraging AI to assess insurance claims through the analysis of photographs.</p>
<p>Tractable has earned prominence in recent years by inventing cutting-edge AI algorithms that can scan photographs of damaged vehicles and determine the amount of damage. With this latest investment, Tractable aims to further enhance its AI capabilities and expand its reach in the insurance industry.</p>
<p>The substantial funding injection from SoftBank Group will enable Tractable to accelerate its research and development efforts, improve its algorithms, and scale its operations globally.</p>
<p>The partnership between SoftBank Group and Tractable also holds promise for the future of insurance. As AI continues to advance, Tractable’s technology can be expanded to assess claims in other areas, such as property damage, personal injury, and more.</p>
<p>The ability to analyze visual data quickly and accurately has the potential to revolutionize the entire insurance industry, enabling insurers to better manage risks, reduce fraud, and enhance customer satisfaction. With this investment, SoftBank Group and Tractable are poised to reshape the future of insurance through the power of AI.</p>
<h2>SoftBank Accelerates Its AI Strategy beyond Tractable</h2>
<p>In a strategic move that aligns with its commitment to harness the potential of artificial intelligence, SoftBank Group has announced its shift to “offense mode&#8221;. This decision comes as AI continues to captivate the attention of global investors.</p>
<p>SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son has said the bank aims to leverage the transformative power of AI to drive growth and recovery after experiencing <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/softbank-vision-fund-32b-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">substantial losses</a> in its Vision Fund investing arm. The Vision Fund, which had faced significant setbacks, compelled SoftBank Group to reevaluate its investment strategies. As part of this recovery process, the conglomerate reduced the volume of new investments.</p>
<p>However, with the rise of AI and its growing impact on various industries, SoftBank now recognizes the immense potential and intends to seize the opportunities presented by this technology.</p>
<p>SoftBank Group’s renewed focus on AI is driven by the belief that this technology has the potential to revolutionize multiple industries, including finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. By investing in AI-driven companies like Tractable, SoftBank aims to play a significant role in shaping the future of these industries while generating substantial returns for its investors</p>
<p>Besides the investment in software AI firms, Softbank also has a more diversified agenda. Arm Lt, one of the company’s subsidiaries is also <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/softbank-arm-advanced-semiconductor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaborating</a> with manufacturing partners to ramp up the production of semiconductors. Accordingly, Arm announced a strategic agreement with Intel Foundry Services (IFS) to enable chip designers to construct low-power computation system-on-chips (SoCs) on the Intel 18A technology.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/robinhood-uk-market/">Robinhood Eyes UK Market with New Hirings Already Underway</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/robinhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robinhood Markets Inc</a> (NASDAQ: HOOD) is preparing to venture into the UK market according to LinkedIn job postings in the past two weeks. Notably, Robinhood has been posting new jobs focused on the United Kingdom market to expand its operations. Two weeks ago, Robinhood posted a job advertisement on its LinkedIn searching for a senior risk and compliance associate to be based in London. The company specified that the candidate should have at least six years of compliance practice experience specializing in financial services in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>On Monday, the company posted another job advertisement for a compliance officer based in London. The candidate is expected to focus on several issues including money laundering reporting responsibilities. Most importantly, Robinhood announced the job advertisement for an operations lead in London to help support the launch, improvement, and scaling of its operations in the UK. While the other positions can be based out of the United Kingdom, the operations lead is expected to be located in London.</p>
<p>The company has been diversifying its operations outside the United States following increased regulatory scrutiny in the recent past that was triggered by the implosion of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a>.</p>
<h2>Robinhood Flees Hostile US Market</h2>
<p>In the past few years, Robinhood has found itself at loggerheads with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for violating certain investment rules. At the tail end of 2020, Robinhood agreed to pay $65 million to settle the charges filed by the SEC. Notably, the SEC has charged Robinhood for routing its customers’ trade orders to other broker-dealers without the profits we disclosed.</p>
<p>“..Principal trading firms attempt to profit from executing large volumes of retail buy and sell orders either by taking the other side of customer orders and exiting the positions at a profit, which is also known as “internalization”, or by routing the orders to other market centers,” the SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a>.</p>
<p>Robinhood has also been under regulatory scrutiny following the meme stock frenzy that involved GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME). The regulatory scrutiny recently pushed Robinhood to delist several crypto assets including Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/matic-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MATIC</a>) from its platform. The decision to delist the mentioned crypto assets was caused by Binance and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase Global Inc</a> (NASDAQ: COIN) charges of listing unregistered securities.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">What does this mean for customers? Everyone who holds Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), and Cardano (ADA) will receive detailed instructions on how to sell and/or withdraw their coins, where supported. (3/4)</p>
<p>&mdash; Robinhood (@RobinhoodApp) <a href="https://twitter.com/RobinhoodApp/status/1667236706330746885?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Nonetheless, Robinhood stated that it remains hopeful the crypto market in the United States will thrive once a clear regulatory framework is put in place.</p>
<h2>Market Outlook</h2>
<p>Robinhood has a reported monthly active users of about 11.8 million and a total of $78 billion in assets under custody. During the first quarter, Robinhood announced its net revenue increased by 16 percent to about $441 million. As a result, HOOD shares have gained about 54 percent YTD to trade around $12.56 on Tuesday.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tsmc-decline-q2-net-profit/">TSMC Expected to See 27% Decline in Q2 Net Profit amid Global Economic Woes</a></p>
<p>Leading global contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tsmc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TSMC</a>) is anticipated to announce a 27% drop in net profit for the second quarter as global economic challenges continue to impact the demand for semiconductors. Despite this, analysts remain optimistic about the company&#8217;s future performance, expecting an improvement in the current quarter.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmc-q2-earnings-seen-down-27-yy-q3-looks-better-2023-07-18/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">poll</a> of 21 analysts, TSMC is projected to report a net profit of T$172.53 billion ($5.58 billion) for the April-June period, down from T$237.0 billion recorded in the same period last year. This anticipated decline can be attributed to several factors, including the exceptional performance TSMC had experienced in the previous year, driven by strong post-pandemic demand.</p>
<h2>TSMC Could Report Positive Financial Earnings in Q3</h2>
<p>Analysts at Fubon Investment in Taiwan believe that the second quarter represents the low point of the current downcycle. While the market professionals expect an improvement in the third quarter, it is likely to be weaker than usual due to ongoing inventory build-ups that are still being addressed within the industry.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, industry experts remain optimistic about TSMC&#8217;s future prospects. The company, which serves as a major supplier to the iPhone maker Apple and Nvidia, a full-stack computing firm, anticipates a rebound in profitability, particularly driven by the growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications and the upcoming release of the new iPhone 15 ahead of the year-end holiday shopping season.</p>
<p>Unlike the electric vehicle (EV) market, where TSMC has had limited exposure, the increasing demand for AI presents a promising opportunity for the Taiwanese chipmaker. Taiwan&#8217;s comprehensive AI supply chain positions the country to benefit significantly from the continued growth in this sector.</p>
<p>The second quarter is traditionally a slow period for many companies in the tech industry, with sales typically picking up in the third quarter and leading into the year-end shopping season. TSMC, being Asia&#8217;s most valuable listed company, experienced a surprise rise in net profit in the first quarter of this year. However, this growth was the smallest since mid-2019, primarily due to global economic challenges affecting chip demand.</p>
<h2>TSMC Remains Bullish on Its Future Performance</h2>
<p>Despite the hurdles, TSMC remains positive about the future as the demand for AI applications rises steadily. The optimistic outlook has boosted the company&#8217;s stock performance, with its shares on the Taipei-listed stock exchange surging by almost 30% year-to-date, outperforming the broader market.</p>
<p>TSMC is scheduled to provide guidance for the third quarter and update previous forecasts during its earnings call on Thursday at 06:00 GMT. In the second quarter, the company recorded revenue of T$480.8 billion ($15.53 billion), within the April forecast range of $15.2 billion to $16 billion. As Coinspeaker previously <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tsmc-sales-ai-tools-chips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>, the impressive financial report was driven by an increase in AI tools and applications. The latest figure compares to the revenue of $18.16 billion achieved in the same period last year.</p>
<p>As TSMC navigates the evolving semiconductor landscape, industry stakeholders eagerly await the company&#8217;s financial updates and future projections, hoping for a more favorable business environment in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-democrats-crypto-regulation/">Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong to Meet with Democrats over Crypto Regulation</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/brian-armstrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Armstrong</a> will be meeting with lawmakers on Wednesday to discuss the future of crypto regulation and legislation. According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-17/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-set-to-meet-with-house-democrats?sref=3REHEaVI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>, Armstrong will be speaking to over 100 Democrats, who are members of a group called the New Democrat Coalition.</p>
<p>The group, according to its website, is dedicated to innovations and policies that generally help the economy. So, they are expected to be open-minded enough while Amstrong touches on issues bordering on &#8220;digital-asset legislation and related issues including tax, national security, privacy, and climate&#8221;.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that the meeting may have to do with the ongoing legal action against Coinbase. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) recently filed a lawsuit against the exchange, citing a violation of federal securities laws. But, Coinbase has since responded with claims that the SEC did not follow due process to take action.</p>
<h2>Crypto Regulation in the US: Where Does It Stand?</h2>
<p>For long years, the crypto industry has argued that tokens should not be classified as securities and so should not be overseen by the SEC. However, the regulator maintains its stance on the subject matter, claiming it is well within its rights to regulate them.</p>
<p>And while there have been several past attempts to bring clarity to crypto regulation, lawmakers from the House and Senate recently <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-lawmakers-crypto-bill-coming-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> separate bills to the same effect. Though it is not exactly clear whether these recent efforts will yield any favorable results. That is considering that Congress may be divided over the bills.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth though, it appears that regulatory clarity may finally be coming to crypto. Especially, in the light of SEC&#8217;s ongoing lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance exchanges.</p>
<p>The suits will either assert SEC&#8217;s jurisdiction over the industry or not. But most importantly, there are expectations that the outcome will put an end to whatever arguments that remains about crypto regulation in the United States.</p>
<p>In closely related news, Ripple, and indirectly the crypto industry, recently scored a little win against the SEC. That is following the court&#8217;s verdict that Ripple&#8217;s XRP token is not a security.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/biren-intelligent-technology-exploring-ipo-amid-rising-ai-hype/">Biren Intelligent Technology Exploring IPO amid Rising AI Hype</a></p>
<p>Shanghai-based Biren Intelligent Technology Co, a Chinese chip and AI company, is reportedly considering an <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-initial-public-offering-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Initial Public Offering</a> (IPO) in Hong Kong later this year.</p>
<p>According to a Bloomberg report, sources familiar with the matter stated that the company is planning to file for the first-time share sale in the coming weeks. The information, shared by anonymous insiders, sheds light on the company’s intentions to capitalize on the growing demand for its AI chips and secure the necessary capital to fuel its expansion.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Biren is engaged in discussions with potential investors, including state-backed funds in Guangzhou, for a separate funding round. The sources noted that this funding round has the potential to raise approximately 2 billion yuan ($279 million).</p>
<p>The proposed IPO and funding round comes at a time when the demand for AI chips is skyrocketing across various industries. Biren’s advanced chip solutions have gained recognition for their superior performance, energy efficiency, and scalability, positioning the company as a key player in the Chinese AI chip market.</p>
<p>While the Chinese chip startup is actively considering an IPO in Hong Kong, specific details such as the size and timeline of the IPO are yet to be determined. The company has not provided any official comment on the matter.</p>
<p>As the IPO landscape evolves and market conditions change, it is possible that Biren’s plans may be subject to further adjustments. The company’s priority will be to ensure that its IPO and fundraising efforts align with its strategic objectives and allow for optimal market reception and investor participation.</p>
<h2>Biren Stepped Up to Bridge China’s AI Gap</h2>
<p>It is worth noting that Biren’s ongoing fundraising endeavors are in line with the Chinese government’s accelerated campaign to bolster its domestic semiconductor industry. This move comes in response to a US-led effort that restricted Chinese companies from purchasing advanced chips used for AI development.</p>
<p>The restrictions <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/google-u-turn-huawei-declines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imposed</a> on Chinese companies&#8217; access to advanced chips, including certain  <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/nvidia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Corp</a> (NASDAQ: NVDA) products, spurred a need for domestic alternatives. Biren has emerged as a key player in this regard, focusing on the development of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and cloud computing solutions.</p>
<p>These areas are essential for AI applications, as GPUs provide the necessary computational power to process complex algorithms efficiently. Meanwhile, Biren has successfully raised approximately 4.7 billion yuan from notable investors, including IDG Capital, Ping An Insurance Group Co., and China Merchants Capital. This significant funding underscores the confidence investors have in the company’s potential and its position as a promising player in the semiconductor industry.</p>
<p>In addition to securing substantial funding, Biren achieved a significant technological milestone. In August 2022, the company announced the release of its first general-purpose GPU, which set a new record in global computing power. This accomplishment underscores the company’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of performance and efficiency in the semiconductor field.</p>

<p>Elon Musk reacted stating that Threads has been just copying Twitter at every end. Earlier this month, Twitter was the first to implement rate limits to prevent excessive scrapping of information by external organizations. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/twitter-threads-rate-limits-bots/">Just Like Twitter, Threads Introduces &#8216;Rate Limits&#8217; to Combat Bots</a></p>
<p>Within 10 days of its <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/meta-threads-app-goes-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a>, Twitter alternative Instagram Threads has been forced to <a href="https://www.threads.net/@johnmcgowan67/replies" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">implement</a> rate limits as a response to the growing number of reports citing crypto-shilling bots and spam attacks.</p>
<p>On Monday, July 17, Instagram head Adam Mosseri announced the introduction of &#8216;rate limits&#8217; in his post on the Threads app. “Spam attacks have picked up so we’re going to have to get tighter on things like rate limits, which is going to mean more unintentionally limiting active people (false positives). If you get caught up [in] those protections let us know,” Mosseri explained.</p>
<p>A user expressed frustration, stating that they spent a significant amount of time on the app blocking bots promoting gambling and crypto websites. Twitter CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a> responded to a screenshot of the announcement posted on Twitter, saying “lmaooo copy 🐈”.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lmaooo </p>
<p>Copy 🐈</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1681017373636329473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>While the Threads app has been designed to copy Twitter, Elon Musk has said that Meta has literally made a copy out of Twitter. As a result, Twitter has also considered taking legal action against Meta.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s lawyer, Alex Spiro, wrote a letter to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/mark-zuckerberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Zuckerberg</a>, CEO of Meta, accusing the company of hiring former Twitter employees who may have access to trade secrets and confidential information.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twitter intends to strictly enforce its intellectual property rights, and demands that Meta take immediate steps to stop using any Twitter trade secrets or other highly confidential information,&#8221; Spiro wrote in the letter.</p>
<p>Starting from July 1, Twitter implemented strict rate limits for users due to excessive data scraping by external organizations. Verified Twitter users now have a daily limit of 15,000 posts, while unverified and new unverified accounts are capped at 1,500 and 1,000 posts per day, respectively.</p>
<h2>Threads&#8217; Rapid Growth Is Pinching</h2>
<p>Soon after its launch, Instagram Threads took less than a week to onboard more than 100 million users. However, the engagement level with the new Twitter alternative has posed a challenge for Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>Olivia Moore, a partner at crypto venture capital firm a16z, discovered that just one week after the launch, daily active users on Threads had dropped by 40%, with the average daily time per user decreasing threefold.</p>
<p>Moore suggests that importing users directly from Instagram doesn&#8217;t align well with a Twitter-like app such as Threads. By linking user accounts to their real-life identities on Instagram, it discourages the types of social interactions that Twitter is known for, like anonymous accounts and fan pages.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It turns out that plugging 100M users into a copycat product isn&#39;t a slam dunk.</p>
<p>One week after launch, DAUs on the ~other app~ are down 40% and average daily time per user dropped 4x.</p>
<p> Why isn&#39;t it working? ⬇️ <a href="https://t.co/rMO4IBHDHf">pic.twitter.com/rMO4IBHDHf</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Olivia Moore (@omooretweets) <a href="https://twitter.com/omooretweets/status/1680752472045023232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>“Twitter has built a unique social graph and interest graph that&#8217;s hard to replace. Even with a copycat product, the underlying networks and user identities developed over a decade are tough to replicate,” said Moore.</p>

<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/valkyrie-spot-bitcoin-etf-sec-proposal/">Valkyrie&#8217;s Spot Bitcoin ETF: SEC Accepts Proposal for Review</a></p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/valkyrie-spot-bitcoin-etf-sec-proposal/">Valkyrie&#8217;s Spot Bitcoin ETF: SEC Accepts Proposal for Review</a></p>

<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) has accepted Valkyrie’s application for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and will now continue with an official review. The proposal, which was filed confidentially in June 2023, was <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nasdaq.htm#SR-NASDAQ-2023-019">revealed</a> on July 17 after the Nasdaq stock exchange refiled for a proposed rule change allowing the listing of the Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>The proposal acceptance follows within a week of the SEC’s acceptance of Blackrock’s ETF application. Recall that on June 15, BlackRock <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed</a> an application for a Bitcoin spot ETF with the SEC. The filing proposed Coinbase as the crypto custodian and BNY Mellon as the cash custodian.</p>
<p>Following Blackrock’s filing, several companies, including WisdomTree, Invesco, and Valkyrie also refiled their previously rejected filings.</p>
<h2>Valkyrie’s Initial Spot Bitcoin ETF Filing</h2>
<p>The Nashville-based crypto asset management firm, Valkyrie, filed its first application for a Spot Bitcoin ETF in January 2021, under the ticker BTF. Co-founder and CIO of Valkyrie Investments Steven McClurg had expressed optimism about their chances. However, about 11 months later, the SEC rejected the filing alongside applications from Wisdom Tree, Krypton, and Global X.</p>
<p>Since then, the SEC has gone on to reject many Bitcoin ETF applications. In fact, the SEC has not approved any spot Bitcoin ETFs despite multiple applications. Instead, the regulator has cited concerns about market manipulation, fraud, and investor protection as reasons for its rejections or delays.</p>
<h2>Optimism Over the New Filing</h2>
<p>Valkyrie resubmitted its Bitcoin ETF application days after BlackRock&#8217;s ETF proposal application. Like BlackRock, it also enlisted Coinbase as its surveillance-sharing partner. The Bitcoin ETF is listed under the ticker ‘BRRR’. Unlike the firm’s existing <a href="https://valkyrie-funds.com/btf/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener">BTF fund</a>, this fund will be leveraged.</p>
<p>With the application on the SEC docket, members of the public will have 21 days to comment on Valkyrie&#8217;s proposal. Following this, the SEC can then decide to approve, reject, or extend its review of Valkyrie&#8217;s proposal. It may also request more information from the company before making a decision.</p>
<p>If approved, Valkyrie&#8217;s Bitcoin ETF would be the first of its kind in the US and could attract significant demand from investors. However, there is no guarantee that the SEC will change its stance on spot Bitcoin ETFs anytime soon, as it has been historically cautious and conservative on crypto-related products.</p>
<p>Regardless of the approval, Bitcoin rallied after several firms submitted their Bitcoin ETF applications. However, at the time of writing, Bitcoin was hovering around $29, 995 according to CoinMarketCap.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/evergrande-81b-loss-two-years/">China&#8217;s Largest Indebted Property Developer Evergrande Reports $81B Loss in Two Years</a></p>
<p>Evergrande Group, China&#8217;s largest indebted property developer, has finally <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/evergrandes-long-delayed-2021-2022-results-show-significant-losses-2023-07-17/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">unveiled</a> its long-awaited earnings report, disclosing a staggering $81 billion combined loss for 2021 and 2022. According to the company&#8217;s financial earnings report released on July 17, the real estate developer acknowledged a net loss of 476 billion yuan ($66.36 billion) in 2021 and an additional loss of 105.9 billion yuan ($14.76 billion) in 2022.</p>
<p>These substantial losses were primarily attributed to write-downs of properties, return of land, losses on financial assets, and mounting finance costs. Notably, the reported loss represents a significant reversal from the net profit of 8.1 billion yuan recorded in 2020 when Evergrande&#8217;s operations were relatively stable.</p>
<p>The repercussions of Evergrande&#8217;s massive debt burden have reverberated throughout China&#8217;s property sector, a vital pillar of the country&#8217;s economy. The company&#8217;s struggles have resulted in defaults and unfinished homes, leaving suppliers and creditors in a precarious position.</p>
<h2>Evergrande Shares Suspended from Trading on Hong Kong Stock Exchange</h2>
<p>The company&#8217;s financial woes started when it failed to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/breaking-evergrande-defaults-the-148-million-bond-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repay</a> a debt of $148 million in 2021. In order to compensate its suppliers and creditors, the real estate giant sold some of its assets and shares but was unable to meet the demand of investors, thereby going into <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/evergrande-shares-trading-loss-default/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">default.</a> The company&#8217;s total liabilities at the time amounted to $300 billion after the default</p>
<p>The following year, Evergrande announced that it had received an order from local authorities to halt trading its shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange, pending the release of the long-overdue financial results and ongoing investigations into seized deposits. The indefinite suspension raises questions about potential delisting if the shares remain halted beyond the 18-month threshold.</p>
<p>The company is now <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/evergrande-repayment-default-looms/">restructuring</a> and confirmed that its shares will remain suspended.</p>
<h2>Evergrande&#8217;s Total Liabilities Reached $340 Billion</h2>
<p>According to the financial earnings report, Evergrande&#8217;s total liabilities have surged from $300 billion at the time of its default to $340 billion by the end of 2022, underscoring the significant financial hurdles faced by the company. The increase represents a 23% percent rise compared to the previous year, revealing the mounting challenges the company, the government, and investors encounter as they work towards resolving weaknesses within a sector that contributes to over a quarter of China&#8217;s economic activity. Additionally, the financial report indicated a substantial drop in revenue, with Evergrande&#8217;s earnings plunging by 55% to 230.1 billion yuan in 2022 compared to the more prosperous period of 2020.</p>
<p>In contrast, the company&#8217;s total assets experienced a decline of 20%, amounting to 1.8 trillion yuan. This drop in assets further accentuates the financial strain faced by Evergrande and its ongoing struggle to maintain stability amidst challenging market conditions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it is worth noting that Evergrande&#8217;s auditors, Prism Hong Kong and Shanghai Limited, refrained from expressing opinions on the company&#8217;s financial statements. The auditor cited insufficient audit evidence as the reason behind this decision, raising concerns about transparency and accuracy.</p>
<p>The reported losses align with analysts&#8217; expectations, given the decline in Evergrande&#8217;s contracted sales, which amounted to 443 billion yuan in 2021 and a mere 31.7 billion yuan in 2022, compared to 723 billion yuan in 2020.</p>
<p>As Evergrande grapples with its financial challenges, the company has been actively pursuing an offshore debt restructuring plan. It recently announced that hearings for the reorganizational schemes will be held in Hong Kong and the Cayman Islands, allowing creditors to consider and approve the proposed plan.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/celo-blockchain-ethereum-layer-2/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/celo-blockchain-ethereum-layer-2/">Celo Blockchain Preps to Transition to Ethereum Layer-2 Network as Token Jumps Nearly 10%</a></p>
<p>The Celo blockchain currently seeks to transition from an independent layer-1 blockchain to an Ethereum layer-2 solution.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/celo-blockchain-ethereum-layer-2/">Celo Blockchain Preps to Transition to Ethereum Layer-2 Network as Token Jumps Nearly 10%</a></p>
<p>CLabs, the developer behind the Celo blockchain, is currently eyeing a transition to the Ethereum ecosystem. The team proposed this via a Twitter announcement where it said that the decision comes after &#8220;months of research and initial discussions with Celo and Ethereum community members&#8221;.</p>
<p>Per the announcement, the proposal seeks for the Celo blockchain to transition from an independent layer-1 blockchain to an Ethereum layer-2 solution. However, a final decision will only be reached after the community votes on Saturday, July 22.</p>
<h2>Celo Blockchain to See Massive Gains from Move, Experts Say</h2>
<p>The Celo team appears to be in high spirits for the anticipated migration. According to a technical analysis of the proposed migration to the Ethereum ecosystem, the blockchain stands to gain a lot of benefits. That includes improved security, greater liquidity, as well as more compatibility among other things.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the migration is expected to initially rely on Optimism&#8217;s OP Stack. And as it was appraised in a <a href="https://forum.celo.org/t/clabs-proposal-for-celo-to-transition-to-an-ethereum-l2/6109" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">post</a> on the Celo Forum:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Migrating Celo to utilize the OP stack eliminates the need to monitor compatibility, making it easy for Celo developers to utilize the full gambit of Ethereum tooling/libraries.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Besides, Celo already works well with the Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM. So, as far as compatibility is concerned, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> developers can simply just move their existing apps over. And if they want to create new ones, they can do so easily, using many of the same tools they are already familiar with.</p>
<h2>CELO Token Surges</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, CELO, the native token of the blockchain, has reacted positively to the announcement. Although that is not exactly unexpected.  Token surges are common when major upgrades such as this are about to take place. And as of publication, CELO has surged nearly 9.96% in the past week to reach $0.545. According to CoinMarketCap <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/celo/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">data</a>, the token has gained more than 35% over the last month.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/euro-stablecoin-market-regulations/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/euro-stablecoin-market-regulations/">Euro Stablecoin Market Set to Grow with Real-World Applications and Clear Regulations</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the European Union has recently proposed a comprehensive regulation called the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA). MiCA aims to offer legal certainty and consumer protection for crypto-asset issuers and service providers.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/euro-stablecoin-market-regulations/">Euro Stablecoin Market Set to Grow with Real-World Applications and Clear Regulations</a></p>

<p>The euro stablecoin market is poised to expand in the coming years, according to Patrick Hansen, European Union strategy and policy director at Circle. Hansen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WF__4bId9zU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a> this while speaking at the EthCC conference in Paris on Monday, July 17. Circle currently has one of the top 5 Euro-pegged stablecoins, the Euro Coin (EUROC). The firm will also be looking to grow its market share.</p>
<h2>A Dollar-Dominated Market</h2>
<p>According to Hansen, the stablecoin market is currently worth about $120 billion. However, euro stablecoins have a meager market share of about $300 million. This represents barely 0.3% of the entire stablecoin market.</p>
<p>At first glance, this may seem like the norm because the US dollar is the most-preferred currency by central banks for trading. However, the Euro is worth up to 20% of the traditional money market. This suggests the euro stablecoin market has more potential for growth. Hansen believes the stablecoin market is dominated by the dollar because it began with the US dollar. Hence, the dollar-pegged assets have been able to gain a first-mover advantage.</p>
<p>Armin Schmid, Head of Pay &amp; Stablecoins at Bitcoin Suisse AG also <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/blockchain/top-reasons-why-stablecoins-are-mostly-backed-by-us-dollar/articleshow/90796351.cms">opined</a> that the dollar-pegged stablecoins are preferred due to the negative interest rates and regulations attributable to the Euro. This, Hansen explained, is because “Liquidity begets liquidity”. With lower liquidity in the market, euro stablecoin users face higher risks and usage costs.</p>
<h2>Regulatory Clarity and Real-World Use to Aid Euro Stablecoin Market Growth</h2>
<p>As the crypto market transitions from mere speculation to real-world utility, Hansen expects the use of stablecoins to grow. Already, there are calls to begin using stablecoins in remittances and business-to-business transactions. There are also calls to integrate euro stablecoins into existing European payment systems. Hansen believes this will make users demand stablecoins in their local currency.</p>
<p>Again, decentralized finance uses like mortgage payments and car loan payments will need to be delivered in local currency. Hansen argued this should increase the size of regionalized liquidity pools and boost the euro stablecoin market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the European Union has recently proposed a comprehensive regulation called the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/european-union-mica-crypto-regulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)</a>. MiCA aims to offer legal certainty and consumer protection for crypto-asset issuers and service providers. Per the framework, MiCA considers payment stablecoins as a means of payment, similar to traditional fiat currency and electronic money.</p>
<p>While they will be subject to more stringent rules and supervision than other crypto-assets, the clarity will help many crypto firms. When the framework kicks off in 2024, it will create a harmonized and innovation-friendly environment that can boost the euro stablecoin market.</p>
