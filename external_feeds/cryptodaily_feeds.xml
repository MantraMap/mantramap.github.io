			  <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The University of California Berkeley&rsquo;s SETI@Home project is no longer allowing new users to participate in its ongoing search for extraterrestrial life, meaning it&rsquo;s no longer able to provide a passive income stream for those who&rsquo;re willing to leave their computer on 24/7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SETI@Home project launched way back in 1999, inviting users to download a special software program that enabled them to donate their excess computing power to the initiative, which is looking for signs of alien life elsewhere in the cosmic void. But much to people&rsquo;s disappointment, scientists announced in 2021 that they&rsquo;re winding down the project and no longer require contributions from the general public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the announcement was a major disappointment for participants, the good news is that there are still many other distributed computing projects that allow users to make money by renting out their idle storage space or processing power.&nbsp;</p>
What is Distributed Computing?
<p>It might sound incredibly technical, but the concept of distributed computing is actually a very simple one. It refers to a process where the combined resources of multiple, distributed computers are aggregated together, providing powerful compute or storage resources for heavy-duty projects. In some ways it can be likened to Airbnb, but instead of renting out your spare room or vacation home, you simply rent out your unused computing resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To participate, you&rsquo;ll need to download and install the required application or plugin for whatever project it is you want to contribute to. Then it&rsquo;ll run in the background, allowing your computer&rsquo;s excess resources to be used by the organization concerned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Where Can I Participate?
<p>There are dozens of interesting projects looking to borrow people&rsquo;s excess computing capacity in support of various use cases:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Spacemesh
<p>Mining cryptocurrency is one of the most obvious ideas for utilizing your spare capacity that comes to mind, but it&rsquo;s important to choose a suitable network. While it was possible to mine Bitcoin from a PC back in the early days, its cryptographic algorithms have become so complex and its mining ecosystem so competitive that such limited hardware simply won&rsquo;t do any more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enter Spacemesh, an alternative cryptocurrency network that&rsquo;s designed to serve the average joe who wants to mine a little crypto on his or her computer at home. Unlike Bitcoin&rsquo;s proof-of-work consensus algorithm, Spacemesh uses a novel proof-of-space time consensus mechanism that is much less energy-intensive. It also employs a unique &ldquo;race-free approach&rdquo; that disincentivizes the use of massive amounts of hardware, ensuring everyone can participate and earn a passive income on their personal Mac or PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All that&rsquo;s required to start mining with Spacemesh is an Intel or AMD CPU with at least 1GB of RAM, and an always-on, unmetered internet connection with a minimum of 5 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike Bitcoin, where the CPU is the main factor for miners, Spacemesh relies on disk storage resources, which do not use energy when they&rsquo;re idle, resulting in much lower costs. The protocol is centered on fairness, and ensures all miners are rewarded for their contributions at every EPOCH, which currently concludes every two weeks, with their exact reward based on how much storage space they commit in proportion to the network size. In addition, the protocol prevents whales from joining the system with massive storage resources &ndash; in such a case, they would face much higher overhead costs, eliminating any profit gains. In this way, Spacemesh ensures its network remains highly decentralized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
HyperCycle&nbsp;
<p>As an alternative, PC and laptop owners can opt to join the HyperCycle network, which is a Layer-0 blockchain that&rsquo;s building an artificial general intelligence network. The idea with this is to promote cooperation between AI agents by establishing a network of nodes that collaborate with one another to solve complex problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This cooperative AI sees distributed computers aggregate their compute resources to create a &ldquo;global brain&rdquo;, kind of like a distributed supercomputer. AI systems can tap into this network and use its combined power to perform computing tasks that would normally be performed by sophisticated server networks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users are required to purchase an individual software node license to participate in HyperCycle&rsquo;s network and deposit a minimum of 1,024 HYPC tokens. That might sound expensive, but HyperCycle insists it&rsquo;s a small price to pay to democratize access to advanced AI computation and pave the way for a future &ldquo;Internet of AIs&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Fleek Network
<p>A great option for Web3 enthusiasts, Fleek Network is calling on users to participate in the industry&rsquo;s first decentralized content delivery network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CDNs play a key role in the internet, ensuring that websites, images and videos can load instantaneously no matter where users are located. Essentially, CDNs are geographically-distributed server networks that enable content to be cached closer to users. When someone connects to an app or website, the content will be delivered from the closest server to their location, significantly reducing latency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fleek Network aims to provide an alternative to centralized CDNs operated by companies like Cloudflare, which go against the ethos of Web3. Of course, it cannot build out a global server network from scratch, so instead it relies on people who&rsquo;re willing to provide computing resources in exchange for rewards. It invites anyone to contribute bandwidth to its network by running a cache node, so they can accelerate content delivery to end users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fleek Network&rsquo;s approach could actually be more advantageous, as its reliance on contributors means its network can potentially extend to the smallest rural villages. Whereas most centralized CDNs are restricted to building their infrastructure in cities, Fleek will be able to operate nodes across the globe. The result is that someone living in Siberia can be served by a node from the same town, rather than connecting to a large data center several hundred kilometers away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Storj
<p>If you have plenty of hard drive space and you&rsquo;re willing to put it to work, Storj offers a viable opportunity with its decentralized cloud storage network, which it presents as an alternative to services like Dropbox, Box and Amazon Web Services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It claims to have some big advantages, including greater privacy with guarantees that content stored within the Storj network will never be monitored or censored. All content stored on people&rsquo;s hard drives is fully encrypted, and only the owner has the keys required to access it. The other key selling point is that content is automatically distributed across multiple devices, eliminating the risk of downtime that would prevent users from accessing their files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To rent out your extra disk drive space to Storj, all that&rsquo;s required is to download its application, install it, and then select how much storage capacity you want to contribute. Once activated, that portion of your hard drive becomes a part of the Storj network so you can no longer use it yourself. Instead, you&rsquo;ll be compensated for renting it out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the requirements, obviously, is that you must be willing to leave your computer up and running and ensure it&rsquo;s always online, in return for payments made to your bank account each month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Hyperlink
<p>Hyperlink refers to itself as the &ldquo;World Supercomputer&rdquo;, but is really a global network of computers that anyone can join to earn passive income. Users donate their computer&rsquo;s resources to host third-party websites, mobile applications and content. Its services are offered as a low-cost alternative to businesses that don&rsquo;t want to invest in their own infrastructure or traditional cloud computing services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the advantages of Hyperlink is that it claims to offer significant earnings potential for users, saying it&rsquo;s possible to earn up to $8,600 per year by connecting a desktop or laptop to its network and leaving it running 24/7. Users can even contribute an entire server if they happen to have one lying around.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another bonus is that Hyperlink offers flexible payment options, allowing users to receive their earnings through PayPal, bank transfers, credit card payment and more. In future, Hyperlink will expand its network to include tablets and smartphones too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
What Are The Downsides?
<p>There actually does not seem to be a lot of downsides to earning a passive income, but those considering it should be aware that by running these programs and keeping their computer switched on 24/7, it may degrade its performance and lifetime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the reality is that most people don&rsquo;t normally use the full capacity of their machine, so they can afford to contribute without really noticing any performance impact. And of course, it&rsquo;s always possible to use an external storage device if you do need more disk space.</p>
<p>Then again, if you do need to perform intensive computing tasks yourself, it might be worth investing in a more powerful machine, or even a second computer that you can leave running and forget about.</p>

<p>A great option for Web3 enthusiasts, Fleek Network is calling on users to participate in the industry&rsquo;s first decentralized content delivery network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CDNs play a key role in the internet, ensuring that websites, images and videos can load instantaneously no matter where users are located. Essentially, CDNs are geographically-distributed server networks that enable content to be cached closer to users. When someone connects to an app or website, the content will be delivered from the closest server to their location, significantly reducing latency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fleek Network aims to provide an alternative to centralized CDNs operated by companies like Cloudflare, which go against the ethos of Web3. Of course, it cannot build out a global server network from scratch, so instead it relies on people who&rsquo;re willing to provide computing resources in exchange for rewards. It invites anyone to contribute bandwidth to its network by running a cache node, so they can accelerate content delivery to end users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fleek Network&rsquo;s approach could actually be more advantageous, as its reliance on contributors means its network can potentially extend to the smallest rural villages. Whereas most centralized CDNs are restricted to building their infrastructure in cities, Fleek will be able to operate nodes across the globe. The result is that someone living in Siberia can be served by a node from the same town, rather than connecting to a large data center several hundred kilometers away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Storj
<p>If you have plenty of hard drive space and you&rsquo;re willing to put it to work, Storj offers a viable opportunity with its decentralized cloud storage network, which it presents as an alternative to services like Dropbox, Box and Amazon Web Services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It claims to have some big advantages, including greater privacy with guarantees that content stored within the Storj network will never be monitored or censored. All content stored on people&rsquo;s hard drives is fully encrypted, and only the owner has the keys required to access it. The other key selling point is that content is automatically distributed across multiple devices, eliminating the risk of downtime that would prevent users from accessing their files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To rent out your extra disk drive space to Storj, all that&rsquo;s required is to download its application, install it, and then select how much storage capacity you want to contribute. Once activated, that portion of your hard drive becomes a part of the Storj network so you can no longer use it yourself. Instead, you&rsquo;ll be compensated for renting it out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the requirements, obviously, is that you must be willing to leave your computer up and running and ensure it&rsquo;s always online, in return for payments made to your bank account each month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Hyperlink
<p>Hyperlink refers to itself as the &ldquo;World Supercomputer&rdquo;, but is really a global network of computers that anyone can join to earn passive income. Users donate their computer&rsquo;s resources to host third-party websites, mobile applications and content. Its services are offered as a low-cost alternative to businesses that don&rsquo;t want to invest in their own infrastructure or traditional cloud computing services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the advantages of Hyperlink is that it claims to offer significant earnings potential for users, saying it&rsquo;s possible to earn up to $8,600 per year by connecting a desktop or laptop to its network and leaving it running 24/7. Users can even contribute an entire server if they happen to have one lying around.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another bonus is that Hyperlink offers flexible payment options, allowing users to receive their earnings through PayPal, bank transfers, credit card payment and more. In future, Hyperlink will expand its network to include tablets and smartphones too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
What Are The Downsides?
<p>There actually does not seem to be a lot of downsides to earning a passive income, but those considering it should be aware that by running these programs and keeping their computer switched on 24/7, it may degrade its performance and lifetime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the reality is that most people don&rsquo;t normally use the full capacity of their machine, so they can afford to contribute without really noticing any performance impact. And of course, it&rsquo;s always possible to use an external storage device if you do need more disk space.</p>
<p>Then again, if you do need to perform intensive computing tasks yourself, it might be worth investing in a more powerful machine, or even a second computer that you can leave running and forget about.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest partnership is an extension of Open Campus&rsquo; mission to educate and raise awareness on issues of climate change and environmental conservation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This July, Open Campus, a community-led Web 3 educational content platform, announced the launch of their #ClimateChange4Kids campaign on X (formerly Twitter) to educate the upcoming generations on the importance of protecting our planet. To extend its efforts, Open Campus is now in partnership with its affiliate, TinyTap and Code Green, a Web 3 organization leveraging blockchain and art to help conserve the environment, to create educational content on climate change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The strategic partnership aims to extend knowledge and awareness of climate change via the Open Campus platform, providing creators, educators and teachers with a decentralized platform to create interactive educational games and earn from their content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While several parts of the world face extreme temperatures and wildfires, such an initiative could be a crucial step in imparting knowledge on how to stop it.&nbsp; Code Green, TinyTap and Open Campus come together in a mission to educate younger generations &ndash; in an engaging and interactive way &ndash; on climate change. Furthermore, the initiative extends the belief in &ldquo;the power of education to shape a more sustainable future&rdquo;, a mission also shared by the&nbsp; United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).&nbsp;</p>

<p>"By combining education, technology, and gaming, we're creating a unique platform to engage children and empower them with the knowledge and awareness to tackle this urgent crisis for our planet,&rdquo; Inna Modja, CEO of Code Green and Goodwill Ambassador for the UNCCD, said.</p>

Open Campus, TinyTap and Code Green launch NFT Giveaway&nbsp;
<p>In light of the new collaboration, TinyTap will create a new climate change-centred course and integrate some elements of Code Green&rsquo;s game HEALV3RSE, available on The Sandbox. Featured on the UNCCD website, HEALV3RSE is a metaverse game that allows users to play, learn about the planet, and have a real-world impact. The game&rsquo;s avatars and NFT will feature in the lessons to incentivize learners and enhance the overall quality of the course, the press statement reads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through various levels of the game, players discover facts about the environment, make eco-friendly choices to help their virtual planet and perform healing actions. The &lsquo;Play To Heal&rsquo; model enhances the game and gives players a novel experience as they participate in healing actions for our planet, such as planting trees, cleaning oceans, and installing solar panels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, Open Campus and Code Green are launching a giveaway to promote the new course. Players who participate in the giveaway campaign have a chance to win up to 100 HEALV3RSE avatars and equipment NFTs. Follow-up details on the giveaway will be posted on Open Campus X (fmr. Twitter) page.</p>
<p>The latest strategic partnership follows the successful launch of &lsquo;Climate Change for Kids&rsquo; in July, aiming to enhance awareness of climate change, especially in younger generations. The #ClimateChange4Kids initiative has seen tremendous support worldwide, with over 200,000 impressions on X. Lastly, Open Campus&rsquo; recent partnership with Cloud Co Entertainment saw the company get a license to use the image of Care Bears, one of the most popular children's products line.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>According to hedge fund manager Mark Yusko, banks take $7 trillion dollars out of the system every year. The advent of triple entry accounting with blockchain means that banks are becoming redundant.</p>
Banks fight dirty
<p>Founder of Morgan Creek Capital, Yusko recently gave an interview in which he gave a portrayal of the banks that isn&rsquo;t often heard. He stated that banks have paid more in fines for criminal acts such as fraud and money laundering than the entire market cap of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>He affirmed that banks are extremely worried about crypto and blockchain technology because it heralds an end to their existence, given that the middle man is now no longer needed. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We (the banks) skim $7 trillion a year out of this system. It&rsquo;s 6 to 8% of GDP that goes to the banks for trust - but we can replace trust with truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yusko is of the belief that the FTX collapse was actually orchestrated in order to bring controversy to the crypto industry and allow US regulators to react by launching an aggressive onslaught against the crypto sector.</p>
<p>He believes that the banking industry, in charge of money for hundreds of years, is in league with regulators to cripple the crypto industry so that it can continue its hegemony over printing money.</p>
<p>Yusko expects the banks&rsquo; fight against the crypto industry will carry on for the next few years before the obvious advantages of crypto and blockchain are finally recognised and given government support.&nbsp;</p>
How the incumbent fights the newcomer
<p>An example of an antiquated and embedded system that seeks to suppress and cripple a new and better system is given by Yusko. He points to when cars were invented and how the incumbent transport system of the horse and buggy sought to do just this in the late 19th century.</p>
<p>Reportedly there was collusion between those seeking to protect the horse and buggy system, and the regulators. Ridiculous and onerous rules were imposed on cars that forced them to have someone walking ahead of them holding a red flag. In addition, three persons were required by law to have charge of a vehicle, and additional persons were needed if wagons or carriages were attached.</p>
<p>These harsh and exacting laws were in place for 30 years before being repealed, and technology was finally allowed to progress.&nbsp;</p>
Imposition of CBDCs
<p>According to Yusko, banking is attempting to do the same thing against crypto. He believes that moves are afoot to impose central bank digital currencies on citizens, forcing their use. Yusko said of CBDCs:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you haven&rsquo;t watched Agustin Carstens (Head of the Bank for International Settlements) talk about what a CBDC actually is - and of course the central bank should control how, when, and if you are allowed to spend &lsquo;your&rsquo; money - it&rsquo;s one of the most chilling 1 minute and 47 seconds that you&rsquo;ll ever watch.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>$BNB, the Binance exchange token, is on the brink of a potential heavy collapse. Will this bring Bitcoin and the crypto market down?</p>
$BNB on the brink
<p>Following negative downward price action since November 2021, the $BNB token has reached the point where a slide under the critical $220 level could lead to a calamitous -5x crash down to below $50.</p>
<p>Right now the price is struggling to stay within the bottom limits of a bear flag it first entered in early June of this year. The price has already slid out of the bottom of the bear flag at time of going to press, but this break is still to be confirmed.</p>
<p>A nervousness does still appear to be upon the crypto market over recent weeks as bears and bulls both eye bitcoin and ethereum as they approach their own critical trendlines and support levels.</p>
Bitcoin and Ethereum also at critical levels&nbsp;
<p>If bitcoin hits the support of its bullish trendline this is likely to be as low as $28,000. The 200 daily moving average is just below this at $27,300. In its favour, the bitcoin hash ribbons indicator very recently signalled a buy. Ethereum is already at and holding its bullish trendline at just under $1,800. This is also the level of its 200 day moving average. Both bitcoin and ethereum could see a significant price drop if these levels break.</p>
Altcoins having a good day
<p>The rest of the altcoin market is mostly doing a lot better than either bitcoin or ethereum so far today. Total 3 (all cryptos with the exception of bitcoin and ethereum) is up 1% on the day so far. Strong support at $331 billion is below the current value of just under $337 billion.</p>
<p>$RUNE is still on the charge this morning with a more than 6% gain so far. This is counted in $RUNEs epic 70% rise since the beginning of August, making this crypto one of the biggest movers over the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Kaspa ($KAS) has also featured prominently among the altcoins but more so over the longer term. The innovative proof-of-work layer 1 rose more than 330% since May, but has been correcting over the last couple of weeks. It is up 3.6% on the day so far.</p>
A $BNB wipeout could mean serious issues for crypto&nbsp;
<p>The question now is whether or not $BNB can hold its ground at $220 if it should get down there. Many will be shorting the token given how the SEC is suing both Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao. Should $BNB indeed make the drop, the token, as well as the exchange, could be in serious financial trouble.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Binance accounting for much of the trade in crypto, plus holding large amounts of many other tokens, such a scenario could be calamitous for the exchange, as well as for the crypto market in general.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Road Town, BVI., August 17th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>As the cryptocurrency market has witnessed a decline for over a year, many investors have chosen to liquidate their assets or move to alternative markets. However, 2023 has painted a different picture, positioning cryptocurrency as one of the best-performing investments. According to CoinMarketCap, the total crypto market capitalization rebounded from a low of $780.9 billion to a staggering $1.2198 trillion. Amid this resurgence, LBank, after a few years of dormancy, has announced the reboot of its IEO. Official participation link:&nbsp;https://www.lbank.com/launchpad-list/pins/</p><p>With LBank&rsquo;s IEO making a comeback, let&rsquo;s dive deep into its historical performance to gauge its potential.</p><p>Historical Gains of LBank IEO &ndash; 8 IEOs with an Average Surge of 1274%</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of LBank&rsquo;s past eight IEOs and their respective gains:</p><p></p><p>Key Insights from the Data:</p><p>Extreme Performers: VEN stands out remarkably with an opening surge of 100% and a jaw-dropping peak surge of 5300%. DBC, with its 300% opening and 2096% peak, also highlights the potential of high return for investors when the right project is picked.</p><p>Steady Climbers: Projects like BLOC, SEER, and INK might not have the most impressive opening surges, but their peak surges underline the importance of holding onto investments and the potential for long-term gains.</p><p>Consistent Performers: Both CMT and DDD had modest opening surges but still managed to deliver reasonable peak surges. These indicate that even projects that start with a quieter entry can offer profitable opportunities.</p><p>Risky Endeavors: While the data predominantly showcases successes, it&rsquo;s also essential to note projects like INK and DDD. Their minimal to zero opening surges serve as a reminder of the risks inherent in IEO investments.</p><p>This data also showcases a strong correlation between the initial surge and peak surge. In simpler terms, projects with an impressive opening usually fare well in the long run. From the data, it&rsquo;s evident that investing in LBank&rsquo;s IEOs can provide returns in the short term. Holding onto these investments for an extended period might amplify the gains further, as exemplified by the metaverse project SAND.</p><p>LBank&rsquo;s Current Market Stance:</p><p>While LBank carries a notable legacy, it is essential to consider contemporary metrics when assessing its present standing. According to the H1 report from CoinMarketCap, LBank is featured among the top five global exchanges, an indication of its continued relevance and adaptability in the fast-evolving crypto landscape. Holding a 4.6% market share in spot trading volume, it&rsquo;s intriguing to observe their strategic emphasis on MEME coins. This focus, often seen as a blend of calculated risk and innovative market positioning, distinguishes LBank from many of its counterparts.</p><p></p><p>To conclude, based on the available data and recent market performances, one can argue that LBank remains a significant player in the exchange arena. As they reboot their IEO, it might be a space to watch for investors keen on exploring fresh avenues.</p><p>About LBank Labs</p><p>LBank Labs, a prominent player in the web3 space, manages a versatile $100 Million fund that extends beyond specific protocols and exchanges.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Road Town, BVI., August 17th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>As the cryptocurrency market has witnessed a decline for over a year, many investors have chosen to liquidate their assets or move to alternative markets. However, 2023 has painted a different picture, positioning cryptocurrency as one of the best-performing investments. According to CoinMarketCap, the total crypto market capitalization rebounded from a low of $780.9 billion to a staggering $1.2198 trillion. Amid this resurgence, LBank, after a few years of dormancy, has announced the reboot of its IEO. Official participation link:&nbsp;https://www.lbank.com/launchpad-list/pins/</p><p>With LBank&rsquo;s IEO making a comeback, let&rsquo;s dive deep into its historical performance to gauge its potential.</p><p>Historical Gains of LBank IEO &ndash; 8 IEOs with an Average Surge of 1274%</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of LBank&rsquo;s past eight IEOs and their respective gains:</p><p></p><p>Key Insights from the Data:</p><p>Extreme Performers: VEN stands out remarkably with an opening surge of 100% and a jaw-dropping peak surge of 5300%. DBC, with its 300% opening and 2096% peak, also highlights the potential of high return for investors when the right project is picked.</p><p>Steady Climbers: Projects like BLOC, SEER, and INK might not have the most impressive opening surges, but their peak surges underline the importance of holding onto investments and the potential for long-term gains.</p><p>Consistent Performers: Both CMT and DDD had modest opening surges but still managed to deliver reasonable peak surges. These indicate that even projects that start with a quieter entry can offer profitable opportunities.</p><p>Risky Endeavors: While the data predominantly showcases successes, it&rsquo;s also essential to note projects like INK and DDD. Their minimal to zero opening surges serve as a reminder of the risks inherent in IEO investments.</p><p>This data also showcases a strong correlation between the initial surge and peak surge. In simpler terms, projects with an impressive opening usually fare well in the long run. From the data, it&rsquo;s evident that investing in LBank&rsquo;s IEOs can provide returns in the short term. Holding onto these investments for an extended period might amplify the gains further, as exemplified by the metaverse project SAND.</p><p>LBank&rsquo;s Current Market Stance:</p><p>While LBank carries a notable legacy, it is essential to consider contemporary metrics when assessing its present standing. According to the H1 report from CoinMarketCap, LBank is featured among the top five global exchanges, an indication of its continued relevance and adaptability in the fast-evolving crypto landscape. Holding a 4.6% market share in spot trading volume, it&rsquo;s intriguing to observe their strategic emphasis on MEME coins. This focus, often seen as a blend of calculated risk and innovative market positioning, distinguishes LBank from many of its counterparts.</p><p></p><p>To conclude, based on the available data and recent market performances, one can argue that LBank remains a significant player in the exchange arena. As they reboot their IEO, it might be a space to watch for investors keen on exploring fresh avenues.</p><p>About LBank Labs</p><p>LBank Labs, a prominent player in the web3 space, manages a versatile $100 Million fund that extends beyond specific protocols and exchanges. With a team of experienced web3 veterans from prestigious entities, they have built an extensive network of expertise and connections. Their investment strategy includes fund-of-fund investments, direct investments in early-stage projects, and liquid projects, enabling them to explore diverse opportunities.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>According to a notice published by the regulatory authority, Dubai&rsquo;s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority has hit digital asset exchange OPNX and its founders nearly $2.8 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crypto bankruptcy claims exchange and its founders, Su Zhu, Kyle Davies, and Mark Lamb, were formally reprimanded by VARA in May.&nbsp;</p>
A Hefty Fine&nbsp;
<p>According to the notice published by Dubai&rsquo;s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority, a fine of 10,000,000 United Arab Emirates dirhams ($2.7 million) was issued against Open Technology Markets (OPNX) for violating several rules related to advertising, promotions, and marketing. The regulatory body stated in its notice,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Further to Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s (VARA) previous notices dated the 12th of April 2023 and the 27th of April 2023 regarding the conduct of Open Technology Markets Ltd. [trading as OPNX and opnx.com], VARA has issued the following fines. AED 10,000,000 against OPNX for a Market Offence under Regulation VIII.A.3 of the Virtual Assets and Related Activities Regulations 2023 (Regulations). This fine was issued on the 2nd of May 2023 and remains unpaid at the time of publication of this notice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dubai&rsquo;s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority also stated that the fine was issued on the 2nd of May, 2023, and remains unpaid as of the 16th of August, when the notice was published. The regulatory body also issued separate fines of 200,000 United Arab Emirates dirhams ($54,451) on Davies, Mark, and Lamb. This fine was for failing to meet advertising and marketing standards set by the regulator. According to the notice, all three have paid the second fine in full.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;AED 200,000 against each of the following 4 persons: OPNX founders Kyle Davies, Su Zhu, and Mark Lamb and OPNX CEO Leslie Lamb. The fines are for violations of Administrative Order No. 01/22 Relating to Regulation of Marketing, Advertising, and Promotions Related to Virtual Assets [failure to ensure marketing meets the requirements of paragraph II.1 and/or II.5 of the Marketing Regulation]. The fines were issued on the 2nd of May 2023 and have been fully paid by the individuals in question.&rdquo;</p>

Further Action?&nbsp;
<p>The fines issued by the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority are the biggest fines the regulator has issued to date. The regulatory body noted that all fines were referred to its grievance committee and were in accordance with all governance requirements. The committee determined that enforcement actions against OPNX and its founders should be upheld in their entirety.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All fines noted above were referred to Vara&rsquo;s grievance committee in accordance with due governance requirements. The committee reviewed the referral of the grievance and determined that the enforcement actions taken be upheld in their entirety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The regulator also hinted at further action against OPNX in a bid to recover payments and could potentially see the matter being referred to law enforcement agencies or competent courts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vara shall determine consequential actions warranted against Opnx, which may include further fines, penalties, and/or taking any actions necessary to recover payment and definitively remedy the behavior including, but not limited to, referring the matter to any law enforcement agency (ies) or competent courts.&rdquo;</p>

The Controversial OPNX Exchange&nbsp;
<p>OPNX was set up and launched by the founders of the failed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), Kyle Davies and Su Zhu. The platform was created following the downfall of Three Arrows Capital, with Zhu and Davies heavily criticized for starting the project. The platform allows investors to trade bankruptcy claims for platforms such as CoinFLEX and FTX. The exchange conducted less than $2 worth of trades as it stumbled into a launch, with major trading firms claimed to be investors by OPNX denied their involvement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency sector has endured a difficult 2022, with several major projects and entities collapsing, while hacks and other threats have also led to investor interest cooling. The most notable collapse was that of the Sam Bankman-Fried-led FTX, which filed for bankruptcy in November.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In a major development, the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange (COIN) has received regulatory approval to list crypto futures in the United States.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The approval comes nearly two years after the exchange had originally applied for approval to offer crypto futures in the markets.&nbsp;</p>
A Long Wait Ends&nbsp;
<p>Coinbase announced on Wednesday that it had secured approval from the National Futures Association (NFA) to operate as a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM). FCMs are similar to market makers, buying and selling futures contracts. With approvals in place, Coinbase has stated its intention to offer eligible US-based customers regulated derivatives products through Coinbase Financial Markets. These will be subject to the oversight of the National Futures Association and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The crypto exchange stated in a post on X,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The National Futures Association, a CFTC designated SRO, has approved Coinbase Financial Markets. as a registered Futures Commission Merchant. Coinbase can now offer futures contracts in BTC and ETH to eligible customers in the US.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The approval makes Coinbase the first crypto platform in the United States to offer traders regulated and leveraged crypto futures along with traditional spot trading. According to the announcement, Coinbase had applied for registration as a Futures Commission Merchant with the NFA in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In September of 2021, we filed an application with the NFA to register an FCM. Our team has worked with regulators since then to ensure we will comply with all the necessary regulations and that our FCM&rsquo;s business model meets the CFTC&rsquo;s customer protection requirements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Coinbase, the approval will allow US customers to access regulated crypto derivatives and allow greater access to the larger crypto economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to announce that approval has been secured, which will allow eligible US customers to access regulated derivatives products through Coinbase Financial Markets and alongside our spot market for a seamless experience subject to the oversight of the CFTC and the NFA. Approval for US customers to access regulated crypto derivatives will allow more people to access the crypto economy in the United States in a safe way that helps keep the US at the center of digital innovation.&rdquo;</p>

Futures Contracts In Bitcoin And Ether&nbsp;
<p>The company also put up a post on X, stating that it could now offer users cryptocurrency futures contracts in Bitcoin And ETH. Coinbase stated in a message,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We believe this is a watershed moment to be able to bring regulated crypto products to US customers. This is a critical milestone that reaffirms our commitment to operate a regulated and compliant business and be the most trusted and secure crypto-native platform for our customers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Other Approvals&nbsp;
<p>The cryptocurrency unit of Cboe Global Markets, Cboe Digital, had already received approval from the CFTC to offer margined Bitcoin and Ether futures back in June. At the time, Christy Goldsmith Romero, the Commissioner of the CFTC, had stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been vocal about the benefits of bringing appropriate crypto activities into the regulated space in order to protect customers, but in a way that supports oversight, accountability, transparency, and risk management.&rdquo;</p>

<p>COIN shares have also registered a significant jump, opening 4% higher at $82.49. Currently, COIN is trading at around $79.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Geneva, Switzerland, August 17th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>TRON DAO Ventures, the investment arm of TRON DAO, has recently bought $2 million worth of CRV tokens. As part of this strategic partnership, Curve will launch on both the TRON and the BTTC networks.</p><p>Curve is a decentralized exchange acclaimed for its automated market makers (AMMs) tailored for stablecoin trading. Having experienced an exponential surge in the latter half of 2020, it once established itself as the epitome of DeFi platforms. Currently, Curve ranks as the world's second-largest decentralized exchange (DEX) and the largest DEX for stablecoin trading.</p><p>The recent hack targeting the platform has led to a chain reaction in the DeFi space. TRON founder Justin Sun promptly expressed his support for Curve after the incident, stating, "Curve is an essential DeFi infrastructure for the blockchain industry. Our thoughts are with the team and the users affected. As a community, let's support and strengthen the security measures to protect our decentralized ecosystem."&nbsp;</p><p>Amidst the volatile market on August 1, TRON forged a partnership with Curve, introducing a stUSDT pool on the platform. stUSDT, the world's first rebase real-world asset (RWA) protocol on the TRON blockchain, is hailed as the Web3 world's version of Yu'E Bao (once China&rsquo;s largest money market fund). According to Defillama, the TVL on stUSDT has already exceeded $700 million.</p><p>Following that, TRON DAO Ventures announced its investment in Curve, underscoring TRON's ecosystem support not only through collaboration but also through financial backing. Meanwhile, Curve will integrate with the TRON and the BTTC networks as part of the partnership.</p><p>The collaboration among TRON, BTTC, and Curve is set to generate crucial synergies for the industry. Curve, a foundation infrastructure in the DeFi domain, offers significant advantages in terms of reduced financial costs and time inefficiencies while also supporting prominent public blockchains like Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Avalanche. This collaboration is poised to help further develop TRON's DeFi ecosystem. Meanwhile, as a major driver of DeFi innovation, TRON will share its most secure and cutting-edge products with Curve.</p><p>The integration between Curve and BTTC will also fuel the growth of DeFi ecosystems, especially DEX platforms. As the industry's first heterogeneous cross-chain interoperability protocol, BTTC has supported cross-chain functionality between TRON, Ethereum, and BNB Chain upon its release. It will also introduce zero-knowledge (ZK) proof technology later this year, which enables users to build dApps seamlessly across different blockchains, promoting an inclusive ecosystem open to everyone.</p><p>With the backing of TRON and BTTC, Curve anticipates a rapid rebound, and users are bound to witness a more vibrant DeFi ecosystem in the crypto industry.</p><p></p><p>About TRON DAO</p><p>TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.</p><p>Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of August 2023, it has over 179.07 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 6.26 billion total transactions, and over $13.01 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government&rsquo;s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (&ldquo;DMC&rdquo;), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica&rsquo;s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.</p><p>TRONNetwork | TRONDAO | Twitter | YouTube | Telegram | Discord | Reddit | GitHub | Medium | Forum</p><p></p><p>About Curve</p><p>Founded by Michael Egorov and launched in January 2020, Curve Finance positions itself as a DEX built on an AMM model. It focuses on the trading of stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI), synthetic assets/derivatives/staking assets (wBTC, renBTC, stETH), etc. In addition to its stronghold Ethereum, Curve also extended its presence across other chains such as Fantom, Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Optimism.&nbsp;</p><p></p>ContactHayward Wongpress@tron.network]]></description>

It will also introduce zero-knowledge (ZK) proof technology later this year, which enables users to build dApps seamlessly across different blockchains, promoting an inclusive ecosystem open to everyone.</p><p>With the backing of TRON and BTTC, Curve anticipates a rapid rebound, and users are bound to witness a more vibrant DeFi ecosystem in the crypto industry.</p><p></p><p>About TRON DAO</p><p>TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.</p><p>Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of August 2023, it has over 179.07 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 6.26 billion total transactions, and over $13.01 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government&rsquo;s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (&ldquo;DMC&rdquo;), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica&rsquo;s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.</p><p>TRONNetwork | TRONDAO | Twitter | YouTube | Telegram | Discord | Reddit | GitHub | Medium | Forum</p><p></p><p>About Curve</p><p>Founded by Michael Egorov and launched in January 2020, Curve Finance positions itself as a DEX built on an AMM model. It focuses on the trading of stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI), synthetic assets/derivatives/staking assets (wBTC, renBTC, stETH), etc. In addition to its stronghold Ethereum, Curve also extended its presence across other chains such as Fantom, Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Optimism.&nbsp;</p><p></p>ContactHayward Wongpress@tron.network]]></content:encoded>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain security firm PeckShield has reported that around $1.7 million worth of ETH is stuck in the Shibarium Bridge after its launch failed to create a meme coin rally, as was widely expected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The much-hyped and highly anticipated Shibarium Network went live late on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
ETH Stuck In Limbo
<p>Blockchain security firm PeckShield broke the news in a post on social media platform X. The firm stated that around $1.7 million worth of ETH was stuck in the Shibarium Bridge. The news comes shortly after Shibarium, a chain that was designed to facilitate the optimum utilization of dog-themed tokens such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), TREAT, and the much-hyped Doge killer LEASH.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many expected the launch of Shibarium to push the price of these meme coins into orbit. However, things did not go as planned and went sideways quite quickly, with the value of the tokens plummeting. Tokens such as TREAT were down 10%, while the BONE and LEASH tokens were down 17% and 25%, respectively, over the past 24 hours. While the developments have, no doubt, left many new users disappointed. However, recovery is possible as network users adapt and reconcile with the changes.&nbsp;</p>
SHIB Plunges By Over 9%&nbsp;
<p>The Shiba Inu (SHIB) token dropped nearly 10% as users began reporting widespread bridging issues after the Shibarium network went live on Wednesday. Available data showed that transactions on the network had been stalled for hours, with users transferring around 954 ETH worth $1.7 million and $750,000 worth of BONE tokens to the contract. Additionally, users were also blocked from sending messages on community forums on Discord after reports of the issue began to surface.&nbsp;</p>
The Shibarium Mainnet&nbsp;
<p>The Shibarium mainnet is an Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution launched by Shiba Inu on the 16th of August. The launch was initiated after months of testing and participation from millions of users. In the end, around 21 million wallets were created. Shibarium uses a new consensus mechanism called the Proof-of-Participation, which selects validators based on the proportion of the quantity of their holdings in the associated crypto asset. This helps avoid the computational costs typically associated with Proof-of-Work consensus mechanisms. The new Layer-2 solution will interact with the Ethereum blockchain and provide a more scalable and cost-effective transaction platform.&nbsp;</p>
Significant Traction&nbsp;
<p>Prior to launch, Shiba Inu&rsquo;s lead developer, who uses the pseudonym Shytoshi Kusama, stated that the new Layer-2 solution has already gained significant traction from new projects interested in building on it. According to a post by the developer on X, over 100 companies are already using the Layer-2 network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kusama has also noted that people in the tech and blockchain industry are discussing an &ldquo;everyday app.&rdquo; However, they added that such innovations must be conducted from a community and decentralized perspective. They further added that Shibarium incorporates both of these principles without compromising on decentralization, interoperability, and user-centric design. Kusama elaborated that while the validator and delegator aspects of the new Layer-2 solution will keep it decentralized, its true innovation lies in the governance, framework, and charter that help govern the nascent ecosystem&rsquo;s technology, community, and innovative aspects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By using Shibarium for governance in this system, alongside self-sovereign identity to ensure quality membership (Shibizenship), the metaverse as our territory, and the ability to partner with other like-minded states, we have effectively shattered what nationhood is and rebuilt it upon the Shib ethos of decentralization!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shibarium will utilize the Heimdall validator and Bor block production nodes, similar to that of the Polygon ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance has officially announced the launch of its opBNB Mainnet, a notable addition to the burgeoning decentralized scaling solutions sector. Touted to bolster transaction speed, security, and scalability, the move is closely watched by industry insiders and users alike.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Harnessing the Optimism OP Stack Bedrock, an optimistic rollup framework, opBNB underwent a comprehensive Testnet phase over a span of 1.5 months. During this time, the network recorded more than 7 million on-chain transactions, connecting to over 435,000 unique wallet addresses. This trial run demonstrated block processing capabilities with times hovering around one second.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, opBNB's Testnet revealed its capacity to support an array of tokens, encompassing not only Binance's proprietary BNB but also widely recognized stablecoins like BUSD, USDT, and DAI. A distinguishing feature emerged in the form of minimized transaction costs, with the Layer 2 gas price set at a minimal 0.2 gwei, leading to significantly reduced expenses for users.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The impending Mainnet rollout, slotted for mid-August 2023, is bifurcated into stages: an initial access for infrastructure providers followed by a general user release. Calearly defined criteria underline the Mainnet's launch, with emphasis on High Availability to mitigate potential bottlenecks and an ambitious performance benchmark, aiming for a consistent 4,000 TPS.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Governance remains central to opBNB's approach. The Mainnet's governance framework, as detailed in the BEP-1 proposal, underscores the commitment to democratic governance processes. Concurrently, to foster ecosystem growth, opBNB is initiating a range of grants and builder programs.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Looking ahead, Binance's roadmap for opBNB is multifaceted. It includes enhancing fraud-proof systems, streamlining account abstraction, and ensuring seamless data exchange with the BNB Greenfield ecosystem. A pivotal feature on the horizon is the decentralized sequencer, indicative of Binance's preemptive stance on potential centralization concerns.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While the opBNB Mainnet launch represents a significant juncture, the path ahead focuses on robust security, augmented community engagement, and facilitating broader digital adoption.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, provided an analytical dive into X's Community Notes tool via a post on his personal website. Notably, Buterin lauded the tool, formerly known as Twitter's Birdwatch, for aligning closely with the ethos of "crypto values" in mainstream contexts.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Launched as Birdwatch in the U.S. in October 2022, Community Notes was conceptualized as a feature that would empower users to classify tweets based on their helpfulness and context. This was introduced prior to Elon Musk's acquisition of the platform.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Buterin's assessment illuminated that the tool's core strength lies in its open-source algorithm, ensuring decisions about which notes are displayed are transparent and unbiased. He opined that the system is &ldquo;the closest thing to an instantiation of &lsquo;crypto values&rsquo; that we have seen in the mainstream world.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While emphasizing its merits, Buterin also touched upon certain imperfections of the algorithm, noting, "It&rsquo;s not perfect, but it&rsquo;s surprisingly close to satisfying the ideal of credible neutrality." Additionally, he highlighted the tool's capability in providing context to potentially misleading images used in news previews and addressing misinformation related to COVID-19.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Going deeper into the mechanics, Buterin elaborated on how the algorithm avoids simplistically averaging out people's votes to gauge a comment's utility. He further noted its efficiency in detecting stark political differences in content, reinforcing its neutrality.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Musk's Approach and Buterin's Observations</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Elon Musk's role in steering X's strategy since acquiring Twitter has been under scrutiny. Vitalik Buterin, while appreciating the algorithm's robustness, speculated that Musk might have directed the removal of certain Community Notes that could be perceived as contrary to his business alignments, specifically those critiques of the Chinese government. Despite this conjecture and comments on "highly contentious actions" post-Musk's takeover, Musk acknowledged Buterin's wrrite-up as a "great analysis".</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This commendation occurs amidst a backdrop of various discussions surrounding Musk's approach to free speech, exemplified by his self-proclaimed stance as a "free speech absolutist." There have been allegations, as per a Washington Post report, suggesting Musk&rsquo;s potential involvement in introducing a five-second delay for links to specific news outlets, including The New York Times.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a somewhat tangential twist, Buterin's analysis was published at a time when Musk was reportedly involved in a digital altercation with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, with discussions hinting at a potential mixed martial arts face-off between the two tech magnates.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Ethereum layer-2 solution Arbitrum is set to &ldquo;cliff unlock&rdquo; over 1 billion worth of $ARB on March 16, 2024 and finally start ARB&rsquo;s staggered unfreezing over the next four years. The first unlock is set almost a year after the $ARB token finally launched last March 2023.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to Token Unlocks, after the initial March 16 unlock, more $ARB tokens will be unlocked every four weeks for the next four years.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">At present, over 5 billion ARB tokens remain locked. Staggered unfreezing is a way to ensure that investors do not immediately sell the token in large quantities (thus drastically lowering the price so as to be completely worthless) and also to ensure that its stakeholders stay involved for a longer period.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The initially turbulent launch of the ARB token last March was somewhat remedied by its $120 million airdrop to DAOs. But ARB is currently on the decline partly because of security issues plaguing the still relatively-new platform. Just last July, Rodeo Finance suffered a significant $1.5 million blow when a code vulnerability was exploited. Last June, Chibi Finance executed a rug pull that stole approximately $1 million worth of tokens from users. The disturbing fact is that these were not the only incidents of some form of exploit in the Arbitrum platform. They highlight the pressing need for security measures in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Still, according to DefiLlama, Arbitrum is the fourth biggest protocol as of writing, with $1.88 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL). ARB on the other hand is currently trading at $1.09 according to Coingecko, down from $1.3 last July. Investors and traders should remain vigilant for developments in the protocol as the unlock date nears.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In a shift in investor appetite, the cryptocurrency community is witnessing a phenomenon that might reshape the Web3 ecosystem for good. Ethereum (ETH), the blockchain synonymous with decentralized applications and smart contracts, is now facing a bold contender, Borroe ($ROE), as the top 10 addresses control over 36% of Ethereum supply.&nbsp;</p>
Whales Circle as Borroe ($ROE) Presale Makes Waves
<p>Borroe Finance is an artificial intelligence, blockchain, and smart contracts-powered NFT marketplace that is rapidly reshaping the future of web3 financing. Borroe has a unique concept that merges cutting-edge technologies to solve real-world financial problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the presale of $ROE continues, investors are grabbing the opportunity to be part of this game-changing project. The current Stage 1 offers $ROE tokens at a low price of $0.0125 per token. With six more stages to come and incremental price increases, early participants can join the Borroe revolution at a pivotal moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the web3 space continues to flourish, Borroe Finance is a testament to the power of innovation, teamwork, and the unwavering belief that a brighter financial future is within reach.</p>
<p>Borroe Finance boasts a roster of experts with deep-rooted experience in the financial, fintech, and blockchain sectors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Price, the Chief Product Officer (CPO), brings over 25 years of leadership in the Financial Services domain, while Maxim Prishchepo, the Blockchain Lead, has an extensive background in blockchain technologies and crypto trading systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This powerhouse of visionaries is committed to revolutionizing how businesses access funding in the web3 era.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
$ROE: Powering the Borroe Revolution
<p>The $ROE token lies at the heart of Borroe Finance's transformative ecosystem. With a total supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens, $ROE operates on the Polygon (Ethereum sidechain) network, offering rapid transfers and scalability while maintaining the structural integrity of the Ethereum Mainnet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the governance and utility token of the Borroe Ecosystem, $ROE grants holders many benefits, including priority notifications, discounted fees, access to premium features, rewards, and the power to shape the future of the Borroe marketplace through governance membership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a clear and innovative tokenomics structure, $ROE fuels Borroe's revolution and empowers investors to actively participate in shaping the web3 financing landscape.</p>
<p>A Point of Entry in a New Financial Frontier</p>
<p>Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and blockchain, Borroe allows businesses to mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing future recurring revenues, all in exchange for immediate funding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This innovative approach ensures a faster, more efficient way for businesses to secure the capital they need to thrive in the rapidly evolving web3 landscape. The brilliance of Borroe's AI-driven risk assessment is that it automates the entire process, reducing the need for cumbersome paperwork and lengthy approval timelines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, Borroe Finance provides a seamless experience for both sellers and buyers, making it a game-changer in web3 financing. Borroe's smart contract has undergone a thorough audit by BlockAudit, a top-tier auditing firm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This stamp of approval demonstrates Borroe's commitment to security and reassures investors of the platform's reliability and integrity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The transparency extends to the smart contract address, which is live and available for scrutiny. This level of openness is a testament to Borroe's dedication to building trust within the community and ensuring that investors can confidently participate in the presale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its approach of seeking regulation where possible and adhering to best practices showcases a responsible approach to growth. By bridging the gap between traditional financial models and the web3 landscape, Borroe Finance has created a unique entry point for investors seeking opportunity and security.</p>
<p>Shifting Tides: Ethereum's Evolution Sparks Interest in $ROE</p>
<p>While Ethereum (ETH) has long been a staple in the crypto realm, recent developments in its Proof-of-Stake transition have stirred uncertainty within its ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Santiment recently reported that Ethereum's top 10 addresses now control over 34% of the total supply. This highlights a potential centralization of ownership and influence within Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reacting to the update, savvy investors are turning their attention to Borroe Finance, an entire presale. The appeal lies in the unique opportunity Borroe presents, a marketplace that seamlessly marries AI, NFTs, and blockchain technology to reinvent web3 financing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the $ROE presale gains traction, investors recognize Borroe as more of a move towards a novel financial frontier, drawing attention away from the uncertainties surrounding Ethereum and taking advantage of a revolutionary platform promising outsized returns.</p>
<p>Investors are catching on to this trend, loading up on $ROE tokens in the presale. Analysts predict that $ROE is poised for a massive rally, with potential gains of 100X even amid the current market conditions. The market sentiment speaks volumes about investors' confidence in Borroe's vision and execution.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Sei Labs has just announced the launch of its Mainnet beta platform, seeking to facilitate the mass adoption of digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
Sei Foundation Announces Mainnet Launch
<p>Open-sourced tech firm behind the Sei blockchain, Sei Labs, has just announced a significant milestone in its journey toward revolutionizing the digital asset landscape. Following a successful Testnet alpha phase that witnessed an impressive 400 million transactions and the creation of 7.5 million unique testnet wallets, Sei Labs has officially launched the Sei Mainnet beta phase.</p>
<p>The team tweeted the announcement on X,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This marks the beginning of an long voyage, transitioning web2 experiences to web3 applications, with lightning fast time to finality&hellip;The Sei Foundation looks forward to seeing the exciting new applications built using Sei's infrastructure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mainnet beta phase's core mission is to undergo refinement through active community engagement and to seamlessly accommodate industry growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notably, Sei isn't just limiting its impact to decentralized finance (DeFi) but extends its prowess to any sector requiring trading, including gaming economies, NFT marketplaces, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).</p>
Scaling to Address Current Challenges
<p>As regulatory scrutiny mounts on centralized exchanges (CEXs), decentralized applications face the imperative of handling increased on-chain volume. Sei is seeking to provide a timely solution to the scalability challenges plaguing existing Layer 1 and Layer 2 infrastructures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform had taken a multi-faceted approach to decentralization, scalability, and capital efficiency, combined with geographical node diversification, to strengthen its resilience against potential network disruptions.</p>
<p>Sei Labs' co-founder Jeff Feng encapsulates the mission succinctly:</p>

<p>"Current Web 3 infrastructure is unscalable, congested, and still too slow. Sei is designed to let apps and other projects scale in a way that no other blockchain can, while also maintaining a user-friendly experience."&nbsp;</p>

Sei&rsquo;s Performance Optimization
<p>The platform has reported some unprecedented speed, with impressive time to finality clocking in at a mere 250ms, which is further enhanced by a 100ms buffer to ensure protocol stability. This speed is fortified by built-in parallelization, further optimizing its performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sei also introduces groundbreaking consensus research innovations, notably the Twin-Turbo consensus, propelling it to previously unattained performance milestones.</p>
Focusing On Holistic User Experience
<p>With the Mainnet's unveiling, the Sei team has revealed that over 200 teams are actively constructing on the Sei network, and over 7.5 million unique wallets have already emerged, generating a staggering 400 million testnet transactions.</p>
<p>Launch day witnesses the introduction of 30 live applications, with more slated for H2 2023, including the much-anticipated decentralized perpetual futures exchange by Sushiswap.</p>
<p>As Sei Labs co-founder Jay Jog pointed out,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The fundamental use case for blockchains is the ability to exchange digital assets. Trading is universally important for all Web3 applications, not just DeFi. It includes social platforms, gaming economies, NFT marketplaces, and more. Exchange applications such as NFT marketplaces or gaming economies will offer the best user experience by building on Sei."</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) has made a strategic investment in MoneyGram International, which resulted in obtaining a coveted seat on the firm&rsquo;s Board of Directors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
Building On A Strong Partnership
<p>The Stellar Development Foundation, responsible for expanding the Stellar network, announced a substantial investment in MoneyGram, a key player in the money transfer sector. This decision builds upon their existing commercial partnership, which was established two years ago. Although the SDF established a commercial partnership with MoneyGram in 2021, the two have collaborated on tools and technology since 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back then, MoneyGram joined forces with SDF to enable cryptocurrency payments and to introduce a cash-to-crypto service. Late last year, the payments firm announced plans to enable users to buy, sell, and hold crypto assets.&nbsp;</p>
Strategic Investment from SDF
<p>Denelle Dixon, the CEO and Executive Director of SDF, clarified in a recent blog post that the investment was made from the SDF's cash treasury, distinct from the Enterprise Fund, which typically supports startups and early-stage companies. This marks the first instance of such an investment being drawn from SDF's treasury. Dixon emphasized that this strategic move aligns with SDF&rsquo;s core mission and is a testament to MoneyGram's commitment to digital evolution.</p>
A Leap Towards Digital Advancement
<p>This investment is expected to bring about substantial benefits for both parties involved. MoneyGram, a prominent player in global financial technology, is set to expand its digital reach with the support of SDF's investment. Moreover, this collaboration will pave the way for the exploration of blockchain technology in the realm of money transfers.</p>
<p>Dixon highlighted the significance of this partnership by stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most importantly, it signifies a rededication from MGI, one of the world&rsquo;s leading global financial technology, to becoming a digital-forward leader in fintech.&rdquo;</p>

Gaining a Seat at the Table
<p>The most noteworthy outcome of this investment is SDF securing a seat on MoneyGram's Board of Directors. This move not only solidifies their partnership but also positions SDF to actively contribute to MoneyGram's strategic decisions and digital business expansion.</p>
<p>Although the exact amount of the investment remains undisclosed, Dixon affirmed that this collaboration underscores SDF's commitment to bridging the gap and democratizing access to financial services.</p>
<p>In her own words,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Continuing to build strong partnerships with organizations across the payments space puts SDF one step closer to achieving our mission of creating equitable access to financial services."</p>
