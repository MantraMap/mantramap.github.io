Later, Blackrock made a turnaround and decided to form a working group to study crypto and blockchain technology. This turnaround is akin to JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon&#8217;s skepticism on the crypto assets. Yet, the Wall Street bank continues to build products around crypto and web 3.0.</p>

<p>Mainstream financial companies have all initially been resistant to cryptocurrencies. However, it is argued that the Wall Street giants would like to have significant share in the crypto market before the United States regulators lay out clear rules for the industry.</p>
<h2>Blackrock Vs Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson criticized the Bitcoiner community&#8217;s welcoming of the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF application. This is apparently because Blackrock represents a massive chunk of traditional businesses whose values are not aligned to the vision behind Bitcoin philosophy, which is decentralization. He <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1669471985611538433?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Bitcoiners defending Blackrock is all you need to know about their ethics, mental state, and greed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, it remains to be seen if and when the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/securities-and-exchange-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> would take a decision on the Bitcoin ETF application. An approval mean massive inroads to mainstream adoption of the crypto market, considering the wide range of portfolio companies Blackrock manages.</p>

<h2><b>Matters Arising and Tether’s Response</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to details in the released documents by the New York Attorney General (NYAG), the stablecoin issuer reportedly deactivated up to 29 accounts owned by top crypto players two years ago. It appears to be that most of the names on the list had their account terminated for different reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These reasons were not plainly stated but at the same time, Tether </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://tether.to/en/Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-What-We-Shared-With-NYAG/"><span style="font-weight: 400">responded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by stating that it does &#8220;not want to comment on any individual relationship, but everyone did pass the strict compliance checks at onboarding and ongoing monitoring required by Tether’s compliance policies.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some of these accounts belonged to the likes of crypto trading platform MoonPay, embattled crypto lending firm BlockFi, crypto investment firm CMS Holdings and the now-shuttered crypto hedge fund Galois Capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Noteworthy, the NYAG&#8217;s investigation ended as far back as February 2021 but it was discovered that some of the documents are dated further till around June of the same year. Their user codes have already been redacted. </span></p>
<h2><b>Tether Saga With NYAG</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Office of the New York Attorney General gathered these documents during its investigation into Tether and its sister company Bitfinex for the misappropriation of $850 million funds. During this time, iFinex, the parent company of both entities, </span><a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-bitfinex-and-tether-seeks-30-day-extension-to-produce-critical-financial-document-before-nyag/"><span style="font-weight: 400">requested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a 30-day extension to produce the critical financial documents before NYAG a few days to the expiration of the previously scheduled date. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, the parties involved reached a </span><a href="https://coingape.com/bitfinex-and-tether-settles-dispute-with-nyag-with-18-5-million-penalty/"><span style="font-weight: 400">settlement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of $18.5 million as a penalty in addition to suspending trading activities in New York. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thereafter, media houses including Coinbase approached NYAG requesting public disclosure of their first quarterly report under Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) but Tether raised an objection against the move. Tether claimed that it was trying to protect its customers&#8217; confidential data which could be &#8220;exploited by malicious actors.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, along the line, NYAG gave the media houses access to the documents in order to prove its commitment to transparency and openness and the deactivation of many crypto company&#8217;s account comes off as one of the matters that has been uncovered thus far.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Cardano Price Daily Chart </strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ADA price may face intense demand pressure at $0.24 support</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sellers may prolong the ongoing correction trend in ADA until the downsloping trendline is intact.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the ADA coin is $192.5 Million, indicating a 37.35% loss</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/q/qHIdWOxP.png" alt="Cardano Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 10th, the Cardano coin showcased a long-tail rejection candle at $0.24 support. Following a massive sell-off, this buying was mainly due to accumulation for investors entering at discounted prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus ongoing bearish trends and accumulation from buyers cause the current sideways movement in ADA price. If the overhead supply pressure persists, the prices could plunge to another 8% to revisit the bottom support of $0.24.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This retest could give additional confirmation for a new relief rally in Cardano.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in the daily chart, the upside could be limited to a downsloping trendline which is carrying a correction phase over the past two months.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Will Cardano</strong> Price<strong> Surpass $0.35 Mark?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current sideways movement in ADA price is likely to stabilize the build-up buying pressure after the excessive sell-off in the coin’s market value. This battle between the buyers and sellers could trigger a range formation between $0.3 and $0.24. However, for buyers to reclaim the $0.35 mark they need a breakout range resistance of $0.3 and an overhead trendline to kickstart a new recovery that could surpass $0.3 </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Relative Strength Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> at the oversold region reflects an unstable price behavior due to excessive selling and therefore it needs to be balanced by an influx of buying pressure in order to establish a sustainable trend.</span></li>
<li><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 20-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> could be a dynamic resistance in a high momentum downtrend.</span></li>

<h2><b>BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF: The Industry’s Concern</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The BlackRock filing did not come as a surprise to many as the investment giant has been showing bold support for the premier digital currency for a while now. The firm </span><a href="https://coingape.com/blackrock-set-to-index-btc-prices/"><span style="font-weight: 400">floated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a Bitcoin price index back in September last year as one of its defined moves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The company is known as the biggest asset manager with about $10 trillion in Assets Under Management (AUM) and it has seen the crypto ecosystem as one of the new growth niches to diversify its capital. Despite the regulatory impasse in the US, BlackRock has </span><a href="https://coingape.com/blackrock-launches-crypto-etf-amid-regulatory-concerns/"><span style="font-weight: 400">launched</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a crypto ETF in Europe for its customers in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite these moves, the application for a spot Bitcoin ETF is considered a rather bold move seeing that the SEC has not approved a related product in the industry’s history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the regulator has approved the Bitcoin ETF products based on the futures price of the cryptocurrency </span><a href="https://coingape.com/its-final-proshares-bitcoin-futures-etf-to-start-trading-next-week-onwards/"><span style="font-weight: 400">starting with ProShares’</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, top asset managers including Fidelity Investments and VanEck have been denied a Spot Bitcoin ETF application by the SEC over the years. This is the concern in the industry at this time.</span></p>
<h2><b>Weighing the Chances of BlackRock</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What is aggravating these concerns is the current regulatory impasse in the United States seeing the onslaught of the SEC against top crypto exchanges including Coinbase and Binance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Messari Senior Researcher Tom Dunleavy has shared promising statistics regarding previous ETF applications of BlackRock. </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/dunleavy89/status/1669701674838134785?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400">According</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to the analyst, BlackRock has secured approval for 575 out of the 576 ETF applications it has made in the past.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Blackrock has succeded in 575 out of the 576 ETF applications it has filed.</p>
<p>&mdash; Tom Dunleavy (@dunleavy89) <a href="https://twitter.com/dunleavy89/status/1669701674838134785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is an excellent statistics but industry insiders are still skeptical as to whether it will be enough to land an approval from the SEC despite the rejections it has handed out to other major competitors in the past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the filing, the SEC is typically obligated to share its decision in the next 45 days but the commission can extend the timing if it deems it necessary.</span></p>

Earlier, the regulatory agency launched the fresh batch of crypto lawsuits, this time targeting two of the world&#8217;s top <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchanges</a>, Coinbase and Binance. Coinbase, the top US based exchange, was charged with engaging in an unregistered securities offering through its staking-as-a-service program.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a> showed very little negative reaction to the back to back lawsuits, amid a prolonged slump in asset prices following the US regional banking crisis news.</p>
<h2>Judge Jennifer Rearden Replaced In Coinbase Lawsuit</h2>
<p>Judge Jennifer Rearden has been replaced by Judge Katherine Polk Failla in the SEC Coinbase lawsuit, who had previously overseen another crypto lawsuit, involving Tether and Bitfinex. However, there seems to be <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/MetaLawMan/status/1669737283447037952" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no particular reason</a> as to why the Judge was replaced, according to MetaLawMan. This past experience is said to be benefiting the new judge as she would be familiar with the crypto terminology. A tweet by the MetaLawMan account said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A new judge has been assigned to the SEC Vs Coinbase case in New York federal court, to replace rookie Judge Jennifer Rearden. The new Judge assigned is Katherine Polk Failla.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Celsius Set To Perform A Rug Pull?</strong></p>
<p>As per announcement, <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-dump-news-celsius-altcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celsius Network will be selling all alltoins</a> excluding custody and withhold account holding from July 1, 2023. It mentioned that the amount recovered from the sale will be converted into Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).</p>
<p>Reports suggest that Celsius network is holding around $215 million worth of altcoins which might be dumped from July 1. As per the list, the crypto lender holds $70.5 million worth of 6.6 million Celsius tokens (CEL). CEL is trading at an average price of $0.1054, at the press time.</p>
<p>The 2nd biggest altcoin held by Celsuis turned out to be Polygon (MATIC). It holds around $51.8 million worth of MATIC tokens. The token has already suffered a decline of more than 25% over the past 7 days. MATIC is trading at an average price of $0.57, at the press time with a market cap of around $5.3 billion. <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/category/news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read More Crypto News Here&#8230;</a></strong></p>

Immediately, the coin price continued its downward approach and showcased three consecutive red candles in the daily time frame chart. With sustained selling, the prices will retest the $0.51-$0.5 support and check whether the polygon coin is ready for a new recovery cycle or not.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A coin price may face high demand pressure at the $0.5 mark</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the MATIC is $562.5 Million, indicating a 28.5% gain.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 10th, the MATIC price showcased a long-tail rejection candle at $0.51-$0.5 support, projecting a rise in demand pressure for the discounted coin. After a minor bounce back, the price is likely to retest this support and confirm the active accumulation from buyers.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the coming days, if the price shows similar signs of rejection at $0.5, the buyers could trigger a new bullish reversal. However, the new relief rally would probably be limited to the overhead resistance trendline(Red) leading to a downtrend for the past four months.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a breakdown below the $0.5 support could push the prices back to $0.321 support.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Will MATIC Price Poke $1 Mark?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the ongoing bearish pressure in the market and the accumulation of sentiment at a discounted price, the MATIC price may witness high volatility in the coming days. Amid this anticipated consolidation, the traders must remain cautious for two technical levels which are $0.5 and the downsloping trendline. For MATIC to revisit $1 it needs a breakout above the overhead trendline</span></p>

<h2><b>Bakkt Takes a Stance</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As reported by Fortune, the Georgia, United States digital currency platform took the stand to delist the three digital currencies based on the regulatory uncertainty hovering around them. The company’s General Counsel Marc D&#8217;Annunzio </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/06/16/bakkt-delists-solana-polygon-cardano-regulatory-clarity/" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400">told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> Fortune it was taking action “until there is further clarity on how to compliantly offer a more extensive list of coins.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bakkt, unlike mainstream digital currency trading platforms, is known to support just a streamlined list of digital currencies and the firm delisted the duo of Algorand (ALGO) and Decentraland (MANA) a few months back after the SEC filed a lawsuit against Bittrex. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the crackdowns in the industry becoming more encompassing, Bakkt has chosen to stay on the side of caution and to effectively manage the small list of assets without controversy on its platform. At this time, Bakkt only supports the trading of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), USDC and Shiba Inu (SHIB) amongst others.</span></p>
<h2><b>Fast Growing Industry Trend</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The delisting of the marked digital currencies by the SEC is fast becoming a major trend, a situation that industry experts have expressed worry could shrink the liquidity of the tokens involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Robinhood was the first trading outfit to </span><a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-robinhood-becomes-first-exchange-to-delist-ada-matic-and-sol/"><span style="font-weight: 400">announce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> it will be delisting the three digital currencies from its platform. While unlike Bakkt, its move was not immediate as it gave users the leverage to trade the three affected tokens until the 27 of this month, its delisting cannot be deemed to be less hurtful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After Robinhood, eToro joined the trend as it emphasized that its US customers will no longer gain access to the three digital currencies until there is regulatory clarity around them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The current woes of Cardano, Solana and Polygon represent a related struggle XRP has had to </span><a href="https://coingape.com/coinbase-delists-xrp-trading-binance/"><span style="font-weight: 400">deal with</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> when the SEC tagged it a security when it charged Ripple Labs Inc in a $1.3 billion lawsuit back in December 2020. With the delisting expanding, industry analysts are keen on knowing which platform will be next to join the trend.</span></p>

The project, named <strong>Rosalind</strong> and conducted by the BOE and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), aimed to explore the practicality and potential benefits of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/">CBDC.</a></p>
<h2>Rosalind Project Findings</h2>
<p>The recently published report from the first phase of the experiment, released by the BIS, revealed that a CBDC could expedite and simplify person-to-person payments, enable the creation of innovative financial products, and reduce instances of fraud. It could also introduce the concept of &#8220;programmability&#8221; to money.</p>
<p><strong>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/indian-cbdc-pilot-expands-to-more-banks-and-locations/">India&#8217;s CBDC Pilot Project Update..</a></strong></p>
<p>These initial findings strengthen the BOE&#8217;s case for launching its own CBDC, informally referred to as &#8220;Britcoin.&#8221; While the BOE has indicated that a CBDC will likely be necessary in the future. The decision will proceed with the technology consultation closing at the end of June and requires the support of the UK Treasury.</p>
<p><strong>Read How <a href="https://coingape.com/web-stories/bank-of-england-doubtful-of-digital-pound/">BoE Was Doubtful Of CBDC In January..</a></strong></p>
<p>Addressing concerns that CBDCs could compromise individuals&#8217; privacy by providing central banks and governments with insight into their spending habits, Verdian argued that this was a misconception and that Project Rosalind demonstrated that privacy could be maintained.</p>
<h3>CBDC and Its Concerns</h3>
<p>Francesca Hopwood Road, head of the BIS Innovation Hub London Centre, expressed confidence that Rosalind could significantly influence the design of retail CBDC systems worldwide.</p>
<p>The Bank of England has faced criticism for pursuing a Digital Pound without fully explaining its advantages. Former BOE Governor Lord Mervyn King described it as a &#8220;solution without a problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before Project Rosalind, Verdian noted that discussions around digital currencies were primarily theoretical and policy-oriented. Although CBDCs have already been launched in other countries, many have encountered limited success. For example, the Bahamas Sand Dollar&#8217;s technology proved insufficiently resilient, resulting in frequent disruptions, and <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-nigeria-becomes-first-african-nation-to-launch-a-cbdc/">Nigeria&#8217;s CBDC</a> failed to gain traction due to a lack of perceived benefits.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this week, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bnb/#:~:text=About%20Binance%20Coin%20(BNB),at%20Coingape%20Crypto%20Price%20Page.">BNB price</a> witnessed a minor pullback in its ongoing downtrend and retested the breached trendline for potential resistance. A long-wick rejection candle formed at the flipped resistance indicates a shift in market sentiment toward continuing the downward trend.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the retest point of $253.5, the coin price plunged by 7.85% to reach the current price of $234 mark. With strong selling momentum, the sellers are likely to push the price another 6% to revisit the $220 mark</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $220 level is multi-month support and that could delay the potential fall and turn the BNB price sideways for a brief period. Consider a pessimistic scenario, a breakdown below $220 is more likely to plunge the price back to $200 psychological support.</span></p>
<h2><b>Will the Binance Coin Price Plunge to $200?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The symmetrical triangle pattern&#8217;s completion on a bearish note suggests a significant downfall for BNB&#8217;s price. The reject retest phase confirms the presence of supply pressure from selling, suggesting the price could plunge to $220, followed by $200. However, to maintain stability in this altcoin any further downfall from the aforementioned level is less likely to June</span></p>

The disclosure comes after years of speculation and scrutiny surrounding the assets backing Tether&#8217;s stablecoin.</p>
<h3>New York&#8217;s Attorney General shed light on Tether&#8217;s holdings</h3>
<p>In October 2021, a Bloomberg investigation uncovered evidence suggesting that Tether&#8217;s reserves included billions of dollars in short-term loans to Chinese companies and a substantial loan to the crypto platform Celsius Network. At the time, Tether denied any exposure to the debt of the crisis-hit China Evergrande Group but remained silent on its holdings of other Chinese securities.</p>
<p>According to the disclosed documents, Tether had holdings of securities issued by prominent state-owned Chinese companies, such as Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China Ltd., China Construction Bank Corp., and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. The maturity dates of these securities range from 2020 to 2021. Additionally, Tether&#8217;s holdings included securities issued by companies like Deutsche Bank AG, Barclays Bank Plc, and ArcelorMittal SA.</p>
<p>Tether&#8217;s banking relationships were outlined in the documents, showing accounts held at Deltec Bank &amp; Trust, Ansbacher (Bahamas) Limited, Capital Union Bank, and Far Eastern International Bank. The stablecoin issuer also held reserve assets in funds at Bradbury Investment and Metis Global Partners. Additionally, Tether had reserves in US dollars, Bitcoin held on Bitfinex (an affiliated crypto exchange), and over $2 billion worth of reserves in gold storage.</p>
<h3>Why this is Concerning?</h3>
<p>The documents also revealed Tether&#8217;s significant lending program, which involved issuing loans in USDT to third parties. As of March 31, 2021, the program reached $5.1 billion, with collateral in the form of digital assets or securities.</p>
<p>The quality of assets supporting USDT has long been a topic of concern due to the stablecoin&#8217;s crucial role in cryptocurrency markets. Traders rely on USDT, which has a circulation of approximately $83.5 billion, for liquidity and stability.</p>

<h2>Binance Under Investigation in France</h2>
<p>Binance France is suspected of having failed to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-money laundering</a> laws (AML). It is suspected that the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchange</a> has approached French customers outside the legal framework until 2022.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Investigation relates on the one hand to acts of illegal exercise of the function of service provider on digital assets (PSAN), and on the other hand, acts of aggravated money laundering, by participating in investment operations, concealment, conversion, the latter being carried out by perpetrators of offenses having generated profits.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>According to the Paris public prosecutor&#8217;s office, the investigation is conducted by the judicial investigation service of finance under the direction of the specialized interregional jurisdiction of Paris since February 2022, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2023/06/16/binance-principale-plate-forme-mondiale-d-echange-de-cryptomonnaies-visee-par-une-enquete-en-france_6177876_4408996.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> Le Monde.</p>
<p>The news comes after Binance announced that it is <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-dutch-netherland-us-sec-crypto-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quitting the Netherlands</a> after failing to secure registration. Binance also faced setbacks in Cyprus and <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-declared-illegal-by-nigeria-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nigeria</a>. The US SEC lawsuit against Binance led many regulators around the world to take action against Binance.</p>
<p>Binance, which has been offering its services in France since 2020, is alleged to have also offered its services illegally in the country until 2022 as it didn&#8217;t require all of its clients to complete KYC documents. Moreover, the exchange is also suspected to have breached French law regarding crypto-asset platforms. Since 2019, crypto firms in France are required to obtain a &#8220;digital asset service provider&#8221; license from the Financial Markets Authority.</p>

<h2>Binance Response to Investigation</h2>
<p><em>&#8220;In France, on-site inspections by regulators and inspectors are part of the regulatory obligations that all financial institutions must comply with. We had a site visit last week by the competent authorities. Binance, as always, has been fully collaborative and fully met obligations</em>,&#8221; <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/davidprincay/status/1669648319646253056" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explains</a> Binance France president David Princay.</p>
<p>Binance said it continues to work closely with regulators and law enforcement agencies on all compliance requirements and maintains high standards.</p>

Amidst this downturn, Ethereum&#8217;s price has recently reached a low of $1624.65, finding support at a long-established trendline. This dynamic support has played a crucial role in sustaining an uptrend for <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">ETH price</a> over the past seven months.

<h2><strong>Ethereum Price Daily Chart</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish reversal from the ascending trendline could replenish the bullish momentum in ETH</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 100-and-200-day EMA moving near $1775 and $1700 increases the resistance power of these levels.</span></li>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent Reversal and Buying Opportunity:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The falling Ethereum price has found reliable support at the ascending trendline of the daily chart. Historical data reveals that the price has rebounded from this support trendline on three occasions, suggesting active accumulation by buyers during dips.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 15th, the ETH price rebounded from the rising trendline, experiencing a 2.3% surge and reaching a current trading level of $1668. This reversal presents another opportunity for buyers to capitalize on the dip, with a suggested stop loss set at $1625. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should the coin price maintain sustainability above the trendline, buyers could gradually drive a recovery above the $2140 peak.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Can $ETH Price Revisit the $2140?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A retest of the long-established support trendline holds a high probability of reigniting a bullish momentum, leading to a new recovery phase. However, for traders seeking a safer entry point, waiting for a breakout above a significant resistance level is advisable. A potential breakout beyond the $1775 barrier would offer buyers additional confirmation of a bullish recovery, potentially driving the price toward the previous swing high of $2138.</span></p>

Traders can wait for a breakout above $1775 to gain a stronger edge in their decision-making process.</span></li>

<h2>Binance Lossing Its Ground?</h2>
<p>As per Binance, no new users living in the Netherlands will be accepted on the crypto exchange with an immediate effect. However, the existing Dutch users will be allowed to withdraw their assets from the platform from July 17, 2023, while no further purchases or trades will be permitted.</p>
<p>Binance<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1669628787267624961" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> mentioned</a> that it was involved in an extensive registration process in order to gain a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license with the regulator. The exchange even tried to explore different avenues to its foot in the country. Meanwhile, it wasn’t able to gain registration. <a href="https://coingape.com/category/news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More Binance News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>
<p>This development comes in when Binance is facing legal challenges from one of the top financial regulators, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The commission has charged Binance, Its US arm, and its executives with violating securities. However, the SEC looks to freeze the biggest crypto exchange’s US affiliate&#8217;s assets.</p>

However, Cyprus’s securities regulator’s website didn’t flag the actual reason behind the deregistering application.</p>
<p>However, the biggest crypto exchange suggests that it has already been compliant with the EU set standards of preventing money laundering and financing of terrorism. Binance has registered in other countries like France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Sweden and Lithuania.</p>

As a result of crypto worth billions frozen, Haru Invest and Delio investors are preparing to bring class action lawsuits against the crypto firms.</p>
<p>South Korea is one of the largest crypto markets, with crypto assets worth billion traded daily on several crypto platforms in the country.</p>
<h2>Investors of Haru Invest and Delio Prepares Class Action Lawsuits</h2>
<p>Crypto firm Haru Invest and Delio investors preparing for class-action lawsuits after they suddenly suspended customer deposits and withdrawals, as per a local media <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2023/06/816_353102.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> on June 16.</p>
<p>Over 400 investors of crypto earn platform Haru Invest and 150 investors of crypto lending platform Delio participated in a KakaoTalk group chat to prepare for lawsuits. Investors will probably sue the crypto platforms for charges including fraud through law firm LKB &amp; Partners.</p>
<p>Haru Invest and Delio offer earn services that allow users to earn yields by depositing their crypto assets on the platforms. Haru Invest and Delio offered maximum yields of 12 percent and 10 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Haru Invest suspended deposits and withdrawals, stating that its consignment operator B&amp;S Holdings provided false information. In addition, Haru Invest has filed a criminal lawsuit against B&amp;S Holdings.</p>
<p>It followed Delio to halt withdrawals due to market volatility amid Haru Invest&#8217;s suspension of deposits and withdrawals. Delio has reportedly deposited a certain amount of crypto assets in Haru Invest. The firm plans to hold an investors&#8217; meeting on Saturday as the situation turns serious.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I sincerely apologize to the investors who believed in us and used our service,&#8221; said Delio CEO Jung Sang-ho. &#8220;We will report our current situation to investors and discuss feasible ways to recoup investments.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

However, the report reveals a notable standout: <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/hbar/">Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR)</a>, which demonstrated remarkable revenue growth fueled by its Consensus Service.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Dominates Q1 Revenue</h2>
<p>During Q1, Ethereum proved its dominance once again, emerging as the clear leader in revenue generation among Layer 1 blockchains. Driven by its widespread adoption and high gas fees, Ethereum recorded an impressive revenue of $457 million. This figure was nearly 2.8 times higher than the combined revenue of all other featured Layer 1 chains.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-151952" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/16135914/messari.jpg" alt="" width="2142" height="1205" /></p>
<p>Ethereum remained the leader in most key financial and ecosystem metrics including market cap, revenue, DeFi TVL and volume, NFT volume, and full-time developers. Ethereum scored a 22 in DeFi Diversity, followed by Polygon (19), Solana (18), and BNB Chain (16).</p>
<h3>Hedera (HBAR) Growth In Q1&#8217;23</h3>
<p>While Ethereum dominated in terms of total revenue, the standout performer in Q1 was Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR). Hedera experienced an extraordinary revenue growth rate of <strong>489% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ)</strong>. This significant increase can be attributed to the adoption and utilization of Hedera&#8217;s Consensus Service</p>
<p>Hedera Hashgraph&#8217;s Consensus Service offers a unique approach to distributed consensus, enabling secure and scalable transactions. This service has gained traction among enterprises and developers seeking a robust and efficient blockchain solution.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-151953" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/16140158/herera.webp" alt="" width="3072" height="1728" /></p>
<p>Across featured networks, full-time developers (devs) decreased by 4% QoQ. Ethereum’s full-time dev count of 1,976 is almost equal to all other featured networks combined. Hedera’s full-time dev count increased the most of featured networks, growing 28% QoQ to 64.</p>
<h3>About Messari Report:</h3>
<p>The Messari report aggregates and compares the financial, network, and ecosystem analyses of the 14 Layer-1 (L1) smart-contract platforms including Avalanche, BNB Chain, Cardano, Ethereum, Harmony, Hedera, NEAR, Polkadot, Polygon, Solana, Stacks, Tezos, TRON, and WAX.</p>
<p>The key takeaways are:</p>
<ul class="jss15">
<li class="jss16"><strong>Ethereum remained the leader in most key financial and ecosystem metrics</strong> including market cap, revenue, DeFi TVL and volume, NFT volume, and full-time developers.</li>
<li class="jss16"><strong>USDC’s temporary depeg and Paxos ceasing BUSD issuance shifted stablecoin dominance toward USDT, benefitting TRON.</strong> TRON’s stablecoin market cap increased 30% QoQ to $43.6 billion; all other featured L1s with a significant stablecoin market cap saw theirs decrease QoQ.</li>
<li>The featured L1s experienced an average QoQ increase of 83% in market cap, but network usage decreased by around 2.5%.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1149" height="600" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/16130901/XRPUSD_2023-06-16_10-30-24.png" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="XRP price prediction" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" /><p>XRP price is up 1% in the last 24 hours and trading marginally above $0.46. A bullish wave has been traversing the market following the mid-week sell-off triggered by remarks made by the Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell when he announced a pause on interest rate hikes on Wednesday.</p>
<p>XRP token marketcap is nearly at $25 billion and in the last 24 hours seen a trading volume of over $1.1 billion rush in. This bullish outlook is not unique to XRP, as <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-and-crypto-enter-steep-correction-next-btc-price-stop-at-23500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin (BTC) is up 2.7% to trade at $25,505,</a> while the largest smart contracts token, Ether has gained 2%—and exchanging hands at $1,673 on Friday.</p>
<p>As we will see later,<a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-crash-xrp-ethereum-sell-off-market-bleeds-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> XRP price is not out of the woods yet</a>. Despite the bullish outlook, bulls are seemingly struggling to uphold the uptrend. And yet, they must reclaim resistance at $0.5 to wade off the bearish shackles and focus on the ultimate breakout to $1.</p>
<h2>XRP Price Sandwiched Between Two Moving Averages, What&#8217;s Next?</h2>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP price is trading at $0.46</a> but more noticeably, is its position between the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (in blue) support and resistance by the 50-day EMA (in red).</p>
<p>Recovery appears to have stalled, plausibly held back by a sell signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. Investors are not yet convinced that XRP is ready for the grand upswing to $1, especially with the <a href="https://coingape.com/ethereum-sees-sharp-selloff-as-it-got-embroiled-in-hinman-email-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuit Ripple is battling with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> still waiting for an imminent determination.</p>
<figure id="attachment_151925" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-151925" style="width: 1149px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/16130901/XRPUSD_2023-06-16_10-30-24.png"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-151925" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/16130901/XRPUSD_2023-06-16_10-30-24.png" alt="XRP price prediction" width="1149" height="600" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-151925" class="wp-caption-text">XRP/USD daily chart | Source <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/vUGZtRnT/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Tradingview</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Traders eyeing long positions in XRP may want to wait until the price breaks and hold above the 50-day EMA. A more conservative option would be to wait until <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/xrp-price-analysis-can-xrp-hold-0-486-support-as-market-fud-rises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP reclaims the $0.5 resistance</a>.</p>
<p>On the downside, short positions in XRP will not be viable until the price breaks and sustains movement below the 100-day EMA.</p>
<p>Additionally, market participants should keep in mind the potential support provided by the confluence formed by the 200-day EMA (purple) and the ascending trendline (dotted). If bears weaken this key support, we can expect XRP price to seek refuge at $0.43, not to mention the risk of sliding below $0.4.</p>
<h2>The Central Bank of Colombia Exploring Ripple’s CBDC Platform</h2>
<p>Ripple continues to cater to the needs of central banks open to delving into payment networks backed by central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). According to the latest announcement by Peersyst Technology, the Colombia central bank is ready to “evaluate potential efficiencies of a (payments) solution using the Ripple CBDC Platform”</p>
<p>The endeavor will feature input from the central bank, Ripple, Peersyst Technology (a software builder), and MinTIC.</p>

<p>To probe a bit further, the Central Bank is set to collaborate with The Ministry of Information and Communications Technologies (MinTIC) to pioneer use cases that will enhance the sophisticated payment infrastructure through the adept employment of the Ripple CBDC Platform.</p>
<p>This initiative will be significantly bolstered by the XRP Ledger &#8211; a fundamentally energy-efficient and open-source blockchain. All the parties have agreed to deliver the project by the end of 2023, which will then be handed over to the Directorate of Digital Government to oversee its operations.</p>

The court hearing on Thursday centered on whether digital assets created by Terraform Labs are securities under an &#8220;investment contract.&#8221;</p>
<h2>US Judge Decision To Dismiss SEC Lawsuit Against Terra Do Kwon In July</h2>
<p>Terraform Labs and co-founder Do Kwon&#8217;s lawyers and the US SEC lawyers filed responses to the motion to dismiss the lawsuit in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on June 15.</p>
<p>Dentons lawyers, representing Terraform Labs and co-founder Do Kwon, strongly claim algorithmic stablecoin UST (now USTC) is not a security as it was designed for practical purposes rather than an investment contract. They filed additional documents to support the motion to dismiss a lawsuit. It includes the US House Financial Services Committee <a href="https://coingape.com/us-house-to-bring-digital-asset-clarity-bill-for-sec-or-cftc-jurisdiction-in-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hearing on digital asset regulation</a> and stablecoin issuance, the SEC request for a restraining order against Binance.US, and Hinman emails in the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit.</p>
<p>Lawyers mention &#8220;regulatory gap&#8221; in whether crypto assets constitute securities as the US Congress discusses regulatory frameworks for the digital asset and stablecoin issuance. Moreover, the SEC is acting outside the boundaries of securities laws and the SEC internal emails on &#8220;investment contract&#8221; to find a security.</p>
<p>US SEC lawyers <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66820843/41/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-terraform-labs-pte-ltd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued</a> the additional documents filed by the defendants don&#8217;t support the motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Moreover, Binance.US transcript and internal SEC emails have no bearing on this case. They claim Howey Test clearly indicates what constitutes an “investment contract” and UST was a security.</p>
<p>Judge Jed Rakoff said he will rule on the motion to dismiss the case by July 14.</p>
<p>In April, a South Korean court ruled that Terra Classic (LUNC) is not a security and Terra crypto assets are not &#8220;investment contracts.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/just-in-terra-do-kwon-hires-top-law-firm-for-his-defense-in-us-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dentons represented Do Kwon earlier</a> to challenge the US SEC subpoena in its investigation of Mirror Protocol in 2021 and a class action lawsuit in the Singapore High Court in 2022. The law firm also represents Terra in other lawsuits. Terraform Labs and Do Kwon hired the world’s largest law firm Dentons to help deal with prosecution and investigation by US federal prosecutors.</p>

<h2>Do Kwon to Be Extradited to South Korea</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Montenegro High Court has approved the bail of Do Kwon and former CTO Han Chang-joon. However, both will remain behind bars as the High Court judge ordered them to be <a href="https://coingape.com/do-kwon-bail-approved-by-montenegro-high-court-extradition-to-south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extradited to South Korea</a>.</p>
<p>The High Court investigating judge at the request of South Korea ordered the extradition detention of Do Kwon and Han Chang-joon for six months.</p>
<p>The investigation of <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-founder-do-kwon-allegedly-have-political-ties-montenegro-prime-minister/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Do Kwon’s political ties</a> with Montengro&#8217;s former Finance Minister Milojko Spajic is also undergoing.</p>
