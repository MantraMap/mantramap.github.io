Benefits provided by the Degen Lounge website
<p>Security and Privacy</p>
<p>Being Web3-based, Degen Lounge poker provides players anonymity, and no programs need to be downloaded. That makes it fast and easy for users to get started playing quickly.</p>
<p>Also, it comes with privacy and security of personal data because no one can find out who you are, your location and IP address, or anything about you.</p>
<p>Deposits, withdraws, and faster transactions</p>
<p>If you want to pay with fiat currency using standard online payment methods, you may often lose several days until you receive your funds. This, for most people, creates a big problem, which cryptocurrencies have successfully solved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies allow payouts from instant to half an hour at the latest, which, compared to the slowness of fiat currencies, is the speed of light.</p>
<p>Low fees</p>
<p>Along with availability, there are also lower fees because, with cryptocurrencies, you don&rsquo;t need an intermediary. Degen Lounge poker charges only a 3% Rake, the lowest rake level of all online poker games. It&rsquo;s a game worth playing. After all, the transfer goes directly from the crypto site to you.</p>
<p>The platform also supports all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based networks such as ETH, BSC, Polygon, Celo, Harmony, xDAI, Fantom, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Aurora, and Cronos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Available everywhere</p>
<p>There are specific regulations and laws in poker that differ for each country. According to some new rules, they don't even allow you to attend the game, so many players have decided to bypass the laws and switch to a safer, faster, and much better option, which is crypto poker.</p>
