			            <description><![CDATA[The new blockchain policy aligns with Nigeria's digital transformation agenda. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nigeria&#8217;s Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy (FMCDE) has approved the National Blockchain Policy as the country doubles down on creating a blockchain-powered economy.</p>
<p>The adoption of the policy by the government will pave the way for the formal utilization of the technology in the country, which has seen significant crypto adoption in recent years. The FMCDE believes its implementation will have a positive effect on both the public and private sectors in Nigeria.</p>
<h2>Blockchain Adoption</h2>
<p>The latest push towards blockchain has also been prompted by Nigeria&#8217;s efforts to move away from its heavy economic reliance on the oil and gas sector and instead allow the economy to &#8220;leapfrog&#8221; into one driven by digital technologies.</p>
<p>As such, the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy developed the National Blockchain Policy to diversify the economy on behalf of the federal government. This is in line with the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS), which was unveiled by President Muhammadu Buhari in November 2019.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the first draft of the policy <a href="https://nitda.gov.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DRAFT-NATIONAL-BLOCKCHAIN-ADOPTION-STRATEGY.pdf?ref=benjamindada.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">released</a> in October 2020 outlined the strategy and stated that it aligns with the 8 pillars of the &#8216;DIGITAL NIGERIA&#8217; Roadmap of the FMCDE. They focus on &#8211; Developmental Regulation, Digital Literacy &amp; Skills, Solid Infrastructure, Service Infrastructure, Digital Services Development &amp; Promotion, Soft Infrastructure, Digital Society &amp; Emerging technologies, and finally, Indigenous Content Development and Adoption.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The vision of the Policy is to create a Blockchain-powered economy that supports secure transactions, data sharing, and value exchange between people, businesses, and Government, thereby enhancing innovation, trust, growth, and prosperity for all. The implementation of the National Blockchain Policy will have a positive effect on both the public and private sectors of the country.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) will be tasked with coordinating the policy initiatives under the oversight of the FMCDE. The authorities have also set up a multisectoral steering committee to monitor policy implementation.</p>
<p>The Federal Executive Council, on the other hand, directed relevant regulatory bodies &#8211;  NITDA, Nigeria&#8217;s Central Bank, the National Universities Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Nigerian Communications Commission to develop regulatory structures for blockchain implementation across various sectors of the economy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nigeria&#8217;s SEC plans to support tokenization, with the main focus being real-world assets such as equities, bonds, and real estate. Cryptocurrency, however, is not on the roadmap.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the country <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/why-bitcoin-nigeria-faces-violent-protests-amid-cash-scarcity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">witnessed</a> a cash shortage that led to violent protests, leaving countless citizens injured and a few dead. Nigerians have flocked to cryptocurrencies to hedge against current inflation and dodge the various limitations on naira transactions in online payments. The African country was <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/sub-saharan-africa-cryptocurrency-geography-report-2022-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">ranked</a> 11th on the Chainalysis 2022 Global Crypto Adoption Index and 17th for peer-to-peer exchange trade volume.</p>
<h2>Blockchain Tech Adoption Trajectory</h2>
<p>PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) recently published a <a href="https://cloud.email.pwc.com/blockchain-report-transform-business-economy-download-now.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">report</a> extensively analyzing blockchain technology. It observed that blockchain, which happens to be one of the &#8220;world&#8217;s fastest developing technologies,&#8221; could boost the global economy with $1.76 trillion by 2030.</p>
<p>The economists at the finance giant expect the majority of businesses to be leveraging blockchain by 2025. By 2025, blockchain&#8217;s GDP is estimated to reach $422 billion.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Crypto markets are breathing a sigh of relief after the Federal Reserve officially pushed its target rate above 5% on Wednesday.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Santiment – a crypto markets intelligence platform – has a bullish outlook on Bitcoin after the Federal Reserve increased its benchmark interest rate by another 25 basis points on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a follow-up blog post, the firm claimed that the top crypto is showing “some promising rise potential” – particularly as its correlation to equities continues to weaken. </span></p>
<h2>What’s Next for Bitcoin?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In its latest </span><a href="https://insights.santiment.net/read/pump-time-after-fed-leaves-the-room-7295?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=twitter_pump_time_after_fed_insight_b_050323/&amp;fpr=twitter" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">insight report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the company said that the market’s initial reaction to the rate decision was one of relief – glad that the </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/fed-announces-25bps-rate-hike-to-5-bitcoin-remains-flat/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">expected hike</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> was “over with,” until the next decision scheduled for June. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some positive signs include Bitcoin surging a modest 2% since Wednesday’s FOMC announcement, and increased trading volume across top market cap assets. Those top assets also lack “any extreme shorts across the board” – not even on Binance Coin, which has been shorted throughout the past month after the exchange was </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cz-addresses-the-cftc-in-house-trading-allegations/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">sued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by US regulators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, Wednesday registered the highest Bitcoin address trading activity in two weeks, with active addresses pushing higher immediately after the rate hike.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This was the highest address activity day in two weeks, and the one from two weeks ago was mainly credited due to a major price drop that traders were reacting to,” explained Santiment. “This rally seemed to be much more related to the rate hike finally being official, and you can see how active addresses pushed even higher directly after the announcement.”</span></p></blockquote>
<h2>Bitcoin, Equities, and Gold</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the Federal Reserve’s target rate now floats at a relatively high 5% &#8211; 5.25%, this may not be such an issue as Bitcoin’s correlation to equities – which are highly responsive to central bank activity – continues to fade. As noted by Santiment, Bitcoin’s modest reaction on Wednesday stood in sharp contrast to its moves following similar rate hikes throughout 2022, which drove Bitcoin and equities alike to multi-year lows. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s important to assess how speculation revolving around how today&#8217;s Fed decision would go may have overshadowed the actual impact of the Fed&#8217;s predictable decision,” added Santiment. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in May, Bitcoin’s correlation to equities has plummeted, while its correlation to gold has simultaneously surged. Both Bitcoin and gold have frequently been </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/heres-why-kiyosaki-wants-to-buy-more-bitcoin-gold-and-silver/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">compared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> as non-sovereign, safe-haven assets that are immune to fiat currency debasement and shielded from the woes of the modern banking system. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Another State opposes the use and testing of CBDCs after Florida. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">North Carolina’s House of Representatives unanimously voted in favor of a bill banning the acceptance of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) by government entities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The legislation follows a wave of vocal opposition to CBDCs from the Republican party, alongside some critics from the Democrat side. </span></p>
<h2>North Carolina Rejects CBDCs</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The <a href="https://lrs.sog.unc.edu/bill/no-centrl-bank-digital-currency-pmts-state-new" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">vote</a> on May 3 saw 118 House members agreeing to pass House Bill 690, while just two members abstained from the vote, and none voted against it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alongside the acceptance ban, the bill would also prohibit the state from participating in Federal Reserve branch testing of a potential CBDC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bill was initially proposed to the House in April titled “AN ACT TO PROHIBIT PAYMENTS IN CRYPTOCURRENCY TO THE STATE,” but was modified on May 2 to substitute the word “cryptocurrency” with “central bank digital currency.” The latter is defined as “a digital currency, a digital medium of exchange, or a digital monetary unit of account issued by the US Federal Reserve System or a federal agency that is made directly available to a consumer by such entities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After three readings in the House and a successful pass, the legislation now must pass through the Senate, and then through Governor Roy Cooper before it can be signed into law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">North Carolina isn’t the first to oppose CBDCs: Florida governor </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/no-cbdc-in-florida-says-governor-ron-desantis/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ron DeSantis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> called on the state legislature to ban CBDC use as money within Florida’s uniform commercial code last March. At the time, he blasted CBDCs for providing the government “with a direct view over all consumer activities,” which could be used to “cut off access to goods and services” like China’s digital yuan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Republican congress members including </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/republican-congressman-tom-emmer-introduces-bill-to-ban-feds-cbdc/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">Tom Emmer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and Ted Cruz have also tried introducing federal legislation banning the implementation of CBDCs by the central bank, blasting them as an invasion of privacy. Former and current Democratic presidential candidates – </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cbdcs-are-aimed-at-tracking-purchases-and-controlling-our-money-us-congresswoman/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">Tulsi Gabbard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/democratic-presidential-candidate-blames-war-on-crypto-for-recent-bank-failures/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">Robert Kennedy Jr</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> respectively – have made claims to a similar effect within the past month.</span></p>
<h2>Banning Bitcoin Mining</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">North Carolina’s Buncombe County Board of Commissioners also approved a one-year moratorium on Bitcoin mining Tuesday, over concerns about noise and pollution such facilities create. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Democrat politicians have frequently opposed Bitcoin mining for its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. The Biden White House published a </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/biden-administration-pushes-congress-to-pass-30-tax-on-bitcoin-mining/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> this week calling on Congress to pass a 30% tax on the Bitcoin mining industry to make it pay for its ‘societal harms’. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin's trajectory has been constricted in a narrowing wedge since mid-April. But an upside break could be in the offing.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to data from the crypto financial service platform Matrixport, the narrowing wedge that has been in formation for the past three weeks is about to break to the upside. Such a trend could project a move higher by an equal amount to the range at which the triangle started to form.</p>
<p>A breakout could lead to a 6,100-point move higher in the price of Bitcoin, which establishes a target of $35,000-$36,000. Such an uptrend would represent nearly 20% gains from the current price.</p>
<ul>
<li>Matrixport&#8217;s research <a href="https://twitter.com/realMatrixport/status/1654020799018446848" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">highlighted</a> the Fed raising interest rates by another 25bps, which is believed to be the last hike for this cycle. This could potentially set up the crypto market for another strong rally.</li>
<li>Simultaneously, the banking sector has been hit by a number of failures that require liquidity injections and government guarantees for any acquiring party. Many <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-could-prosper-amid-the-us-banking-crisis-financial-advisor-bernstein-urges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">experts</a> believe Bitcoin could prosper amid the ongoing banking crisis in the United States.</li>
<li>Moreover, in the recent earnings season for companies in the country, stock buybacks appeared to be resuming. In fact, the buybacks are expected to hit $1 trillion this year. This trend could prove beneficial for not just stocks but also risk assets such as crypto.</li>
<li>Despite <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-reclaims-29k-after-feds-latest-interest-rate-hike-market-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">reclaiming</a> $29k, Bitcoin&#8217;s trading volume has been on a decline. However, the report also noted that &#8220;the path higher sees only limited resistance.&#8221;</li>
<li>Another important factor that suggests an uptrend is the transactions on the Bitcoin network that reached a record high. The number of active addresses on the network has also remained strong, near 1 million addresses.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[The PEPE hype seems nowhere near its end, with the asset spiking nearly 90% in the past 24 hours.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Pepe Coin (PEPE), a memecoin launched in mid-April, has quickly emerged as one of the sensations in the cryptocurrency industry. Its price has skyrocketed by a staggering 638% for the past week, whereas the gains for the past 24 hours alone reached 90%. The asset&#8217;s market capitalization has also skyrocketed to almost $700 million.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some possible reasons behind the substantial rise could be the overall positive condition of the market following the Fed&#8217;s latest interest rate hike or the fact that whales have exchanged assets for PEPE. Last but not least, the popular rapper Soulja Boy also interacted with the memecoin on Twitter.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Market Turned Green</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For starters, the impressive price increase of PEPE could be partially driven by the current positive condition of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin and most of the altcoins headed north shortly after the Federal Reserve </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/fed-announces-25bps-rate-hike-to-5-bitcoin-remains-flat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">announced</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> another increase in interest rates by 25 basis points.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While the policy has caused price swings in the opposite way on previous occasions, it was somewhat different this time, as many economists expect this to be the final rate hike due to fears of an upcoming recession. Gregory Daco &#8211; Chief Economist at EY-Parthenon &#8211; </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65474456" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">said</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the inflation battle is over, but we are in a situation where we&#8217;re seeing gradual disinflation, and we&#8217;re also in an environment where interest rates are high and elevated and therefore should be a constraining business activity, which should lead to further disinflation in coming months.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Still, PEPE&#8217;s gains for the past 24 hours are much more significant than those marked by BTC, ETH, BNB, and other larger-cap digital currencies, meaning more factors could be behind the price surge.</span></p>

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Whales&#8217; Activity</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The rapid price increase of the now-trending token seems to have caught the eye of some crypto whales. According to the blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, one such holder <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1654061347813076993" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">swapped</a> almost all his assets for PEPE. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Specifically, he exchanged $590,000 worth of WBTC, $90,000 worth of CULT, $235,000 worth of UNI, and $37,000 worth of ETH to get 1.72T PEPE. The platform claimed the investor had made a paper profit of well over $1 million.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Other whales have used the surge to lock in substantial profits at the beginning of the week.

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Interaction From Celebrities</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">PEPE&#8217;s popularity reached such highs that even celebrities joined its ecosystem. One example is the well-known American rapper DeAndre Cortez Way (better known as Soulja Boy). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The author of the single &#8220;Crank That&#8221; </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/souljaboy/status/1653971555456815104" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">revealed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in his most recent tweet that he &#8220;done got rich off PEPE.&#8221; However, he did not specify his precise actions or how much he had profited indeed.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The musician is not a newbie in the world of crypto. He released a song dedicated to Bitcoin in 2018, while in 2021, he </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/souljaboy/status/1352677013077647362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1352677013077647362%7Ctwgr%5E2bca3a917dc15eaaddd96ac8480bb215f92ceac6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F55144%2Fhere-are-the-cryptocurrencies-in-soulja-boys-portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">said</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> he owns BNB, TRX, DGB, and other tokens.

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Overall Mania and FOMO</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The hype generated around PEPE could be another factor that attracts new investors and boosts its price. It is a well-known fact that people tend to follow growing trends and feel inclined to enter a project that has gained mass attention. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">That term has a name: Fear of Missing Out (FOMO), and it occurs often in the crypto sector. It has been connected with other memecoins in the past years, such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which, similar to PEPE, charted colossal price spikes at some point. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Even though the memecoin might sound like an asset that could make people rich overnight, it is worth noting that there are certain challenges for inexperienced investors, such as security risks and enhanced market volatility.

			            <description><![CDATA[The feature enables Injective-based dApps to access available prices on-chain whenever needed.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Injective &#8211; a layer 1 blockchain &#8211; announced the integration of Pyth with the Injective mainnet. The move should allow decentralized applications (dApps) to access any of Pyth’s on-chain data for hundreds of markets covering equities, commodities, and foreign exchange pairs, in addition to crypto.</p>
<p>According to a press release shared with <em>CryptoPotato, </em>Injective revealed that the integration is a first for the Cosmos IBC ecosystem positioning Injective as the first IBC-enabled chain to aggregate Pyth data via Wormhole.</p>
<h2>Injective Pyth Integration</h2>
<p>The testnet phase by Helix has already utilized the Pyth integration, which enabled the Injective-based exchange hub to list several novel real-world assets (RWA) markets on-chain for the first time, such as gold, Yen, and Euro. As a result, Helix processed more than $9 billion in volume to date &#8211; the highest in the entire Cosmos derivatives market.</p>
<p>Injective Labs co-founder and CEO Eric Chen commented,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are thrilled to have Pyth bring novel asset data into the Injective universe,” said Eric Chen, co-founder, and CEO of Injective Labs. “Now developers create markets with high fidelity on-chain data, bringing forth a new paradigm of cross-chain data composability.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Facilitating dApps built on the network to access real-world asset data is expected to be hugely impactful within DeFi as the industry continues to evolve, the exec said in a statement to <em>CryptoPotato</em>. Chen further highlighted the importance of merging traditional finance with decentralized finance and added that the latest move &#8220;is a step towards creating a thriving environment for the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pyth is essentially a first-party financial oracle network that is tasked with publishing continuous real-world data on-chain, introducing an innovative low-latency pull oracle design. Binance, CBOE, Jane Street, Hudson River Trading, DRW Cumberland, and Virtu Financial, are some of the prominent data publishers to Pyth.</p>
<h2>Injective So Far</h2>
<p>Since launching its mainnet in 2021, the total value locked in Injective Protocol has surged to $20.53 million. The Cosmos-based network <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/injective-unveils-first-ever-solana-rollup-for-cosmos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">released</a> a layer-2 testnet that utilizes Solana&#8217;s Sea Level Virtual Machine (SVM), enabling developers to port Solana Web3 apps to the Cosmos ecosystem in March.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the platform also <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/pantera-kraken-and-others-join-consortium-for-injective-labs-150m-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> a $150 million ecosystem initiative to boost the adoption of interoperable infrastructure and DeFi amidst a struggling market. The consortium was joined by several prominent Web3 players, including Pantera Capital, Kraken Ventures, Jump Crypto, Kucoin Ventures, Delphi Labs, Flow Traders, Gate Labs, and IDG Capital, among others.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Mahe, Seychelles, May 4th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bitmex.com/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">BitMEX</a>, a leading cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, today announced the listing of two new perpetual contracts, PEPE and SUI. BitMEX is proud to be the first derivatives exchange to list SUI Perpetuals Contracts and the second to list PEPE Perpetuals Contracts.</p>
<p>The recent meteoric rise of PEPE has raised concerns about liquidity for its holders. The token&#8217;s market capitalization surged to $137 million in less than a week.</p>
<p>However, due to its rapid ascent, selling large positions could significantly negatively impact the token&#8217;s price. By offering PEPE Perpetual Contracts, BitMEX allows traders to gain exposure to the token without the fear of illiquid markets.</p>
<p>A BitMEX spokesperson commented on the listing as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>“PEPE needs a Perp! Perpetual Contracts are the most traded product in crypto and offer all investors taking a long or short position on tokens with better liquidity and fewer network risks. At BitMEX, we offer Tether-margined and Bitcoin-margined perpetual contracts. We are proud to be the inventor of the Perpetual Swap and have long been a leading trading venue for crypto derivatives, offering uncompromised security, a reliable platform, and deep liquidity &#8211; as professional traders deserve.”</p></blockquote>
<p>BitMEX traders can now long or short PEPE via two listings &#8211; PEPEUSD and PEPEUSDT. Both listings were launched on May 3, 2023, at 04:00 UTC with up to 50x leverage.</p>
<p>Same is true for SUI Token which is available as a Bitcoin-margined perp SUIUSD and Tether-margined SUIUSDT perp. Both contracts started trading on 3 May 2023 at 12:11 UTC and offer up to 50x leverage.</p>
<p>In addition to the PEPE listings, BitMEX is excited to introduce the SUI Perpetual Contract, further expanding the range of trading options available to its users.</p>
<p>By trading PEPE and SUI listings on BitMEX, users can enjoy up to 50x leverage and one of the highest max position sizes in the industry, providing a dynamic and versatile trading experience for novice and seasoned traders.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Court documents filed on May 3 reveal FTX is attempting to claw back funds in the form of repaid loans, withdrawn liquidity, and collateral from fellow bankrupt platform Genesis.</p>
<p>The total sum at stake amounts adds up to over $3.88 billion across all entities affiliated with Genesis.</p>
<h2>Accused of Enabling FTX’s Misconduct</h2>
<p>In the documents <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/genesis/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTQ5Njk4OQ==&amp;id2=-1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">filed</a> by FTX’s lawyers in court on May 3, it is claimed that Genesis was one of the main culprits allowing the FTX Group to get away with their downright rash behavior. The bankrupt exchange&#8217;s legal team further attempts to legitimize their motion by claiming that, unlike other FTX creditors, Genesis was largely repaid.</p>
<p>Genesis was one of the main feeder funds for FTX and instrumental to its fraudulent business model. At one point in 2021, Genesis Global Capital (GGC) had over $8 billion of outstanding loans to FTX Debtor Alameda Research Ltd. Unlike other FTX creditors and customers, Genesis was repaid to a large extent.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The FTX Debtors’ Avoidance Claims against Genesis relating to certain of those repayments represent significant avoidance actions in the FTX Chapter 11 Cases.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Considering that the whole point of a bankruptcy case is to make creditors whole again, this would seem rather counterintuitive.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, $.188 billion of the attempted clawback represent loans repaid to Genesis by the FTX Group, a similar “strategy” to the one used in another lawsuit <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/alameda-sues-voyager-in-attempt-to-recoup-loan-repayments/" data-wpel-link="internal">filed</a> by the FTX Group against yet another bankrupt crypto platform, Voyager. A further $273 million attempt represents the pledge of collateral by Alameda to Genesis, which was apparently used for the purpose that collateral is supposed to serve, by definition.</p>
<h2>Withdrawn Assets at Stake too</h2>
<p>However, the most brazen part of the clawback attempt is the request to have returned funds that were already withdrawn by Genesis.</p>
<p>As stated in the FTX Group’s request, over $1.8 billion in Genesis liquidity were withdrawn from FTX platforms. To put it plainly, FTX wants Genesis’ money back.</p>
<p>Of this claim, $1.6 billion in assets belonged to Genesis itself, and a further $213 million belonged to GGC International, a Genesis-affiliated business that is even classified as a non-debtor in the case, which makes the attempt even more shocking.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the real issue with this second attempt is not simply the FTX Group’s pistols-at-dawn approach towards anyone who had previously engaged in business with it, wrongly assuming that they had done their due diligence.</p>
<p>The real problem with this second attempt is that it creates a legal precedent if the motion actually passes. Even if it is denied, other crypto platforms in similar situations may feel justified to make identical attempts now that the Rubicon has been crossed.</p>
