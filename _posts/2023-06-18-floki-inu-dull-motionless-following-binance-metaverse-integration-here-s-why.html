Binance, the global crypto exchange renowned for its vast scale and influence, has taken a step towards promoting the widespread acceptance and usage of Floki Inu, the popular memecoin that has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts worldwide. Embarking on a strategic initiative, Binance has ingeniously incorporated Floki Inu into two exceptional categories within its expansive ecosystem, namely the Metaverse and Gaming sections. With this development, Binance has effectively opened up new avenues for the crypto named after billionaire Elon Musk&#8217;s dog, propelling its growth trajectory and solidifying its position as a prominent player in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. #Binance has added $FLOKI to the #Metaverse and #Gaming categories on its exchange! ðŸ”¥ This is a big deal and allows millions of users to trade #Floki alongside top metaverse and gaming cryptocurrencies like $SAND, $MANA, $AXS, $IMX, $GALA, and $ENJ.#Floki adoption continues! pic.twitter.com/UKIssfoOih â€” FLOKI (@RealFlokiInu) June 16, 2023 The Floki Inu team may have hoped that news of Binance&#8217;s decision to add the meme to the Metaverse area would increase the value of their coin, but this was not the case today. Floki Inu Price Wasn&#8217;t Feeling It At the time of writing, FLOKI price was nearly unchanged, managing to notch a meager 1.4% increase in the last 24 hours, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows. In the last seven days, the meme coin was only able to maintain a less than 5% gain.

Bitci, a leading cryptocurrency exchange in Turkey with more than 5 million customers, has added support for the token. The meme coin&#8217;s recent tweet, stating its plans to develop a crypto educationÂ platform, also caused a stir in the crypto community. The University Of Floki is an online resource designed to meet the needs of the estimated 1Â billion cryptocurrency users worldwide by 2025. As of today, the market cap of cryptocurrencies stood at $1.03 trillion.

By also realizing Floki Inu&#8217;s potential in the gaming industry, Binance has created a link between the cryptocurrency industry and the ever-evolving world of digital entertainment.
