<p><strong>From CPU to ASIC</strong></p>
<p>In Satoshi Nakamoto&#x2019;s initial vision, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> mining could be performed using CPUs installed on PCs. During its infancy, Bitcoin remained obscure and offered no value.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x2019;t until 2010 when Bitcoin enthusiast Laszlo Hanyecz argued that GPUs could perform more computations per second than CPUs and tried to use GPUs for mining, and he was correct. After Hanyecz shared his GPU mining code with the community, Bitcoin saw its first hashrate surge by 20,000 times, from 6 MH/s in January 2010 to 120 GH/s in December 2010.</p>

<p>What&#x2019;s interesting is that Hanyecz, who introduced GPU mining, was also the one who started Bitcoin Pizza Day. Hanyecz earned plenty of bitcoins through the GPU mining approach he invented and spared no efforts to promote the crypto. For instance, the guy bought two pizzas with 10,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, giving real value to the new currency for the first time.</p>
<p>The appearance of GPU mining and the surging <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> price led to a mining arms race, and miners were constantly seeking new ways to improve their hashrate. In 2011, someone shared the code of FPGA mining machines on GitHub, which started a new era dominated by specialized mining rigs. In 2011, the Bitcoin hashrate rose from 116 GH/s at the beginning of the year to nearly 30 TH/s at the end of the year, a nearly 300X growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/picture31.png?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20230516%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230516T100950Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=600&X-Amz-Signature=62b356365a3f33fda41ecb46536cda3b109373624ba8a1369ed7b97b2cb4ba59"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-588037" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/picture31.png" alt="" width="554" height="145" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/picture31-300x79.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/picture31.png 554w" sizes="(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px"></a></p>
<p>2012 saw the birth of ASIC mining machines, which are superior models, and the Bitcoin hashrate skyrocketed from 20 TH/s to 12 PH/s, an increase of 600 times. Since then, ASIC models have replaced CPUs, GPUs, and FPGA machines as the mainstream <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> mining machine.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/picture41.png?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20230516%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230516T101106Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=600&X-Amz-Signature=34af4b601acae68eb6dc798f9993d90fa4527f1334c079a73fa1e328f6239b6b"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-588038" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/picture41.png" alt="" width="554" height="145" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/picture41-300x79.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/picture41.png 554w" sizes="(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px"></a></p>
<p><strong>From Solo Mining to Pool Mining</strong></p>
<p>The growing hashrate raised new concerns &#x2014; Is bitcoin mining still profitable as more and more miners join the business? Upon realizing the limitations of solo mining, Czech programmer Marek Palatinus found a solution: unite <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> miners, pool the resources, and share the profits. In 2010, Marek started slushpool, the world&#x2019;s first mining pool. Since then, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> mining has gradually transitioned from solo mining to pool mining.</p>
<p>Although mining pools gather a large number of miners, miners are not always tied to one pool, which has led to the sudden rise and fall of many pools. For instance, in 2013, GHash.IO attracted plenty of miners with its zero-fee policy. By 2014, the pool&#x2019;s peak hashrate had even surpassed 51%, raising concerns in the Bitcoin community. However, this giant pool eventually shut down in 2016 due to repeated large-scale DoS attacks.</p>
<p>Clearly, mining pools demand strong technical capacity. In the early days, many pools underestimated the technical requirements of the industry. As a result, they suffered attacks and eventually shut down, just like GHash.IO.</p>
<p>Having realized the immature technologies and products in the pool industry, Haipo Yang, an early Bitcoin builder, decided to build a stabler and more efficient pool to empower <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> mining, a key channel for maintaining the normal operations of the network. In just two months, he independently completed the coding of ViaBTC Pool, which officially went live on June 5, 2016.</p>
<p><strong>ViaBTC Riding the Waves</strong></p>
<p>Born in a time of fierce competition, ViaBTC has remained a top player in terms of hashrate, thanks to its stable technologies, innovative products, and satisfying user experiences.</p>
<p>Shortly after its launch, ViaBTC invented the PPS+ payment method based on the conventional PPS and PPLNS methods. This new approach guarantees stable mining revenue while sharing miner fees, allowing ViaBTC miners to earn more coins than their peers in other pools. Later on, mainstream pools started to embrace the PPS+ payment method. ViaBTC&#x2019;s invention of PPS+ has catalyzed changes in industry rules and brought higher and stabler mining revenue to miners.</p>
<p>At ViaBTC, technology is always a priority. For instance, the pool optimized the broadcasting and transmitting process of the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> network through its independently developed <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> client. Thanks to its high-speed block updating networks distributed around the world, miners can discover and broadcast new blocks more quickly. Furthermore, these efforts have lowered the orphan rate, ensured stable mining revenue, and improved the operating efficiency of the network. To date, ViaBTC remains the mining pool with the lowest orphan rate.</p>
<p>Over the years, ViaBTC has also introduced a wide range of functions and tools, including the Transaction Accelerator, Auto Conversion, Smart Mining, Hedging Service, Crypto Loans, Hashrate Fluctuation Notification, Revenue Sharing, and Referral Commission, to provide users with faster, stabler, and more lucrative mining and derivative services.</p>
<p>Looking back at the past seven years, ViaBTC has seen the ups and downs of crypto mining. GHash.IO is just one of many pools brought down by network attacks. Moreover, there are also pools hurt by disrupted cash flows, as well as pools abandoned by miners due to unstable block output. ViaBTC, on the other hand, has remained committed to products and technology, with a focus on users. These efforts have paid off as it becomes one of the few crypto companies to celebrate its seventh anniversary.</p>
<p>ViaBTC now provides mining services for more than one million users in over 130 countries and regions, covering 10+ cryptos that include <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>. Moreover, the pool is a top player in terms of the mining hashrate of cryptos including <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>, with multi-billion dollar worth of cumulative mining output.</p>
<p>Going forward, ViaBTC will continue to provide professional, efficient, secure, and stable crypto mining services for miners, while developing comprehensive, reliable, secure, and satisfying crypto products through dedicated efforts. At the same time, ViaBTC will drive the progress of the mining industry to witness the new blockchain future together with its users.</p>

<h2>Indonesia Establishes New National Payment System</h2>
<p>Indonesia will introduce a new national payment system that will replace Visa and Mastercard in state-owned institutions and companies, according to Dicky Kartikoyono, Bank Indonesia&#8217;s Head of Strategic Management and Governance Department. The central bank official was quoted by CNBC as saying Monday:</p>
<blockquote><p>In accordance with the president&#8217;s plan, the transition to our national payment system is proceeding smoothly. We expect that very soon it will become widespread, including within state-owned enterprises.</p></blockquote>
<p>The central banker explained that Indonesia’s decision to create its own payment system is “very timely,&#8221; emphasizing that Southeast Asian countries should establish &#8220;a safety cushion that will protect businesses and ordinary citizens&#8221; from increasing financial uncertainty in the West.</p>
<p>In March, Indonesian President Joko Widodo urged regional authorities to use credit cards developed by local banks instead of global financial conglomerates as a measure to shield transactions against any &#8220;possible geopolitical consequences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dodit Proboyakti, a board member of the Indonesian Credit Cards Association, told Sputnik publication that Indonesia will apply what it learns from Russia&#8217;s experiences with its Mir payment system to its own payment system. The Russian government-backed Mir payment system gained much popularity after Western nations imposed heavy sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Bank Indonesia Governor Perry Warjiyo recently said that Indonesia is following the BRICS economic bloc’s de-dollarization <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indonesia-is-following-brics-de-dollarization-lead-says-central-bank-governor/">lead</a> by diversifying its currency usage through the implementation of the local currency system. He noted that Indonesia has also made agreements with several nations to use local currencies in trade, including Thailand, Malaysia, China, and Japan.</p>
<p>Besides Indonesia, nine other Southeast Asian countries (Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) recently agreed to “encourage the use of local currencies for economic and financial transactions.” The 10 countries are members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the BRICS leaders plan to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-leaders-set-to-discuss-common-currency-to-challenge-us-dollar-dominance-in-upcoming-summit/">discuss</a> a common currency at their upcoming leaders&#8217; summit. The BRICS nations comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Many people believe that a BRICS currency will <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currency-will-erode-us-dollars-dominance-former-white-house-economist-warns/">erode</a> the U.S. dollar&#8217;s dominance.</p>

<h2>Interest in BRICS Membership Rises</h2>
<p>South Africa&#8217;s Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Naledi Pandor has revealed that the BRICS nations are working on guidelines to cater to the rising interest of countries wanting to join the economic bloc. The BRICS nations comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. This year, the BRICS presidency is held by South Africa.</p>
<p>Addressing the South African line ministry on “Strengthening Partnerships for a Fairer and More Equitable Global System,” Pandor was quoted by Telesur as saying Monday:</p>
<blockquote><p>BRICS is attracting a lot of interest from a number of countries, and our sherpas are working on the concept of how the group can respond to this interest. We hope that our leaders will present final guidelines at the conclusion of the BRICS summit.</p></blockquote>
<p>The BRICS countries have been making efforts to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-push-to-expand-global-influence-to-counter-the-wests-destructive-actions/">expand</a> the group&#8217;s global influence. In April, Anil Sooklal, South Africa’s ambassador to the BRICS group, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-getting-applications-to-join-every-day-attracts-19-requests-before-summit/">revealed</a> that the economic bloc is &#8220;getting applications to join every day.&#8221; He stated at the time that 13 countries have already formally asked to join and another six have asked informally. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/saudi-arabia-joining-brics-would-accelerate-chinese-yuans-use-as-trading-currency-says-professor/">Saudi Arabia</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iran-seeks-brics-membership-to-counter-western-hegemony-promote-multipolar-world-says-president-raisi/">Iran</a> are among the countries that have expressed interest in joining.</p>
<p>Pandor further highlighted the importance of fostering global cooperation by establishing influential alliances that collaborate with the United Nations to drive an inclusive and forward-looking international development agenda. She noted that the BRICS group has the potential to fulfill this transformative role.</p>

<p>According to the South African foreign affairs minister:</p>
<blockquote><p>The growing interest in the alliance shows that many countries are looking for a multipolar forum that is modern, inclusive, and focused on the common good.</p></blockquote>
<p>She also shared that South Africa&#8217;s &#8220;partnership with BRICS has resulted in tangible benefits&#8221; across multiple sectors, noting that the country&#8217;s total trade with BRICS countries increased from $25 billion in 2017 to $36 billion in 2021. In addition, she noted that South Africa has secured more than $5 billion in funding from the group&#8217;s New Development Bank (NDB) &#8220;for key infrastructure projects in renewable energy, water, and other sectors.&#8221;</p>
<p>The BRICS group is also working on creating a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-leaders-set-to-discuss-common-currency-to-challenge-us-dollar-dominance-in-upcoming-summit/">common currency</a> that will help its members reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. The topic is expected to be discussed at the BRICS leaders&#8217; summit in August.</p>

<h2>Economist Highlights Rising De-Dollarization Trend</h2>
<p>Canadian economist James Brander shared his thoughts on the worldwide de-dollarization trend and the waning influence of the U.S. dollar last week. Brander is an Asia Pacific professor in the Strategy and Business Economics Division of the University of British Columbia.</p>
<p>He explained that the U.S. dollar’s dominance in the global market is declining as a growing number of countries are opting to conduct their international transactions using local currencies instead of relying on the USD, Press TV reported. While noting that the U.S. dollar is &#8220;the major reserve currency&#8221; and &#8220;over half of all international currency reserves in the world are U.S. dollar reserves,” he said: &#8220;The role of the U.S. dollar has been declining. It&#8217;s still big, but it has been declining.” The economist added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Other currencies have been getting more important in international transactions and as reserve currencies. Current geopolitical tensions have increased the move towards using other currencies … especially Russia, as well as China, and some other countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;More local currencies are being used for international transactions,&#8221; the professor reiterated. &#8220;So, we&#8217;ve got a transaction between India and Russia and that&#8217;s handled either in Indian currency or Russian currency. We&#8217;re seeing more of that instead of U.S. dollars. I don&#8217;t see a problem with that.”</p>

<p>The imposition of economic sanctions by the U.S., particularly on Russia, is widely viewed as a significant driving force for other nations to transition away from the USD. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stated last month: &#8220;There is a risk when we use financial sanctions that are linked to the role of the dollar that over time it could undermine the hegemony of the dollar … Of course, it does create a desire on the part of China, of Russia, of Iran to find an alternative.”</p>
<p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-de-dollarization-push-china-and-crypto-threaten-us-dollars-dominance-analyst/">De-dollarization</a> efforts have been gaining momentum among the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). The economic bloc is also working on creating a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-working-on-creating-new-currency-to-be-discussed-at-next-leaders-summit/">common currency</a> that will help its members reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar. The BRICS leaders are expected to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-leaders-set-to-discuss-common-currency-to-challenge-us-dollar-dominance-in-upcoming-summit/">discuss</a> the matter at their upcoming leaders&#8217; summit in August. In addition, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/10-southeast-asian-nations-challenge-dollar-dominance-with-push-for-local-currencies/">10 Southeast Asian nations</a> recently agreed to encourage the use of national currencies in transactions.</p>

Moreover, the Cashtokens token ecosystem is now accessible through the blockchain explorers 3xpl.com and salemkode.com, allowing users to explore its potential.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Upgrade Unleashes Token Frenzy and Infrastructure Support</h2>
<p>As of May 15, 2023, Bitcoin Cash advocates have unlocked a new realm of possibilities with the highly anticipated <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-cash-achieves-milestone-upgrade-unleashing-cashtokens-transformative-features/">annual upgrade</a>. Now, they have the power to mint and engage in transactions involving tokens built on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. The <a href="https://cashtokens.org/">Cashtokens development</a> allows token creation and transactions to be verified by the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> network, running alongside traditional financial activities.</p>
<p>Several wallets compatible with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> have already embraced the Cashtokens infrastructure, and crypto enthusiasts can select a Cashtokens-focused wallet through the web portal <a href="https://www.bestbchwallets.com/">bestbchwallets.com</a>. Blockchair&#x2019;s lead developer, Nikita Zhavoronkov, recently shared the experience of jumping into the realm of Cashtokens. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/nikzh/status/1658437566859735042?s=20">tweet</a>, Zhavoronkov expressed enthusiasm, stating that &#x201C;playing with Cashtokens for the last day&#x201D; has been nothing short of captivating.</p>

<p>Zhavoronkov emphasized the superior efficiency of BCH-native tokens compared to contracts built atop other blockchains, citing reduced fees as a significant advantage. However, the developer also highlighted a fundamental difference when working with Cashtokens, urging developers to discard their preconceived notions about Ethereum&#x2019;s ERC20s.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Unlike with ERC-20 and ERC-721, it&#x2019;s possible to send both [fungible tokens] and some NFTs within a single output,&#x201D; Zhavoronkov stated. The Blockchair developer&#x2019;s thread added:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are no &#x2018;contracts,&#x2019; token ids are now called &#x2018;categories.&#x2019; The transfer structure follows the UTXO model. For token details, it&#x2019;s proposed to have the Metadata Registry.</p></blockquote>
<p>Zhavoronkov also <a href="https://twitter.com/nikzh/status/1658437571813208067?s=20">recommended</a> the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> community embark on an exploration of Cashtokens with the <a href="https://3xpl.com/bitcoin-cash">3xpl.com explorer</a>. The developer said: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s super fast, adless (no more &#x201C;double your bitcoins&#x201D; ads), private, open-source, and with lots of pro features for devs [and] analysts.&#x201D; Complementing the 3xpl.com explorer, users can also harness the <a href="https://explorer.salemkode.com">salemkode.com explorer</a> to delve into the realm of Cashtokens and explore associated transactions.</p>

<p>Ever since the upgrade took effect at block height 792,772, Bitcoin Cash users have been enthusiastically minting Cashtokens. According to <a href="https://3xpl.com/bitcoin-cash">statistics</a> provided by the 3xpl.com explorer, 1,308 fungible tokens and 25,336 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have sprung to life within the last 24 hours, marking a surge in token creation on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.</p>

The current value of the BRC20 token economy now stands at $497.75 million, comprising a total of 24,677 distinct tokens. </strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Users Issued More Than 10,000 New BRC20 Tokens In a Permissionless Fashion in 4 Days</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is embracing functionalities that were previously synonymous with the Ethereum blockchain, such as the innovation of new tokens and the generation of non-fungible token assets. As the clock struck 10:43 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 16, the BRC20 token economy achieved an impressive valuation of $497.75 million.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.ph/jdvtS">Archived</a> records indicate that the collective market capitalization of its 24,677 distinct digital tokens has soared 16.56%, surpassing the $427 million mark <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brc20-token-economy-thrives-amidst-crypto-downturn-surging-53-in-five-days/">observed</a> just four days earlier.</p>

<p>As of now, the largest market valuation in the BRC20 token realm is commanded by the ordi (ORDI) token, which stands at $342 million. Each ORDI is currently being traded at $16.31, although it may not hold the title of the highest-valued coin per unit.</p>
<p>The MEME token, valued at $94.68 per coin, and the OSHI token, valued at $477.50 per unit, surpass ORDI in individual worth. However, both MEME and OSHI have considerably smaller supplies compared to the abundance of ORDI (21M), making them more scarce.</p>
<p class="p1"></p>
<h2>Parallel Surges: BRC20 Transactions and Bitcoin&#8217;s Backlog Converge</h2>
<p>In the world of BRC20 tokens, PUNK token boasts a value of $243 per coin, and the token called GOLD holds a trading price of $19.82 per unit. Over the last 24 hours, a total of $206,705,219 in BRC20 trade volume has been generated, with ORDI trades accounting for $197.88 million of that sum.</p>
<p>The remaining BRC20 token markets observe trade volumes of $930,485 or even less during the same time frame. According to <a href="https://dune.com/cryptokoryo/brc20">data</a> from Dune Analytics, 5,906,735 BRC20 transactions have been successfully processed onchain.</p>

<p>Just like the spike in Ordinal inscriptions witnessed on May 7, a parallel surge in transaction fees for deploying, minting, and transferring BRC20s coincided with the Bitcoin network&#8217;s backlog of unconfirmed transactions. The frenzied BRC20 activity occurred on May 7 and 8, 2023.</p>
<p>Interestingly, BRC20s face a similar controversy, stemming from the fact that they emerge from the same technological foundations. Bitcoin maximalists vehemently oppose both Ordinal inscriptions and BRC20s, wishing to confine Bitcoin&#8217;s blockchain to solely financial transactions. However, the wider market seems to embrace the trend, demanding its continuation and growth.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin&#x2019;s Inscription Frenzy: Over 7 Million Ordinal Inscriptions and Counting</h2>
<p>The unstoppable momentum of Bitcoin&#x2019;s Ordinal inscriptions continues to defy detractors, surging past several milestones. With over 7 million inscriptions now firmly embedded in the blockchain, any skepticism toward demand surrounding this trend is being shattered. Today, on May 16, 2023, the tally stands at <a href="https://ordinals.com/inscription/c6bf98ccdd9a360cd6fb548f3d99189166015e642f8c04e1284b09936c5ce691i0">7,204,882</a> inscriptions since the inaugural one occurred on December 16, 2022.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-588107 size-full" title="Bitcoin's Ordinal Inscriptions Surpass 7 Million Mark, Fueling the Trend&#x2019;s Unstoppable Momentum" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ddddc666666.jpg" alt="Bitcoin's Ordinal Inscriptions Surpass 7 Million Mark, Fueling the Trend&#x2019;s Unstoppable Momentum" width="1280" height="350" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ddddc666666-300x82.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ddddc666666-1024x280.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ddddc666666-768x210.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ddddc666666.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>The world of inscriptions experienced a significant acceleration on April 21, 2023, when the count stood at a <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis">mere 1.24 million</a>. In just 25 days since then, the number of Ordinal inscriptions has skyrocketed by over 480%, signaling an astonishing surge. Notably, May 7, 2023, emerged as the pinnacle of this inscription frenzy, with a record-breaking influx of inscriptions. It was on this day that Bitcoin&#x2019;s mempool found itself <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-makes-progress-clearing-backlog-lightning-network-capacity-channels-dropped-amid-congestion-issues/">congested</a> with an overwhelming 500,000 unconfirmed transactions, a testament to the overwhelming demand and activity in the system.</p>
<h2>30-Day Sales Stats Show Bitcoin&#x2019;s Ordinal Inscriptions Have Bolstered NFT Market</h2>
<p>Bitcoin miners have been handsomely rewarded for their role in processing inscription transactions, receiving 1,324 bitcoins (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) valued at $35.86 million. Notably, the pinnacle of these fees was witnessed on May 7, coinciding with the day when Bitcoin&#x2019;s network fees <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/average-bitcoin-transaction-fees-skyrocket-to-19-20-per-transfer-as-over-440000-transactions-remain-unconfirmed/">surpassed</a> the 6.25 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> block subsidy. Intriguingly, the majority of Ordinal inscriptions take the form of plain text rather than JPEG images, with an overwhelming count of <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis">6,402,199</a> inscriptions embracing the plain text format.</p>

<p>The realm of selling NFT collections has proven profitable for Ordinal inscriptions, amassing $93 million in sales over the past 30 days. As a result, Bitcoin has ascended to become the second-largest blockchain in terms of NFT sales this month, according to 30-day statistics from cryptoslam.io. Notably, the market has recorded sales from <a href="https://ordinalswallet.com/collections">popular Ordinal collections</a> such as Pixel Pepes, Sub100k, Bitcoin Frogs, Space Pepes, Bitcoin Punks, and Sub10k. Out of the six highest-priced NFTs sold this month, five have emerged from the fertile grounds of the Bitcoin blockchain&#x2019;s Ordinal inscribing technology.</p>

The global market cap is currently down by 1.28%, as overall market uncertainty remains high. Apecoin also rallied, extending recent gains.</strong></p>
<h2>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>)</h2>
<p>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>) was once again in the green, as the token rose for a third consecutive session.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>/USD surged to a peak of $89.68 in today&#x2019;s session, after starting the week at a low at $86.42.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#x2019;s rally has seen litecoin climb to its strongest point since April 30, which is the last time price was above $90.00.</p>

<p>From the chart, it appears that this level is once again the target for bulls, and could very likely be hit in the coming days.</p>
<p>After breaking out of a ceiling at 50.00, the relative strength index (RSI) is now tracking at 56.28.</p>
<p>The next visible point of resistance is now at the 59.00 mark, and should this be hit, not only will <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> be above $90.00, but likely closer to 92.00.</p>

<h2>Apecoin (APE)</h2>
<p>In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>, apecoin (APE) also surged on Tuesday, despite current market uncertainty.</p>
<p>Following a low of $3.33 to start the week, APE rose to an intraday high of $3.45 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>The gain comes as APE broke out of a ceiling at $3.35, resulting in price climbing to its highest point since May 8.</p>

<p>APE has fallen marginally lower from earlier highs, as its RSI failed to overcome a resistance point at 38.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, price strength is at the 37.69 mark, with the price now at $3.42.</p>
<p>If bulls are able to break this wall, then there is a good chance that APE could continue its move towards $4.00.</p>

The platform is accessible via the Okx Wallet and will enable users to mint and trade Ordinal inscriptions and BRC20 tokens. While the Ordinals marketplace is still in its early stages, users can take advantage of the ability to view and transfer Ordinal inscriptions using the multichain wallet.</strong></p>
<h2>Okx Embraces Ordinals and BRC20 Trend, Reveals New Ordinals Marketplace</h2>
<p>Okx, the crypto firm, exchange, and Web3 company, has announced the Okx Wallet now provides seamless access to the groundbreaking Ordinal and BRC20 ecosystem. With over <a href="https://ordinals.com/inscription/01681ab53ea8943112bf2606f214fb5370ff9ece7b37d4aabfbe05ea94e01f2ai0">7 million</a> Ordinal inscriptions linked to the Bitcoin blockchain and <a href="https://brc-20.io/">18,250 BRC20 tokens</a> valued at nearly half a billion dollars, inscriptions have been a game-changer for crypto enthusiasts. What&#8217;s more, Bitcoin&#8217;s NFT sales (aka Ordinal inscription trades) are just below Ethereum’s, making it the second-largest chain in terms of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nft-sales-surge-31-this-week-as-bitcoin-nfts-secure-second-place-in-blockchain-sales/">NFT sales last week</a>.</p>
<p>Okx is embracing the Ordinals trend with open arms. The crypto firm further detailed that it is rolling out the Okx Wallet&#8217;s features in phases. As of now, users can view and transfer Ordinal inscriptions, and later this week, they&#8217;ll be able to trade BRC20 tokens. By the end of May, the wallet will enable users to issue their own Ordinal inscriptions (NFTs) and BRC20s. And by June, Okx is promising to take things up a notch by allowing users to trade (buy, sell, and list) Ordinal inscriptions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okx has always believed in the power of Bitcoin to revolutionize global markets and bring us closer to a truly decentralized system,” Jason Lau, the chief innovation officer at Okx, said. “We are embracing Ordinals and BRC-20, despite early criticisms about their impact on transaction costs, because we see the potential of Bitcoin to expand its use cases into areas previously dominated by Ethereum-based applications,” Lau added.</p>

<p>The firm will be joining the ranks of several other Ordinals market players, including Open Ordex, Ordinals Market, Ordswap, Ordinals Wallet, Gamma, Magic Eden, and Unisat. Together, these markets boast 59,954 unique traders and have facilitated over $123 million in Ordinal inscription swaps settled in both bitcoin and ethereum. In addition to launching the Okx Wallet marketplace for Ordinals, the firm is also set to attend the <a href="https://www.bitcoinbuildersconf.com/event/10a5f7cf-7c5e-426c-a1b8-b65ceea0eb8c/summary">Bitcoin Builders</a> event in Miami on May 17.</p>
