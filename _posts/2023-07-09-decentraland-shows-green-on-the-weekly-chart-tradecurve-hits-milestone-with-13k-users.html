<p>Decentraland, one of the most well-known virtual worlds, has seen a surge in the value of its native token, MANA. However, it's not the only cryptocurrency to achieve major milestones, as the upcoming Tradecurve exchange has surged in user count and reached a total of 13,000 sign-ups even before launch. We will go over both projects to see why this has been the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Decentraland (MANA) Heads Into The Green Zone According to Weekly Chart
<p>Decentraland celebrated Metaverse Pride 23, an event that was held with Polygon Mind. Decentraland also saw numerous developments, where they introduced new profile updates, where users could swap names, modify their bio, add links and other information, and manage their wallets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of July 4, 2023, the Decentraland cryptocurrency traded at $0.404545. During the past week, Decentraland saw its high point of value at $0.358488, with its low point at a value of $0.416113. Within the last two weeks, the total price increase of Decentraland was by 20.8%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, within the past seven days, Decentraland climbed by 4%. This indicates that on its weekly chart, Decentraland has maintained its green zone and is heading upward in value.</p>

Tradecurve Hits 13,000 User Milestone
<p>However, Decentraland was not the only project to reach a significant milestone. Tradecurve is an upcoming hybrid exchange that focuses on privacy and anonymity. In addition, it's not locked to just crypto trading, as anyone can also trade bonds, US and European equity CFDs, ETFs, forex, indices, commodities, and options. As a result, 13,000 people have already signed up for the exchange even before its launch.</p>
TCRV Increased by 80% in Value
<p>During Stage 4 of the presale, TCRV trades at $0.018, indicating that the cryptocurrency has surged in value by 80% since the beginning giving solid ROI for early investors. In addition, it will surge by an additional 40% at Stage 5, meaning that investors who want to make the most significant ROI will want to get into it early.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Analysts are also predicting that based on its feature sets, such as high leverage at 500:1, negative balance protection, and the VIP account system, TCRV can spike in value even further.</p>

Analysts Predict a 100x Jump In value When Tradecurve Launches
<p>Current market experts predict that the growth of the TCRV token will be by 100x, fueled by its future listing on Tier-1 exchanges and on Uniswap, and due to the introduction of Proof of Reserves (PoR) that will bolster transparency in the exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, true borderless access appeals to millions of people, and the team estimates that they can onboard 100,000 users at launch. They've already raised $2.8 million out of the estimated $20 million, and the presale has seen significant appeal from investors and whales.&nbsp;</p>
