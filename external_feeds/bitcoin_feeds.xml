<h2>&#8216;One Regulatory System&#8217;</h2>
<p>Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Singapore&#8217;s senior minister who is also the chairman of the country&#8217;s central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), talked about cryptocurrency regulation during a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/davos-2023-banking-panel-reinforces-the-need-for-crypto-regulation/">panel discussion</a> with other regulators and bankers at the World Economic Forum last week.</p>
<p>Shanmugaratnam previously served as Singapore&#8217;s deputy prime minister and the minister for finance. He is also currently the coordinating minister for social policies and adviser to the prime minister on economic policies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something is very clear, whether it&#8217;s crypto or traditional finance, you gotta regulate for things like money laundering. So that&#8217;s very clear,&#8221; he began.</p>
<p>&#8220;But beyond that, if you have to think about regulating crypto the same way we regulate banks, insurance companies, and so on — for prudential reasons, for financial stability reasons — I think we&#8217;ve got to take a step back and ask the basic philosophical question,&#8221; the minister explained. &#8220;Does that legitimize something that&#8217;s inherently purely speculative, and in fact, slightly crazy?&#8221; he said, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Or are we better off just providing ultra clarity as to what&#8217;s an unregulated market and if you go in, you go in at your own risk. I lean a bit more towards the latter view.</p></blockquote>
<p>The MAS chairman proceeded to clarify that some segments of the crypto market should be regulated, pointing to stablecoins as a possible area of oversight.</p>
<p>&#8220;But to start getting into a game of regulating, whether it&#8217;s ostrich eggs or crypto or anything else, it&#8217;s going to be a never-ending game and I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s the right way to go,&#8221; he opined.</p>
<p>While emphasizing that &#8220;consumer education&#8221; is important, he noted: &#8220;But also just ultra clarity — make very clear that this is a risk you are taking at your own expense, and by the way please don&#8217;t take that risk because it&#8217;s going to be foolish. I prefer that approach.&#8221;</p>

<p>Minister Shanmugaratnam further detailed: &#8220;And then if crypto or blockchain or any of the parts of that ecosystem would like to do things that traditional finance is doing, you apply exactly the same regulations to that — capital, liquidity, reserve backing — exactly the same regulations.&#8221; He concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>So people are very clear. There is one regulatory system for everything. And if you&#8217;re outside of the regulatory system, buyer beware.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Crypto to Play a Major Role in the UAE</h2>
<p>United Arab Emirates Minister of State for Foreign Trade Thani Al Zeyoudi talked about cryptocurrency Friday during an interview with Bloomberg in Davos, Switzerland.</p>
<p>He shared that one area the UAE is looking to expand is cryptocurrencies, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Crypto will play a major role for UAE trade going forward.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The most important thing is that we ensure global governance when it comes to cryptocurrencies and crypto companies,&#8221; Al Zeyoudi described.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started attracting some of the companies to the country with the aim that we’ll build together the right governance and legal system, which are needed,&#8221; the official noted.</p>
<p>Omar Sultan Al Olama, UAE Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy, and Remote Work Applications, also talked about cryptocurrency regulation last week in a World Economic Forum session titled &#8220;Finding the right balance for crypto&#8221; in Davos. He confirmed that no crypto exchanges have been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/uae-says-no-virtual-asset-service-provider-has-been-granted-an-operating-permit/">licensed</a> in the UAE, emphasizing that the regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies in the UAE are &#8220;not light.&#8221; The minister said:</p>
<blockquote><p>UAE has not issued a single licensed crypto exchange in UAE, neither Binance nor FTX … no one was able to onboard any customers even last week.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dubai-approves-first-law-to-regulate-crypto-assets-establishes-regulator-to-oversee-crypto-sector/">established</a> in March, also states on its website that it has not granted any operating permit to date. VARA is responsible for licensing and regulating the crypto sector in the Emirate of Dubai and its free zone territories (excluding DIFC) under UAE law.</p>
<p>However, a number of cryptocurrency exchanges — including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-receives-license-to-offer-more-crypto-services-in-dubai/">Binance</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dubais-new-virtual-asset-regulator-licenses-crypto-exchanges-binance-ftx/">FTX</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dubai-regulator-grants-crypto-trading-app-okx-license-to-extend-services-in-the-uae/">Okx</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/uae-based-crypto-exchange-bitoasis-obtains-provisional-approval-from-dubais-new-regulator/">Bitoasis</a>, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/digital-asset-exchange-coinmena-secures-provisional-license-allowing-it-to-operate-in-the-uae/">Coinmena</a> — have received a provisional license from VARA. The regulator recently clarified that these crypto trading platforms are in stage one of a four-stage approval process.</p>
<p>According to the &#8220;Digital Lifestyle&#8221; 2022 report published by the United Arab Emirates Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority (TDRA), <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-11-4-of-uae-residents-have-invested-in-cryptocurrencies/">about 11.4%</a> of UAE residents own or have invested in cryptocurrencies.</p>

Despite growing pressure for it to extend the period for returning the old notes, the central bank insists the Jan. 31 deadline still stands.</strong></p>
<h2>Less Than 40% of ATMs Are Dispensing New Banknotes</h2>
<p>As the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)’s Jan. 31 deadline for returning the old naira banknotes approaches, banks in several Nigerian states are still distributing the soon-to-be demonetized banknotes, a report has said. In addition, fewer automated teller machines (ATMs) — less than 40% according to an investigation by the Guardian — were reportedly dispensing new banknotes.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://guardian.ng/business-services/concerns-trail-cbns-deadline-scarcity-of-new-naira-notes/">Guardian report</a>, some bank insiders are adamant that the shortages are caused by the CBN, which has not distributed enough new banknotes. One unnamed banker from Lagos claimed that their branch got &#8220;just N1.5m new notes&#8221; in the previous week and had no new stock of the redesigned naira at the time of writing.</p>
<p>The banker, however, suggested that the CBN planned to do a massive rollout of the new banknotes in the last week of January. The banker said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The deadline is fast approaching, but we are not getting the expected quantity. We are suspecting that they will roll it out massively next week because there are no indications that the deadline will be extended.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another banker from Nigeria’s Ogun state said while the CBN has refused to extend the current deadline the increased anxiety suggests that &#8220;a massive rollout of the money&#8221; should have been done by now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>CBN Refuses to Bow to Pressure</h2>
<p>The fears that many Nigerians will lose out when the old naira banknotes are phased out has prompted some politicians to call for an extension of the deadline. However, the CBN has so far refused to bow to pressure and has insisted that the deadline still stands.</p>
<p>In the past, the central bank has dismissed claims that the decision to demonetize the old banknotes is aimed at punishing certain groups. Instead, the CBN <a href="https://dailypost.ng/2023/01/21/no-extension-of-date-for-depositing-old-naira-notes-cbn/">insists</a> that the exercise is designed to help it reduce expenditure on cash management as well as to weed out counterfeit banknotes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some Nigerian commentators have suggested that the CBN may be deliberately injecting inadequate banknotes as part of an attempt to force residents to switch to digital alternatives including its central bank digital currency (CBDC). Such speculation has in turn prompted the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) to issue a statement cautioning the CBN.</p>
<p>In the statement, the governors <a href="https://www.vanguardngr.com/2023/01/were-not-against-naira-redesign-policy-of-cbn-nigerian-govs/">reportedly</a> said that while they are not against the currency redesign policy, the central bank should &#8220;consider the peculiarities of states especially as they pertained to financial inclusion and under-served locations.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>The following opinion editorial was written by Bitcoin.com CEO Dennis Jarvis.</em><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>The gross mismanagement and outright fraud in 2022 by many opaque centralized exchanges are driving people back to the core tenets of crypto, such as decentralization, self-custody, transparency, and censorship resistance. People are naturally turning to DeFi (decentralized finance). Unfortunately, much of DeFi is not yet ready to act as a suitable substitute.</p>
<p>In this article, I will talk about two of the most important challenges: how to make DeFi more accessible to new users and how to improve its performance when compared to centralized services.</p>
<h2>The Onboarding Problem and Its Solution</h2>
<p>The problem with getting new users to adopt DeFi is partly due to user experience (UX).<a href="http://bitcoin.com/"> Bitcoin.com</a>’s Head of Product Experience Alex Knight did an excellent job <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/web3-must-overcome-significant-ux-challenges-to-reach-mass-adoption/">outlining</a> the problems and solutions of the UX challenges in web3 applications. To summarize: the self-custodial web3 model generally leads to developers creating a user experience that’s fundamentally different from the one people are used to in the custodial web2 model — and that creates huge friction.</p>
<blockquote><p>Solving the UX problem is a combination of clever design, education, and incentives.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the design front, the challenge is to create products that are as familiar and easy-to-use as the best web2 analogs. At<a href="http://bitcoin.com/"> Bitcoin.com</a> our self-custodial multichain wallet app has long-provided an intuitive experience, but only for simple actions like buying, selling, sending, and receiving crypto. As we integrate more complex DeFi features, including our own decentralized exchange <a href="https://verse.bitcoin.com/">Verse DEX</a>, right into the app, it is critical that the user experience remain as indistinguishable from web2 as possible while using web3 rails exclusively.</p>
<p>Yet even if web3 manages to reach parity with web2 in terms of ease-of-use, there is still the challenge of convincing people to make the switch. This is where education and incentives come in. Education will do two things: rebuild confidence in crypto, and prepare users to make the move. Incentives will provide the push that’s often needed to try something new.</p>
<p>Luckily, the cryptocurrency space is ideally suited to provide the perfect combination of education and incentives. I’ve written about <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-power-of-loyalty-points-and-the-importance-of-getting-them-right-dennis-jarvis-ceo-of-bitcoin-com/">the power of loyalty tokens in crypto, and the importance of getting them right</a>, and we’ve thought long and hard about how to integrate them in the <a href="http://bitcoin.com/">Bitcoin.com</a> ecosystem.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve launched our own ecosystem token VERSE, we’re able to start experimenting with ways to use monetary incentives to safely guide people into decentralized finance, where they can benefit from its advantages over CeFi (centralized finance). One way we’re planning on doing that is to reward newcomers with VERSE tokens for taking actions like securely backing up their wallet.</p>

<h3><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-570117 size-full" title="We Must Expedite the Move From Centralized Services to Viable DeFi Alternatives" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cex.jpg" alt="We Must Expedite the Move From Centralized Services to Viable DeFi Alternatives" width="1280" height="650" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cex-300x152.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cex-1024x520.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cex-768x390.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cex.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></h3>
<h2>The Execution Problem</h2>
<p>Even if you solve the problem of onboarding new users, DeFi in its current iteration fails in responsiveness and market size. If either of these is lacking, people will not come, or abandon soon after.</p>
<p>DeFi responsiveness has seized up under what would be considered light traffic in web2. On-chain capacity has not been able to handle peak 2021 DeFi usage. Even with the proliferation of alt-L1’s and the beginnings of live L2’s, on-chain block space was easily swamped.</p>
<p>DEX market size encapsulates DeFi’s capacity problem. I’ll let crypto Twitter help me out here:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note that these comments were posted just before FTX imploded. It’s possible that the tweets’ authors’ views have changed since then. Still, their criticisms ring true: Current DeFi products simply cannot replace CEXs in terms of liquidity, volume, and order matching.</p>
<p>It’s a problem for the crypto industry when many of the biggest traders, market makers, and proponents of crypto cannot execute trades or participate in size on decentralized platforms. They’re forced to gather on risky centralized exchanges, which creates a self-reinforcing cycle of dependence on CEXs.</p>
<p>In the past, CEXs seemed like an agreed upon stop-gap until crypto technology was at a place where it was capable to take over. As crypto garnered more attention, I feel like the industry as a whole became complacent, distracted by the amount of money pouring in. The feeling was something like, “Those things will be solved in time.”</p>
<h2>Solution to the Execution Problem</h2>
<p>I believe that the base crypto technological tools are all here, or nearly so. An example of a DEX that can compete on an acceptable level with a CEX, is the layer 2-based dYdX exchange. Leveraging zero-knowledge proof systems, dYdX can execute transactions cheaply and quickly enough to compare with the responsiveness of CEXs. <a href="https://dydx.exchange/blog/dydx-chain">Currently</a>, “the existing dYdX product processes about 10 trades per second and 1,000 order places/cancellations per second, with the goal to scale up orders of magnitude higher.”</p>
<p>Now the only thing it lacks is comparable liquidity. Since good liquidity begets better liquidity, a constructive first step is that dYdX uses an order book and matching engine, a much more efficient and profitable way to make markets. Using an order book should attract market makers to provide the liquidity sufficient to make DEXs comparable to CEXs.</p>
<p>Additionally, liquidity will come now that it’s obvious (again!) that you can’t trust these centralized intermediaries. Big players in crypto need to make a concerted effort to move out of CEXs into DeFi protocols. <a href="http://bitcoin.com/">Bitcoin.com</a>, for one, is proud to be offering extensive DeFi solutions. The <a href="http://bitcoin.com/">Bitcoin.com</a> Wallet, with over 35 million self-custodial wallets created to date, continues to be an important onboarding tool, setting up newcomers to easily and securely interact with decentralized finance.</p>
<h2>The Future Is DeFi</h2>
<p>Don’t be disillusioned by the shortcomings I have identified here. The truth of the matter is that all of DeFi’s shortcomings are trivial in comparison to its strengths. DeFi enables self-custody of your assets but with the utility we’ve come to rely on from centralized financial institutions; for example, swapping between assets, earning yield on your assets, or using your assets to take out loans. Until now, these financial activities have always required trusted intermediaries. The solutions to DeFi’s problems are attainable, which is in stark contrast to the entrenched problems in traditional finance. Ultimately the answer to traditional finance’s problems is DeFi.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casino loyalty programs have evolved through the changing paradigm of the casino industry. Digitalization has provided the arena of chance-based gaming the mobility to fit right onto the handheld devices of players. Registered members that reach the VIP levels can passively earn cash prizes, cashback, Free Spins & other bonuses, while not even being aware that they might be getting rewarded simply for playing their favorite games.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Space Odyssey: A VIP Loyalty Program</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://bitspinaffiliates.com/aa504883d"><b>BitSpinCasino</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Bitcoin.com, offers a loyalty program that delivers a rich VIP experience while dishing out competitive rewards to those who would like to make the casino their preferred portal to play. Space Odyssey, the loyalty program pays homage to the legendary filmmaker Stanley Kubrick by naming itself after the space-time classic that renders the same titular effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes unbeknownst to the player, any registered member who plays the casino games automatically starts accumulating loyalty points. Once these points reach a certain threshold, they start rewarding the player with regular freebies as they progress level by level in the loyalty program. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rewards in the Loyalty Program</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each level unveils a special kind of spacecraft for the player while upgrading their ranks in the BitSpinCasino Universe and rewarding them with extra booster bonuses such as increasing weekly cashback and Free Spins on every level. Starting at the level of Rookie aboard a humble spacecraft called the Orbital Yacht, the player can level up all the way to gain control of the Galactic Cruiser and become the Master of the Universe, where they can enjoy 300 Free Spins, as well as 15% cashback every week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The upper echelons of these levels also unlock access to a special, dedicated VIP Manager that will be available for the player 24/7, whenever they need any kind of assistance. Not only do players here get pampered with VIP treatment but are also offered many exclusive promotions tailored specifically to the player&#x2019;s preferences. </span></p>

New York&#8217;s top financial regulator stressed that businesses should not commingle customer funds and that customer funds should be segregated with separate accounting.</strong></p>
<h2>FTX Collapse Prompts NYDFS to Issue Guidance on Virtual Currency Custodian Regulations</h2>
<p>Following the recent collapse of FTX and allegations directed at its co-founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, and top deputies, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) released guidance detailing that customer assets held by a virtual currency business must be segregated.</p>
<p>The guidance was issued by Adrienne Harris, the superintendent of the NYDFS, and the regulator insists that virtual currency custodians need to apply a &#8220;safe regulatory framework&#8221; to protect customers and preserve trust. The NYDFS guidance provides a summary of four different policies and standards that virtual currency entities (VCEs) should adhere to. The four policies are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Segregation of and Separate Accounting for Customer Virtual Currency;</li>
<li aria-level="1">VCE Custodian’s Limited Interest in and Use of Customer Virtual Currency;</li>
<li aria-level="1">Sub-Custody Arrangements; and</li>
<li aria-level="1">Customer Disclosure.</li>
</ul>
<p>“To custody customer virtual currency properly and maintain appropriate books and records, a VCE custodian is expected to separately account for and segregate customer virtual currency from the corporate assets of the VCE custodian and its affiliated entities, both onchain and on the VCE custodian’s internal ledger accounts,” the New York regulator details.</p>

<p>The regulator further said that custodians should have limited interest in customer funds and in the use of a client&#8217;s virtual assets. &#8220;When a customer transfers possession of an asset to a VCE custodian for the purposes of safekeeping, the department expects that the VCE custodian will take possession only for the limited purpose of carrying out custody and safekeeping services,&#8221; the NYDFS guidance explains.</p>

The &#x201C;shadow fork&#x201D; will serve as a testing environment for the Shanghai upgrade, allowing developers to identify bugs and any potential issues.</strong></p>
<h2>Ethereum&#x2019;s Shanghai Upgrade &#x2018;Shadow Fork&#x2019; Launches</h2>
<p>As the cryptocurrency community awaits the upcoming Shanghai hard fork, core Ethereum developers have launched a testing environment called a &#x201C;shadow fork&#x201D; in order to test the upgrade. This follows the developers&#x2019; <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethereum-validator-count-surpasses-500000-ahead-of-upcoming-shanghai-hard-fork/">announcement</a> of the launch of a new testnet for the Shanghai upgrade on Jan. 11, 2023. The fork, which will focus on allowing staked withdrawals, is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethereum-developers-prepare-to-deploy-shanghai-public-testnet-focus-on-staked-ether-withdrawals/">anticipated</a> to occur in March 2023.</p>
<p>According to Marius van der Wijden, an Ethereum Foundation software developer, there were a few issues with the &#x201C;shadow fork&#x201D; that began at approximately 6 a.m. Eastern Time on Monday morning. &#x201C;It started out with a few issues because the config wasn&#x2019;t correctly applied on Geth (we disallow overriding the mainnet config),&#x201D; van der Wijden <a href="https://twitter.com/vdWijden/status/1617530244302532615?s=20&t=r7_CRKXdg0nSzuluNaiK6Q">wrote</a> on Twitter. The developer <a href="https://twitter.com/vdWijden/status/1617530251441209344?s=20&t=r7_CRKXdg0nSzuluNaiK6Q">added</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For now, the chain is finalizing correctly, let&#x2019;s see if Potuz and I can break it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The cryptocurrency community has been concerned about the Beacon chain withdrawals, as there are 16,167,527 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> stored within the <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa">validator contract</a> that is currently locked. Only a hard fork can unlock the staked funds and the Shanghai upgrade is meant to pave the way toward that goal. <a href="https://beaconscan.com/stat/validator">Statistics</a> from Beaconscan.com show that there are 504,765 validators, as the validator count crossed the 500,000 zone this year.</p>

<p>It has been approximately 130 days since <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/what-is-the-merge-a-brief-explanation-of-ethereums-transition-from-proof-of-work-to-proof-of-stake/">The Merge</a>, when Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network. The Shanghai upgrade will be the next major hard fork following The Merge. In addition to allowing Beacon chain withdrawals, developers are exploring ways to lower gas costs for the withdrawals as well. The public testnet for the Shanghai upgrade is set to launch in the near future, giving the general public an opportunity to test the new software&#x2019;s features.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your thoughts on the Ethereum developers&#x2019; use of a &#x201C;shadow fork&#x201D; for testing and bug identification prior to the Shanghai upgrade&#x2019;s mainnet release? How do you think the upgrade will impact the Ethereum community and the locked-staked funds? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

It would be the first time that a stablecoin could be purchased directly from a bank account.</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Walker at Fluid said:</strong> <em>“One of the problems with crypto is the lack of connection to the real world. Fluid solves that by integrating Dai directly into our accounts. Users can buy Dai directly from us using dollars, euros, pounds and dozens of other currencies. Dai holders can also now buy coffee on their Fluid Cards, which operate on the Mastercard network”.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/fluid_fi">Fluid</a> offers traditional bank accounts in Europe and the UK and Fluid Accounts, which are open to anyone globally. Users can connect their Web3 wallets to these accounts, for a seamless TradFi &#8211; DeFi experience. <em>“Gone are the days of having to go through an exchange,”</em> &#8211; said Walker.</p>
<p><em>“Our main motivation was to offer an alternative to money transmitters, who charge exorbitant fees,”</em> said Tina Bielowski. <em>“We use Dai as part of our payment rails, together with integrations into the traditional system, and the end result is that the world’s poorest get a better deal. Even better, since the money is delivered directly to the user’s phone, it allows vulnerable people to have control of their financial life.” </em></p>
<p>Fluid’s own digital money provides the integration solution missing for so long in the crypto world. When combined with Dai, Fluid’s offer is intended to connect the two world and removes barriers to adoption.</p>
<p><strong>Fluid’s detailed proposal can be seen here:</strong> <a href="https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip99-offer-dai-to-cefi-projects-to-enable-real-world-use-cases/19466">https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip99-offer-dai-to-cefi-projects-to-enable-real-world-use-cases/19466</a></p>

<p><strong>More details</strong></p>
<p>Fluid enables Dai holders to off-ramp from crypto to a bank account (or Fluid Account) in less than a minute. Holders can also spend their Dai on their Fluid Cards, which run on the Mastercard network. These cards are available to anyone, globally.</p>

In Dec. 2022, the annual inflation rate dropped to 6.5%, and many experts predict it will decrease further. However, economist Mohamed El-Erian of the University of Cambridge believes inflation will become &#x201C;sticky&#x201D; in midyear, around 4%. The central bank, on the other hand, is primarily focused on reducing inflation to 2%.</strong></p>
<h2>5% Is the New 2%: Tight Monetary Policy and Interest Rate Hikes Unable to Curb Inflationary Pressure</h2>
<p>Members of the Federal Reserve, including its 16th chair, Jerome Powell, have frequently stated that the bank&#x2019;s goal is to bring inflation down to 2%. Powell has <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20220826a.htm">emphasized</a> that the Federal Open Market Committee&#x2019;s (FOMC) &#x201C;overarching focus right now is to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal.&#x201D; To tame inflation, the central bank has used its monetary tightening policy and interest rate hikes. So far, the Fed has raised rates <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/all-eyes-on-the-next-fed-meeting-market-trajectories-hinge-on-decision/">seven times</a> in a row since last year, with increases happening on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Inflation in the U.S. has decreased since approaching double digits in October and November 2022. At that time, economist and gold enthusiast Peter Schiff <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-inflation-rate-in-august-runs-hot-at-8-3-peter-schiff-says-americas-days-of-sub-2-inflation-are-gone/">stated</a> that &#x201C;America&#x2019;s days of sub-2% inflation are gone.&#x201D; At the 2023 World Economic Forum event in Davos, last week, JLL CEO Christian Ulbrich <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/530879db-a04c-42a1-adcb-11f18c7f7552">told</a> the Financial Times that his peers are starting to say that 5% will be the new 2%. &#x201C;Inflation will persistently remain around 5%,&#x201D; Ulbrich said to the FT reporters. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-mohamed-el-erian-says-feds-characterization-of-inflation-as-transitory-the-worst-call-in-history/">Mohamed El-Erian</a>, president of Queens&#x2019; College at the University of Cambridge, explained on January 17 that inflation may become &#x201C;sticky&#x201D; around the 4% range.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Stocks and bonds are off to an exuberant start to 2023, but there is still plenty of uncertainty about the world&#x2019;s growth, inflation and policy prospects,&#x201D; El-Erian <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-01-17/buoyant-markets-need-to-keep-an-eye-on-four-risk-factors">wrote</a> in an op-ed article published on Bloomberg. &#x201C;The improvement in U.S. growth prospects is being accompanied by a depletion of savings, which had benefited from the considerable fiscal transfers to households during the pandemic, and an increase in indebtedness,&#x201D; the economist added.</p>
<h2>El-Erian: &#x2018;Mounting Wage Pressure&#x2019; to Spark Notable Change in Inflation</h2>
<p>El-Erian further noted that the value of <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> has undergone a notable appreciation this year, and he attributes this to investors becoming more accepting of relaxed financial constraints and an increase in risk-taking attitudes. &#x201C;Bitcoin is up some 25% so far this year thanks to looser financial conditions and larger risk appetites,&#x201D; the economist wrote.</p>

<p>While the Federal Reserve aims to bring inflation back down to the 2% range, and some <a href="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/u-s-inflation-rate-history-by-year-and-forecast-3306093">predict</a> the inflation rate will decrease to 2.7% this year and 2.3% in 2024, El-Erian anticipates an adhering predicament around the 4% range. &#x201C;Increasing wage pressure&#x201D; is driving this change, El-Erian emphasized.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This transition is particularly noteworthy because inflationary pressures are now less sensitive to central bank policy action,&#x201D; the economist wrote. &#x201C;The result could well be more sticky inflation at around double the level of central banks&#x2019; current inflation target.&#x201D;</p>

Following comments last week from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, many have bought the token in anticipation of the lawsuit ending in the coming months. Dogecoin was another notable gainer on Monday.</strong></p>
<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, formerly ripple, was one of Monday&#x2019;s notable gainers, as the token rose to a three-month high in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD hit an intraday high of $0.431 to start the week, coming off the back of Sunday&#x2019;s low at $0.3979.</p>
<p>As a result of today&#x2019;s surge in price, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> has risen to its strongest point since November 8.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the move took place following a breakout of a ceiling at the $0.410 resistance level.</p>
<p>As of writing, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> is still trading above this point, however earlier gains have eased, with price now at $0.420.</p>
<p>Momentum has eased, with traders seemingly securing gains as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which is tracking at 68.64, nears a ceiling at 69.00.</p>

<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, dogecoin (DOGE) started the week stronger, with the meme coin hovering close to a key resistance level.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.0861 on Sunday, DOGE/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.09289 earlier today.</p>
<p>This surge saw dogecoin briefly break out of a resistance point at $0.09200, closing in on a six-week high in the process.</p>

<p>As can be seen on the chart, this breakout was not sustained, with the meme coin now trading below $0.09000.</p>
<p>One of the reasons behind the afternoon&#x2019;s decline is the fact that price strength has encountered a hurdle of its own.</p>
<p>Currently the RSI is tracking at 63.51, which is slightly below a ceiling at the 64.00 mark, and seems to have panicked earlier bulls.</p>
