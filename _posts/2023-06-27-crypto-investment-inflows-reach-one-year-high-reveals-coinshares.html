Crypto investment products are once again proving their market allure, with inflows hitting their highest level since July 2022. European asset management firm, CoinShares, noted an influx of $199 million just last week, signaling revived interest from investors in the crypto space. The surge is seen as a correction, compensating for almost half of the outflows observed in the preceding 9 weeks. CoinShares attributed the surge to recent filings for physically backed ETFs from high-profile issuers. Particularly, the crypto market is evidently witnessing a rebirth of enthusiasm as global asset management giants, such as BlackRock, file for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin Takes The Lion&#8217;s Share In this wave of increased inflows, Bitcoin emerged as the undisputed front-runner. Bitcoin-centric investment products saw inflows of $188 million last week, according to CoinShares. On the other hand, short-bitcoin continued its trend of nine consecutive weeks of outflows, reaching $4.9 million. These contrasting trends are a testament to Bitcoin&#8217;s persistent allure amid market fluctuations. Ethereum also registered inflows, albeit at a comparatively lesser scale of $7.8 million. CoinShares’ data implies a currently subdued investor appetite for Ethereum as compared to Bitcoin. Notably, despite the Bitcoin and Ethereum domination, there&#8217;s a visible, albeit &#8220;very minor&#8221;, flow towards alternative cryptocurrencies, such as XRP and Solana. This points to a diverse market interest, even if it doesn&#8217;t match the scale of the major cryptos. The improved market sentiment is also persuading investors towards multi-asset investment ETPs. These ETPs saw an inflow of $8 million last week, which further emphasizes the ongoing diversification of investor interests in the crypto asset class. Record High For Crypto Assets Under Management With the increased inflows, the total assets under management (AUM) across fund managers have now also reached $37 billion. This is the highest level noted since before the collapse of Three Arrows Capital. It underscores not just the resilience of the crypto market, but also the continued faith that investors place in it. It is worth noting that alongside the surge in crypto investment inflows, the crypto market particularly large crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum has seen a rebound from its losses amid the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase. In the past day, Bitcoin experienced a slight dip of 0.6%, but its trading price continues to hover above the recently regained $30,000 benchmark. The past week has seen an addition of over $70 billion to Bitcoin&#8217;s market cap, boosting it from a low of $514 billion the previous Monday to exceed $580 billion today. Meanwhile, Ethereum has been on the fence in the last 24 hours with no significant movement. The second-largest asset by market cap currently has a daily trading volume above $8 billion and a market cap of $226 billion. Featured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView
