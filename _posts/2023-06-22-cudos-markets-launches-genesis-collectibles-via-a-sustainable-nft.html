<p>The CUDOS Blockchain is excited to introduce CUDOS Markets, a tokenized RWA (real-world assets) marketplace for Hashrate NFTs, adding another major tool to the CUDOS ecosystem. The public sale of the first collection of limited-edition NFTs is taking place on June 22 on this unique platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CUDOS Markets builds upon the success of CUDO Compute and CUDO Miner, leveraging the company&rsquo;s expertise to create a marketplace for tokenized real-world assets, starting with sustainable Bitcoin (BTC) rewards. As outlined in CUDOS&rsquo; roadmap, collectible holders will gain access to Bitcoin rewards, future games that will allow them to win additional hashrate and future drops, including tokenized renewable energy infrastructure.</p>
<p>Unlike conventional Bitcoin acquisition, which raises concerns about sustainability and environmental impact, CUDOS Markets ensures that all BTC rewards are sourced exclusively from sustainable and 100% renewable energy sources. This pioneering approach ushers in a new era of responsible cryptocurrency acquisition, empowering individuals to make environmentally conscious choices while benefiting from digital assets.</p>
<p>Renowned artist Delux3, formerly a senior designer at Nike, crafted the Genesis collection artwork. Delux3&rsquo;s signature style of &ldquo;refined street art&rdquo; incorporates deep tonal layers and unexpected color combinations. As an established artist in the Solana art world, Delux3&rsquo;s visionary and abstract contributions to the new Hashrate Collection for CUDOS Markets promise to captivate collectors.</p>
<p>The Genesis Collection Public Sale will be offering the opportunity to purchase at a fixed price of $330. Buyers are in with a chance of winning one of the five tiers of hashrate NFTs, with the top tier consistently returning up to 170TH/s throughout a period of four years. Additionally, participants will have a chance to mint one of the three unique one-of-one collectibles concealed within the Genesis collection.</p>
<p>The Genesis Collectibles will be backed by Bitcoin hashrate derived solely from preapproved sustainable mining farms, starting with the first Genesis collection from Blockmole.</p>
<p>CEO and founder Matt Hawkins shared his thoughts on the latest Cudo Ventures product launch:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our new product, CUDOS Markets, is not just another NFT marketplace. It&rsquo;s a platform where people can make a positive impact on the world by buying and selling sustainable NFT collectibles that are real-world assets backed by our ecofriendly Bitcoin miners. With CUDOS Markets, we&rsquo;re excited to offer a unique opportunity to combine the power of blockchain with our commitment to sustainability and social responsibility. We believe this new offering will be a game-changer for the NFT industry and beyond.&rdquo;</p>
