			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have a great future. They haven't reached their full potential yet, but they definitely will. I draw such conclusions not only from the current situation in the markets or from the systematic growth in demand for crypto, which is indeed observed. But also, by observing the positive changes in the attitude of the world's elites towards it. </p>
<p class="s3">Both financial, which already regularly report new projects like the launch of a national bitcoin exchange in Indonesia in July-2023 (confirmed by the local regulator) or the receipt of a licence to provide cryptocurrency services by a division of the French Societe Generale (SG Forge) from the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF), which cannot but please. But also, political ones, because it is on them that legislative and regulatory decisions depend, which will allow the development of the crypto industry.</p>
<p class="s3">The speech of Democratic Party member and US presidential candidate Robert Francis Kennedy Jr. (nephew of the legendary 35th U.S. President John Kennedy) at an event organised by Heal-the-Divide PAC was highly inspiring. The politician openly stated that he was willing to take steps to back the U.S. national currency with Bitcoin, and this would support the dollar's status as an international reserve currency.</p>
<p class="s3">Kennedy called Bitcoin a hard currency and put it on par with silver, gold, platinum, emphasising that such an approach would help "restore the strength of the dollar, rein in inflation and usher in a new era of financial stability, peace and prosperity for the country". This will provide at least some of the U.S. debt obligations (treasuries) with hard assets, increasing confidence in them.</p>
<p class="s3">Not only has the Democrat recognised the power of bitcoin and publicly reiterated the thesis of many crypto-activists, but he has also made it clear that he is ready to make crypto-assets a tool of public policy. This is a serious acknowledgement, which could translate into a large-scale project centered on the U.S. and the world's key currency, the dollar. </p>
<p class="s3">The second important thesis of Robert F. Kennedy concerns taxation. He announced that his administration would "exempt the conversion of Bitcoins to the U.S. dollars from capital gains taxes." In May, the American authorities had already abandoned the idea of imposing an additional 30% tax on industrial mining of cryptocurrencies, and now they are ready to liberalise the capital gains part. That will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the market, which in the U.S. is now on the brink and is very much hoping for positive changes. It is known that many have even considered the option of migration from the U.S. And so now Kennedy's statement will be received very well.</p>
<p class="s3">By the way, the presidential candidate does not just throw promises, but justifies them. It can be seen that the politician follows the situation in the industry and sentiments. Since he says that tax breaks will allow the development of jobs in the U.S. and not in Singapore, Switzerland, Germany and Portugal. He is aware about the negative sentiment in cryptocurrency circles.</p>
<p class="s3">At the moment, there are few options left in the United States that minimise taxation and do not violate current legislation. The most common are transactions through people's retirement accounts and working through the Puerto Rico, where corporations can enjoy a favourable tax rate of 4% and ordinary investors can work as qualified residents and receive a tax exemption. However, these options are not suitable for everyone. Therefore, crypto investors are increasingly looking at the possibility of working in Singapore, Portugal, Malta, and in some cases Hong Kong. There, the issue of taxation is solved more easily. </p>
<p class="s3">Robert F. Kennedy repeated his old thesis that cryptocurrencies give people freedom, freedom of choice and will. Something he spoke about at the conference in Miami (USA) in May 2023, when he recalled the story of truckers' strikes in Canada. People weren't breaking local laws, but the authorities pressed on by blocking their personal bank accounts to subjugate them - they were deprived of the ability to support their families and pay their mortgages. In fact, these are financial repressions that were applied at the state level.This is essentially financial repression that was applied at the state level. What could not have been realised with the adequate development of cryptocurrencies that can protect citizens and their freedom.</p>
<p class="s3">Freedom of money is also freedom of speech and expression of will. And these are cryptocurrencies that can provide all this, but not fiat currencies, total financial monitoring and requirements for classical financial institutions.</p>
<p class="s3">All of this has been talked about many times at crypto conferences and conventions. It is encouraging that this has finally been heard and realised by politicians at the highest level, and, most importantly, that they are not just talking, but are ready to act decisively.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The US Department of Justice announced that it had dropped the charges of illegal campaign finance activity against the FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
<p>According to a filing of July 26, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) agreed to drop one of the charges related to illegal campaign finance activity against the disgraced FTX Democrats megadonor and FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;</p>
The Crypto Robinhood Uncovered
<p>After months of investigation, it was estimated that Sam Bankman-Fried donated $93 million worth of stolen customer funds to the US politicians. The FTX founder is known as one of the largest Democratic Party donors. Some of Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s illegal contributions include donations to the 2020 Presidential campaign, as well as campaigns of the U.S. Senators and U.S. House representatives. Prosecutors suggested that the crypto mogul had made these contributions to influence the policies that could potentially benefit the crypto industry.</p>
<p>Following the sudden collapse of the Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s crypto exchange FTX due to its inability to repay the clients, it was also revealed that the company&rsquo;s former CEO had authorized the diversion of $2 billion from customers' funds to cover loans and expenses for the firm.</p>
One of the Eight Charges Dropped
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried was originally indicted on eight charges in December. One of these charges is now dropped thanks to the extradition treaty between the United States and the Bahamas. Apparently, the Bahamas submitted a filing to New York federal judge Lewis Kaplan that dropped the charges of campaign finance fraud.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice letter said, &ldquo;The Government has been informed that The Bahamas notified the United States earlier today that The Bahamas did not intend to extradite the defendant on the campaign contributions count. Accordingly, in keeping with its treaty obligations to The Bahamas, the Government does not intend to proceed to trial on the campaign contributions count.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The FTX founder will still be charged with the other seven counts present in the DOJ&rsquo;s original indictment. Those include charges regarding wire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering.&nbsp;</p>
What&rsquo;s Next for Sam Bankman-Fried?
<p>After being released on $250 million bail back in December, the bail status of Sam Bankman-Fried is now in jeopardy due to his latest interview with the New York TImes. The persecutors accused the former FTX CEO of discrediting their witness, Caroline Ellison. As a result, Bankman-Fried has agreed to an interim gag order that prevents him from publicly discussing the case. The terms of his bail now depend on federal prosecutors and attorneys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am certainly very mindful of his First Amendment rights, and I am very mindful of the government&rsquo;s interest here, which I take very seriously. And I say to the defendant, Mr. Bankman-Fried: You better take it seriously, too.&rdquo; commented Judge Kaplan.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Gofaizen &amp; Sherle has launched the new product for obtaining crypto licenses in El Salvador, expecting it to become one of the key business destinations on the crypto map. In this article, we have discussed all the necessary details that will help you launch an effective business in El Salvador quickly and easily.</p>
<p>El Salvador is rapidly emerging as a sought-after destination in the world of cryptocurrencies, particularly due to increased regulatory scrutiny in the EU and US. As these major economies tighten their regulations, businesses are exploring alternative jurisdictions, and El Salvador has become a prime choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Known for recognizing Bitcoin as legal tender and even launching cryptocurrency mining on a volcano, El Salvador has quickly gained attention in the crypto industry. The country's diverse economy, with a focus on coffee production, construction, and industrial manufacturing, has shown positive GDP growth and relatively low inflation and unemployment rates.</p>
<p>El Salvador's government actively supports the crypto industry and aims to attract foreign companies and investors. They have implemented a favorable tax system, exempting digital asset-related income and profits from taxation. Additionally, technology companies engaged in AI, app development, and digital products can enjoy a 15-year tax exemption.</p>
<p>The National Commission of Digital Assets of El Salvador (NCDA) issues licenses to virtual asset service providers (VASPs), offering a transparent and secure framework for crypto businesses. This supportive regulatory environment makes El Salvador a promising hub for the crypto community.</p>
<p>The Key Advantages of El Salvador</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Unique Taxation System Benefits VASPs: No payments required for operations with digital assets, and transactions can be conducted using Bitcoin. The nominal value, yields, and income from digital assets are tax-exempt. Capital gains and ordinary income from buying, selling, or transferring digital assets are also tax-exempt. Issuers, certifiers, and service providers of registered digital assets enjoy these tax benefits for their related activities without any obligation for tax withholding;</li>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gofaizen &amp; Sherle has launched the new product for obtaining crypto licenses in El Salvador, expecting it to become one of the key business destinations on the crypto map. In this article, we have discussed all the necessary details that will help you launch an effective business in El Salvador quickly and easily.</p>
<p>El Salvador is rapidly emerging as a sought-after destination in the world of cryptocurrencies, particularly due to increased regulatory scrutiny in the EU and US. As these major economies tighten their regulations, businesses are exploring alternative jurisdictions, and El Salvador has become a prime choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Known for recognizing Bitcoin as legal tender and even launching cryptocurrency mining on a volcano, El Salvador has quickly gained attention in the crypto industry. The country's diverse economy, with a focus on coffee production, construction, and industrial manufacturing, has shown positive GDP growth and relatively low inflation and unemployment rates.</p>
<p>El Salvador's government actively supports the crypto industry and aims to attract foreign companies and investors. They have implemented a favorable tax system, exempting digital asset-related income and profits from taxation. Additionally, technology companies engaged in AI, app development, and digital products can enjoy a 15-year tax exemption.</p>
<p>The National Commission of Digital Assets of El Salvador (NCDA) issues licenses to virtual asset service providers (VASPs), offering a transparent and secure framework for crypto businesses. This supportive regulatory environment makes El Salvador a promising hub for the crypto community.</p>
<p>The Key Advantages of El Salvador</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Unique Taxation System Benefits VASPs: No payments required for operations with digital assets, and transactions can be conducted using Bitcoin. The nominal value, yields, and income from digital assets are tax-exempt. Capital gains and ordinary income from buying, selling, or transferring digital assets are also tax-exempt. Issuers, certifiers, and service providers of registered digital assets enjoy these tax benefits for their related activities without any obligation for tax withholding;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The jurisdiction offers notably low state fees, which is highly beneficial for business activities;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">El Salvador has crypto-friendly banks, making it one of the most crucial and convenient options. This is almost a unique opportunity for a crypto project;</li>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BlackRock and India&rsquo;s Jio Financial Services will soon enter a joint venture to launch a &ldquo;digital-first offering&rdquo; in India. </p>
<p>Today, the world&rsquo;s largest asset manager, BlackRock, announced it would join Jio Financial Services (JFS) in a 50:50 joint venture to launch asset management services in India. Joi Financial Services is part of Indian tycoon Mukesh Ambani&rsquo;s Reliance Industries.</p>
<p>The venture, named &ldquo;Joi BlackRock,&rdquo; will see each company invest $150 million in the project and aims to offer &ldquo;tech-enabled&rdquo; access to &ldquo;affordable, innovative investment solutions&rdquo; to millions of Indian investors.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s press release said the project would combine BlackRock&rsquo;s &ldquo;scale and investment expertise with Joi Financial Services&rsquo; knowledge and resources&rdquo; to transform India&rsquo;s asset management industry through a digital-first offering.</p>
<p>Hitesh Sethia, President and CEO of JFS, commented:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is an exciting partnership between JFS and BlackRock, one of the largest and most respected asset management companies globally. The partnership will leverage BlackRock&rsquo;s deep expertise in investment and risk management along with the technology capability and deep market expertise of JFS to drive digital delivery of products.</p>
<p>Jio BlackRock will be a truly transformational, customer centric and digital-first enterprise with the vision to democratise access to financial investment solutions and deliver financial well-being to the doorstep of every Indian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rachel Lord, Chair and Head of APAC for BlackRock, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;India represents an enormously important opportunity. The convergence of rising affluence, favourable demographics, and digital transformation across industries is reshaping the market in incredible ways.</p>
<p>We are very excited to be partnering with JFS to revolutionise India&rsquo;s asset management industry and transform financial futures. Jio BlackRock will place the combined strength and scale of both of our companies in the hands of millions of investors in India.&rdquo;</p>

BlackRock Makes Waves
<p>The assets manager recently made headlines when it announced it had applied to a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). If the SEC approves it, BlackRock&rsquo;s iShares ETF will become the first crypto spot ETF in the US. The firm is, however, facing obstacles in the form of the SEC, and was forced to refile its application after the securities agency took issue with it.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Following the viral US Congress Hearing about UFOs, over 50 alien-themed tokens have emerged on the crypto market.</p>
The US Government Blamed for Covering up Alien Activity
<p>On July 26, the House Oversight Subcommittee on National Security held a highly-anticipated hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), commonly known as unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Three former military officials accused the US government of concealing important extraterrestrial findings.</p>
<p>According to the whistleblower David Grusch, who is a former Air Force intelligence officer, the Pentagon is covering up a &ldquo;multidecade&rdquo; UAP program which aims at collecting and restoring crashed extraterrestrial crafts. Grusch testified under oath that he is aware of an alien spacecraft in possession of the US government and the &ldquo;non-human&rdquo; biological remains that were found on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryan Graves and David Fravor, retired US Navy commanders, also claimed to have seen UAP findings while serving in the military. While speakers said they couldn&rsquo;t share too much information due to it being classified, they raised concerns over the US government hiding too much regarding the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If UAP are foreign drones, it is an urgent national security problem. If it is something else, it is an issue for science. In either case, unidentified objects are a concern for flight safety,&rdquo; said Ryan Graves.</p>

The Crypto Market Reacts to the Buzz
<p>The &ldquo;exciting&rdquo; hearing quickly went viral and became trending on Twitter and Google searches. Crypto traders couldn&rsquo;t miss the chance to capitalize on the new trend and launched over 50 alien-themed coins just over the span of 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tickers like &ldquo;ALIENX,&rdquo; &ldquo;UFO&rdquo;, and &ldquo;ALIEN&rdquo; have invaded the crypto market. However, most of these tokens haven&rsquo;t seen much trading activity so far. Only the larger and more established alien-themed coins have managed to improve their performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, the native token of the popular blockchain game Alien Worlds, known as TLM, grew by 3.5% within 24 hours after the news broke. Among other UFO memecoins that have slightly climbed during the last day are the UFO Gaming Token (UFO) which gained 2.4% and the AlienFi token (ALIEN) which surged by 5.9%.</p>
<p>Memecoins are known to quickly emerge in the midst of a growing trend. However, many of them could potentially be scams that try to take advantage of the hype. So, traders should be very careful when choosing an asset for investment.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg remains hopeful about the company&rsquo;s metaverse prospects despite sinking $3.7 billion in operating losses in the second quarter of this year.&nbsp;</p>
Meta&rsquo;s Metaverse Investment Takes a Toll
<p>The tech giant posted its latest earnings report, which revealed that it had faced significant losses in the second quarter of 2023, with metaverse-related expenses amounting to a staggering $3.74 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of its ongoing investment in the virtual reality (VR) business, Meta has already spent a total of $7.7 billion in 2023. Despite the substantial losses in its metaverse ventures, Meta managed to report an 11% increase in revenue for Q2 2023 compared to the same period last year, reaching a total revenue of $31.9 billion. This revenue growth, however, was overshadowed by the concerning performance of its metaverse-focused Reality Labs.</p>
Reality Labs Revenue Hits a Low
<p>The revenue from Reality Labs, which is responsible for Meta's metaverse initiatives, plummeted by nearly 40% compared to Q2 2022, hitting its lowest point in two years with just $276 million in revenue. Meta's financial chief, Susan Li, attributed this sharp decline to reduced sales of its VR headset, Quest 2. Additionally, the department's expenses rose by 23% to $4.0 billion, primarily due to increased staffing costs.</p>
<p>Meta anticipates further challenges for Reality Labs, with projected operating losses expected to persist throughout 2023. The losses were attributed to the ongoing development of VR-related products and continued investments in the metaverse.</p>
Stock Price Surge Despite Metaverse Woes
<p>Following the earnings announcement, Meta's stock price experienced a significant surge, rising over 7% in after-hours trading, reaching around $320, as reported by Google Finance data. Despite this recent increase, $META shares remain below their all-time high of over $378, set in September 2021. Nevertheless, the stock has gained nearly 140% year-to-date.</p>
Threads Platform Faces Challenges
<p>Zuckerberg acknowledged that while the platform had seen unexpected daily engagement, the company's primary focus was on user retention, followed by growth and eventual monetization. This statement came on the same day as a report from Similarweb, claiming that Threads had experienced a 60% decline in users since its launch. Threads initially reached 49 million daily active users on its Android app on July 7, but the numbers fell drastically to 12.6 million by July 23.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the CEO has remained hopeful about the platform&rsquo;s performance, claiming that the company strategy was &ldquo;fully committed to the metaverse vision.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Lucerne, Switzerland, July 27th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Swisstronik, the layer-1 network for building scalable, decentralized applications that ensure users&rsquo; privacy while remaining regulatory compliant, is delighted to announce the launch of its first testnet. Swisstronik Testnet 1.0 is available now, bringing immediate benefits to dApp developers including robust encryption and enterprise-grade transaction security through its utilization of Intel SGX technology.&nbsp;</p><p>The project is aiming to foster real-life adoption of blockchain through a robust, user-friendly and secure network that relies on hardware and software solutions to address challenges around legal compliance, data privacy, and interoperability. Swisstronik aims to become the preferred blockchain solution for dApp developers, individuals, enterprises and anyone else who cares about compliant and safe solutions while staying true to crypto&rsquo;s ethos of privacy and decentralization.&nbsp;</p><p>The launch of Swisstronik Testnet 1.0 comes at a time when interest in networks that can support secure, private transactions in a highly regulated environment is growing. Existing privacy solutions are too focused on anonymity, which is anathema to regulations. Amid the tightening regulations around crypto globally, increased regulatory action against cryptocurrency exchanges and early adoption of central bank digital coins (CBDCs), it&rsquo;s clear that the crypto industry urgently requires a compliant yet privacy-preserving, decentralized alternative. Once CBDCs launch, the industry will require a compliant and compatible bridge between them and the rest of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This is the gap Swisstronik is aiming to fill with its identity-based blockchain platform powered by the first of its kind Web3 Compliance Suite - a self-regulating network of local personal data verifiers and compliance partners that allows seamless yet compliant cross-border operations..&nbsp;</p><p>Swisstronik&rsquo;s Compliance Suite is created to reduce any company's regulatory burden by doing compliance management in a more cost-effective and user-centered manner to ensure privacy and safety for every user. Moreover, because all interactions are executed inside fully encrypted Intel SGX enclaves, Swisstronik nodes cannot access the details of any transaction. The SGX enclaves can be likened to creating a protective wrapper around the EVM, ensuring all transaction information is hidden from the rest of the network. It means every transaction on Swisstronik&rsquo;s blockchain is fully isolated and safeguarded from prying eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>In a future update, Swisstronik will bolster its privacy and security features with the addition of zk-SNARKs &ndash; cryptographic proofs that allow one party to provably verify information without having to reveal it. Based on zero-knowledge proofs, zk-SNARKs will be especially useful for verifying KYC data and other personal information of users.&nbsp;</p><p>Swisstronik Testnet 1.0 is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) standard, meaning developers can seamlessly migrate Ethereum-based dApps and smart contracts to its ecosystem. Future versions of the Swisstronik Testnet will implement the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, further enhancing the interoperability among Cosmos based-blockchains.&nbsp;</p><p>Swisstronik anticipates a great deal of interest among dApp developers looking to build compliant offerings and explore data security concepts such as Intel SGX and zk-SNARKs, having received more than 750+ applications for early access to its testnet, despite not making any active efforts to promote the network.&nbsp;</p><p>To ensure the integrity of its testnet and increase confidence within the community, Swisstronik is delighted to announce the launch of its first Bug Bounty campaign, with a $70,000 reward fund. The campaign will end on September 15, 2023, after which any bugs found will be fixed before the launch of Swisstronik Testnet 2.0 in the autumn.&nbsp;</p><p>About Swisstronik</p><p>Swisstronik is building a scalable layer-1 network to address challenges around legal compliance, data privacy, and interoperability in order to boost real-life adoption of the blockchain. Its goal is to become the go-to solution for developers building compliant, privacy-preserving dApps and cryptocurrency users who value data protection and transaction secrecy.&nbsp;</p><p>Swisstronik is the first platform that lets anyone build compliant yet private dApps with zero legal expertise. It does so with an unprecedented combination of two functionalities &ndash; a first of its kind Web3 Compliance Suite that gathers international regulators, KYC issuers and other legal service providers in a self-regulating network, and combination of programmable, hardware-based protection technology based on Intel SGX, and cryptographic techniques based on zero-knowledge proofs. As a result, Web3 companies can become KYC, AML and DPR compliant with minimum costs by launching on Swisstronik or integrating one of its utilities in their dApps on other chains. And users can be sure their data stays private &amp; secure even during identity checks.</p><p>Twitter - Linkedin - Telegram - Discord - Github</p>ContactMarketing DirectorAlexandra SerebrennikovaAlexandra.s@swisstronik.com]]></description>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Two popular meme coins, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have recorded huge price dips, leaving investors on edge. However, amidst this uncertainty, a new memecoin called Pomerdoge has emerged, generating excitement and gaining traction as the potential frontrunner for the best investment of 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale</p>
<p>Analysts Tags Pomerdoge (POMD) Best 2023 Investment</p>
<p>As meme coins continue to rise, new projects are springing up with new uses and access to untapped industries. One such project is Pomerdoge. Pomerdoge will be a P2E game that will connect players from all corners of the globe. The Pomerdoge ecosystem will have three key components; NFT collections, Pomergame (an immersive game center with rewards and compensation), and Pomerplace (a marketplace for the buying, selling, and trading of valuable in-game items).</p>
<p>One of the notable highlights of Pomerdoge lies in its unwavering commitment to security and user protection. Currently, Pomerdoge is in the initial phase of its token presale and is available at only $0.0000264 per token. Those who jump in now will benefit from the upcoming 40x price surge and receive profits based on their holdings.</p>
Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Dips Despite New Development&nbsp;
<p>As Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to make its mark in the crypto-sphere, Shiba Inu's (SHIB) ecosystem lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, has announced that Shibarium will launch in August. Despite the news, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is still trading between $0.0000072 and $0.0000078, following recent price advancements last week. However, to experience an upward surge, Shiba Inu (SHIB) needs to overcome a supply barrier near the $0.000008 level, where 91,460 addresses hold a considerable amount of SHIB.</p>
<p>At present, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a 5.24% drop in the last 24 hours, resting at $0.0000072. Notably, IntoTheBlock's Global In/Out of the Money indicates a significant supply barrier in the $0.000008 to $0.000014 range. Many Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors have purchased SHIB at an average price of $0.000010, with 400,380 addresses holding 286.42 trillion SHIB. A successful breakthrough of this barrier could potentially propel Shiba Inu (SHIB) toward the $0.000014 to $0.000019 range.</p>
Is Dogecoin (DOGE) Losing Relevance?
<p>In 2021, Dogecoin (DOGE) emerged as a remarkable meme cryptocurrency, capturing widespread attention and reaching its peak of $0.7376 in May. The excitement surrounding Dogecoin (DOGE) was amplified by endorsements from prominent figures like Elon Musk, whose acquisition of Twitter in 2022 triggered multiple price surges for the memecoin.</p>
<p>Over time, Dogecoin (DOGE) climbed the crypto ladder, thanks to support from the Dogecoin (DOGE) community, and is now the eighth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. However, the fortunes of Dogecoin (DOGE) took a turn after its all-time high. The bankruptcy of several cryptocurrency firms in 2022 further impacted Dogecoin's (DOGE) price. Presently, Dogecoin (DOGE) is being traded at $0.065436, exhibiting a modest increase of 0.25% within the last 24 hours.</p>
Conclusion&nbsp;
<p>Amid the price declines for Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), the emergence of Pomerdoge has reignited investors' interest in meme coins. The prospect of Pomerdoge surpassing these top guns in the market has generated interest from investors. Pomerdoge's utility and connection to the gaming sector which houses millions of users can help propel POMD's price in the ongoing run, making it an enticing investment opportunity.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two popular meme coins, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have recorded huge price dips, leaving investors on edge. However, amidst this uncertainty, a new memecoin called Pomerdoge has emerged, generating excitement and gaining traction as the potential frontrunner for the best investment of 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Analysts Tags Pomerdoge (POMD) Best 2023 Investment</p>
<p>As meme coins continue to rise, new projects are springing up with new uses and access to untapped industries. One such project is Pomerdoge. Pomerdoge will be a P2E game that will connect players from all corners of the globe. The Pomerdoge ecosystem will have three key components; NFT collections, Pomergame (an immersive game center with rewards and compensation), and Pomerplace (a marketplace for the buying, selling, and trading of valuable in-game items).</p>
<p>One of the notable highlights of Pomerdoge lies in its unwavering commitment to security and user protection. Currently, Pomerdoge is in the initial phase of its token presale and is available at only $0.0000264 per token. Those who jump in now will benefit from the upcoming 40x price surge and receive profits based on their holdings.</p>
Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Dips Despite New Development&nbsp;
<p>As Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to make its mark in the crypto-sphere, Shiba Inu's (SHIB) ecosystem lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, has announced that Shibarium will launch in August. Despite the news, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is still trading between $0.0000072 and $0.0000078, following recent price advancements last week. However, to experience an upward surge, Shiba Inu (SHIB) needs to overcome a supply barrier near the $0.000008 level, where 91,460 addresses hold a considerable amount of SHIB.</p>
<p>At present, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a 5.24% drop in the last 24 hours, resting at $0.0000072. Notably, IntoTheBlock's Global In/Out of the Money indicates a significant supply barrier in the $0.000008 to $0.000014 range. Many Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors have purchased SHIB at an average price of $0.000010, with 400,380 addresses holding 286.42 trillion SHIB. A successful breakthrough of this barrier could potentially propel Shiba Inu (SHIB) toward the $0.000014 to $0.000019 range.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In an eventful week for the crypto market, Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) have surged by over 50%. Meanwhile, Tradecurve (TCRV), currently in its presale phase, is eyeing an astounding 50x pump. This article will delve into the factors driving the surges in Solana and Ripple, and explore why Tradecurve is predicted to make such a significant splash.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Solana (SOL): Empowering DeFi and NFTs with Blazing Fast Transactions
<p>Solana (SOL)'s price suffered a significant downturn in 2022 due to a mishap involving FTX and multiple network security vulnerabilities. The speculation was rife that FTX was the driving force behind Solana's bull run, and when FTX went bust, the Solana ecosystem took a hit.</p>
<p>Following this, Solana showed signs of resilience, inching close to the $25 mark in early 2023. However, the recovery was short-lived due to an SEC investigation into alleged unregistered security offerings, leading to another price retreat of over 27%.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the present, and Solana has finally managed to pierce through the $25 resistance. The asset moved from $21 to $32 in just two days &mdash; gains of 50% for Solana investors who had held the asset through thick and thin.</p>
<p>Analysts note the breakout above the $22-25 level is significant. They also expect a further rally to $40 in the coming weeks for Solana. However, Solana still relies on Bitcoin (BTC) movements. As such, any pullback in the leading cryptocurrency&rsquo;s price could dampen the bullish sentiment.</p>
Ripple (XRP) Surge Over 50%: Resurgence of the Digital Payment Giant
<p>The SEC's ruling has finally laid to rest the debate surrounding Ripple (XRP). The verdict: it is NOT a security, and as such Ripple can be traded freely across US markets without fear of regulatory repercussions.</p>
<p>In response to the announcement on July 13, Ripple's price soared by almost 100% within a single day. However, the initial euphoria among Ripple investors has since settled down, with the price of Ripple correcting to a current price of $0.76 after peaking at $0.94</p>
<p>At present, Ripple traders are closely monitoring the $0.73 level, which is considered a significant support point for Ripple. If the price were to fall below this level, we could see a further correction for Ripple, possibly down to the $0.55 range.</p>
Tradecurve (TCRV) Eyes 50x Presale Pump: Unraveling the Potential
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) represents a cutting-edge evolution in trading platforms. It marries the advantages of both centralized and decentralized exchanges through its unique hybrid model. Its broad trading portfolio spans commodities, stocks, forex, and beyond. They encapsulate a robust variety of financial instruments.</p>
<p>A standout feature of Tradecurve is its departure from the standard, often cumbersome, KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures. This allows traders to seamlessly navigate global financial markets without navigating identity verification steps that are typical on many platforms.</p>
<p>But the innovative elements of Tradecurve don't stop there. The platform comes with AI-enhanced algorithmic trading, trading leverage up to 500:1, and access to social trading services. Furthermore, it hosts a metaverse-based trading academy, offering an immersive educational experience for traders</p>
<p>Demand for TCRV during the Tradecurve presale is skyrocketing. This is with more than 100 million TCRV tokens sold and a price increase of 150% from $0.010 to $0.025 in just a few months.</p>
<p>Market analysts suggest this might be the tip of the iceberg for Tradecurve's upward trajectory. In fact, they are projecting the potential for TCRV to soar to $1.00 following its listing on major exchanges later this year.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. confirmed his recent purchase of a significant amount of Bitcoin earlier this year.</p>
Putting His Money Where His Mouth Is
<p>Kennedy had been previously criticized for publicly endorsing BTC at the Bitcoin Miami Conference in May. During a Twitter Space session on July 26, he revealed that he is not promoting an idea he does not believe in, as he has purchased 2 BTCs for each of his seven children. This disclosure marks the first time Kennedy has acknowledged owning cryptocurrency and aligns with his stance on promoting Bitcoin's potential benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the interview, Kennedy reiterated his support for backing the U.S. dollar with Bitcoin and exempting the asset from capital gains taxes if he becomes President. He believes that Bitcoin can drive innovation in America.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, he emphasized that capital gains exemptions on Bitcoin conversions should be limited to smaller investors and businesses, avoiding windfalls for large corporations like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs.</p>
Buying BTC In Response To Criticism&nbsp;
<p>The decision to invest in Bitcoin came as a response to critics who accused him of promoting a "volatile commodity" without having any personal stake in it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kennedy explained his reasoning, saying,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Right after that Bitcoin conference I got a big check and I said, okay, you know, I'm going to put my money where my mouth is and so I bought two Bitcoin for every one of my seven children&hellip;Now I&rsquo;m a Bitcoin owner, and I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll now find a different way to come at me, but no one can say I didn&rsquo;t put my money where my mouth is."</p>

<p>Kennedy has six biological children, four sons and two daughters, aged 22 to 38. His seventh child is likely from his marriage to actress Cheryl Hines, who had one daughter prior to their marriage in 2014.</p>
Previously Denied Holding BTC
<p>During his speech at the conference in May, Kennedy denied any personal investment in cryptocurrency, stating that he was not an investor and not offering investment advice. However, a leaked financial disclosure later revealed that he held "between $100,001 and $250,000" worth of Bitcoin at the end of June.</p>
<p>Based on available information, if Kennedy bought a total of 14 Bitcoin at an approximate price of $26,800 shortly after the conference, his holdings by the end of June would have exceeded $380,000. As of the time of publication, Bitcoin's price stands at $29,327, indicating that Kennedy's investment is currently worth around $410,000.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has intensified its oversight of financial institutions that use AI and predictive algorithms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the SEC, its proposed regulatory measures signal its intent to ensure that AI applications are used in a manner that safeguards the interest of investors and maintains market integrity.</p>
<p>However, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce was scathing once again of what she sees as the Commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;distorted thinking&rdquo;, referring to her belief that Chair Gensler&rsquo;s approach is that investors can&rsquo;t think for themselves.</p>
<p>She goes a step further when she makes the accusation that the proposal &ldquo;reflects a hostility toward technology&rdquo;, highlighting that this antagonism is directed at predictive data analytics (PDA) such as AI, machine learning, or deep learning algorithms, neural networks, natural language processing (NLP), as well as other technologies.</p>
<p>She disregards the SEC view that it is &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; on technology by saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Requiring firms to subject certain types of technologies to a uniquely onerous review and conflict remediation process is not technology neutral. Let us be honest about what we are doing here: banning technologies we do not like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peirce also rejected the SEC dismissive approach to disclosure within the proposal, when it makes the assumption that &ldquo;disclosure is of no use to investors&rdquo;, remarking that &ldquo;the whole premise of our disclosure regime is that investors can think for themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She makes the case that the proposal just doesn&rsquo;t take into account &ldquo;operational feasibility&rdquo;, saying that broker dealers and investment advisors would have to carry out a &ldquo;conflict identification process&rdquo; with &ldquo;Eye-wateringly detailed written policies and procedures&rdquo; for evaluating potential conflicts and how they would be dealt with.</p>
<p>Once again, Hester Peirce has taken her own agency to task for what she sees as an over-complicated proposal that is likely to put smaller businesses off of using the technologies in question, and in her view is generally not needed.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Multichain bridge, one of the oldest and more established token bridges used in DeFi, has suffered a $126 million loss in July, making it one of the larger bridge hacks in history.</p>
<p>But this one is different from previous hacks like the Nomad bridge. No code was really compromised, as reportedly the assets were taken by the CEO&rsquo;s sister. Multichain&rsquo;s CEO, known only as Zhaojun, was apparently apprehended by Chinese authorities a few weeks prior.</p>
<p>The CEO&rsquo;s disappearance wreaked havoc on the team&rsquo;s operations, according to their own report. Zhaojun held several important keys that were important for the operation and maintenance of the protocol. According to the explanation published by the Multichain team, they had asked his sister for access to these keys via cloud backups. Allegedly, she then took the money &ldquo;for safekeeping&rdquo; only to be arrested herself shortly after.</p>
<p>The incident highlighted what some industry experts and insiders knew all along: Multichain was an extremely centralized bridge, which literally ceased to function as soon as its CEO became unavailable. For a crypto project, this is a damning story &mdash; even traditional corporations are more decentralized than that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why this wasn&rsquo;t spotted</p>
<p>Given these revelations, it seems surprising that people trusted Multichain enough to have hundreds of millions of dollars deposited on the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Venket Naga, CEO at blockchain privacy-preserving platform, Serenity Shield, gave a few ideas how this might have happened. &ldquo;First, the code's complexity may have made it challenging for non-experts to identify potential loopholes. Second, there might have been limited transparency and auditing, allowing crucial issues to go unnoticed,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>Because of their cross-chain nature, bridges are often a black box. Even though Multichain&rsquo;s core architecture is open-source, the complexity of these systems means that it&rsquo;s difficult to have a good understanding of how it&rsquo;s all implemented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trust in the code's integrity might have been assumed, neglecting the need for robust security assessments,&rdquo; added Naga. &ldquo;Moving forward, conducting comprehensive audits, fostering transparency, and engaging the community are crucial to prevent similar situations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bridge Choice 101</p>
<p>Bridge vulnerabilities are a common theme in Web3, and many teams deemed competent and reputable suffered enormous losses. So how can an average user try to avoid these incidents and spot unsafe bridges from further away?</p>
<p>There is no perfect standard, but ideally it should be a mix of robust decentralization, simple architecture and good history of operation.</p>
<p>For example, for bridges running on some form of trusted validators (which applies to most of them), you would expect that these entities should be well-known, and at least somewhat separate from the bridge&rsquo;s creators.</p>
<p>Architecture-wise, most bridges today are quite simple contracts based on multi-signature cryptography. More decentralized options have emerged from time to time, most notably Nomad. Unfortunately, these solutions are more complex, so this bridge got hacked because of one poorly implemented line of code.</p>
<p>A good indicator is time. Poor bridges fail and only the sturdy options remain after some time &mdash; though Multichain is a significant exception to this rule. Many existing bridges have already gone through hacks, notably Wormhole. At the time, the project got &ldquo;bailed out&rdquo; by Jump Crypto, which allowed it to resume operations and re-establish some level of trust.</p>
<p>But this apparent &ldquo;insurance&rdquo; shouldn&rsquo;t be taken for granted. According to Brandon Brown, CEO and Co-Founder of personal wallet theft protection FairSide, &ldquo;bridges present complex challenges for cover providers due to centralization and the risks associated with smart contracts.</p>
<p>Bridges are a crucial aspect of blockchain usage, but their implementation leaves much to be desired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To rebuild trust in blockchain bridges, a comprehensive approach is crucial,&rdquo; according to Naga. &ldquo;Implementing enhanced security measures, transparent bridge design and operations, rigorous audits, and involving the community in governance are essential.</p>

<p>For Broen, &ldquo;innovative solutions are emerging, such as Axelar's Interchain, which offer promising potential in mitigating the inherent risks of interoperability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hopefully, these solutions come sooner rather than later.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The EOS Network Foundation is forging ahead with a milestone legal challenge against former EOS developer Block.one, which it accuses of failing to uphold a promise to invest $1 billion in the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a legal update published July 26, ENF CEO Yves La Rose said the failure of Block.one to live up to its promises is one of the biggest issues facing the EOS Network community. Later that day, La Rose tweeted that the community has a choice of three legal avenues they can pursue in order to seek compensation from the developer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Decision Time For EOS Investors
<p>The first option is to join the ENF&rsquo;s existing U.S. class action lawsuit, which was filed against Block.one several years prior. According to La Rose, the ENF is on the verge of settling with Block.one for the sum of $22 million. EOS community members have until August 23, 2023 to decide whether they&rsquo;d like to join this class action suit, or opt out and pursue other legal options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By joining the class action, investors would forfeit their right to make any other future claims against Block.one. This is legally binding as the class action includes a clause that shields Block.one from any further action against it by those who participate. Those interested in either joining the suit or opting out should contact James Koutoulas at james@koutoulaslaw.com.</p>
<p>Anyone who purchased EOS tokens or ERC-20 tokens directly from Block.one or certain cryptocurrency exchanges between June 26, 2017 and May 18, 2020 could be eligible to participate in the U.S. class action, La Rose said. More information on the lawsuit and its eligibility requirements can be found here.</p>
<p>As an alternative, La Rose said Nemesis Venture Capital is pursuing a separate agreement with Block.one on behalf of EOS community members that choose to opt out of the ENF&rsquo;s class action. La Rose said it&rsquo;s likely that anyone interested in seeking compensation through this avenue would need to opt out of the U.S. lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third option for investors is not guaranteed at this time. Apparently, the ENF is exploring the possibility of filing a separate claim against Block.one in the Cayman Islands, and once again, investors would need to opt out of the U.S. class action to pursue this alternative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Early EOS investors therefore face a tough decision. The ENF&rsquo;s U.S. class action is expected to settle on September 30, 2023 and is likely to result in participants receiving compensation soon. However, investors who decide to pursue one of the other legal alternatives could potentially receive much more, though there is a risk that the action may fail and they end up with nothing.&nbsp;</p>
Why Is This Happening?
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ENF has been engaged in a long and bitter struggle against Block.one to receive compensation for those who invested in EOS during its initial coin offering back in 2018. At the time, EOS raised a record $4.1 billion through the ICO. Many felt the network was uniquely positioned to rival Ethereum as the number one smart contract network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately for EOS&rsquo;s backers, the project struggled to live up to its billing. A lack of development and a failure to meet the milestones on its original roadmap meant EOS fell behind not only Ethereum, but also many other emerging blockchains. By 2020, the EOS token&rsquo;s value had fallen to a fraction of its ICO price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EOS community placed the blame on Block.one, the project&rsquo;s lead developer, saying it had failed to invest the promised $1 billion in the network. After waiting several years for Block.one to get its act together, the EOS community ultimately took matters into its own hands. This led to the birth of the EOS Network Foundation, led by La Rose, who was previously the CEO of an EOS block producer called EOS Nation. Soon after it was founded in August 2021, the ENF began plotting to displace Block.one and take control of the EOS network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>La Rose collaborated with other EOS block producers on a plan to create a hard fork of the EOS network, which was done in September 2022, a day now known as &ldquo;EOS Independence Day&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then, the ENF has focused its energy on revamping EOS so it can genuinely compete with Ethereum and other chains, and it has made great progress over the last two years. Even so, the ENF refused to let Block.one to escape punishment, pursuing legal action to force it to account for its lack of investment.&nbsp;</p>
Possible Implications For Crypto?
<p>The outcome of the ENF &ndash; Block.one dispute could have some serious consequences for the wider blockchain community, due to its focus on a developer not honoring its commitments to investors. Many times, crypto investors have had little to no recourse when they invest in projects that fail due to the lack of effort by its developers, or in some cases, outright scams. This case could therefore set a legal precedent that enables other investors to seek damages in similar situations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, the outcome of the ENF&rsquo;s legal proceedings against Block.one could lead to major changes in the way crypto fundraising activities are conducted, hence the industry is watching very closely to see how it develops.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto payments platform CoinsPaid believes North Korean Lazarus Group was behind the hack that saw $37 million stolen from the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform has restarted operations after halting them in the wake of the hack and has proposed a roundtable with other victims of the Lazarus Group.&nbsp;</p>
Lazarus Group Behind Hack&nbsp;
<p>CoinsPaid had halted all operations following the hack that hit the platform on the 22nd of July, with hackers stealing over $37 million. In a post published on the 26th of July, the company pointed at the dreaded Lazarus Group, accusing it of orchestrating the hack while announcing the resumption of processing services. The company stated in the post,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the 22nd of July, CoinsPaid experienced a hacker attack, resulting in the theft of USD 37.3M. We suspect Lazarus Group, one of the most powerful hacker organizations, is responsible. In response to the attack, the company&rsquo;s dedicated team of experts has worked tirelessly to fortify our systems and minimize the impact, leaving Lazarus with a record-low reward. Indeed, our security measures and procedures allowed CoinsPaid to prevent higher loss of funds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Lazarus Group has become one of the most feared hacker organizations and has targeted some of the biggest companies in the world, including Sony, Alphapo, Atomic Wallet, Horizon Bridge, and Axie Infinity. The Axie Infinity hack alone saw the group steal a staggering $625 million.&nbsp;</p>
Customer Funds Secure&nbsp;
<p>The post also confirmed that the platform had resumed operations in a new, secure, and limited environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the partial downtime, our services are getting up and running one by one in the new secured environment. We expect it to take a few more days to sort out minor details and ensure the system works smoothly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The firm assured users that their funds were safe. However, it acknowledged that the company&rsquo;s balance sheet had taken a considerable hit. Despite the loss, the company believes that Lazarus was hoping to extract a much larger sum from the platform, but the company&rsquo;s team of experts was able to thwart their attempts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We believe Lazarus expected the attack on CoinsPaid to be much more successful. In response to the attack, the company&rsquo;s dedicated team of experts has worked tirelessly to fortify our systems and minimize the impact, leaving Lazarus with a record-low reward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>CoinsPaid&rsquo;s preliminary investigation was assisted by blockchain security firms, including Match Systems, Chainalysis, and Crystal. CoinsPaid CEO Max Krupyshev stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;CoinsPaid will recover and continue delivering first-class innovative payment solutions despite the incident. We have no doubt the hackers won&rsquo;t escape justice.&rdquo;</p>

Roundtable With Other Victims&nbsp;
<p>According to the online coding platform GitHub, the Lazarus Group is actively targeting entities and users in the crypto and cybersecurity space. Cybersecurity platform Socket.Dev outlined how the hacker group targets users by compromising their accounts through Malware. According to Socket.Dev, the first point of contact are social media platforms such as WhatsApp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just last month, Elliptic, a blockchain forensics firm, revealed that the group had managed to hack Atomic Wallet, with the platform losing around $100 million. Meanwhile, online crypto sleuth ZachXBT revealed that the Alphapo hack resulted in a loss of $60 million. The Alphapo hack also impacted CoinsPaid, as the two organizations are closely associated with one another. CoinsPaid revealed that it would be organizing a roundtable with other victims of the Lazarus Group and launching an initiative to minimize such attacks in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Within a few weeks, CoinsPaid will organize a round table with all the Lazarus victims to announce a new initiative aimed at minimizing and preventing such attacks in the future. We urge Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, Bitfinex, OKX, and others to participate in this vital process.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s announcement of the widely expected 25 basis point rise in the interest rate led to a higher move in cryptocurrencies.</p>
No surprises in FOMC meeting
<p>There was probably never going to be any surprises yesterday for the interest rate or indeed for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell&rsquo;s performance afterwards. The 25 basis point rate rise was announced, and Powell didn&rsquo;t say anything to make markets jittery.</p>
<p>Powell commented on what he saw as &ldquo;robust&rdquo; job gains over recent months leading to low unemployment. However, he did remark that the Fed &ldquo;remains highly attentive to inflation risks&rdquo;, no doubt taking into account the rise in energy prices once again.</p>
<p>Therefore, from a crypto point of view, things were quite stable and prices moved up as a result, albeit not in a particularly strong fashion. After a bit of a dump on Monday, the trend has remained to the upside.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is continuing to follow an up channel on the short time frame, although having fallen out of the range it has been in for the last month, the current move may just be to confirm the bottom of this range as new resistance.</p>
Altcoin breakouts
<p>Given that they have been trending lower for quite a few days now, certain altcoins look to have taken a lot more advantage than Bitcoin of the fairly meek and mild FOMC meeting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solana ($SOL) broke out of its downtrend and recorded a strong 8% surge on the day. The move has broken through the resistance at $25 and so it now remains to be seen if this can be held, giving $SOL a firm base on which to move higher.</p>
<p>Chainlink ($LINK) was another vigorous mover. The oracle play shifted 4.8% to the upside yesterday, and has continued the positive price action so far today with a further 2.4%. Traversing in a range since early May, $LINK looks to be regaining the mid-point of this range before perhaps attempting the range top at $9.50.</p>
<p>Dogecoin ($DOGE) was one of the only cryptocurrencies to sink on Wednesday, down 4.75% on the day. However, this was on the back of a very strong surge from Elon Musk&rsquo;s favoured coin which had taken it as far as 19% up at one point on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thursday&rsquo;s price action is positive once more. A bounce from the 200-day moving average has sent it to test the resistance at $0.078 once again.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The United States House Financial Services Committee has cleared two key crypto regulatory bills that could finally provide much-needed regulatory clarity to the space in the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the bills cleared includes the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, introduced by Majority Whip Tom Emmer back in March.&nbsp;</p>
The Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act&nbsp;
<p>Majority Whip Tom Emmer introduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act. The bill states that blockchain developers and service providers that do not hold custody of user assets cannot be classified as money transmitters. The bipartisan bill is co-led by Representative Darren Soto. Emmer and Soto also serve as the co-Chairs of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus. Talking about the bill, Emmer had stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crypto and blockchain technology, by nature, does not easily fit into the frameworks policymakers have considered when crafting regulations in the past. For too long, federal regulators and lawmakers have jammed the blockchain ecosystem into statutory definitions that just do not make sense. It should be simple: If you don&rsquo;t custody consumer funds, you aren&rsquo;t a money transmitter. My bill provides that necessary confirmation for the blockchain community.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmer also talked about how the delay in providing clarity for the crypto ecosystem in the United States risks driving the technology overseas at the cost of domestic users and investors. Emmer stated that the bill would go a long way in helping America become a leader in the crypto space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The longer we delay providing this commonsense clarification, the greater risk that this transformative technology is driven overseas, depriving domestic users and investors. This bill will help America remain a technological leader in the crypto space.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As co-Chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, Soto had also extended his support to the bill.&nbsp;</p>
A Way Towards Regulatory Clarity?&nbsp;
<p>Most US lawmakers voted in favor of Emmer&rsquo;s Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act and the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. The House Financial Services Committee had approved the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act in a 35-15 vote. The bill aims to establish clear rules for crypto firms on registering with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) or the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with the passage of the bill announced via Twitter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a historic first, the House Financial Services Committee just advanced the BIPARTISAN FIT for the 21st Century Act to protect consumers and provide clear rules of the road for the digital asset ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bill also provides a clear process for crypto firms to certify that their projects are adequately decentralized with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This would allow them to register their digital assets as a digital commodity with the CFTC. French Hill, a Republican Congressman who also served as the Vice Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, stated that he was happy the bill passed with bipartisan support.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have crafted landmark legislation that establishes robust consumer protections and clear rules of the road for market participants while keeping innovation in the United States.&rdquo;</p>

A Big Win For The US&nbsp;
<p>The bipartisan Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act sets guidelines that remove excessive requirements for blockchain developers and service providers. Tom Emmer called the bill&rsquo;s passing a &ldquo;huge win&rdquo; for the US, explaining that the bill clarifies what entities in the blockchain space come under the definition of &ldquo;money transmitters.&rdquo; Emmer added that if passed in the House of Representatives, the bill will help establish that if companies do not custody customer funds, they will not be classified as a money transmitter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;BREAKING: My nonpartisan bill &ndash; the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act &ndash; just passed out of the @FinancialCmte. This is a huge win for the United States as we are one step closer to putting Americans in the driver&rsquo;s seat in crafting the future peer-to-peer digital economy.&rdquo;</p>

A Divided House&nbsp;
<p>Despite the passage of these crucial bills, there are considerable divisions among Republicans and Democrats when it comes to crypto. A third piece of legislation called the Digital Assets Market Structure Bill failed to pass, with several Republicans and Democrats refusing to support the bill. Maxine Waters, a Democratic Representative, was extremely critical of the bill, accusing it of ignoring regulatory guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission and furthering the interests of the crypto space while failing to adhere to clear guidelines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I have said before, we don&rsquo;t need to invent new regulatory structures simply because crypto companies refuse to follow rules of the road. Our securities laws have protected investors and retirees for 90 years while supporting capital formation and facilitating innovation.&rdquo;</p>
