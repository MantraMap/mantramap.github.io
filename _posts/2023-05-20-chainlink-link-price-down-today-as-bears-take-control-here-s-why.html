LINK is also recording a sideways trend on the daily chart, and its trading volume has also tanked by over 32%.  The recent price action is primarily influenced by macroeconomic factors such as inflation, regulatory laws and investor sentiment. LINK Price Analysis LINK is in a sideways trend today, forming a red candle on the daily chart. It is trading below its 50-day and 200-Simple Moving Averages (SMA), a short and long-term bearish sentiment. Also, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 41.30 and dropping out of the neutral zone to the oversold region of 30, confirming the bearish trend. LINK&#8217;s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is just above its signal line and shows convergence, a bearish signal. Also, the MACD indicator displays a negative value. LINK is just above its nearest support level of $6.362, which has proved critical after the 6.177 price level provided initial support. However, its signals on the daily chart look bearish, hinting at a further price drop for the asset. However, if the bulls mount a rally, LINK will encounter resistance at the $6.753 and the $6.907 price levels. LINK enjoyed a positive price movement in 2023. However, the bears are currently controlling the market. It will likely drop into an oversold region before the bulls rally again.
