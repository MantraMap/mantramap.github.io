<p>The new Celsius company will operate Celsius' mining operations while taking over private equity, institutional loans, and venture capital investments. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/crypto-celsius-new-user-company/">Bankrupt Crypto Lender Celsius Network Plans New User-Owned Company</a></p>
<p>As per the latest Bloomberg report bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network LLC has started polling its account holders to restart a new user-owned company.</p>
<p>Soon after getting approval from US Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn, Celsius Networks will start sending ballots to account holders. Along with sending ballots to account holders, Celsius will provide voting materials with clear explanations about the company&#8217;s plans to repay its customers.</p>
<p>Judge Martin Glenn mentioned that he will give his approval if the company advisors give more details about the ups and downs of the crypto industry and any difficulties that might affect Celsius&#8217; crypto mining activities. Crypto lender Celsius Network filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last year following the collapse of the Terra ecosystem.</p>
<p>However, under the leadership of Arrington Capital, the company is planning a fresh start. Arrington Capital had won the crypto lender&#8217;s assets at a bankruptcy auction earlier this year.</p>
<h2>How Shall Celsius Network Repay Customers?</h2>
<p>In the latest hearing, Celsius lawyer Chris Koenig said that the company is on track to repay customers by the end of this year. The bankrupt crypto lender shall repay its customers by offering equity in the new company.</p>
<p>This company will operate Celsius&#8217; mining operations while taking over private equity, institutional loans, and venture capital investments along with $500 million in “liquid cryptocurrency” investments, notes the court documents.</p>
<p>However, Judge Glenn stated that there&#8217;s still a lot of work pending to proceed with the plan. Additionally, some of the customers at Celsius Network have opposed this repayment plan while other creditors could potentially challenge it in court.</p>
<h2>Creditors of Crypto Lender Celsius Voice Displeasure</h2>
<p>As Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-14/celsius-to-poll-customers-on-launching-new-user-owned-company" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a>, individual creditors have voiced displeasure over Celsius&#8217; repayment plan. They think that they are being forced to take an equity stake in a risky new company. A number of customers have expressed the view that Celsius should return their native CEL tokens and are against the company&#8217;s proposal to value CEL tokens at 25 cents each.</p>
<p>However, Judge Glenn has outrightly denied that Celsius account holders won&#8217;t get their CEL tokens back. The Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) has claimed that Celsius and its former CEO treated CEL similarly to stock in a public company, which is typically affected in Chapter 11 proceedings. The issuance of CEL tokens might not be possible since they relied on Celsius&#8217; value, and after Chapter 11, there might not be a Celsius entity anymore, as Judge Glenn stated.</p>

<p>It is very likely that Kraken Ventures will support many projects rather than making a few large-sized investments.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/kraken-ventures-100m-crypto-businesses/">Kraken Ventures Floats $100M to Support &#8216;Early Stage&#8217; Crypto Businesses</a></p>
<p>Kraken Ventures, the investment arm of one of the world&#8217;s leading crypto exchanges, is set to raise $100 million as its second fund. This comes barely two years after its first raise of $65 million back in December 2021.</p>
<p>According to the investment firm, the new fund it proposes would be targeted at early-stage founders. However, it will not be a one-time investment, says Brandon Gath, managing partner for Kraken Ventures. While the fund must have been dispensed to a business at the startup stage, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/kraken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kraken</a> would continue to offer support to the business through its journey. Gath wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Kraken Ventures’ (KV) next fund will double down on our existing thesis and continue to support founders through their full journey from initial capital to IPO.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Kraken Ventures to Invest in Numerous Projects</h2>
<p>According to Gath, Kraken has been involved in “hundreds of early-stage investments”. But its next fund is still a major deal considering that it is a massive upgrade to its previous fund. More so, the venture market for blockchain and crypto-based projects has been somewhat on a general decline.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Kraken Ventures will be seeking to support as many startups as possible with the fund. Per Gath, Kraken Ventures already operates on the belief that “smaller funds best serve entrepreneurs”. And also added that there is overwhelming data evidence that shows that, truly, “small funds outperform large funds”. Therefore, it is very likely that Kraken support many projects with the fund rather than making a few large-sized investments.</p>
<p>So far, Kraken Ventures has reportedly funded no less than 32 companies, with a major percentage of the investments being Series A funding.</p>
<p>It might however be worth mentioning that Kraken&#8217;s investments are not limited to blockchain/crypto-based projects alone. According to its website, it invests in both fintech and crypto-focused businesses. And one of its fintech investments was recently <a href="https://twitter.com/Parsers_vc/status/1691141408332066825?t=j0A-Reu2Qy9rXTVXYBL3Ug&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">recorded</a> when Kraken Ventures helped fintech startup Rightfoot to raise $15 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/zimbabwe-gold-backed-digital-tokens/">Zimbabwe to Launch Gold-backed Digital Tokens for Retail Transactions</a></p>

<p>The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has <a href="https://www.rbz.co.zw/documents/mps/2023/Mid-Term_Monetary_Policy_Statement_2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> its plans to launch its gold-backed digital token (GBDT) for retail transactions. The Bank first <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/zimbabwe-central-bank-gold-backed-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> the Gold-Backed Digital Tokens (GBDT) in May. Its introduction formed part of a series of measures to stabilize the local currency suffering significant depreciation. With inflation at 175.8% in June, there was strong domestic investor demand for convenient and reliable market-based instruments.</p>
<h2>Investors Embrace GBDT</h2>
<p>First, the RBZ began by issuing physical gold coins which were quickly snatched up by investors. Thereafter, it unveiled the GBDT with its greater possibilities. Physical gold held at the bank backs up each GBDT. Further, the GBDT allows investors to store value without worrying about the risk of keeping physical gold coins. Also, the tokens can be divided into smaller units, increasing their accessibility.</p>
<p>Consequently, RBZ Governor John Mangudya noted that the token issuance was hugely successful with investors. Within a month of introducing GBDT, the bank issued the token 11 times to cater to the 590 applications. These were valued at ZW$50.50 billion and US$7,794.87.</p>
<p>“Continued uptake of the GBDTs is envisaged to sustainably anchor inflation and exchange rate expectations,&#8221; the bank said.</p>
<h2>Gold-Backed Digital Token to Become the Foundation for CBDC Development</h2>
<p>RBZ received Cabinet approval to proceed with developing a CBDC in July 2022. According to a recent survey, 71% of respondents want a CBDC. Consequently, the GBDT could become the basis for its CBDC development, according to RBZ.</p>
<p>Already, the gold-backed digital token possesses many features of a CBDC. For this reason, the bank believes rolling out GBDT for transactions is an appropriate next step on its path to a functional <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDC</a>. </p>
<p>“The Bank is at an advanced stage in preparations for the rolling out of GBDTs for transactional purposes in Phase II of the project,” it said. Consequently, the bank is liaising with key stakeholders like the Confederation of Zimbabwean Industries (CZI). These have shown their interest in issuing GBDT-denominated cards.</p>
<p>The RBZ Governor revealed the bank’s plan to launch a national awareness campaign to drive the adoption of the asset. The campaign will educate the public on the use and benefits of GBDT. RBZ believes that GBDT will complement the use of the US dollar in domestic transactions when fully launched.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coindesk-lays-off-editorial-staff/">CoinDesk Lays Off 45% of Its Editorial Staff as It Explores Sales Option</a></p>
<p>Coindesk, a prominent player in the crypto media landscape, has made significant headlines with its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/15qwhcv/coindesk_lays_off_45_of_editorial_staff_as_it/">recent decision</a> to lay off 45% of its editorial staff while simultaneously exploring potential avenues to sell the business.</p>
<h2>CoinDesk Made a Bold Move with Its Staff Layoff</h2>
<p>According to a memo authored by CoinDesk CEO Kevin Worth, the layoffs are primarily concentrated within the media team. Worth noted that the layoffs were a necessary step to ensure the company&#8217;s financial stability moving forward and to facilitate the impending sale of CoinDesk Inc.</p>
<p>Reports suggest that a total of 20 employees are affected by the layoff, equating to 45% of Coindesk&#8217;s editorial team. This personnel reduction corresponds to a 16% cut in the entire workforce, highlighting the company&#8217;s emphasis on its editorial division.</p>
<p>Behind this seemingly drastic step lies a broader strategic vision. Digital Currency Group (DCG), the parent company of CoinDesk, has been in discussions to bring on board strategic investors. While the layoffs are clearly painful for the impacted employees and the company&#8217;s operations, they are framed as a necessary preparation for a major transition.</p>
<p>Notably, sources indicate that DCG is close to concluding a significant sale of a stake worth over $125 million, backed by crypto investor Matthew Roszak of Tally Capital. Under the terms of this impending deal, DCG will not completely divest from CoinDesk, instead, it is set to maintain a stake in the media property.</p>
<p>CoinDesk’s prospective sale was first <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coindesk-full-partial-sale/">reported</a> in January, sending shockwaves across the crypto space at the time. This revelation came amid the backdrop of financial struggles faced by DCG, which had been acquired through the acquisition of Genesis Trading, a brokerage firm that had gone <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/genesis-files-bankruptcy/">bankrupt</a>.</p>
<p>The intricacies of financial management in the crypto space had caught up with DCG, prompting the company to investigate several ways for raising cash and repositioning itself for long-term success.</p>
<h2>CoinDesk to Onboard New Investors</h2>
<p>In a recent shareholder letter for the second quarter of 2023, DCG disclosed pivotal developments within its Coindesk subsidiary.</p>
<p>The investor letter noted that CoinDesk has enlisted the expertise of financial advisers to facilitate the process of onboarding new institutional and strategic investors, in collaboration with  DCG. These discussions have reportedly been underway for several months, highlighting the seriousness of the initiative and the interest it has generated within the investment community.</p>
<p>Coindesk&#8217;s endeavors seem to be complemented by its strong performance during the quarter. The letter highlights the remarkable achievement of $15 million in revenues attributed to the Consensus 2023 festival, held in April.</p>
<p>CoinDesk&#8217;s strategic shift is further contextualized by DCG’s broader business operations. DCG, which operates across various sectors within the crypto ecosystem, has been actively exploring avenues to attract new investors for its ventures. This includes the search for investors for Luno, its crypto exchange subsidiary.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/fednow-dlt-micropayment-hedera/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<p>The collaboration between FedNow and Dropp has garnered mixed reactions from the crypto community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/fednow-dlt-micropayment-hedera/">FedNow Adopts DLT Micropayment Partner for Retail Transactions on Hedera</a></p>
<p>The United States Federal Reserve&#8217;s instant payment system FedNow has added support for Dropp, a cutting-edge payment application based on the Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) Network. The company, which uses advanced blockchain technology to expedite payment processes and enhance financial transactions, has now joined a growing list of payment providers for the FedNow service.</p>
<p>The FedNow payment platform was <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-federal-reserve-fednow-payment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially launched</a> in July to connect financial institutions and businesses with innovative service providers for instant transactions.</p>
<p>On August 14, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s payment platform added Dropp to the showcase section of its <a href="https://explore.fednow.org/explore-the-city?id=10&amp;postId=108&amp;vendor=dropp-inc." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">website</a> as one of its partners. Through this partnership with the duo, Dropp will be able to continue its services of empowering merchants to receive payments from consumers without incurring substantial transaction fees.</p>
<h2>Dropp Accepts Both Crypto and Fiat Payments</h2>
<p>As a micropayment processor, Dropp accepts both crypto and fiat currencies for payments. With the addition of the platform in FedNow&#8217;s showcase section, users can pay for services using various crypto assets, including HBAR, the native crypto of the distributed ledger technology (DLT) Hedera.</p>
<p>Dropp&#8217;s approach represents a shift away from the traditional subscription model. Unlike conventional content subscription plans, the company enables customers to pay only for the content they consume, offering greater flexibility and cost efficiency.</p>
<p>Although FedNow&#8217;s inclusion of the payment processor seemed like an embrace of DLT technology, the central bank warned that the materials presented on its website serve as a convenient reference for potential FedNow service participants.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve Financial Services (FRFS) emphasized that its role is restricted to hosting applications in the showcase section of the FedNow platform. Adding that it neither supports nor endorses any particular showcase provider.</p>
<p>&#8220;Federal Reserve Financial Services (FRFS) is merely the host of the showcase and does not support or endorse any showcase providers, and the inclusion or exclusion of a provider should in no way imply any recommendation or endorsement by FRFS,&#8221; FedNow wrote.</p>
<h2>Not the First Payment System Adopted by FedNow</h2>
<p>While Dropp is not the first payment processor adopted by FedNow to execute retail transactions, the platform has demonstrated a pattern of removing payment providers days after being added to the platform.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, certain blockchain networks announced partnerships with FedNow but were subsequently removed from the platform. Another crypto company, Metal Blockchain, declared its interest in May to integrate with FedNow but was removed from the showcase after a short period.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the collaboration between FedNow and Dropp has garnered mixed reactions from the crypto community. Some community members expressed concern that adopting blockchain technology might compromise the original principles of cryptocurrencies as an alternative to traditional financial systems.</p>
<p>A Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/15qrd9g/where_is_there_no_longer_any_emphasis_on/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">user</a> lamented that while people might be pursuing better financial situations, it should not come at the expense of compromising the principles of fairness and transparency.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/q2-earnings-foxconn/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/q2-earnings-foxconn/">Foxconn Maintains Caution on Global Uncertainties despite Beating Forecasts in Q2 2023 Earnings</a></p>
<p>On Monday, August 14, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/apple-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple</a> supplier Foxconn announced its second-quarter (Q2) earnings beating market estimates. These strong Q2 earnings came on the backdrop of a booming artificial intelligence sector. However, the company still maintains a cautious outlook for the year 2023 amid global uncertainties.</p>
<h2>Foxconn in Q2 2023</h2>
<p>Foxconn&#8217;s net profit for the second quarter fell by 1%, but it was still higher than what analysts predicted. The company&#8217;s net profit went down to T$33 billion ($1.0 billion) in the April-June period, compared to T$33.29 billion from the previous year. This result was better than the average prediction of T$25.57 billion profit from 13 analysts, according to Refinitiv.</p>
<p>Foxconn also mentioned that it anticipates a slight decrease in revenue for its smart consumer electronics products in the third quarter. This category includes smartphones and contributes about half of Foxconn&#8217;s total revenue.</p>
<p>The Taiwan-based largest electronics manufacturer worldwide downgraded its outlook for the full-year revenue of 2023. With this, Foxconn joins the list of companies that have been facing the heat of a sluggish recovery in China and a weak global economy.</p>
<p>Chairman Liu Young-way described Foxconn&#8217;s outlook as &#8220;relatively cautious&#8221;. He <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/14/apple-supplier-foxconn-cautious-despite-beating-earnings-forecasts.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">added</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“At present, there are many external variables: global monetary policy tightening, geopolitical tensions, inflation and other uncertainties.”</p></blockquote>
<p>At the earnings briefing, Liu said that he sees a lot of potential in India wherein they are rapidly expanding their manufacturing capabilities. Additionally, the company has committed “several billion dollars in investment&#8221; which it calls just the beginning.</p>
<p>However, just during the last month of July, Foxconn pulled out of a joint venture with Vedanta in India. But the company is still keen on applying for different incentives under the country&#8217;s chip production plan.</p>
<h2>Foxconn Gearing for an EV Push and AI</h2>
<p>Foxconn, a company that makes things like phones and electronics, might start making batteries for electric cars at its factory in Wisconsin. The electronics manufacturer sees a great opportunity in this rapidly evolving EV market, however, it didn&#8217;t give many details regarding the same.</p>
<p>With the rise of generative AI apps, Foxconn is getting more popular for servers in this area. They think they can work more closely with customers in North America. This is good news because demand for smartphones and computers has been a bit slower. “AI growth has been strong, but we have not seen any pick-up for other products,&#8221; the company noted.</p>
<p>Before announcing its results, Foxconn, the company responsible for assembling about 70% of iPhones, experienced a 1.4% increase in its shares. In contrast, the main market saw a 1.3% decrease. Foxconn&#8217;s shares have risen by 10% in total this year.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-canada-expansion/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-canada-expansion/">Coinbase Global Announces Its Canada Expansion via Strategic Partnership with Peoples Trust Company</a></p>
<p>Leading publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange based in the United States <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase Global Inc</a> (NASDAQ: COIN), announced on Monday that it has opened its services to crypto users in Canada. The crypto company noted in the announcement that it has partnered with Peoples Trust Company, part of Peoples Group, to enable seamless on/off ramping services. Furthermore, Coinbase users in Canada can access the Interac e-Transfers, which are simple and secure. Additionally, the company noted that the Interac feature was the most requested by Canadians. Notably, the company highlighted that depositing funds to Coinbase using Interac is free and almost instant to all eligible users.</p>
<p>The crypto company noted that the official launch in Canada is a move geared toward making the crypto market accessible to more investors around the world. Meanwhile, the company has faced significant regulatory hurdles in the United States after the collapse of FTX and Alameda Research late last year, thus accelerating its international expansion to ensure its future growth prospects.</p>
<p>“Canada is well positioned to be a global leader in the crypto economy thanks to the high levels of crypto awareness, a passionate local tech ecosystem, and the progress towards a strong regulatory framework,” said Nana Murugesan, Vice President, International and Business Development, Coinbase. “As Coinbase’s next Go Deep Market, we are making significant investments to help Canadians access the benefits of cryptocurrency.”</p>
<p>Similar sentiments were echoed by Lucas Matheson, the Coinbase country director in Canada, who highlighted that the official launch in the country will help democratize finance in the country.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Launch in Canada</h2>
<p>The Canadian crypto market has significantly grown over the past few years, as it even has a functional Bitcoin ETF among other regulatory frameworks. As a result, a study conducted by Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) found that 15 percent of Canadian investors have already invested in the crypto market and more than double expect to purchase digital assets within the year. As a result, Coinbase has remained keen to widen its services to investors in Canada in the recent past. Moreover, Coinbase is now a leading crypto employer in the country, which works in line with the government’s agenda.</p>
<p>Coinbase has previously worked closely with Canadian regulators to help create a strong digital asset regulatory framework. Resultantly, its strategic partnership with Peoples Group has been commended for combining traditional financial institutions with neo-banking services</p>
<p>“Peoples Group is pleased to partner with industry leader Coinbase, to enable this money movement tool for their Canadian customers and expand payment possibilities,” <a href="https://investor.coinbase.com/news/news-details/2023/Coinbase-Accelerates-International-Expansion-with-Official-Launch-in-Canada/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> David Furlong, Chief Operating Officer of Peoples Group.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Coinbase shares traded around $81.11, up approximately 0.12 during Monday’s per-market.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/yen-level-us-dollar-2022/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/yen-level-us-dollar-2022/">Japanese Yen Slumps to Lowest Level Against US Dollar Since November 2022</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/yen-level-us-dollar-2022/">Japanese Yen Slumps to Lowest Level Against US Dollar Since November 2022</a></p>
<p>The Japanese yen experienced a massive decline on Monday, August 14, slipping to its lowest level against the US dollar for the first time since November 2022. This downward trajectory resulted in the yen breaking through the crucial 145 mark. According to a CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/14/yen-breaches-145-level-against-usd-raises-expectations-boj-may-intervene.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report,</a> the currency briefly touched the same level last Friday before eventually recovering some ground.</p>
<p>The decline has brought about speculation that the country&#8217;s central bank, the Bank of Japan (BOJ), may intervene to restore the value of the Japanese currency. A recent Forex report released by HSBC on Monday provided insights into the potential outcomes of the bank&#8217;s support.</p>
<p>The report suggested that the Japanese Ministry of Finance might consider intervention within the range of 145-148 to stabilize the yen&#8217;s decline. It&#8217;s worth noting that both the BOJ and the Japanese government had previously intervened by purchasing yen when it <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/japanese-yen-24-year-low-yield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breached</a> the 145-to-dollar exchange rate in September 2022. One month after the government got involved, the currency <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/japanese-yen-falls-dollar-32-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declined</a> further to 150% against the US dollar.</p>
<h2>Japanese Bonds Hit 10-Year High As BOJ Modifies Policy</h2>
<p>However, HSBC also noted the possibility of short positions on the yen increasing further if the BOJ and Japanese authorities choose not to intervene this time.</p>
<p>The report highlighted that these positions had been reduced by over 30% in July, coinciding with the buildup to the BOJ&#8217;s monetary policy meeting on July 28. The BOJ said during the conference that it would offer to purchase 10-year Japanese government bonds at a fixed rate of 1% in a move that aims to expand the trading band on long-term yields.</p>
<p>The central bank further stated that it would still maintain the previous 0.5% cap on these yields, making it look more like a reference point rather than a rigid limit. Reacting to the news, the country&#8217;s bonds surged to a 10-year high of 0.572% two weeks ago.</p>
<h2>US Dollar Hits One Month High Despite Plummeting Yen</h2>
<p>While the Japanese currency is headed towards a downward trajectory, the US dollar has displayed a strong uptrend since the close of July, with the dollar index surging from its July 13 low of 99.77 to its current level of 102.99.</p>
<p>HSBC drew attention to a &#8220;new factor&#8221; contributing to the strength of the dollar – particularly, the elevated longer-term US yields due to concerns about the country&#8217;s budget deficit and treasury supply. The bank acknowledged that this might be a temporary phenomenon, occurring alongside the existing USD framework that is not signaling a robust downtrend for the US dollar.</p>
<h2>Japan to Unveil Its Gross Domestic Product Tomorrow</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Japan is gearing up to reveal its gross domestic product (GDP) data for the quarter ending in June on Tuesday, August 15.</p>
<p>Additionally, inflation figures for July are set to be released later this Friday. <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/hsbc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HSBC</a> highlighted that any deviations in the data could strengthen negative sentiments.</p>
<p>Market experts are projecting a 0.8% growth in GDP on a quarter-on-quarter basis, and the core consumer price index, excluding fresh food prices, is expected to reach 3.1%, as a Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/yen-breaks-above-145dlr-level-choppy-trading-dollar-firm-2023-08-14/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">poll</a> indicates.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coca-cola-masterpiece-nft-collection-on-base/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coca-cola-masterpiece-nft-collection-on-base/">Coca-Cola Launches Masterpiece NFT Collection on Base</a></p>

<p>The household brand name <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coca-cola/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coca-Cola</a> has launched its Masterpiece NFT collection on the Coinbase layer-2 network, Base. Recall that last week, the Base mainnet officially <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-base-network-live-web3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened to the general public</a> with over 100 Dapps and service providers.</p>
<p>Coinbase <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1690763490674503680" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> Coca-Cola&#8217;s NFT launch as part of its “Onchain Summer” initiative which began on August 9. The OnChain Summer initiative is to celebrate Base’s mainnet launch with on-chain art, gaming, and music projects. The aim is to demonstrate the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the Layer 2 chain.</p>
<h2>About the Masterpiece NFT Collection</h2>
<p>The Coca-Cola NFT collection features either a classic or a modern artwork, intertwined with the iconic Coca-Cola bottle. Classics such as &#8220;The Scream&#8221; by Edvard Munch and &#8220;Girl with a Pearl Earring&#8221; by Johannes Vermeer are used in the collection. The collection includes eight NFT versions, available from 0.0011 ETH to 0.014 ETH.</p>
<p>“Coca-Cola is bringing their Global Masterpiece campaign on-chain with iconic works from leading artists,” the announcement said.</p>
<p>Since announcing the mint on Sunday, nearly 50,000 NFTs have been minted via the mint.fun platform. One can expect that many more will be minted with the minting period not due to end until Wednesday.</p>
<h2>Not the First Rodeo</h2>
<p>This is not Coca-Cola’s first foray into the world of NFTs. In July 2021, Coca-Cola auctioned its first-ever NFTs as a single asset. <a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/media-center/coca-cola-nft-auction-fetches-more-than-575000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The auction</a> was a big hit with fans and the crypto community and sold for over $575k. The proceeds were then donated to Special Olympics International. Later in July 2022, the company launched another 136 digital collectibles to celebrate Pride Month.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola is not the first major brand to join the NFT craze. Other companies such as Nike, Asics, Louis Vuitton, Mattel Creations and Taco Bell have all launched NFT collections in recent months. However, Coca-Cola&#8217;s Masterpiece NFT collection is unique in its use of Base. The brand could very well be the largest consumer brand to be involved with Base so far.</p>
<p>Later this month, other digital collectible projects like Zora, Pixelmon, Showtime, and Indelible are also expected to launch on Base. As more brands follow suit, it will be interesting to see how Base paves the way for more mainstream adoption of NFTs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mastercard-minority-stake-mtn/">Mastercard to Acquire Minority Stake in MTN’s Fintech Business</a></p>
<p>MTN Group Ltd (JSE: MTN), Africa’s largest wireless carrier, has announced that <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/mastercard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mastercard Inc</a> (NYSE: MA) is planning to purchase a minority stake in its financial technology business. This investment deal values the fintech arm at approximately $5.2 billion, representing almost 40% of MTN&#8217;s total market value.</p>
<p>MTN’s Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Mupita stated in a recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-14/mastercard-to-buy-stake-in-mtn-s-5-2-billion-fintech-unit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> that the signing of the definitive investment agreements between MTN and Mastercard is anticipated to take place in the near term.</p>
<h2>Promise of the MTN-Mastercard Partnership</h2>
<p>This strategic partnership with Mastercard holds immense promise for both companies. MTN’s extensive reach across the African continent, combined with Mastercard’s expertise in secure payment technology, is poised to accelerate the growth and accessibility of fintech services in the region.</p>
<p>This influx of funds can serve as a temporary substitute for dividends from subsidiaries, providing financial flexibility and allowing MTN to address short-term financial needs or allocate resources to strategic initiatives.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the cash injection from Mastercard’s investment can partly offset the impact of increased 2023 capital spending guidance for MTN, which has been affected by forex (foreign exchange) fluctuations.</p>
<p>This balance-sheet reinforcement, combined with Mastercard&#8217;s <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mastercard-acquires-ciphertrace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expertise</a> in payment technology and financial services will position MTN to pursue its digital transformation efforts and expand its fintech offerings more aggressively.</p>
<p>Mastercard&#8217;s investment in MTN’s mobile money unit reflects a broader industry trend, with companies such as Airtel Africa and Safaricom likewise focusing on transitioning from basic voice and text mobile services to comprehensive digital solutions. This precedent, set by other industry giants like India&#8217;s Jio Platforms Ltd, underscores the importance of collaboration and strategic investment in driving innovation and growth in the digital economy.</p>
<p>As MTN seeks to raise funds through asset sales, including the sale and lease-back of mobile-phone towers and potentially divesting its stake in IHS Holding Ltd., the market will closely watch the execution of these plans, as they could further enhance MTN’s financial position and support its growth objectives.</p>
<h2>MTN Reports Impressive Half-Year Earnings</h2>
<p>In the midst of this strategic partnership, MTN has delivered impressive financial results for the first half of the year. The company revealed a 7.1% increase in its half-year earnings.</p>
<p>MTN reported that its headline earnings per share (EPS), a key measure of profitability, rose from 506 cents in the same period the previous year to 542 cents in the first six months of the current year. This robust financial performance signals the company’s resilience and adaptability in a dynamic market environment.</p>
<p>The company has faced operational challenges due to frequent power outages, which compelled it to allocate substantial capital to backup power systems. Despite these hurdles, MTN has remained proactive in its pursuit of strategic partnerships that could enhance its fintech offerings.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/anthropic-100m-investment-sk-telecom/" rel="prev">next</a></p>
