					<description><![CDATA[TrueUSD's Reserve Certificate has been audited by the former FTX.US accounting team.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>TrueUSD&#8217;s Reserve Certificate has been audited by the former FTX.US accounting team</em>.</li>



<li><em>The Network Firm, formerly known as Armanino and worked with Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) for FTX.US to perform the audit.</em></li>



<li><em>In December last year, the accounting firm Armanino ended its crypto audit business and abandoned the client.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to CoinDesk, the certificate of reserve of the troubled stablecoin TrueUSD was audited by The Network Firm, formerly Armanino, and worked with Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) for FTX.US to perform the audit.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>At the beginning of March this year, a group of former FTX accountants, US Auditors Armanino, set up shop as The Network Firm to provide audit, attestation, and related work for crypto clients.</p>



<p>Armanino, an accounting firm of FTX.US, has ended its crypto audit business and abandoned its clients. The reason is that other clients in the industry consider Armanino&#8217;s reputational risk to question their audit results and put pressure on it. This firm is also the accounting firm for crypto exchanges such as Gate, OKX, and Kraken. Reportedly, Armanino began providing support to the crypto industry in 2014, including proof of reserve audits and evidence of stablecoins.</p>



<p>After the FTX incident broke out, American investors sued Prager Metis and Armanino, the auditors of FTX, accusing them of conspiring to commit extortion.</p>



<p>Executives at Archblock, which powers the TUSD stablecoin, previously confirmed the Armanio team in emails to CoinDesk and said they would continue using The Network Firm.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the community stirred with the rate of TUSD in Curve&#8217;s 4pool surpassing the 70% mark, and the stablecoin is showing a slight depeg signal.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="qme" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PeckShieldAlert?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#PeckShieldAlert</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TUSD?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#TUSD</a> <a href="https://t.co/faXi8UQ5Tn" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/faXi8UQ5Tn</a></p>&mdash; PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1673894108581199872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 28, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>This case is reminiscent of Curve&#8217;s 3pool USDT rate crossing the 50% mark on June 15, not long ago, resulting in USDT being depeg for a short period of time.</p>



<p>Looks like a similar situation is playing out with TUSD. The community speculates that something is going on with TUSD or that someone has some &#8220;insider&#8221; information about the stablecoin. So we are simultaneously converting TUSD to safer stablecoins like USDC, USDT, and DAI.</p>



<p>This makes the trading price of the TUSD/USDT trading pair on Binance.US at $0.9007, shortly after hitting as low as $0.8. On the Binance platform, the pair is trading at around $0.9992.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2070.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="616" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2070-1024x616.png" alt="TUSD Depeg Due To TrueUSD Reserves Audited By FTX.US Collapsed" class="wp-image-198486" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2070-1024x616.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2070-300x181.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2070-768x462.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2070-750x451.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2070.png 1045w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="TUSD Depeg Due To TrueUSD Reserves Audited By FTX.US Collapsed 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In fact, it can be seen that TUSD is in a difficult situation when its main partner, Prime Trust, is in trouble. Prime Trust is a USD deposit and withdrawal partner for TrueUSD, so since mid-June, TrueUSD has suspended deposit and withdrawal activities through Prime Trust.</p>



<p>Despite claiming to be &#8220;unaffected&#8221;, the community still found signs that users could no longer convert TUSD to USD. Some people even received emails from TUSD claiming that TUSD could not be issued or redeemed.</p>



<p>Nevada&#8217;s Division of Financial Institutions has now submitted the Prime Trust to take over and freeze all of its businesses in a severe capital shortfall.</p>

<p>The collaboration will accelerate Startale&#8217;s development of Web3 services and products, including its objective to offer all-in-one Web3 development solutions and an emphasis on linking real-world assets with the Web3 ecosystem.</p>



<p>Part of the cash will also be used to hire additional employees in order to promote the development of web3 products and services.</p>



<p>The web3 company said that the funding would be used to construct infrastructure to promote the worldwide adoption of web3. Jun Watanabe, President, and Representative Director of Sony Network Communications, has joined Startale Labs as a director.</p>



<p>Watanabe is also a co-founder of the Astar Network, a parachain that operates on the Polkadot ecosystem and is backed by Startale Labs. Astar recently announced smart contracts that supported two virtual machines, allowing the network to host WebAssembly or Ethereum Virtual Machine applications.</p>

<p>The Web3 footprint of Startale Labs may be tracked to many locations of the globe Astar Network. Nevertheless, its primary concentration has been in Japan, where it has grown to become the leading blockchain in the Asian nation.</p>



<p>Sony Network Communications is a well-known fiber optic internet service provider. Nonetheless, other Sony domains and divisions have been participating in other Web3 efforts, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</p>

<p>This is not the first time the two firms have collaborated on a project. Early this year, they collaborated with Astar Network, Japan&#8217;s Polkadot Network-based smart contract platform, to co-host a Web3 Incubation Program, which provides assistance to web3 initiatives attempting to add value to NFTs and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).</p>

<li><em>Horizen has made a groundbreaking announcement regarding the approval of ZenIP 42204. Consequently, ZEN will no longer retain its status as a privacy coin.

<p>The decision signifies a significant change as all privacy features of ZEN will be removed at the consensus level. In a blog post on their official website, Horizen highlighted that this move aims to eliminate technical debt and proactively address potential regulatory threats. Consequently, ZEN will no longer retain its status as a privacy coin.</p>



<p>The forthcoming deprecation of the  ZEN Coin mainchain shielded pools marks a fundamental shift in  ZEN Coin&#8217;s approach to privacy within its blockchain ecosystem. While privacy features have been a distinguishing characteristic of ZEN, Horizen has taken a proactive stance to prioritize regulatory compliance and confront technical challenges head-on.</p>



<p>The decision to remove privacy features at the consensus level underscores Horizen&#8217;s commitment to streamlining its technology stack and aligning with evolving regulatory standards. By doing so, the platform seeks to address concerns surrounding privacy coins and establish a solid foundation of transparency and accountability.</p>

<p>The move comes amidst a growing wave of scrutiny and regulatory attention towards privacy coins due to concerns about their potential involvement in illicit activities. By taking proactive measures to address these concerns,  ZEN Coin aims to foster a more compliant and regulated environment within its blockchain ecosystem.</p>



<p>While the removal of privacy features may come as a surprise to some ZEN coin holders and privacy advocates, Horizen emphasizes that this strategic change will enable the platform to better manage technical debt and allocate resources towards further innovation and growth. The company remains committed to the long-term sustainability and development of the Horizen ecosystem.</p>



<p>Horizen&#8217;s decision to remove privacy features at the consensus level signals its dedication to adaptability and responsible growth within an evolving blockchain landscape. The impact of this transformation on the ZEN community and its ecosystem will unfold over time as Horizen continues to navigate the intersection of technological advancements and regulatory requirements.</p>

<li><em>Israeli government seizes millions in cryptocurrency from the Iranian military and Hezbollah.</em></li>



<li><em>Crypto used to finance operations due to banking restrictions.</em></li>



<li><em>Authorities trace transactions and seize funds meant for terrorists.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.israelhayom.com/2023/06/28/in-first-israel-seizes-millions-from-crypto-wallets-tied-to-iran-hezbollah/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Israel Hayom</a></em>, the Israeli government has confiscated millions of dollars in cryptocurrency from wallets related to the Iranian military and the Iran-backed Hezbollah terrorist organization in Lebanon.</strong></h5>

<p>Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated on Tuesday that Israel had, for the first time, captured cryptocurrency wallets linked to Iran&#8217;s Quds Force and Lebanon&#8217;s Hezbollah terror proxy. Israel&#8217;s Mossad espionage agency, military intelligence, Israeli police, and others were all engaged in the endeavor.</p>



<p>Gallant said the &#8220;extensive and precedent-setting&#8221; action over the previous week resulted in the seizure of millions of dollars in digital money meant for terrorists.</p>

<p>According to Gallant, the Quds Force, Hezbollah, and Syrian organizations have been using cryptocurrencies provided by outside parties to pay for their operations since the beginning of the year. They have been labeled as terrorist groups by the United States and certain other nations and have been barred from participating in the regular global banking system.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Whoever finances terror or maintains economic ties to terror groups are targets, just like those directing terrorism. There is a clear connection to terror that originates in Iran, which is the financier and purveyor of terrorism against Israel and many countries around the world, both directly and through its proxies,&#8221; Gallant stated.</p>

<p>After the confiscation of multiple digital wallets related to terrorism finance by Jerusalem months earlier, the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas stated in April that it would no longer accept donations through the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, citing &#8220;hostile&#8221; behavior against contributors.</p>



<p>While cryptocurrency is thought to provide privacy, technological advancements have allowed authorities to identify persons behind crypto transactions. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are popular for illegal transactions since they are difficult to track. Without revealing a name or location, anybody in the world may open a Bitcoin account and begin receiving digital payments.</p>

<p>DWF Labs, a global digital asset market maker, and multi-stage Web3 investment firm, has further strengthened its commitment to support Conflux&#8217;s growth. This investment brings DWF Labs&#8217; total investment to $28 million. The previous investment was $10 million in March of this year.</p>



<p>Since then, Conflux has established ecosystem partnerships with Floki, Worldcoin, Blockbank, Luganodes, AirDAO, Mask, and OpenEden, with a growing list of partnerships under discussion. Conflux and DWF Labs have also co-organized many events, including those held in Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Paris.</p>



<p>DWF Lab is one of Conflux&#8217;s principal backers. This funding not only strengthens our relationship, but also serves as a catalyst for our shared ambition to expand the Conflux ecosystem.</p>



<p>Conflux previously said it would build a blockchain-based SIM card in partnership with China Telecom, the second-largest wireless carrier in China with an estimated $390 million subscribers. Recently, &#8216;Ethereum China&#8217; Conflux attracted attention as Hong Kong welcomed retail traders.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of this year, Conflux&#8217;s market capitalization has grown from $46 million to nearly $650 million currently &#8211; making CFX one of the best performing tokens.</p>



<p>Some Asia-focused investors argue that Conflux&#8217;s indirect links to the Chinese market could position CFX as a proxy bet on the broader Asian market.</p>



<p>More recently, Conflux joined the Web3 Institute of Hong Kong, participated in the Singapore Digital Economy Roundtable hosted by the Singapore Government, and led the drafting of IEEE P3217, an international blockchain standard by the Singapore Government Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[TrueUSD's endorsement news causes a negative impact, trading at a disadvantage compared to Tether on Binance.US.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>TrueUSD&#8217;s endorsement news causes a negative impact, trading at a disadvantage compared to Tether on Binance.US.</em></li>



<li><em>Concerns arise over the audit of TrueUSD conducted by The Network Firm (formerly Armanino), which discontinued its crypto audit business.</em></li>



<li><em>Stablecoin volatility affects the market, but Bitcoin remains unaffected, trading above $30,000.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The fact that endorsement news of TrueUSD (TUSD), a dollar-pegged stablecoin, is causing a negative effect when it is trading at a disadvantage to Tether (USDT) on Binance.US, the Binance exchange&#8217;s US subsidiary.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The TUSD/USDT pair was trading at 90 cents on Binance.US at press time, having touched a low of 80 cents on Wednesday, according to data from TradingView. The pair was trading at approximately $0.9985 on Binance.</p>

<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/28/trueusds-reserves-were-attested-by-former-ftxus-accounting-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinDesk</a></em>, The Network Firm, previously known as Armanino and working with former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried for FTX US, audited the reserved certificate of the unstable stablecoin TrueUSD. According to the publication, The Network Firm sprang from the digital asset division of the accounting firm Armanino.</p>



<p>Armanino, an accounting company, said in December of last year that it was discontinuing its crypto audit business and leaving customers. Other industry customers thought that Armanino&#8217;s reputation risk would cast doubt on its audit findings, putting Armanino under pressure. </p>



<p>Armanino also serves as an accounting company for cryptocurrency exchanges, including Gate, OKX, and Kraken. According to reports, the audit company started providing assistance to the crypto company in 2014, offering proof of reserve audits and proof of stablecoins.</p>

<p>After the FTX affair, US investors sued Prager Metis and Armanino, FTX&#8217;s auditing company, accusing them of extortion conspiracy.</p>



<p>Stablecoin volatility, which has emerged as a financing currency over the last three years, often flows into the larger market. TUSD, with a market capitalization of $3 billion, offers less of a systemic risk to the larger market than Tether, which has a market capitalization of more than $83 billion.</p>



<p>At the moment, Bitcoin is not reacting to the news, the price of BTC is still trading above $30,000.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The NFT market showed little sign of renewed optimism in May, despite $43 million raised, the highest amount of funding since November 2022.</strong></h5>



<p>However, the amount raised outpaced actual market volume and user growth, suggesting that enthusiasm remains concentrated among venture investors. Mainstream collectors have yet to match the interest. Unique users and trading volume continue to decline.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The market needs to move beyond temporary hype and speculation and attract broader participation and success across projects.</p>



<p>Data of this report was obtained from Footprint&#8217;s NFT research page.

<h1 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">Crypto Macro Overview</h1>



<p><a href="https://www.footprint.network/@KikiSmith/BTC-ETH-Decentralized-Stablecoin-Market-Analysis?date_filter=past35days" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BTC</a> opened the month of May at $28,074, peaked on May 5 at $29,528, and turned down to $27,223 on May 31. For the month as a whole, bitcoin was down slightly by 0.5%. </p>

<p>However, BTC as a marketing indicator,  is still up more than 64% year-to-date, compared to its price of $16,605 on Jan. 1. ETH is following the same trend, down less than 1% in May, and up 58% year-to-date in 2022.</p>



<p>Market players shouldn&#8217;t have a false feeling of security as a result of the current quiet in the volatility of Bitcoin and ETH. Specifically, BTC saw a significant 13.3% drop in on-chain volume, indicating a decrease in trading activity on Bitcoin Network.</p>

<p>The Milady Maker collection was mentioned in a tweet by Elon Musk on May 10, 2023, which caused trading volume to spike to $13.95 million, sending prices soaring. The mid-month spike shows how young the NFT market is. The bigger picture can be skewed by &#8220;hot&#8221; new collections or sales that come and go quickly in terms of popularity.</p>

<p>Though, on May 10th, <a href="https://www.footprint.network/research/nft/nft-market/market-overview?series_date=past30days" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the number of users</a> in the NFT market is not increasing a lot, so we may speculate that the NFT user base is not growing significantly at the moment, even though Milady Maker&#8217;s collection is getting hot, the users are still the same people who have been in this market for a long time.</p>

<p>At the beginning of May, there were more NFT buyers than sellers, with the ratio being 2:1, mostly because of some projects on Polygon as below, with a bunch of buyers and only several sellers on the secondary market.</p>

<p>According to the data of <a href="https://www.footprint.network/research/nft/nft-market/market-overview?series_date=past30days" target="_blank" rel="noopener">daily buyers &amp; sellers</a>, there are still more NFTs listed for sale than active buyers interested in buying them, indicating a potential oversupply of NFTs, not necessarily subpar collections.</p>



<p>While the NFT market has experienced fluctuations, it is still a growing industry with the potential for long-term growth and acceptance.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">Chains &amp; Marketplaces for NFTs</h1>



<p>Ethereum dominates NFT volume with over 95% of the total market. However, in terms of unique active wallets, about 40% are on Ethereum, 34% on Polygon and 16% on Solana.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While still small compared to traditional markets, growing unique participation across multiple chains is a healthier sign for the NFT space than if the large majority remained concentrated on Ethereum alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.footprint.network/research/nft/nft-market/market-overview?series_date=past30days" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Footprint Analytics</a>, over 70% of wash-trading takes place on x2y2, indicating that their systems and policies allow manipulative behavior with fewer barriers &#8211; whether intentional or not, this highlights the speculative nature of the current NFT market and the need for continued progress towards transparency, trust and genuine mainstream interest.</p>

<p>It is expected for the wash trade value to decrease as the NFT market experiences a downturn, but it is noteworthy that the wash trade percentage has also decreased over the past three months.</p>

<p>After a brief period of euphoria caused by the Blur airdrop, the NFT market has now returned to a bearish state, characterised by a marked decline in speculator enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Footprint Analytics has conducted an analysis of the top 50 volume collections. This shows a decrease in the prevalence of wash trading, which can be primarily attributed to two key factors:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Speculation-driven projects</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Projects such as <em>MineablePunks</em> and <em>Terraforms by Mathcastles</em> initially gained significant trading volume based on speculation. However, these projects were based solely on hype and lacked substantial underlying value. As traders and investors realised the limited utility and long-term potential of these collections, interest waned, resulting in a loss of sustained trading activity.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Wash trading during the hype</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Wash trading played a significant role in certain collections at the height of their hype. However, as the excitement and frenzy around these collections subsided, speculators no longer found it advantageous to engage in such activity. As a result, both wash trading and overall trading volume declined. This trend was particularly evident for collections hosted on the Opensea platform(<em>Opensea collections</em>).</p>



<p>As speculators reduce their trading activity, it is expected that the prices of certain collections may take a hit. However, this period of lull in the NFT market actually fosters a healthier environment, paving the way for future prosperity.</p>



<p>In addition, the market slowdown is lowering barriers to entry, providing opportunities for genuine users and game developers to participate. With less speculative trading dominating the market, project teams can now focus on their project. This strategic shift allows them to lay the groundwork for a potential recovery in the next market cycle and attract long-term investors who value the sustainable growth and utility of NFT projects.</p>



<p>When it comes marketplaces, according to <a href="https://www.footprint.network/research/nft/nft-market/marketplaces?series_date=past30days" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest data</a>, Blur is currently the leading NFT marketplace with a monthly value share of around 60%. This is followed by OpenSea with around 20% and x2y2 with around 10%.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">NFT Investment &amp; Funding&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1>



<p>The total amount raised in May was $43.2 million, the highest since November 2022. However, there were only 7 funding rounds, which is a relatively low number.</p>

<p>In May, two significant NFT funding with the most amount are Pudgy Penguins and AlienSwap. Pudgy Penguins raised a $9 million seed round led by 1kx to build the next great IP company. And AlienSwap raised $12 million led by NEXT Leader Capital and C² Ventures to expand the AlienSwap engineering team.</p>

<p>The higher amounts invested in May are a positive signal of renewed optimism, despite a slowdown in actual market activity and participation. However, sustainability depends on broader success across more projects.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">Hot Topics of the Month: Bitcoin Ordinals</h1>



<p>Ordinals are a unique category of NFTs that are based on the Bitcoin network. Ordinals have seen insane growth in the few months. A <a href="https://twitter.com/Footprint_Data/status/1664320477446406144?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter Space from Footprint Analytics</a> talked about this topic.</p>



<p>It begins on January 21, 2023, when programmer and crypto enthusiast Casey Rodarmor launched the Ordinals protocol on the Bitcoin network. The innovation allows for the minting of Bitcoin NFTs. Ordinals caused a high number of Bitcoin transactions in May.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ua6I69kEzXmY-jbhaf69UEEXSl7MMh70tkZ5QSTTQ9mjsQ0REG1CVEId0AHIScDAm-3pkGRZiV_Fk-YShrZbyZ71aj0NDCOIac4BefdnKTsmyuhj0bjstDE63bQRDTRfQyQsMF4mNm8wpOu3eElOItI" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ua6I69kEzXmY-jbhaf69UEEXSl7MMh70tkZ5QSTTQ9mjsQ0REG1CVEId0AHIScDAm-3pkGRZiV_Fk-YShrZbyZ71aj0NDCOIac4BefdnKTsmyuhj0bjstDE63bQRDTRfQyQsMF4mNm8wpOu3eElOItI" alt="NFT Monthly Report: The Rise and Fall of the Market in May" title="NFT Monthly Report: The Rise and Fall of the Market in May 35"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><a href="https://www.footprint.network/@8hwYRTm1E3/Bitcoin-Chain-Analysis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Bitcoin Daily Transaction Fees</em></a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>They introduce a new dimension to digital collectibles and asset ownership by allowing users to add arbitrary data to a Bitcoin transaction and tie that data to an individual satoshi, creating a unique asset known as an ordinal. For now, it has minted over 10 million according to Footprint data.</p>



<p>The Ordinals protocol is still in its infancy, with lightweight wallet applications, NFT trading markets, and other &#8220;infrastructure&#8221; yet to be built. People still expect the future and further expansion of the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>OKX Global Chief Commercial Officer Lennix Lai stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Security, transparency and trust are the core tenets of OKX&#8217;s operating philosophy. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re committed to operating with complete transparency and providing regular PoR audits that users can independently verify. We hope that our efforts will raise the overall standard of the digital asset industry and establish new benchmarks for transparency and security.&#8221;</p>

<p>Proof of reserves (PoR) is the process of confirming that the customer assets held by a cryptocurrency exchange or financial institution match the number of assets kept in reserve on the customers&#8217; behalf. PoR has been widely publicized as the major method for crypto investors to ensure that their assets are properly safeguarded. It&#8217;s also a crucial tool for crypto platforms since it allows them to demonstrate that they have enough assets to support transactions and withdrawals.</p>



<p>The bankruptcy of FTX and the dissolution of Three Arrows Capital both stunned the cryptocurrency sector. They called into doubt the dependability and integrity of cryptocurrency custodians.</p>



<p>A PoR audit shows that the company&#8217;s on-chain holdings are equal to the client assets recorded on the balance sheet, reassuring consumers that the business is viable and liquid enough to continue doing business with them.</p>

<p>PoR is often carried out by a third-party auditor who examines a trading platform&#8217;s assets and liabilities. The auditors want to validate the exchange&#8217;s assertions and will then publish the findings for public consumption. This theory assumes that the exchange&#8217;s digital assets kept in custody for users are backed up 1:1 by exchange-owned reserves.</p>



<p>At the moment, OKX&#8217;s PoR system has been improved using zk-STARK and other cutting-edge technology, and users may independently check OKX&#8217;s solvency at any time.</p>
