<li dir="ltr">Boojum upgrade is live as zkSync Era transitions to a new STARK-powered proof system.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The new proof system is designed to power world-class performance on regular consumer-grade hardware.</li>
<li dir="ltr">zkSync is rolling out the feature in phases as it tests out its security and functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">zkSync Era, a zero knowledge (ZK) proofs layer 2 protocol for <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>, has announced its high-performance proof system called Boojum.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the team, the upgrade is not only to scale network performance but also significantly improve on its overall decentralisation by allowing for the use of consumer-grade hardware.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Say hello to Boojum &#128075;: zkSync Era&rsquo;s new high-performance proof system for radical decentralization. Boojum is an upgrade that will transition zkSync Era to a STARK-powered proof system, providing world-class performance on consumer-grade hardware.</p>
<p>&#128161;&nbsp;Learn more:&hellip; <a href="https://t.co/1GrwJ5Y07A">pic.twitter.com/1GrwJ5Y07A</a></p>
<p>&mdash; zkSync &#8718; (@zksync) <a href="https://twitter.com/zksync/status/1680820952991408129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">New zkSync Era upgrade</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Boojum is a Rust-based arithmetization and constraint library that zkSync is transitioning to from its SNARK-based prover system. The protocol noted in an<a href="https://zksync.mirror.xyz/HJ2Pj45EJkRdt5Pau-ZXwkV2ctPx8qFL19STM5jdYhc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;<u>announcement</u></a> on Monday that the new proof system will power the platform&rsquo;s upgraded version of ZK circuits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While zkSync Era can currently process over 100 transactions per second (TPS), Boojum is expected to considerably bump this up. On top of that, the team targets near-real-time and cheap transactions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Our current SNARK-based system, while effective for today, won&rsquo;t scale to the high-volume, near real-time transactions the ZK Stack, where zkSync Era operates as a Hyperchain, aims to support in the coming years. The future we imagine for these systems is one in which proofs are generated and verified cheaply and quickly, allowing for fast finality and interoperability between Hyperchains</em>,&rdquo; the zkSync Era team wrote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In terms of reducing hardware requirements, Boojum will allow for GPU provers with as little as 16 GB of RAM. The move to have such a low barrier is crucial to supporting an increasingly decentralised ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Today&rsquo;s rollout of Boojum upgrade will incorporate a phased out integration into mainnet. While live on the mainnet, the upgrade&rsquo;s first implementation is in &ldquo;shadow mode&rdquo;. It means the team will run the new proof system in tandem with the current one.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, while Boojum will be in testing mode, &ldquo;shadow proofs&rdquo; will be generated and verified from real production data on Mainnet blocks. zkSync will continually work on the ecosystem to fine-tune the upgrade&rsquo;s functionality as it moves closer to full migration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dubai, United Arab Emirates, July 17th, 2023, Chainwire</strong></p>
<p>Delegated proof-of-stake blockchain <a href="https://www.kalima.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Kalima</a> has entered into an agreement with ABO Digital, a private alternative funding group based in the Bahamas and Dubai. This significant partnership involves a commitment of US$10 million into the French-based blockchain company. Kalima has also released details of its KLX token sale.</p>
<p>Kalima is a rapidly growing ecosystem that allows businesses, developers, and startups to build web3 enterprise and data governance applications, with a focus on IoT (Internet of Things) data in order to solve real-world problems.</p>
<blockquote><p>Kalima CEO Andr&eacute; Legendre said: &ldquo;The funding commitment from ABO Digital marks a significant milestone for Kalima, which plans to utilize the funds to further innovate and refine IoT solutions to revolutionize industries and drive digital transformation. The arrangement with ABO Digital will enable Kalima to enhance its IoT blockchain solutions for industrial companies and bolster strategic partnerships within the IoT and blockchain ecosystem.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We are excited to work with the Kalima team going forward,&rdquo; said Amine Nedjai, CEO of ABO Digital. &ldquo;Kalima&rsquo;s innovative approach and expertise in web3 enterprise applications align perfectly with our commitment to driving technological advancements in enterprise blockchain solutions.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Kalima team has also announced a 24-hour private sale of its KLX token on Pinksale. The event will provisionally take place on July 19. A general purpose utility token, KLX can be used to pay for transactions and access blockchain services on the Kalima protocol.</p>
<p>To support the growth of the KLX token, on July 10 Kalima Blockchain Governance created several proposals. These include bridging the KLX token from Polygon to the Ethereum network and proposing the 24-hour token sale on Pinksale. Following completion of the private sale event, KLX will be made available for trading on Uniswap, where a KLX-ETH pair will be established.</p>
<p>The primary objective of the private sale, which will have a hard cap of 300 ETH, is to create a sufficiently deep liquidity pool on Uniswap. The Uniswap listing of the KLX token is planned for July 21.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A US federal judge ruled last week that Ripple is a security when sold to institutional investors</li>
<li>Ripple&rsquo;s price jumped by more than 30%</li>
<li>Only a close above parity would invalidate the bearish bias</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Ripple squeezed higher last week following a landmark decision from a federal judge ruling that it is a security when sold to institutional investors. If crypto is a security or not has been the subject of many debates lately.</p>
<p>The ruling is a major victory for Ripple, even though the same judge ruled that Ripple is not a security when sold to retail investors. Nevertheless, Ripple&rsquo;s price bounced from its long-term consolidation area, up over 30% in one single day.</p>
<p>For technical traders, the question is whether the higher spike is enough to break the bearish trend. As it turns out, bulls will have to push some more for Ripple&rsquo;s bearish trend to end.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/06/17/1689589909591-979dd710-cd6b-4aef-9029-b2d49dc2935b.jpg" style="width: 1800px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="1800" height="490"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD/?exchange=CRYPTO">Ripple chart by TradingView</a></p>
<h2>Ripple should trade above parity with the US dollar for the bearish bias to end</h2>
<p>Despite the spike higher, Ripple&rsquo;s price remains under pressure unless it manages to climb above parity with the US dollar.</p>
<p>In other words, it remains sensitive to US dollar news, and any dollar strength should result in Ripple giving up more of its recent games.</p>
<p>However, it would all change if the market climbs above parity. This area has provided resistance since the start of 2022 and still does &ndash; after all, it contained the price action following last week&rsquo;s news.</p>
<p>The good part for bulls is that breakout came at the end of a bullish triangle. The said triangle acted as a reversal pattern, and triangles like these usually appear at the end of bearish trends.</p>
<p>All in all, the bias remains bearish unless more strength leads to Ripple trading above parity. Until then, look for US dollar news to drive the price action.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">XRP rallied by more than 70% on Thursday following favourable ruling in Ripple&rsquo;s legal case against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale nears $800k as more investors enter the market.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has been extremely bullish over the past 24 hours, with the prices of most coins and tokens in the green zone.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale has also been performing excellently and is now set to reach the $800k level as more investors enter the market.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">XRP and XLM rally to new highs</h2>
<p dir="ltr">XRP, the native coin of the Ripple ecosystem, rallied by more than 70% on Thursday, thanks to a favourable ruling in the ongoing Ripple vs. SEC legal case.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ripple-wins-sec-case-xrp-not-a-security/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ruled</u></a> a few hours that the sale of Ripple&rsquo;s XRP tokens on exchanges and through algorithms did not constitute investment contracts.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the judge also ruled that the institutional sale of the tokens did violate federal securities laws.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ripple&rsquo;s partial victory was welcomed by the cryptocurrency ecosystem, with XRP rallying to a one-year high of $0.84 on Thursday, adding more than 70% to its value in the process. At press time, the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/ripple/#:~:text=The%20price%20of%20XRP%20today,trading%20volume%20of%20%24622.39M." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Ripple</u></a> stands at $0.7857</p>
<p dir="ltr">XLM, the native coin of the Stellar Lumen ecosystem, also soared by more than 50% following the Ripple announcement. BTC, ETH, Solana, and Polygon also recorded excellent gains over the last 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Shiba Memu?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a>, although still in its presale stage, is included in the ongoing market rally. Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale reached a new level a few hours ago as more investors entered the market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu is a cryptocurrency token that combines AI and blockchain technology to create an unstoppable, entirely self-sufficient marketing powerhouse.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In their whitepaper, the team explained that Shiba Memu is a project that could do the work of 100 marketing agencies. However, as an AI-based platform, Shiba Memu is also active.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The platform is always working to find the best work going on in creative advertising, eating it up and spitting it back out, but better.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu is riding on the recent popularity of meme coins, which have become a multi-billion dollar sector within the cryptocurrency industry. Over the last three years, the market cap of meme coins grew from practically $0 to reach the $20 billion mark in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, Shiba Memu differs from the hundreds of other meme coins in the market in that it has utility and will solve real-world problems for users.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to their whitepaper, Shiba Memu has self-sufficient marketing capabilities powered by AI technology, making it a unique and attractive investment.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a> will develop its own marketing strategies, write its own PR, and promote itself in relevant forums and social networks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Currently, the project operates on Ethereum and BNB Chain, the two leading DeFi and smart contract blockchains in the cryptocurrency space.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale nears $800k</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale investment has more than tripled over the past seven days. Last week, Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale investment stood at $215,000, and it currently stands at $798,247.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The surge in investment can be attributed to an increase in investors entering the market and investing in the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Shiba Memu team said they would use the funds generated from the presale to develop some of their products. Most of the funds would be used to develop Shiba Memu&rsquo;s AI technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Click here to find out more about&nbsp;<a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale event</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Should you invest in Shiba Memu today?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has experienced an excellent performance since the start of the year, with the prices of most coins and tokens up by nearly 50% during that period.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the market is still down by more than 50% from the all-time high set in 2021. Market analysts are now expecting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to rally in the medium to long term.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The decision to invest in a token depends on the investor. However,&nbsp;<a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a> could be a big winner once the project launches and the token gets listed on cryptocurrency exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu will be combining the powers of AI and blockchain technology to ease marketing strategies for companies and organisations. If the project gets the right level of adoption, its SHMU token could rally higher over the next few months and years.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Katie Haun is the founder and CEO of Haun Ventures and also a former US Department of Justice prosecutor.</li>
<li dir="ltr">In a tweet on Sunday, Haun said the SEC is unlikely to appeal as the agency wouldn&rsquo;t want to lose on appeal.</li>
<li dir="ltr">XRP price rose significantly after the judge&rsquo;s summary ruling.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Katie Haun, the founder and CEO of Haun Ventures and former prosecutor at the US Department of Justice, believes the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is unlikely to seek an &ldquo;immediate appeal&rdquo; of the court ruling that effectively declared&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/xrp/"><u>XRP</u></a> not a security.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">SEC immediate appeal &ldquo;unlikely&rdquo;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Haun, who sees the win for&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/ripple/"><u>Ripple</u></a> after its tussle with the agency as a great outcome for crypto, shared her opinion via tweeted remarks on Sunday. The comments follow last week&rsquo;s summary court ruling that was largely welcome across the industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;ve spoken with trusted legal colleagues (including @HaunVenturesv advisors Steve Engel and James Burnham) and the consensus is that the court drew a reasonable line&mdash;distinguishing between XRP itself (not an investment contract and thus not a security) and certain XRP transactions in which institutional investors paid money to Ripple directly and Ripple made contractual commitments in exchange, creating an investment contract under Howey</em>,&rdquo; Haun tweeted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to her, the distinction has offered the crypto industry an avenue to explore in cases the SEC has brought against some of the top exchanges. The argument here is that &ldquo;tokens are never &ldquo;investment contracts&rdquo; on their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Only binding contracts imposing post-sale obligations on the seller can constitute investment contracts and hence tokens traded on exchanges or secondary markets would almost never qualify</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">On whether the SEC will appeal the court&rsquo;s decision, Haun notes that there&rsquo;s a possibility it could. However, it&rsquo;s unlikely to be an immediate appeal. On why this could be the case, the former a16z fund manager explained:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;&hellip; <em>an immediate appeal seems unlikely both because the agency would have to ask the court to split this decision from the portion going to trial and because I&rsquo;m skeptical the SEC actually wants legal clarity. The Commission benefits from the current confusion and losing these issues on appeal would jeopardize its entire enforcement agenda. So I&rsquo;d be surprised if the SEC tried to appeal now</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Congress needs to step in </h2>
<p dir="ltr">XRP price skyrocketed more than 100% as a result, hitting highs of $0.94. However, the coin&rsquo;s value is hovering near $0.75. &nbsp;The partial win for Ripple could be key in pushing XRP above the $1 supply wall.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some observers have&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1679904748273532936"><u>opined</u></a> that the court&rsquo;s decision could be reversed on appeal, while some&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1679882709718519808"><u>say</u></a> Ripple faces a significant penalty in case of settlement. The overall sentiment though is that while the ruling delivered a blow to the SEC, what remains to be seen is what it does for the broader question of regulation.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Can Congress step in? Haun says it&rsquo;s imperative they do so.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Even if the outcome here was positive overall, the complexity of the court&rsquo;s reasoning suggests that existing laws and jurisprudence may be ill-equipped to contend with all the important policy concerns at play. The major questions doctrine seems built for crypto at this moment: major decisions on policy like this are for Congress, not unelected agencies,</em>&rdquo; she noted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Crypto prices are rising sharply, with Bitcoin up 20% in the last three weeks</li>
<li dir="ltr">The filing of a number of high-profile Bitcoin ETFs has pushed optimism in the market</li>
<li dir="ltr">Under the hood, liquidity remains low and some worrisome trends emerge, however</li>
<li dir="ltr">The regulatory woes are still present, with Coinbase and Binance facing a murky future</li>
<li dir="ltr">The macro picture also remains uncertain, with the prospect of a lagged impact via tightening monetary policy looming large</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">It wouldn&rsquo;t be like crypto markets to get overly excited. In the past couple of weeks, positivity has returned to the space, led by the seminal filings for a Bitcoin spot ETF by two of the world&rsquo;s biggest asset managers, Blackrock and Fidelity.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additionally, Fidelity were among a cohort of large trad-fi operators, including Schwab and Citadel Securities, to back the new exchange EDX, which offers trading for Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin is up 20% in the last three weeks, breaching past the $30,000 mark, while Ether is up 16% in the same timeframe, approaching the $2,000 mark once more. A glance at the <a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/"><u>Fear and Greed</u></a> index, an interesting metric which gauges overall sentiment in the space, shows it is markedly in the &ldquo;greed&rdquo; sector with a score of 61 (0 represents extreme fear, 100 represents extreme greed).&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/06/05/1688557574714-e61e6782-a3ef-4b4a-9f4f-a101fbbe3e8d.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="535">And yet, a look under the hood betrays some concern. Firstly, if the filing of the ETFs is the reason for the recent ramp, as it appears to be, is a 20% jump justified? The SEC has declared the recent filings as &ldquo;inadequate&rdquo;, according to the WSJ, informing the Nasdaq and CBOE (who filed the paperwork on behalf of the asset managers) that there is not enough detail with respect to &ldquo;surveillance-sharing agreements&rdquo;. The SEC had previously said that sponsors of a Bitcoin trust are required to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the applications can be updated and refiled (and the CBOE did indeed refile theirs since, with Nasdaq likely soon to follow) the development hints at how difficult it has been to get the much-coveted spot ETF over the line. There is no guarantee that these are approved, despite the big names involved &ndash; the SEC even rejected an application from Fidelity in the past, turning it away in January 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In truth, it feels inevitable that Bitcoin spot ETFs will one day be traded freely, but a 20% jump on a mere filing in the last couple of weeks is a massive ramp when considering what else has happened in the space, and the state of markets, which we will delve into now.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Liquidity</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Liquidity continues to lag, a factor which cannot be overstated &ndash; and indeed one which the eventual approval of spot ETFs should help.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Looking at centralised exchanges per data from Kaiko as we close out the second quarter of 2023, volume over the past three months was lower again, coming in at the lowest number since 2020, before Bitcoin and crypto embarked on their inexorable price rises and took the financial world by storm.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/06/05/1688557591169-492d05de-add9-47cf-86fa-47539ff38e28.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="324"></p>
<p dir="ltr">But with lower liquidity, moves to both the upside and downside are exacerbated. This has perhaps contributed to Bitcoin&rsquo;s steep rise in the past few weeks, and also year-to-date, with it currently up 83%.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">But liquidity and volumes being so low should be alarming for market participants. Much of the inroads made during the pandemic, with regard to Bitcoin taking its place next to bona-fide asset classes from a trading perspective, have slowed if not reversed &ndash; at least from a liquidity perspective.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As further evidence of this, in the below chart, I&rsquo;ve presented the total balance of stablecoins across exchanges, which has fallen a staggering 60% in the past six months &ndash; an outflow of $26 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/14290288">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">Having said that, there are pockets of optimism which hint at a brighter future if/when these spot ETFs do get approved. Looking at volume in derivatives markets, it has been rather consistent. In fact, it is markedly up on the second half of 2022. Perhaps this means the spot market has been greater affected by the regulatory crackdown. Either way, it&rsquo;s a less gruesome picture than what we are seeing in spot markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/06/05/1688557591126-4dee794c-aab5-4225-8275-f59e55c418c3.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="327"></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Regulation</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Right now, with regard to crypto-specific risk, it really all comes back to regulation. We have discussed the ETF filings, but June also brought two seminal moments: formal charges brought against Coinbase and Binance.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The two cases are extremely different, mind you. Binance&rsquo;s lawsuit <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/opinion-binance-sued-by-sec-an-inevitable-but-ominous-day-for-crypto/"><u>could not be less surprising</u></a>, with the exchange constantly skirting guidelines and laws. The charges amount to a laundry list of different offences, including trading against customers, manipulating trade volume, encouraging users to circumvent geographical restrictions and securities violations.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is the latter charge which is the centre of the suit against Coinbase, however, and the most pivotal of the lot. It is also why the Coinbase suit is <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/coinbase-and-cryptos-fate-hangs-by-a-string-a-deep-dive/"><u>far more intriguing</u></a>. Do not forget that the allegations are coming from the SEC, the same body which presided over Coinbase&rsquo;s IPO in April 2021. Why did the SEC let an unregistered securities exchange float on a US stock exchange? You tell me.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">But let&rsquo;s get back to the point: what this all means for crypto markets. While Bitcoin appears to be carving its own place out in the eyes of the law, a slew of other tokens were named as securities by the SEC. Despite this, they have risen sharply since off the Bitcoin ETF news. Does this make sense?&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h2>
<p dir="ltr">At the end of the day, crypto is going to crypto. Prices move, and trying to pinpoint reasons is often a fool&rsquo;s errand. The last month, however, feels like we have seen an extremely aggressive price rise despite some bad news on the regulatory front.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additionally, the macro picture has not changed much, even with the pause at the last Fed meeting. Fed chair Jerome Powell&rsquo;s comments made it clear that this was a pause rather than an about-turn in policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Looking ahead, nearly all committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year,&rdquo; Powell said when announcing the pause.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The market believes him. I backed out probabilities from Fed futures in the next chart, which show that there is currently an 86% chance of a 25 bps hike at the next Fed meeting in three weeks time, with only a 14% chance of rates being left unchanged again. I have presented this next to the same probabilities conveyed by the market exactly a month ago (Bitcoin is up 20% in the time since), showing softer forecasts do not explain the sharp price (the chance of no hike has actually come down).&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/14349271">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">As I said, crypto going to crypto. But with assets as notoriously volatile as what we see in this sector, it would be wise to stop and think about whether the sudden wave of positivity is justified. When considering the liquidity picture and the regulatory trouble, there are plenty of reasons to hesitate.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then when one layers in the macro picture, the picture becomes murkier again. Let us not forget that we are in the midst of one of the swiftest rate hiking cycles in modern history, with rates rising all the way from zero to above 5%, and the prospect of them rising even further later this month.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Monetary policy operates with a lag, and the scale of that tightening is enormous. Sentiment may feel like it has flipped dramatically, but there is a long road ahead yet.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals is in its second presale phase with huge demand for the tokens.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">AI has grown popular, with AltSignals expecting it to increase the quality of trading signals.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">$ASI price could start to rise in the third quarter as the token will begin to list.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">There has been a new reawakening in artificial intelligence since ChatGPT was created, and big tech companies started making multi-billion-dollar investments in the sector. One company that has realised this trend is AltSignals, a trading signal service platform founded in 2017. Since launching the&nbsp;<a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>presale</u></a> of the $ASI token, powering the AltSignals AI platform, investors have been accumulating. The first presale phase sold out quickly, and more than half of the tokens are bought in the second phase.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>The power of AI trading and AltSignals iteration</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Trading is becoming automated daily, and AI is becoming integral to that. The trading industry has used automation for enhanced market analysis and predictions. Since starting in 2017, AltSignals has benefited from automation, using the AltAlgo&trade; indicator to generate quality trading signals. That has made it an on-demand platform, attracting over 52,000 members on Telegram and more than 1,400 VIPs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals want to take the game of automation to the next level. Owing to the increasing popularity of AI, the company seeks to incorporate AI to tap into the power of deep machine learning, forecasting, and sentimental analysis. The company expects AI to increase the quality of signals generated.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals also expects AI to revolutionise trading experiences. With AI, traders can make entries with clearer confluences and better risk management. With an already winning strategy that generates signals with average success rates of over 64%, AltSignals expects AI to be a game-changer for its trading community.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What buying $ASI means</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Investors buying $ASI will have access to the AltSignals AI platform dubbed ActualizeAI. The platform confers investors full benefits of trading signals and interacting with other traders. $ASI also decentralises AltSignals governance. Members can vote on issues and determine the directions taken by the AltSignals team.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But AltSignals also want investors to grow with the platform. As such, there will be trading competitions and tournaments. Users participating in the contests will have an additional chance to win $ASI. This could be ideal for investors looking to advance their skills in trading by learning from others and applying their competencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Members of ActualizeAI have exclusive access to presale opportunities and future AI-powered products. The AI Members Club also lets users earn $ASI by giving their ideas and feedback on AlSignals products.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Is AltSignals a good investment, and what is its price potential in 2023?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Altsignals powers a demanded service. The platform has a following and is only advancing to the next level. Investing in $ASI means taking a position in an already successful platform. It could be a good investment for investors looking to improve their trading or benefit from quality trading signals to increase their incomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">$ASI also carries huge potential given the already successful project and growing application of AI. As the presale has shown, the demand for the token is already high. The token could explode in value and generate returns for investors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The price of $ASI could start to rise in the third quarter of 2023 when the token will list on Uniswap. However, the real price potential could be realised when the AI platform launches in early 2024 and more investors join.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a conservative prediction, double or triple-digit price increases should be the minimum by the end of 2023. In 2024, the price could rise by over 1,000%, following similar trends set by newly launched projects and tokens.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Should you buy $ASI this week?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">$ASI is valued at $0.01875 this week and is in its second presale phase. The price began at $0.015 in the first phase and will rise at each stage. Buying now could be ideal for investors looking to spend less and get more before the price increases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Seychelles, seychelles, July 17th, 2023, Chainwire</strong></p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">As part of Flipster&rsquo;s (formerly AQX) name launch, the business today announced an additional 1,500,000 USD worth of bonus rewards to encourage new users to join and trade on their exchange. Until the rewards are fully distributed, the futures exchange will run at least one campaign per week to encourage new users to signup and trade derivatives on the Flipster platform. Under the old name the exchange has already made available more than 400,000USDT worth bonus in past campaigns.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The first promotion in the series kicked off on the 17th of July, 2023 (running for seven days). A massive 110,000 USDT in bonuses has been allocated. 10,000 USDT to reward new users when completing identity verification with a 10 USDT Bonus. The remaining 100,000 USDT bonus is to incentivise and reward high volume traders that give the platform a chance. The top performer by trading volume will be rewarded with 10,000 USDT in Bonus at the end of the weekly campaign.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Flipster has reimagined futures trading with a mobile-first approach to appeal to casual crypto traders with limited experience in derivatives trading (or, as they say, Flipping).</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The method is to specialize in derivatives trading, stripping back the app experience to make it faster to learn and easier to use. Novice traders can open, close and monitor positions from any location. Potentially meaning some users may make more money on the bus to work, than from their days Labor. Beyond ease of use, the portable experience makes trading fun and feels less like a technical task.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The flip to a mobile-first approach came after initially having a web experience similar to other futures exchanges. The traditional UI for futures trading has a steep learning curve and is considerably more technical, which strongly contrasts with the UI that most contemporary apps users have become familiar with. The data concluded that users new to derivatives were not attracted to this experience as it had been built for experienced traders. The Flipster team discovered a few alternative UIs for future trading and none that have successfully been created to onboard new users to crypto futures trading at scale.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">While the focus is on simplicity, Flipster has features that will spark the interest of experienced traders as well. The exchange regularly adds new perpetual swap contracts, and as of today, over 120 assets can be traded with leverage, making Flipster a competitive exchange for traders to consider. Amongst their assets are tokens not found for futures on other exchanges and some even with low visibility in spot markets.</p>
<blockquote><p>CEO Yongjin Kim said, &ldquo;The team has been working very hard on bringing this new vision for futures trading to life, and now is the right time to incentivise users to trade with us. Once users start trading on our platform, they will be coming back again and again. Rather than just copying what every other exchange has done, we are doing something fresh, and I believe the market is ready for some injection of new ideas. To our existing users, I want to thank you for being with us, and to the new guys coming in now, Welcome&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">6 years ago today, a little exchange called <a href="https://twitter.com/binance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Binance</a> launched.

<h2 dir="ltr">Binance&rsquo;s employee layoffs</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Multiple crypto and mainstream companies have in the past year or so aggressively cut on their headcount, with crypto&rsquo;s situation exacerbated by the debilitating crypto winter. Binance was among those to eye staff reduction as Wu Blockchain revealed in a May 31<a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1663890209526927373" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;<u>tweet</u></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Prior to the expected employee cut, the Changpeng &lsquo;CZ&rsquo; Zhao led company had an estimated 8,000 employees globally. Reports highlighted plans to send 20% of the workforce home.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Binance remains the world&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange by trading volume. However, the past month has been tough for the company in terms of the myriad of regulatory challenges it has faced.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The early June lawsuit by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), came as the exchange exited a number of countries due to regulatory reasons. It included Belgium and the Netherlands, and it <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/binance-drops-its-license-application-in-austria/">ended its pursuit of a license in Austria</a>. Menwhile, it also faced scrutiny in France and recently Australia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There have also been exits by top executives, including exchange&rsquo;s former Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann.</p>
