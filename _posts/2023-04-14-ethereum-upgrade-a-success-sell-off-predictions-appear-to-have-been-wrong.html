As more people get familiar with cryptocurrency and its uses, they'll become more comfortable holding onto their tokens, even during periods of potential volatility.<br /><br />Overall, another strong week for crypto!<br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="color: #333333;">---<br /></span></span><i style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; color: red; font-weight: bolder;">Author:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #333333;">Mark Pippen<br /></span></i><i style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;"><span style="color: #0b5394;">London News Desk&nbsp;<br /></span></span></span></i><i style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;"><a href="https://www.globalcryptopress.com/"><span style="color: #444444;">Breaking Crypto News</span></a>&nbsp;</span></span></i></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"><img src="//feedburner.google.com/fb/images/pub/feed-icon32x32.png" alt="" style="border:0"/></a><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">Subscribe to GCP in a reader</a></div>
