<ul><li>Voyager Digital may start distributing its remaining assets to creditors in the next few weeks.&nbsp;</li><li>The announcement was made by Voyager’s Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors.&nbsp;</li><li>The direct distribution plan for customers was unveiled last month after Binance US pulled out from a deal to acquire Voyager.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The stranded customers of Voyager Digital got some relief earlier today after the bankrupt crypto lender indicated that it may start repaying them in the next few weeks. Voyager Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors recently took to Twitter to announce that the company was deliberating the final liquidation procedures. </p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>Voyager Digital To File Final Liquidation Procedures On May 5</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/VoyagerUCC/status/1654203057591267329" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> thread from Voyager’s Unsecured Creditors Committee, the bankrupt crypto lender and the committee is in the process of finalizing the liquidation procedures. The committee reminded its Twitter community that any plan for liquidating the firm’s assets are required to be filed before they come into effect. The liquidation procedure will lay out the details of the method by which creditors will receive the distribution from Voyager. </p>



<p>Once the liquidation procedures are filed parties will have ten days to express any objection to the plan. In the event that any party objects, the bankruptcy court will schedule a hearing to consider the objection before allowing the crypto lender to go ahead with the liquidation. In case no objections are filed, Voyager Digital’s distribution plan will come into effect. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Voyager is also finalizing everything internally that is necessary to make distributions to creditors. We are hopeful that initial distributions will begin within the next few weeks.”</p><cite>Committee of Unsecured Creditors</cite></blockquote>



<p>Voyager Digital’s (VYGVQ) share price gained more than 6% following the latest development. The firm initially <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-us-ends-1-billion-voyager-deal/">announced</a> its plan to distribute the remaining assets to creditors and stranded customers on April 25, 2023, after Binance US terminated the $1 billion deal to acquire Voyager&#8217;s assets. At the time, the bankrupt crypto lender stated that the Chapter 11 plan allows for the direct distribution of cash and crypto to customers using its online platform. </p>

<ul><li>The Bankruptcy Court of Delaware has authorized bankrupt crypto exchange FTX to sell its LedgerX.</li><li>The derivatives trading platform is set to be sold to M7 Holdings LLC for $50 Million.</li><li>The sale is part of a broader effort from the bankrupt exchange’s management to repay its creditors.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware has approved the sale of FTX’s non-bankrupt crypto derivatives exchange LedgerX. The bankruptcy court’s approval comes less than two weeks after the defunct crypto exchange announced that it had reached an agreement with an affiliate of Miami International Holdings to sell LedgerX in a multi-million dollar deal.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>FTX Will Sell LedgerX To M7 Holdings</strong></h2>



<p>The bankruptcy hearing for the proposed sale was streamed live on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoXrCSg4uHc" rel="nofollow noopener">Youtube</a> earlier today. Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey gave FTX the green light to sell its LedgerX business to M7 Holdings LLC for $50 million. The buyer is an affiliate of Miami International Holdings, which owns and operates several exchanges, including the Bermuda Stock Exchange and the Miami International Securities Exchange. </p>



<p>FTX <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-announces-ledgerx-sale-for-50-million/">announced</a> on April 25, 2023, that it had entered into an interest purchase agreement with M7 Holdings LLC to offload LedgerX. The agreement to offload the crypto derivatives exchange came after a comprehensive sale process that saw participation from multiple bidders including popular crypto exchange OKX. At the time, FTX stated that the deal with M7 was subject to approval from the Delaware bankruptcy court as well as the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission. </p>



<p>LedgerX’s sale is part of a broader effort from the bankrupt crypto exchange’s new management to raise funds in order to repay its creditors and customers. Speaking on the initial agreement with M7 Holdings, FTX CEO John Ray stated, “We are pleased to reach this agreement with MIH, which is an example of our continuing efforts to monetize assets to deliver recoveries to stakeholders.”</p>

<ul><li>A WallStreetBets’ insider who rugged WSB Coin has returned the funds he took from the project.&nbsp;</li><li>$WSB lost more than 90% earlier today after insiders dumped more than half a million dollars worth of the memecoin.&nbsp;</li><li>The insider responsible for the rug pull has since made contact with the WallStreetBets team to make WSB investors whole.&nbsp;</li><li>$WSB gained more than 150% after the insider agreed to return the funds.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The WallStreetBets insider accused of pulling the rug from under WSB Coin investors has returned the funds he took from the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/doge-up-6-twitter-crypto-trading-etoro/">memecoin</a> project. In a rather interesting turn of events, WSB Coin’s zjz.eth who was accused of rugging the project, took to <a href="https://twitter.com/zjzWSB/status/1654089362563366915" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today to defend his actions and instead accuse WallStreetBets’ Twitter operator WSBMod of gaining undue profits through secret airdrops of the memecoin. Following hours of back and forth, the stolen funds were returned to the project, leading to a 155% hike in WSB Coin’s price. </p>



<h2><strong>WallStreetBets Insider Returns 332 ETH To WSB Coin</strong></h2>



<p>The controversy started earlier today after the recently launched WSB Coin lost more than 90% of its value. Popular On-chain sleuth ZachXBT <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1653937194388664322" rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> that a member of WallStreetBets (zjz.eth) had dumped more than $600,000 worth of WSB from the project’s marketing funds that he was holding for safekeeping. The insider then proceeded to collude with the moderator of the WallStreetBets subreddit (OIP), to drain the project’s multi-sig treasury.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WSBMod called out the project’s insiders on Twitter and demanded they get in touch to facilitate the return of the stolen funds. The moderator shared the identities of both insiders on Twitter and threatened to contact the FBI over their rug pull. zjz.eth soon took to Twitter to reveal that he was seeking a return mechanism for the eth he had taken. He further accused WSBMod of draining WSB Coin through secret airdrops of over $25,000. He alleged that the memecoin was designed to enrich the moderator. However, he was called out by the community for dumping the stolen WSBs and netting over half a million dollars in the process. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was ordered to respond to a complaint from crypto exchange Coinbase within the next 10 days, a court ruled on Wednesday.</li><li>Coinbase filed a lawsuit to force the watchdog to clarify how it interprets and applies securities laws to the cryptocurrency industry.</li><li>The ruling is the latest development in an ongoing showdown between crypto businesses in the U.S. and financial watchdogs.</li></ul>



<p>On Wednesday, a U.S. court <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1653898889311948800?s=20" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1653898889311948800?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ordered</a> the Securities and Exchange Commission to answer a lawsuit regarding how the watchdog applies federal laws to the nascent digital asset industry and cryptocurrencies. </p>



<p>The complaint in question was filed by crypto exchange Coinbase after the SEC issued a Wells notice to the company. Indeed, the regulator alleged a &#8220;possible violation of securities laws&#8221; by Coinbase. </p>



<p>In response, Coinbase sued the regulator for opting to reign in the crypto industry through enforcement actions rather than providing sufficient guidance and compliance guidelines.</p>



<p>Coinbase cited a petition from 2022 that asked the watchdog to provide official rules for the crypto industry. Gary Gensler&#8217;s commission is yet to address the petition. Instead, the regulator has cracked down on crypto entities like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for allegedly breaking existing securities laws. </p>



<p>The regulator now has 10 days to respond to Coinbase&#8217;s suit following the court ruling on Wednesday. Also, the crypto exchange may submit a reply seven days after the regulator files. </p>



<h2>SEC Enforcement Actions </h2>



<p>The watchdog has continuously maintained that the crypto industry remains a threat to U.S. financial stability. While likening crypto to the &#8220;wild wild west&#8221; and insisting that existing securities laws provide sufficient oversight, the regulator has also undertaken several enforcement actions against crypto businesses. </p>



<p>Crypto proponents speculated that the latest round of enforcement actions is part of a called &#8220;operation chokepoint 2.0&#8221;, a joint initiative between state and federal regulators meant to boot out crypto and digital asset staking services from America. </p>



<p>Coinbase was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-launch-offshore-crypto-exchange/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-launch-offshore-crypto-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused</a> of violating securities laws in March. Crypto trust company Paxos also received a Wells notice from the watchdog over alleged violations. Binance was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-nydfs-against-binance-deal-voyager/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-nydfs-against-binance-deal-voyager/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">embroiled</a> in a legal sparring match with the commission over a $1 billion deal to buy Voyager assets. </p>



<p>Some businesses like <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/pierce-lambasts-sec-kraken-decision/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/pierce-lambasts-sec-kraken-decision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kraken</a> were fined and forced to completely shut down some of their on-shore services. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Coinbase users will no longer be able to borrow up to $1 million using Bitcoin as collateral.</li><li>The crypto exchange plans to shut down its Borrow program starting May 10, 2023, due to insufficient demand for the product.</li><li>Wednesday&#8217;s decision also comes amid a tussle between U.S. regulators and crypto businesses like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance.</li></ul>



<p>Coinbase users will no longer be able to access cash loans using Bitcoin as collateral as the company moves to unwind its Borrow product. </p>



<p>According to an <a href="https://twitter.com/hyper_deflation/status/1653793658913554439?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/hyper_deflation/status/1653793658913554439?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">email</a> sent to users on Wednesday, the crypto exchange plans to shut down its Borrow program starting May 10 this year. The move will not affect outstanding loans but users will not have the option to take new loans. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Beginning May 10, 2023, customers will no longer be able to take out new loans with Coinbase Borrow. There is no impact on your outstanding loans and there is no action required at this time. You will continue to have access to your loan history and the full Borrow dashboard.</p></blockquote>



<p>Coinbase U.S. users were introduced to the Borrow product back in August 2020. The program did not launch till over a year later in November 2021, giving users an option to access cash without liquidating their BTC holdings. </p>



<p>Users in some U.S. states were allowed to borrow as much as $1 million against their Bitcoin balances at an 8.7% annual percentage rate (APR). </p>



<p>Interest in the product has seemingly declined in the two years since its launch. A Coinbase spokesperson noted that the reduced interest was the main reason behind closing the borrow program. </p>



<p>&#8220;We regularly evaluate our products to ensure we’re prioritizing the offerings that our customers care about most,&#8221; said the spokesperson. </p>



<h2>Coinbase Embroiled In Battle With U.S. Regulators</h2>



<p>Although regulatory concerns were not the main reason for Wednesday&#8217;s decision, the move comes amid tension between U.S. regulators like the SEC and crypto businesses. </p>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a Well notice to Coinbase in March over alleged securities law violations. In response, the crypto exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-responds-to-secs-wells-notice/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-responds-to-secs-wells-notice/" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued</a> the SEC to strong Gary Gensler&#8217;s commission into clarifying regulations for the crypto industry. </p>



<p>Coinbase is also looking toward offshore options, The company recently <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-launch-offshore-crypto-exchange/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-launch-offshore-crypto-exchange/" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> a derivatives exchange domiciled in Bermuda. </p>

<p>Ethereum&#8217;s stablecoin market welcomes a new contender built by the developers of decentralized trading venue Curve Finance. </p>



<p>On May 3, the DEX developers <a href="https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1653872243556986880?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1653872243556986880?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> that smart contracts for crvUSD were deployed on Ethereum&#8217;s mainnet. The team minted 20 million crvUSD tokens in total. Users can view this stablecoin supply on Etherscan. </p>



<p>&#8220;This is not finalized yet because UI also needs to be deployed. Stay tuned!&#8221; said crvUSD developers promising to roll out a user interface for the stablecoin.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As many figured &#8211; deployment of crvUSD smart contracts has happened!<br><br>This is not finalized yet because UI also needs to be deployed. Stay tuned!</p>&mdash; Curve Finance (@CurveFinance) <a href="https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1653872243556986880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">May 3, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<h2>Curve Finance&#8217;s Mechanics For Its Stablecoin </h2>



<p>Curve Finance designed its crvUSD stablecoin as a U.S. dollar-pegged token with an over-collateralized structure. This means that crvUSD can only be minted by posting collateral in supported cryptocurrencies. Minters must provide excess collateral against the amount of crvUSD tokens that they wish to mint. </p>



<p>The design leverages other crypto assets rather than fiat currencies, a design similar to Maker&#8217;s DAI stablecoin. </p>



<p>Opting for an over-collateralized asset structure comes with its risk. The Curve Finance team implemented a fresh blockchain algorithm called Lending-Liquidating AMM or LLAMMA to mitigate this risk. LLAMMA achieves this by liquidating and depositing crypto assets as collateral. Developers automated the process to optimize crvUSD&#8217;s mechanics. </p>



<h2>New Stablecoin On The Block</h2>



<p>crvUSD enters a highly competitive Ethereum stablecoin market with names like DAI, USDT, and USDC. However, the stablecoin was designed by one of the largest DeFi entities on the market. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/curve-finance-initiates-proposal-to-stop-incentivizing-ust-pools-with-crv/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/curve-finance-initiates-proposal-to-stop-incentivizing-ust-pools-with-crv/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Curve Finance</a>&#8216;s authority in the space could drive crvUSD adoption among stablecoin users who tap into crypto&#8217;s $130 billion stablecoin market cap. </p>

<ul><li>OpenSea’s former product manager Nate Chastain has been convicted of wire fraud and money laundering.&nbsp;</li><li>A federal jury in New York found Chastain guilty of using insider information to trade NFTs.</li><li>The former executive faces up to 40 years in prison for netting $50,000 from his insider trading scheme.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Nate Chastain, the former Product Manager at NFT marketplace OpenSea, has been convicted by a federal grand jury in New York in the first-ever NFT <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-manager-guilty-insider-trading/">insider trading</a> case. Chastain’s conviction comes less than two weeks after the first hearing in his case was held in the District Court for the Southern District of New York. </p>



<h2><strong>Former OpenSea Executive Faces Up To 40 Years In Prison</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ex-opensea-manager-convicted-nft-insider-trading-case-2023-05-03/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a>, the federal jury found Chastain guilty of money laundering and wire fraud for his role in the NFT insider trading scheme. He faces up to 40 years in prison. The charges were filed against him in June last year by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan. As the head of product, Chastain was responsible for picking the digital artworks that would be featured on the NFT marketplace’s homepage.</p>



<p>Federal prosecutors accused the former OpenSea executive of abusing his position at the firm to illegally trade NFTs. He reportedly made more than $50,000 between June 2021 and September 2021 by purchasing NFTs that were about to be listed, and then offloading them after their prices surged. Chastain reportedly tried to cover his tracks by using multiple wallets and accounts to route his funds. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Nathaniel Chastain exploited his advanced knowledge of which NFTs would be featured on OpenSea’s website to make profitable trades for himself. Although this case involved trades in novel crypto assets, there was nothing particularly innovative about his conduct — it was fraud.” </p><cite>Damian Williams, U.S. Attorney SDNY</cite></blockquote>



<p>Nate Chastain’s guilty verdict comes more than six months after his lawyers filed a motion to get the case dismissed on procedural grounds. He pleaded not guilty as his lawyers argued that OpenSea did not treat the insider knowledge as confidential information during his tenure at the company. &#8220;Nobody told Nate that he couldn&#8217;t use or share that information,” the former executive’s lawyers stated during the closing arguments earlier this week. </p>

<ul><li>Changpeng Zhao recently stated that believes that support from banks is the biggest challenge for crypto.&nbsp;</li><li>The Binance Chief believes that traditional finance systems are important for furthering crypto adoption.&nbsp;</li><li>Zhao views traditional banking institutions as a necessary element for Bitcoin rather than a rival.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Changpeng Zhao, the man at the helm of the world’s largest crypto exchange, believes that support from the traditional finance industry is an important prerequisite to increase the adoption of cryptocurrencies. Zhao’s comments came during a recent ask-me-anything (AMA) <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/from-cz/highlights-from-czs-may-1-ama-4719549893974593654" rel="nofollow noopener">session</a> where he answered questions on topics like crypto regulation, the relationship between traditional banking institutions and the crypto industry, and token listings on his crypto exchange. </p>



<h2><strong>Changpeng Zhao: Banks And Bitcoin Are Not Rivals</strong></h2>



<p>Speaking on Banking v. Bitcoin, Changpeng Zhao stated that the success or failure of banks doesn’t necessarily have a meaningful impact on crypto. According to him, the extent of the impact is limited to Bitcoin’s role as a safe haven asset when investors lose confidence in TradFi. However, that is true for real estate and gold as well. Zhao believes that it is possible for crypto to coexist with banks and traditional fiat currencies rather than it being a zero-sum game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/justin-sun-apologize-binance-cz-sui-tusd/">Binance</a> chief further argued that the success of banks will lead to a more prosperous economy with money and value which will translate to a better scenario for the crypto industry. “The more people, the more activity, the better it is for everyone. That&#8217;s how I view things,” Zhao added. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If banks are willingly working with crypto, especially exchanges, then we can really facilitate the flow between traditional financial systems and crypto financial systems.”</p><cite>Changpeng Zhao, Co-founder and CEO of Binance</cite></blockquote>



<p>When asked about the regulatory landscape for the crypto industry, Changpeng Zhao revealed that the number one challenge for crypto firms today is receiving support from banks. The regulatory uncertainty surrounding the crypto industry has discouraged traditional banking institutions from catering to businesses operating in the crypto space. Zhao believes that a proper regulatory framework will restore investors’ and banks’ confidence in crypto, which will ultimately further its adoption.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the AMA session, the Binance CEO also talked about memecoins and the listing of tokens on his crypto exchange. He clarified that he isn&#8217;t involved in Binance’s token listing process. As far as memecoins are concerned, Zhao revealed that he never understood them. However, as long as users are willing to trade them, his exchange will list them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>BUSD&#8217;s Fall</h2>



<p>BUSD&#8217;s dwindling activity comes after its issuer Paxos was the subject of enforcement actions from two U.S. regulators. The crypto trust company received a <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-binance-stablecoin-paxos-busd/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-binance-stablecoin-paxos-busd/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wells notice</a> from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accusing Paxos of issuing unregistered securities. Paxos promised to litigate if necessary and &#8220;categorically&#8221; <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/busd-issuer-paxos-in-discussion-u-s-sec/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/busd-issuer-paxos-in-discussion-u-s-sec/" rel="noreferrer noopener">opposed</a> the SEC&#8217;s allegations. </p>



<p>New York&#8217;s Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) ordered Paxos to cease issuing new BUSD tokens. Paxos is regulated by the NYDFS and can operate in New York&#8217;s jurisdiction. The company said redemptions would <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/paxos-busd-binance-redemptions-till-2024/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/paxos-busd-binance-redemptions-till-2024/" rel="noreferrer noopener">continue until February 2024</a> at the very least. </p>

Community members proposed removing the stablecoin from lending pools and decentralized services. Platforms like Coinbase also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-suspend-busd-trading-march-13/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-suspend-busd-trading-march-13/" rel="noreferrer noopener">moved</a> to delist the token. </p>



<h2>Tether Solidifies Stablecoin Lead</h2>



<p>Tether&#8217;s USDT, crypto&#8217;s largest stablecoin, continues to command the lion&#8217;s market share of the stablecoin ecosystem amid troubling times for rivals. At its peak, BUSD boasted over $23 billion in supply. This figure has dipped sharply to around $5 billion. </p>



<p>USDT&#8217;s market cap alone is north of $82 billion. Tether&#8217;s closest competitor Circle (USDC) has a market cap of just above $30 billion. Tether is also reportedly minting significant amounts of new USDT tokens. </p>



<p>Typically, Tether creates new USDT in response to increased demand, signaling the influx of fresh cash into the ecosystem often deployed to purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies.</p>

<ul><li>Celsius founder Alex Mashinsky has filed a motion to dismiss the complaint filed by the Attorney General of New York.</li><li>The lawsuit accused Mashinsky of misleading and defrauding the investors of his crypto lending firm. </li><li>The former CEO has dismissed the allegations made in the lawsuit and called them “baseless”.  </li></ul>



<p>Alex Mashinsky, the man behind the failed crypto lending firm <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-creditors-suspicious-trades-ftx/">Celsius</a>, has filed a motion in the Supreme Court of New York to dismiss a complaint filed against him by the state of New York in January this year. Mashinsky’s lawyers responded by claiming that the fraud claims made against him by New York Attorney General Letitia James, are baseless and derived from online misinformation. </p>



<h2><strong>Alex Mashinsky: Crypto Products Offered By Celsius Were Not Securities</strong></h2>



<p>The lawsuit was <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-sues-former-ceo-celsius-cryptocurrency-platform-defrauding" rel="nofollow noopener">filed</a> by the State of New York against Alex Mashinsky for defrauding hundreds of thousands of investors out of billions of dollars worth of crypto assets. The lawsuit alleged that Mashinsky repeatedly made false and misleading statements regarding Celsius’ safety to encourage investors to deposit billions worth of crypto into the crypto lender. Attorney General James further alleged that amid last year’s crypto contagion, Mashinsky misrepresented and concealed the financial health of his company. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=/mPuBL5LQ5Z2OEWZ70pvhw==" rel="nofollow noopener">court filing</a> by the former CEO’s lawyers, the allegations made in the lawsuit “parrot misformation” on the internet about Mashinsky and Celsius. They claimed that the “baseless” conclusions in the complaint demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding of the bankrupt crypto lender’s business and the role that the former CEO played in it. In the response, Mashinsky’s lawyers claimed that Celsius’ bankruptcy was blamed on him despite being caused due to external events that were out of his control. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Complaint cynically cherry picks fragments of statements and sound bites, without broader context, falsely depicting Celsius’s exceptional transparencies with its users as a deceptive tactic.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Speaking on the allegation of perpetrating securities fraud by failing to register Celsius as a securities dealer and offering securities through the platform, Alex Mashinsky’s lawyers stated that the Earn Accounts offered to customers were not securities. “The Complaint fails to plead adequately the existence of securities or commodities in Celsius’s business model,” the lawyers argued. The response also cited several legal precedents to argue that no investment contract exists between the firm and the investor without a predetermined interest rate.&nbsp;</p>
