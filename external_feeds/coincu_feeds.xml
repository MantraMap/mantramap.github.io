<li><em>Decentralized social media app Damus threatened with delisting by Apple over &#8220;zaps&#8221; feature.</em></li>



<li><em>Users can send small amounts of BTC over the Lightning Network to content creators.</em></li>

<p>One of the reasons for its popularity is that most implementations of Nostr support payments over the blockchain&#8217;s Lightning Network. Lightning is Bitcoin’s second layer payment network that enables faster transactions and lower transaction fees.</p>

<p>The Damus app was launched in the App Store earlier this year, but it faced a threat of delisting on June 13. The reason behind this threat was the &#8220;zaps&#8221; feature of the app, which allows users to send small amounts of bitcoin over the Lightning Network to tip their favorite content creators. This feature is similar to Twitter&#8217;s &#8220;tip&#8221; feature. Apple deemed this feature to be a violation of its App Store Review Guidelines 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 (vii).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Looks like we are getting removed from the appstore even after updating our app to make it clear that no digital content is getting unlocked when users are tipped.

</div></figure>



<p>According to Apple, the zap button should be removed from all &#8220;notes&#8221; or content sections as this is equivalent to selling digital content. However, it is fine to have a zap button on user profiles.</p>



<p>The CEO of Damus, Casarin, spoke with Apple and proposed a compromise. He suggested removing all note zapping functionality from the app. Casarin modified the Damus interface so that zap buttons would still appear on notes. However, the zaps themselves would not be associated with any notes and would only be sent and processed at the profile level. Despite this, Apple was not satisfied with the compromise.</p>



<p>Casarin spent the next two weeks removing the ability for users to see zaps. He resubmitted the app, but Apple gave the exact same response. Apple confirmed that they had engaged with Casarin and explained how to resolve the issue. However, upon receipt of the latest submission, they found that the issues were still unresolved and rejected the app.</p>

<p>Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey appeared to criticize Apple&#8217;s decision. He argued that &#8220;tips aren&#8217;t unlocking content.&#8221; Dorsey is now the CEO of Bitcoin-focused financial services company Block (SQ), and he has donated millions towards the protocol’s development. Earlier this month, he tweeted that a move by the tech giant to cut off Damus could restrict Bitcoin adoption and thwart the &#8220;one opportunity to build a truly global payment protocol for the Internet.&#8221;</p>



<p>On June 14, the company rejected an updated version of the non-custodial Lightning-enabled bitcoin wallet Zeus, but it was subsequently approved the next day.</p>



<p>Apple claims that it reviews all apps against the same set of guidelines that are intended to protect customers and provide a fair and level playing field to developers. However, Casarin and others have criticized the company’s approval process, calling it &#8220;opaque.&#8221;</p>

<p>The transaction occurred just one hour ago and is estimated to be worth approximately $15.11 million USD based on the current market value of ETH.</p>



<p>The withdrawal of such a substantial amount of ETH by a single entity has attracted the attention of the crypto community. Whales are individuals or entities that hold significant amounts of cryptocurrencies, and their actions often have the potential to influence market trends and investor sentiment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>While the motives behind the whale&#8217;s decision to withdraw a large sum of ETH remain unknown, such transactions can have an impact on market dynamics. A significant withdrawal can potentially lead to increased selling pressure or trigger speculation among traders and investors.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1949.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="658" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1949-1024x658.png" alt="image 1949" class="wp-image-198028" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1949-1024x658.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1949-300x193.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1949-768x494.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1949-1536x988.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1949-2048x1317.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1949-750x482.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1949-1140x733.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Crypto Whale Withdraws $15 Million From Binance - Market Impact Looms 5"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The timing of the withdrawal is also noteworthy, as it comes during a period of increased volatility in the cryptocurrency market. The market has experienced fluctuations in recent weeks, with various digital assets experiencing both sharp gains and losses. This withdrawal may indicate the whale&#8217;s desire to reposition their holdings or take advantage of prevailing market conditions.</p>



<p>The value of ETH has been subject to fluctuations in line with the broader cryptocurrency market. As one of the leading cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, ETH has garnered significant attention from investors and traders worldwide. Its use in decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts has contributed to its popularity and value.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Whale.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="834" height="521" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Whale.jpeg" alt="Whale" class="wp-image-198030" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Whale.jpeg 834w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Whale-300x187.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Whale-768x480.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Whale-750x469.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 834px) 100vw, 834px" title="Crypto Whale Withdraws $15 Million From Binance - Market Impact Looms 6"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The transaction from the whale at address 0x882E serves as a reminder of the influence that large holders of cryptocurrencies can have on market dynamics. Their movements and actions can create ripples in the market, leading to price fluctuations and potentially affecting investor sentiment.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The power of Web3 and blockchain technology is only starting to be realized, and now with the adoption of AI and its convergence with crypto, we have even more of a frontier to explore. We are incredibly excited to pursue this through our Global Innovation Lab with a new team of top talent that shares our vision.”</p>

<p>The total value of the deal amounts to a staggering $162.9 million, with an approximate cost of $21.5 per terahash (T).</p>



<p>MicroBT, based in Shenzhen, China, is renowned as the world&#8217;s second-largest producer of Bitcoin mining machines. However, in a strategic decision, Riot has secured an agreement to have these mining machines manufactured in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, marking a shift in production to the United States.</p>



<p>This acquisition showcases commitment to expanding its mining capabilities and solidifying its position in the industry. The influx of these latest-generation mining machines will significantly enhance Riot&#8217;s mining infrastructure and bolster its mining capacity for Bitcoin.</p>

<p>The move to purchase such a substantial number of mining machines is driven by the company&#8217;s ambition to capitalize on the growing demand and potential profitability of Bitcoin mining. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, mining operations have become increasingly competitive, with companies vying to maximize their mining efficiency and output.</p>



<p>By collaborating with MicroBT, Riot can leverage the expertise of one of the industry&#8217;s leading manufacturers to acquire state-of-the-art equipment. The newly acquired machines are expected to be deployed in Riot&#8217;s mining facilities, further strengthening the company&#8217;s mining prowess.</p>

<p>The acquisition of the MicroBT mining machines positions Riot to take advantage of the growing popularity of Bitcoin and the increasing demand for mining services.

<p>As per the latest update, SmartBCH Alliance Limited has received 4,281,291.42 rvUSD, 651,928.02 USDC, and 6,834.015 BCH from Coinflex. Out of the 651,928.02 USDC received, 521,542.4 USDC (80%) has been swapped into 3,924.84 BCH and transferred to pp9xzxg4re07pdtkm5v2zdwjx2c6z6qnj5jnu6f6d9. The remaining 130,385.62 USDC has been reserved for legal and other operating expenses for the SPV. The SPV owns 10,758.86 BCH so far.</p>



<p>The SPV is opening an account in OPNX and will gradually swap rvUSD into BCH in the exchange. Coinflex has also burned 33,365.67 sBCH back to the old bridge address 0x8c4F85ec71C966e45A6F4291f5271f8114a7Ba15. Now, there are 67,756.766 sBCH in circulation on smartBCH.</p>



<p>According to the restructuring terms approved by Seychelles Courts, the SPV shall be entitled to common equity and one board seat of Coinflex. However, they haven’t received these assets yet. Coinflex is still undergoing the legal process for restructuring, and the community will be updated once there is any significant progress.</p>



<p>The SPV has entered into an agreement with Coinflex, in which it will take over the responsibilities of maintaining the 1:1 peg between sBCH and BCH using all the assets owned by the SPV. However, there is a risk of failing to maintain such peg due to the discrepancy between the assets owned and the circulating sBCH. Nevertheless, by receiving the assets, the peg of sBCH:BCH is safer than not having received it. Prior to this, the peg has been maintained well by the community.</p>

<p>This innovative standard aims to enhance the security of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) by incorporating multiple layers of protection, including an on-chain two-factor authentication (2FA) system. The project recently announced the launch of ERC-721x, unveiling its unique features to the public.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing ERC721x: A safer implementation of the ERC721 standard <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2694.png" alt="⚔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br><br>This technology gives you the convenience of a hot wallet, with the added security of a cold wallet.<a href="https://t.co/DGwuSRrI5d" target="_blank">https://t.co/DGwuSRrI5d</a> <a href="https://t.co/7DoNivnMwv" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/7DoNivnMwv</a></p>&mdash; CyberKongz (@CyberKongz) <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberKongz/status/1673372436132245504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 26, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>ERC-721x introduces two distinct layers known as &#8220;locking&#8221; and &#8220;guarding.&#8221; These layers work in tandem to fortify the security of NFTs. With the locking feature, users can secure their assets in a holding wallet, providing an initial layer of protection. However, CyberKongz takes security a step further by introducing the Guardian wallet, which allows users to lock their assets in the holding wallet for a second time. This additional layer of security adds an extra level of assurance to safeguard valuable NFT assets.</p>



<p>The integration of on-chain 2FA within the ERC-721x standard is a significant development in the NFT space. Two-factor authentication is widely recognized as a robust security measure in various digital applications. By bringing this security mechanism to the blockchain, CyberKongz is aiming to enhance the trust and confidence of NFT collectors and investors.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Hong Kong aims to be a digital asset and stablecoin hub.</em></li>



<li><em>Circle Internet Financial recognizes the demand for US dollar stablecoins in Asia.</em></li>



<li><em>Allaire believes stablecoins will continue to grow internationally, especially in Asia.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle Internet Financial Ltd., expressed his keen interest in the development of regulations in Hong Kong during an interview at the Tianjin 2023 Summer Davos Forum. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Circle-CEO-.webp"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="577" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Circle-CEO--1024x577.webp" alt="Circle CEO" class="wp-image-197990" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Circle-CEO--1024x577.webp 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Circle-CEO--300x169.webp 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Circle-CEO--768x432.webp 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Circle-CEO--750x422.webp 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Circle-CEO--1140x642.webp 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Circle-CEO-.webp 1245w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Circle CEO Vigilant As Hong Kong Regulators Step Up Scrutiny 17"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Circle Internet Financial Ltd. is a US-based stablecoin issuer and has been closely monitoring the impact of China&#8217;s encryption rules on the Hong Kong market.</p>



<p>According to Allaire, Hong Kong is aiming to position itself as a prominent digital asset market and stablecoin hub. The company recognizes the enormous demand for US dollar stablecoins in Asia and emerging markets. As a result, Circle Internet Financial Ltd. is closely watching the regulatory developments in Hong Kong.</p>



<p>Stablecoins have gained significant popularity in recent years due to their stability and potential for facilitating international transactions. Allaire believes that the demand for stablecoins will continue to grow, especially in regions like Asia where there is a need for a reliable digital currency that can provide stability and liquidity.</p>



<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s potential as a stablecoin hub is further amplified by its strategic location as a major global financial center and its existing infrastructure for fintech innovation. The city&#8217;s regulatory approach to digital assets will play a crucial role in attracting businesses and investors to the market.</p>

<p>Allaire&#8217;s comments come at a time when regulatory scrutiny on cryptocurrencies and stablecoins has been intensifying worldwide. Governments and financial regulators are seeking to establish clear frameworks to address concerns related to investor protection, financial stability, and money laundering risks.</p>



<p>In response to the changing regulatory landscape, Circle Internet Financial Ltd. has been proactive in collaborating with regulators and engaging in constructive dialogue. The company aims to ensure compliance with the evolving rules while continuing to offer innovative and user-friendly financial services.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Robinhood will lay off around 7% of its full-time workers, or roughly 150 individuals, due to a lack of consumer engagement.</em></li>



<li><em>The layoffs were made to react to volume and better align team structures, according to Chief Financial Officer Jason Warnick.</em></li>



<li><em>Robinhood&#8217;s user base has decreased as commodity prices have risen, and the business saw an increase in workers departing voluntarily.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/26/robinhood-cutting-7percent-of-its-full-time-employees-.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC</a></em>, Robinhood, a stock and cryptocurrency trading platform, said on Monday that it will let off around 7% of its full-time workers, or about 150 individuals, owing to a fall in consumer engagement.</strong></h5>

<p>The trading platform was critical in the retail trading frenzy during the epidemic, but it has suffered with a shrinking user base as commodity prices have risen.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We’re ensuring operational excellence in how we work together on an ongoing basis. In some cases, this may mean teams make changes based on volume, workload,” Robinhood stated.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The layoffs were made to react to volume and better align team structures, according to Chief Financial Officer Jason Warnick&#8217;s statement to the <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-lays-off-about-7-of-its-full-time-employees-2111cb48" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WSJ</a></em>.</p>



<p>The announcement comes a week after the business announced the acquisition of financial technology startup X1 Inc for around $95 million in cash as it seeks fresh income streams to offset the deterioration in its primary trading segment.</p>

<p>Last year, Robinhood laid off over 1,000 employees in two waves of layoffs. According to its annual report, Robinhood has over 2,300 full-time workers as of the end of 2022.</p>



<p>According to Robinhood&#8217;s most recent quarterly report, the business saw an increase in workers departing voluntarily and a decrease in reported employee job satisfaction in the months after the layoffs last April and August.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/194416-robinhood-crypto-trading-volume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robinhood</a> has less than 11 million monthly active users as of May. Transaction-based revenue fell 5% year on year in the first quarter and was more than halved from the same period in 2021. The company exceeded Wall Street revenue projections in the most recent quarter, as the US Federal Reserve&#8217;s quick rate rises increased its interest income.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>OKX cryptocurrency exchange is ceasing services to Japanese users due to local laws and regulations.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance also announced last month that it will no longer provide services to Japanese citizens starting from November 30, 2023.</em></li>



<li><em>The Japanese government is still working on establishing regulations for cryptocurrency firms to operate in the country.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Coinpost, OKX is suspected of ceasing to provide services to Japanese users.</strong></h5>

<p>According to a notice in the app:</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;OKX Exchange products are unavailable in Japan due to local laws and regulations. You can still sign up/log in, and access OKX Wallet.

<p>Trading inside the OKX app was still available at the time of publishing. OKX has not yet announced a particular date for when the rule will go into effect.</p>



<p>Binance, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange, stated last month that it would no longer provide services to Japanese people.</p>



<p>Binance Global previously declared that the present service will be discontinued for Japanese citizens on November 30, 2023. Binance intends to build a Japanese-language platform in the summer of 2023.</p>

<p>Users in Japan transferred to Binance Japan from the global version in November of this year, and it seems that OKX, which does not have a license in Japan, was compelled to reply to the Financial Services Agency.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, OKX has <a href="https://coincu.com/192628-okx-partners-with-komainu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teamed</a> with Komainu, a digital asset storage provider, to allow institutional clients to keep their cryptocurrency in the Nomura-backed custodian while trading on the exchange. This is one of the strategic cooperation relationships to expand in Japan.</p>



<p>Japan is still establishing the necessary circumstances for crypto firms to operate. The National Tax Office revised the legislation on June 20 to exclude cryptocurrency issuers from paying a 30% business tax on unrealized profits on tokens. The tax reform comes as Japanese officials push programs to encourage the country&#8217;s blockchain and cryptocurrency industries.</p>

<li><em>Binance&#8217;s attempt to limit the SEC&#8217;s use of terms relating to Binance.US&#8217; handling of client money in press releases has been denied by Judge Amy Berman Jackson.</em></li>

<p>On Friday, lawyers for BAM Trading, which trades as Binance.US, filed a complaint regarding the SEC&#8217;s news release, noting concerns about the SEC&#8217;s misleading extrajudicial statements.</p>



<p>Binance&#8217;s attorneys took issue with the SEC&#8217;s phrasing describing the alleged commingling or diversion of user money from trading platforms to investment entities that the agency claims CEO Changpeng Zhao controls.</p>

<p>Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the District of Columbia District Court, who is presiding over the SEC&#8217;s action against <a href="https://coincu.com/197209-binanceus-now-reject-sec-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance.US</a>, rejected the accusations, stating that the court&#8217;s mission is not to wordsmith public remarks from any of the case&#8217;s parties.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“It is not apparent that Court intervention … is needed at this time, or that it is necessary or appropriate for the Court to get involved in wordsmithing the parties&#8217; press releases. Nor is it clear that the agency&#8217;s public relations efforts to date will materially affect proceedings in this case,” Judge Jackson wrote.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Last week, the company&#8217;s lawyers requested Berman Jackson to censure the SEC outside of court for its characterization of the alleged abuse of billions of dollars in client funds, arguing that the news release may bias a jury.</p>

<p>The SEC filed a complaint against Binance, Binance.US, and CZ on June 5, saying that the exchanges supplied unregistered securities to US users and that Binance failed to register as an exchange or a broker-dealer clearing agency. The federal regulator first requested that the court freeze all Binance.US assets but finally agreed to a compromise in which only the exchange&#8217;s workers would have access to customer cash.</p>
