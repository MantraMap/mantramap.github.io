<ul>
<li>Binance’s founder says challenges with regulators will steel the resolve of the exchange’s employees.</li>



<li>In recent months, the exchange has come under fire over non-compliance issues with regulatory agencies, casting a shadow of doubt over its future.</li>
</ul>



<p>Despite the regulatory headwinds against Binance, the exchange’s CEO Changpeng Zhao claims that camaraderie amongst employees is at its zenith as he shares the “secret” for building resilient teams.</p>



<p>On July 10, the embattled CEO took to <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1678277304307404800?s=20">Twitter</a> to reveal the formula for building a hardy team spirit in the face of mounting challenges. According to Zhao, the secret lies in the right amount of “external pressure” designed to forge a resilient culture in the workplace.</p>



<p>He pressed his point home using the analogy of an alien invasion of Earth, noting that “all the issues between the US and China would disappear in a heartbeat.” Zhao noted that fancy team-building dinners and coaching exercises may assist in building resilience but has the flaw of being only a temporary measure.</p>



<p>“While I’m not suggesting the pressure needs to be life-threatening, fighting in the trenches together is the best way to build time teams,” said Zhao. “It builds resilience, alliance, resilience and most importantly trust between the team members.”</p>



<p>Zhao added that while adversity may create internal trust, companies can foster external trust through “collaboration and cooperation,” citing Binance as an example of a resilient team.</p>



<p>Binance has been in the eye of the storm in recent weeks as the exchange, following allegations of financial impropriety by US regulators and an investigation from French authorities for aggravated money laundering. Things went from bad to worse after the exchange was forced to exit Dutch markets, and a fresh investigation from Australian officials seemed to compound Binance’s regulatory woes.</p>



<p>“If the allegations against Binance are true, they implicate very serious criminal and civil misconduct, including national-security related issues,” remarked Alex Zerden, CEO of Capital Peak Strategies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-crack-in-the-wall-for-binance"><strong>A crack in the wall for Binance</strong></h2>



<p>Despite claims of a resilient team, there appears to be a mass exit of leading executives at the exchange. Binance’’s Chief Strategy Officer and Senior Vice President of Compliance left their roles at the company with multiple reports claiming the exits were linked to a probe by the US Department of Justice.</p>



<p>However, Zhao hit back at the claims saying that the exits are normal occurrences in the lifespan of every company, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binances-cz-shrugs-off-news-of-senior-executive-personnel-resigning-as-attempts-to-spread-fud/">confirming</a> that Binance will “continue to hire” new staff to fill existing vacancies.</p>



<p>Early in the year, the company lost Matthew Price as its Global Head of Intelligence and Investigations, while <a href="https://zycrypto.com/brian-brooks-steps-down-as-binance-us-ceo-after-only-three-months/">Brian Brooks</a> left his role as Binance.US CEO in 2021, only three months after his appointment.</p>

<p>A handful of factors primarily determine the price movement of any cryptocurrency asset. This squally ranges from a fundamental level to a technical level. For a leading asset like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/glassnode-co-founder-optimistic-as-ethereum-reclaims-key-support-setting-stage-for-bullish-momentum/">Ethereum</a>, fundamental and technical developments have repeatedly swayed market sentiments.</p>



<p>With Ethereum (ETH) preparing to enter the third quarter of 2023, market players are curious to gain insight into the factors stimulating the asset’s continuous price growth. According to recent data from CryptoQuant, the upsurge in Ether’s price value can be traced back to DEXs. </p>



<p>Decentralized exchanges, also known as DEXs, are peer-to-peer marketplaces allowing users to carry out transactions with other crypto traders without needing a third party.</p>



<p>The on-chain metrics platform CryptoQuant asserted that a significant portion of Ether’s bullish price performance could be tied to the rise in the number of DEX transactions carried out this year.</p>



<p><em>“Starting from 2023, when observing the volume of ETH traded on DEX, particularly the volume of transactions where ETH is swapped, we can see that it tends to move in a similar direction to the price of ETH.”</em> CryptoQuant asserted. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">DEX Transaction Volume and Its Impact on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ethereum?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Ethereum</a> Price: A 2023 Overview<br>Quicktake Post by <a href="https://twitter.com/Woo_Minkyu?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Woo_Minkyu</a> <br><br>Thread<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/4fjWJpGda8">pic.twitter.com/4fjWJpGda8</a></p>&mdash; CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1678200781621559303?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 10, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The pattern was first spotted in January 2023, CryptoQuant noted. Since then, the volume of trades involving ETH on decentralized exchanges has consistently risen. Later in March, the network recorded an enormous volume of trades after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cracked down on many <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-wants-four-months-to-make-a-recommendation-on-coinbases-call-for-crypto-clarity/">centralized exchanges</a>.</p>



<p>Although this might have been another factor that boosted the price of ETH, the volume of ETH being swapped on decentralized exchanges has been decreasing consistently since March.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s still unknown where the market is. It is still unclear whether or not Ether has peaked. As CryptoQuant asserts, “We now need to determine whether the current price of ETH will continue to adjust upwards or if the current stage signifies a bottom signal, indicating a good buying opportunity.”</p>



<p>At the time of this report, most altcoins on the market are trading in the red zone. Ether trades for $1,875 after dropping by 4.30% over the last week. Bitcoin has also not been spared by the mild downswing, as it has lost 0.45% in the last hour and more than 2% of its gains within the last 7 days. <a href="https://zycrypto.com/standard-chartered-bank-says-bitcoin-price-likely-to-hit-50000-this-year-120000-by-2024/">Bitcoin</a> now trades at a press time price of $30,610.</p>

<p>Major international bank, Standard Chartered, has <a href="https://zycrypto.com/standard-chartered-bank-says-bitcoin-price-likely-to-hit-50000-this-year-120000-by-2024/">revised its prediction</a> for the price of Bitcoin for the next 18 months. While the bank is still predicting a price increase by the end of next year, it has changed its earlier projection of $100,000 per BTC and now estimates that Bitcoin could, in theory, reach $120,000 by the end of 2024.</p>



<p>The British bank believes the current increase in Bitcoin&#8217;s price would encourage miners to stockpile more BTC, further impacting its value.</p>



<p><em>“The rationale here is that as well as maintaining the bitcoin ledger, miners play a key role in determining net supply of newly mined BTC,”</em> said Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick, adding that <em>“Increased miner profitability per BTC mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher.”</em></p>



<p>Standard Chartered&#8217;s optimistic outlook reflects rising confidence in Bitcoin&#8217;s performance and reinforces the belief by some that the crypto winter has come to an end.</p>



<p>But others are not so eager regarding miners’ profits, especially around the upcoming Bitcoin halving. Nearly half of Bitcoin miners aren&#8217;t operating as efficiently as they should be, which could cause problems after the next halving, according to Jaran Mellerud, a crypto mining analyst at Hashrate Index.</p>



<p>Indicating that these miners, along with others who do not own their mining rigs, are likely to be greatly impacted by the halving, he notes that about 40% of BTC miners run at a greater cost per kilowatt-hour than the anticipated post-halving break-even price.</p>



<p>Given the ongoing high costs for energy worldwide, there are concerns that more miners may need to forfeit their operations if they cannot source cheaper electricity.</p>



<p>Standard Chartered’s updated projection signals a 20% increase in their <a href="https://zycrypto.com/100k-bitcoin-price-next-for-standard-chartered-bank-after-ringing-crypto-winter-dead/">earlier $100,000 forecast</a>, indicating solid expectations for Bitcoin&#8217;s future performance.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="646" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1024x646.png" alt="" class="wp-image-82749" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1024x646.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-300x189.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1536x970.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2048x1293.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bullish-outlook-but-with-a-caveat"><strong>Bullish Outlook, But with a Caveat</strong></h2>



<p>Some also see the potential onboarding of major financial institutions like BlackRock and others who have applied for a Bitcoin ETF as a major driver for the price of BTC. However, the CEO of Trust Machines, Muneeb Ali, has a slightly different view about where the Bitcoin price is headed.</p>



<p>In an interview on CNBC’s Crypto World, Ali highlighted the significance of custody concerning any spot Bitcoin ETF. If companies like BlackRock can address custody issues and actively participate in the Bitcoin network, it would be significant since it shows genuine ownership of and relationship to the underlying asset.</p>



<p>This, in turn, sends a positive message to other conventional financial organizations. Because they view Bitcoin as an established and safe investment, this could encourage more organizations to investigate and experiment with it. Ultimately, it remains to be seen how these factors will influence the Bitcoin price; as for a Bitcoin ETF, the SEC has denied every single application so far.</p>

<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB), the world&#8217;s second-largest meme coin, has been grabbing attention in the cryptocurrency markets lately, sparking curiosity and raising questions about its potential.</p>



<p>On July 6, crypto onchain analytics firm Santiment highlighted the significant rise in the creation of new daily addresses for Shiba Inu, averaging over 2,500 per day in the past couple of weeks. In a tweet, the firm noted that while the price performance of SHIB may have been underwhelming in the past year, there is hope behind one of 2021&#8217;s favourite meme coins.</p>



<p>Delving deeper into the underlying trends, the firm highlighted several factors contributing to the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shib-price-looks-nigh-as-shiba-inus-testnet-sees-rising-activity-ahead-of-shibarium-mainnet/">positive spin</a> on Shiba Inu&#8217;s recent developments. First, the network growth of SHIB has been quite high lately, indicating increasing interest and engagement. Additionally, the network realized profit loss is completely underwater, which suggests that investors who bought SHIB are still holding onto their tokens despite potential losses. Furthermore, the supply of SHIB on exchanges is at its lowest point since 2022, indicating a decrease in available tokens for trading.</p>



<p>According to the firm, the implications of this situation can be interpreted from two different perspectives. On the one hand, the sudden attention on meme coins like SHIB could be seen as &#8220;a toppish indicator&#8221;, potentially signalling a market top or peak, which could imply market saturation or a future decline.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Santiment argued that the recent surge in interest could also bring new life into SHIB, which was flying under the radar.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;As suggested by our proprietary metrics, daily active addresses for SHIB were lacklustre before this surge in interest, indicating a newfound demand for the token,&#8221;</em> the firm wrote.</p>



<p>Moreover, the surging interest in Shiba Inu can also be attributed to anticipation around the mainnet launch of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-core-dev-teases-shibarium-launch-timeline-amid-super-bullish-strategy-for-shib/">Shibarium</a>, the ecosystem&#8217;s layer-2 scaling solution. Over the past few months, speculations around the product have been on the rise, with several proponents in the community, including Shiba Inu devs, suggesting that release dates may be closer than expected.</p>



<p>Notably, in the latest blog, Shytoshi Kusama dropped another hint at <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-monster-move-draws-near-amid-imminent-launch-of-shibarium-in-august/">Shibarium launching in August</a> while announcing Shib&#8217;s sponsorship of the Blockchain Futurist Conference, Eth Toronto, and Eth Women, set to be held in Toronto that month. According to the lead developer, the event will serve as a platform to showcase completed projects, including Shibarium.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Shibarium Beta Testnet, or Puppynet, has also seen significant adoption and engagement. According to data from Puppyscan, the total transactions and the number of wallet addresses connected to the Shiba Inu layer-2 test network have reached new highs of $27.37M and 17M, respectively.</p>



<p>These developments, combined with the ongoing substantial investments in SHIB by investors, are anticipated to ignite the upcoming bull run for the cryptocurrency to the highly envisioned $0.001 price point. At press time, SHIB traded at $0.000007518 after a 0.36% drop in the past day.</p>

<p>Prominent crypto lawyer John E. Deaton was recently asked about the possibility of more XRP holders joining the civil case against Ripple in Oakland, California, if the verdict in <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-vs-ripple-hinman-documents-release-is-a-boost-to-ethereum-jpmorgan-analysts-share-opinion/">SEC vs Ripple</a> goes against Ripple and the judge declares XRP a security. Just last week, a California Judge certified a class of American purchasers of XRP in a complaint accusing Ripple Labs of selling unregistered securities. This second legal concern Ripple is facing is the subject of the tweet that prompted the question.</p>



<p>Concerning the ongoing legal conflict between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Deaton discussed the possible options and their potential impact on Ripple, XRP investors, and the SEC.</p>



<p>Regarding any money flowing from Ripple to the SEC, the lawyer is sure it won&#8217;t happen for years and only if Ripple were to lose on appeal.</p>



<p>Deaton said: <em>“If the Supreme Court takes it on appeal (which I believe they will if Congress hasn’t acted by then), I believe Ripple hands down wins with this Supreme Court. If the SEC wins Ripple will appeal and the status quo that exists today will continue over the next 2-5 years.”</em></p>



<p>He claims that if the SEC prevails and the civil case attorneys triumph because the Californian judge upholds Judge Torres&#8217; decision, Ripple will also appeal that case and no money will change hands, possibly never. If Ripple loses all of its challenges in five years, the SEC, not the civil claimants, would be responsible for collecting the $1.3 billion.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the SEC would receive this money rather than the civil claimants. In response, the SEC would create a repayment fund akin to the Veritaseum case, enabling holders of XRP to sell their tokens.</p>



<p>Deaton emphasizes an intriguing aspect of the situation that some may have missed. He argues that if the SEC were to lose, the damages that could be recovered in civil litigation would rise. Conversely, an SEC victory could make obtaining any financial losses more challenging for the civil lawsuit&#8217;s plaintiffs.</p>



<p>Deaton stresses that signing up for the 75K list, a list of XRP owners he represents in SEC vs Ripple, does not constitute a waiver of any rights or claims. Being on the list instead aids in identifying a sizable potential class of XRP holders. Holders of XRP on the list would probably be informed if there was ever a financial recovery in either the civil or SEC lawsuit.</p>



<p>He said: <em>“Also if Ripple loses and Congress fixes this regulatory mess during the 5 years of appeals, it all goes away anyway. Bottom line, being on the list didn’t waive anything and, if anything, it identified your claims (if you have any) long ago.”</em></p>



<p>Critics who claim that joining the 75K list and claiming that XRP is not a security would be damaging if XRP holders received financial compensation are dismissed by the attorney. He clarifies that even if a judge and an appeals court found differently, being mistaken about XRP&#8217;s security status would not result in punishment.</p>



<p>Given the possible outcomes, Deaton expresses doubt about the civil lawsuit&#8217;s impact. He contends that, paradoxically, XRP investors would gain if the SEC finally wins since it would receive the largest settlement and the best resolution.</p>



<p>These observations from John E. Deaton offer helpful perspectives on the probable outcomes and repercussions for all parties involved as the Ripple-SEC legal dispute continues.</p>

<p>During his latest interview, Jay Clayton voiced his openness to a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman noted that he was doubtful about trading in the BTC market during his time in office. However, he admitted that the emergence of reputable institutions in the crypto industry is an impressive development not seen before. </p>



<p>As such, he believes it would be &#8216;hard to resist&#8217; okaying a physically-backed bitcoin ETF as long as the requisite regulatory protections are in place, similar to those in the futures market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clayton-bullish-on-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval"><strong>Clayton Bullish On Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval</strong></h2>



<p>In July 2013, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss filed paperwork to introduce the first-ever Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). A decade later, the industry is still waiting for a spot Bitcoin product.</p>



<p>Speaking during a Monday <a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1678381857367289856">interview </a>with <em>CNBC</em>, the former chair of the SEC, Jay Clayton, pinpointed the noteworthy changes he has witnessed in market sentiment toward crypto since his tenure. &#8220;This is an offshore, retail, nothing close to what I would say are the core of our financial markets,&#8221; Clayton posited of Bitcoin&#8217;s earlier days.</p>



<p>While Clayton was previously wary of the Bitcoin market due to concerns of wash trading and market manipulation, the former securities regulator recognized the remarkable steps the industry has made, particularly in terms of institutional investment.</p>



<p>Prominent reputable companies are now foraying into Bitcoin, showing increasing confidence in the industry’s regulatory safeguards and trading credentials. “The fact that we have these institutions that know markets better than anybody and saying we&#8217;re going to put our reputation behind it, I find that pretty remarkable,&#8221; Clayton observed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Time For Bitcoin ETF Approval</strong></h2>



<p>Speaking of spot bitcoin ETFs, Clayton said he thought applicants have a strong chance at approval if they can ascertain that it’s a more efficient way for investors to invest in the crypto asset.</p>



<p>“If they’re right that the spot market has similar efficacy to the futures market, it would be hard to resist approving a bitcoin ETF.”</p>



<p>The former Wall Street regulator is popularly known for launching an unprecedented suit against Ripple and two of its top executives in late 2020 while he was still chair of the SEC. He is also responsible for the rejection of numerous physically backed bitcoin ETFs during his stint as the 32nd chairman of the commission.</p>



<p>As of right now, there&#8217;s still no spot Bitcoin ETF trading in the United States, but BlackRock’s application a couple of weeks ago signalled to the industry that the time may be coming when that changes. In recent weeks, we’ve seen around half a dozen new filings for a spot bitcoin ETF. Has the market matured enough to support an ETF as Clayton suggests, and can applicants give the SEC adequate guarantees that an ETF would be safe for investors?</p>



<p>While Clayton is bullish on the approval of a spot crypto ETF if certain conditions are met, he did not say when he expects such a long-awaited product to happen in the U.S finally.</p>

<p>Terraform Labs&#8217; trouble continues as the Seoul Southern District Court on Monday conducted the first hearing for Daniel Shin and seven other employees of the company. Shin, who was indicted in April by South Korea on violations of capital-markets law, among other charges, skipped the hearing. His legal team requested additional trial preparation time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-legal-proceedings-for-daniel-shin-begin-in-seoul"><strong>Legal Proceedings For Daniel Shin Begin In Seoul</strong></h2>



<p>A trial preparation hearing for Terraform co-founder Daniel Shin kicked off in a Seoul Southern District Court.</p>



<p>According to a report from local news outlet <em>News1 Korea</em> on July 10, the Seoul court held the preliminary hearing for Shin and seven of his alleged accomplices. However, the former Terra exec reportedly did not personally show up for the hearing. His attorneys argued that this case is more technical and asked for extra time. Judge Jang Seong-hoon approved the request and set August 28 as the second trial date.</p>



<p>Shin and the seven others were indicted without detention on April 25 by the Seoul Southern District Prosecutor’s Office for myriad charges, including illegal trading. At the time, prosecutors said the entire Terra project was “fictitious” and bound to fail.</p>



<p>Prosecutors have alleged that Shin and his accomplices misled investors and manipulated the price of some tokens via media coverage and transactions beginning in 2018. They reportedly accrued “unfair profits” of around 462.9 billion won (over $350 million). Shin’s attorneys denied all the allegations in April. Nonetheless, the authorities said at the time that they had already frozen 246.8 billion won ($184.7 million) in assets from the people indicted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shin co-founded Terraform Labs with Do Kwon back in 2018. His legal team has previously asserted that he left the company in 2020, prior to the spectacular May 2022 implosion of the Terra ecosystem. Per his LinkedIn profile, Shin then went on to launch payments firm PortOne Global. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Global Legal Fallout</strong></h2>



<p>The catastrophic meltdown of Terra caused by its algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) dropping from its peg with the U.S. dollar sent shockwaves throughout the crypto markets, triggering a series of high-profile bankruptcy cases.</p>



<p>Legal fallout from the multi-billion-dollar Terra cataclysm now spans multiple countries following the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/terras-luna-sees-selloff-following-founder-do-kwons-arrest-in-montenegro/">detention </a>of Do Kwon and chief financial officer Han Chang Joon in Montenegro in March.</p>



<p>Both the United States and his native South Korea are pushing for Kwon’s extradition, but he and Joon must first face charges of using forged travel documents in Montenegro. As <em>ZyCrypto </em><a href="https://zycrypto.com/terras-do-kwon-found-guilty-of-passport-forgery-in-montenegro-sentenced-to-four-months-in-prison/">reported</a> last month, Kwon was sentenced to four months in prison in the Balkan nation.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the cornered crypto founder has moved to dismiss charges brought against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), on the basis that Terra-linked tokens don’t qualify as securities.</p>

<p>Multinational bank Standard Chartered, which in December 2022 <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-05/bitcoin-sinks-further-70-in-standard-chartered-list-of-possible-2023-upsets?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google&amp;sref=323RPL5z">predicted </a>that the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/analyst-reveals-what-market-conditions-could-supercharge-bitcoin-price-to-310000/">bitcoin price</a> was on track to plummet as low as $5,000 in 2023, now believes that the world&#8217;s first and largest cryptocurrency will cost ten times more by year-end and an astounding $120,000 in 2024.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-120-000-bitcoin-supply-shock-will-slingshot-btc-skyward"><strong>$120,000: Bitcoin Supply Shock Will Slingshot BTC Skyward</strong></h2>



<p>Standard Chartered has shared a rosy outlook for Bitcoin.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/standard-chartered-bumps-up-bitcoin-forecast-120000-2023-07-10/">report </a>by Standard Chartered Bank’s Global Head of Research &amp; Chief Strategist, Geoff Kendrick, Bitcoin has the potential to reach $50,000 this year. Thereafter, the top crypto will climb to $120,000 by the end of next year.</p>



<p>In the banking group’s opinion, the price boom would be driven by one key factor: bitcoin supply dynamics. As network miners use more resources to secure the network, they dump less of their BTC coins, causing a demand-supply disparity that favors the bulls.</p>



<p>“Increased profitability for miners to mine Bitcoin means they can reduce sales while maintaining cash inflow, reducing the net supply of Bitcoin and driving up Bitcoin’s price,” Kendrick opined.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exciting Times Ahead For Bitcoin</strong></h2>



<p>Standard Chartered giving a bullish forecast on Bitcoin’s future price makes it the latest firm to conclude that digital assets are here to stay especially after BlackRock&#8217;s recent entry into the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) arena. BlackRock’s ETF application could make it much easier for fellow Wall Street firms to embrace cryptocurrencies and subsequently transform the BTC market.</p>



<p>Assuming the financial giant succeeds in its ETF quest and other institutional investors follow suit, it would stabilize the Bitcoin price at a considerably higher level than the current $30,000.</p>



<p>Since <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-surges-past-31k-now-up-80-this-year-as-wall-street-eyes-digital-gold/">popping above $31k</a> in June, bitcoin has changed hands between $29,500 and $31,500 levels. The crypto was little changed on Monday, dropping by 0.1% over the past 24 hours to trade at $30,252.43 at press time, according to CoinGecko.</p>



<p>That being said, the involvement of huge financial institutions, whether it be for ETF filings or the new EDX crypto exchange marks a substantial shift and a pivotal moment for the crypto industry in the United States and globally.</p>

<p>According to data from Glassnode, the Bitcoin network has seen an upsurge in the amount of Bitcoin held by market players. Notably, this uptrend was spotted amongst Bitcoin holders in the United States.</p>



<p>Glassnode asserted that the new development was triggered by BlackRock’s recent announcement concerning its spot Bitcoin ETF application. The new development signals a potential inflection point in the asset’s supply dominance if the trend continues.</p>



<p><em>“Following the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF request announcement on June 15th, the share of Bitcoin supply held/traded by US entities has experienced a notable uptick, marking a potential inflection point in supply dominance if the trend is sustained.”</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Following the Blackrock <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> ETF request announcement on June 15th, the share of Bitcoin supply held/traded by US entities has experienced a notable uptick, marking a potential inflection point in supply dominance if the trend is sustained. <a href="https://t.co/DvRCYB4BUF">pic.twitter.com/DvRCYB4BUF</a></p>&mdash; glassnode (@glassnode) <a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1677637186559135745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The price of Bitcoin could also benefit from the success of the Bitcoin ETF request, as it will become the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the country. </p>



<p>In a recent interview with Fox News, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, made some <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-holds-above-31k-as-blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-lauds-bitcoin-for-digitizing-gold/">bullish remarks about Bitcoin</a>, as he explained that the asset is pioneering the digitalization of gold differently.</p>



<p><em>“I do believe the role of crypto is [that] it’s digitizing gold in many ways. Instead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation, as hedge against the onerous problems of any country, or the devaluation of your currency.. let’s be clear: Bitcoin is an international asset, it’s not based on any one currency, and so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative.” Fink asserted.</em></p>



<p>Sentiments around BlackRock&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF filing are mixed at this time. While some market participants are positive that the ETF proposal by the $10 trillion asset manager could usher in more institutional investors, others insist that the ETF poses a more significant risk to the Bitcoin market.</p>



<p>Notably, Cathie Wood, the CEO of Ark Invest, stated that the SEC would likely reject BlackRock’s ETF proposal. Speaking to Fortune Crypto in a recent interview, Wood is <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/07/06/we-dont-think-thats-true-cathie-wood-says-blackrock-doesnt-have-an-edge-when-it-comes-to-sec-approval-for-a-spot-bitcoin-etf/amp/">quoted</a> saying; </p>



<p><em>“We [Ark Invest] know that there was a surveillance clause in their prospectus that ours didn’t include, but what I’m told is it won’t take much time for us to amend our prospectus, and that all of the exchanges are moving in this direction.”</em></p>



<p>At report time, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoins-correlation-with-traditional-markets-and-gold-diminishes-heres-why/">Bitcoin</a> is trading for $30,274. After clearing hourly losses, Bitcoin seems to be positioning itself for a comeback. The apex cryptocurrency could retest its recent high of $30,403 in the near term.</p>

<p>Dr Gavin Wood, the creator of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/uniswaps-groundbreaking-decision-expanding-business-to-polkadot-via-moonbeam-parachain/">Polkadot</a>, made a ground-breaking revelation about his ambitious aspirations to build a global supercomputer on the Polkadot network. The announcement was made during the recent Polkadot Decoded conference when Wood highlighted the vast potential of Polkadot and outlined its key features.</p>



<p>Because of the scattered and incompatible nature of the current internet infrastructure, Wood sees Polkadot as a worldwide supercomputer. He asserts that a decentralized network with seamless data sharing and connectivity between various blockchains and networks is what the future holds.</p>



<p>Wood emphasized the need for a platform to unite specialized blockchains into one cohesive network. He stated, <em>&#8220;Polkadot aims to create a scalable and interoperable platform where different blockchains can communicate and share information, essentially creating a global supercomputer.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Several crucial aspects could help Polkadot take over the market. To begin with, its distinctive architecture enables the effortless movement of any data or asset across several blockchains.</p>



<p>Polkadot emphasizes the underlying resources needed to communicate and interact between chains rather than concentrating simply on chains. Polkadot is a platform for developers to create applications for people, not simply a platform for hosting chains, according to Wood.</p>



<p>And then, of course, the resilience of Polkadot is a key feature. Even though the word &#8220;unstoppable&#8221; has been used to characterize blockchain networks, Wood thinks the word &#8220;resilience&#8221; is more accurate and better describes Polkadot&#8217;s capacity to withstand attempts to interfere with how it is supposed to work. Polkadot ensures the network&#8217;s integrity by offering resilience against the corruption of purpose.</p>



<p>In a broader sense, Polkadot functions as a provider of highly resilient general-purpose computation. Wood compares it to a modern multicore computer, where each core runs separately and simultaneously. These cores, referred to as parachains, operate on Polkadot constantly. He revealed plans to go from a roughly 50-core CPU to 500 or even 1000 cores, giving the network more computational power.  </p>



<p>Polkadot&#8217;s cores have characteristics in common with central processing units (CPUs), including bandwidth, compute power and latency. The quantity of data processed per second, or bandwidth, is now believed to be around 1 MB. The Geekbench 5 benchmark rates a core&#8217;s processing power at about 380. Additionally, there is a 6-second lag between each subsequent chunk of work.</p>



<p>Polkadot&#8217;s promise, meanwhile, goes beyond holding parachains in place. Wood considers the feasibility of directly executing smart contracts on Polkadot cores. Although this implementation is not immediately available, it highlights how flexible and all-encompassing Polkadot&#8217;s computational capabilities are. Developers may run complex logic and keep a lot of state by utilizing Polkadot&#8217;s cores&#8217; power and bandwidth, outperforming the limitations of conventional smart contract platforms.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Polkadot uses a relay chain and parachains structure to guarantee excellent scalability and security. Parallel processing and higher transaction throughput are made possible via parachains, which are separate chains that link to the primary relay chain. Thanks to this design, Polkadot can manage many transactions at once, making it appropriate for enterprise-level applications.</p>



<p>Additionally, the governance structure of Polkadot is intended to be open and democratic. It makes the platform fair and inclusive by enabling token holders to participate in decision-making. This decentralized governance strategy complies with blockchain technology&#8217;s guiding principles and offers a robust and secure framework for developing the Internet.</p>



<p>Dr Gavin Wood has further cemented Polkadot&#8217;s reputation as a pioneer in the blockchain sector by revealing the platform&#8217;s concept for a global supercomputer. The blockchain ecosystem is a strong candidate for the future of decentralized apps and services due to its distinctive architecture, scalability, and democratic governance approach. Polkadot&#8217;s concept has the potential to transform the internet as we know it and bring in a new era of frictionless communication and cooperation across blockchains and networks as the world progresses toward a more connected future.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has continued to show impressive strength, recovering roughly 100% year to date. In the past week alone, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization has grown by over 17%, perching above $30,000.</p>



<p>This growth comes from improving metrics, particularly from small-scale investors who have been demonstrating remarkable conviction and commitment by steadily growing their holdings, even in the face of the cryptocurrency market&#8217;s volatility and regulatory challenges.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Glassnode&#8217;s lead analyst, &#8220;Checkmate&#8221;, sheds light on the significant impact these smaller investors are making in the market. In a tweet, the pundit highlighted <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-shrimps-and-crabs-increase-holdings-by-almost-1-million-btc-amid-price-drop/">Bitcoin shrimps</a>, or addresses holding less than 1BTC, noting that they have been stacking sats at an impressive rate of 33.8k BTC monthly. According to the pundit&#8217;s analysis, for every new coin entering the market, shrimps are acquiring 1.25 BTC, effectively reducing the available supply.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;The last time the little guy stacked this hard was 2017 ATH, buying the top. Five years later, they are stacking harder, faster, and in a more sustained manner, despite all the bullshit. Bullish,&#8221;</em> the pundit wrote, attributing the purchases to the <em>&#8220;success of Bitcoin education visualized via on-chain data.&#8221;</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/19zmIYhFMmTJCDF35qpMvVXxns1ZujOvsI-EdJPxe6u5oafBLjLxx_dFhX0gClFQEsllWUvVZEFpApOFvufz8P_M9O3fCo0a8VZ1hd3m8y9c-08S24QQ7XYDJed52WgbiNVD-YRuUOTdbEx6YBmYMg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>On the other hand, Checkmate highlighted the so-called &#8220;Bitcoin crabs&#8221;, or investors who hold between 1 and 10 BTC. According to the pundit, this cohort has also aggressively accumulated coins, with a monthly rate of 22,400 BTC.</p>



<p>Remarkably, this accumulation represents an additional 83% of the mined supply, further emphasizing their growing influence in the market. The commitment these entities show, considering their higher investment range, highlights their belief in the long-term value of Bitcoin.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/G0GFfcuiXhlz5XbsBwWFdb6E5Jx7P2RfjdvnHWrgwDZpSMbJudf86d8IOVqKFeFKfV_RI5WZV9nkvD7KskBwWtFNIwPheJhXwLfMs_KRDKYnvZIB7zoDNKSSxLg3zNIpieDJBAb4cx3jKUdbgRneDg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Notably, while Bitcoin shrimps and crabs persist in accumulating coins, a striking contrast can be observed with the behaviour of Bitcoin whales (entities holding 1000-5000 BTC) and humpbacks (entities holding over 5000 BTC), who have been distributing their coins over the past eight years or so.</p>



<p>That said, the increased <a href="https://zycrypto.com/blackrock-highly-optimistic-on-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-as-ceo-larry-fink-terms-bitcoin-an-international-asset/">institutional interest</a> in Bitcoin has significantly motivated shrimps and crabs to accumulate coins aggressively. The recognition and adoption of Bitcoin by mainstream institutions such as Fidelity and Blackrock, as well as major banks, have sparked confidence among smaller investors, who see the potential for substantial returns and a hedge against traditional financial risks.</p>



<p>At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $30,276 after surging just over 2% in the past 24 hours. </p>

<p>Shytoshi Kusama, the anonymous lead developer for Shiba Inu, has revealed an ambitious vision to create a more decentralized and long-lasting community for SHIB.</p>



<p>In a Thursday blog titled &#8220;Long Live Shivainu!,&#8221; Kusama shared insights into the project&#8217;s progress and outlined the path ahead. Kusama started by acknowledging the initial question that sparked this endeavour, <em>&#8220;Is it possible to build a leaderless, 100% decentralized, autonomous, persistent community?&#8221;</em></p>



<p>While many projects have attempted similar goals, Kusama emphasized that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-unlocks-remarkable-price-trajectory-amid-exciting-ecosystem-updates-for-shibarium/">Shiba Inu</a> has surpassed expectations and become one of the most successful projects. However, the pundit stressed the importance of achieving true permanence, going beyond mere decentralization, and ensuring a robust foundation for the community. To fulfil the original vision of Shib&#8217;s founder, Ryoshi, Kusama proposed an update that adds intent and expands on the concept of a decentralized and enduring community.</p>



<p>In his view, establishing a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is fundamental to realising this vision. A DAO is a blockchain-based organization that operates without a central authority. Kusama proposed wrapping the existing &#8220;Shiba Doggy DAO&#8221; with the Cayman Foundation in the blog.</p>



<p>With the emergence of DAOs in the past three or so years, the need for a legal framework that protects members, safeguards funds, and enables governance has led to the establishment of the so-called DAO legal wrapper. As a result, some jurisdictions, like the Cayman Islands, Singapore, Switzerland and Panama, have emerged as some of the most popular for DAO incorporation due to their progressive pro-crypto laws.</p>



<p>According to Kusama, this move aims to ensure that the DAO&#8217;s decisions are executed by the foundation, guaranteeing the proper management of DAO assets.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Kusama introduced the Doggy DAO(s) concept, which will govern different aspects of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. He revealed that the governance would be divided into four segments, with each core token in the system having its respective governance responsibility. This division ensures equal representation and supports the long-term sustainability of the community.</p>



<p>In other exciting news, the pundit announced Shib&#8217;s sponsorship of the Blockchain Futurist Conference, Eth Toronto, and Eth Women, scheduled to take place in Toronto in August. The event will serve as a platform to showcase completed projects, including the highly anticipated <a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shib-price-looks-nigh-as-shiba-inus-testnet-sees-rising-activity-ahead-of-shibarium-mainnet/">Shibarium network</a>.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;At this location, the completed World paper will be exhibited, all Shib branded projects will be published, and Treat will be published in detail for the first time.&nbsp;In addition, it is very likely that we will also discuss and release the L2 Shibarium that we have been waiting for</em>,&#8221; wrote Kusama.</p>



<p>That said, following Kusama&#8217;s reveal, it will be interesting to see how SHIB&#8217;s vision for a decentralized community proceeds to fruition even as the ecosystem enters an exciting implementation phase, showcasing its unwavering commitment to revolutionize the cryptocurrency landscape.</p>

<p>In a recent report by Bank of America, the role of Ripple in the payments industry, especially in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, has been hailed by the second-largest bank in the United States. A team of analysts from the bank is unabashedly bullish on the company’s tech.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bank-of-america-endorses-ripple-as-a-possible-exception"><strong>Bank Of America Endorses Ripple As A “Possible Exception”</strong></h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://business.bofa.com/content/dam/flagship/global-transaction-services/treasury-innovations-outlook/payments-innovation-in-apac.pdf">report </a>by Bank of America entitled “Breaking New Ground: Harnessing Payments Innovation in APAC”, the bank highlighted the role of blockchain in digitizing trade documents and the potential of Ripple’s frictionless remittance solutions to transform cross-border payments.</p>



<p>Bank of America acknowledges the evolutionary power of technology in enabling real-time payments. According to the bank’s report, APIs are the primary catalysts for the adoption of real-time payments, and they have revolutionized both customer connectivity and transaction processing. </p>



<p>“Banks can save money by utilizing Ripple’s technology, which is one of the reasons cross-border payments through Ripple have become so well-known. By eliminating middlemen and utilizing blockchain technology, Ripple lowers the transaction costs associated with international payments,” said Bank of America.</p>



<p>The bank dubbed Ripple’s work in the cross-border payments space as a “possible exception”, adding that banking institutions can boost the value and competitiveness of their products by passing down the cost-saving benefits to their customers. Moreover, in a highly competitive market, the decrease in operational costs also improves banks&#8217; overall financial health and profitability.</p>



<p>The Head of Treasury Products APAC at Bank of America, Es Venkat, posited: “We’re already seeing Open Banking become a reality in EMEA, with the API mechanism being used to develop many new use cases.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Did XRP’s Future Just Get A Lot Brighter?</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple Labs has, in the past <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-sees-ultra-bullish-use-cases-after-colombias-central-bank-taps-ripple-to-pilot-cbdc/">inked deals </a>with a myriad of financial services providers across the globe. While the recognition by the Bank of America is a big deal, it’s important to note that the majority of financial giants are still not using Ripple’s tech as they are deterred by the company’s legal troubles in the United States. </p>



<p>The San Francisco-based blockchain payments firm has been <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">locked in a courtroom war </a>with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since 2020 over the allegation it broke federal securities laws by selling the XRP cryptocurrency to retail consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If Ripple’s tech achieves widespread adoption after it&#8217;s incorporated into the existing traditional financial infrastructure, it will result in tremendous changes to the global payments ecosystem.  </p>



<p>As for the XRP price, the bears have held off any attempts by the bulls to drive the price of crypto higher despite <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-lawsuit-sec-has-a-3-chance-of-winning-says-lawyer-predicts-xrp-victory-surge-to-10-price/">increasing hopes of a favorable outcome for Ripple</a> in its ongoing SEC lawsuit. The sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap was trading around $0.4674 at publication time, plummeting 0.9% over the last day, per CoinGecko. Whether XRP will embark on a new journey north soon remains anyone&#8217;s guess.</p>

<p>According to the Thursday <a href="https://cryptohayes.substack.com/p/massa">blog post</a>, the well-known crypto trader suggested that Bitcoin will ascend as the dominant currency for AI. He argued that the premier crypto’s attributes as a purely digital, censorship-resistant, and digitally scarce currency make it the most fitting choice for AIs.</p>



<p>“Bitcoin is thus the logical currency choice for any AI. It is purely digital, censorship-resistant, provably scarce, and its intrinsic value is completely electricity-cost-dependent. There is nothing in existence today that comes close to challenging Bitcoin on these aspects.”</p>



<p>Hayes added that compared to fiat currencies and gold, which don’t have irrefutable value or quantifiability, Bitcoin&#8217;s immutable supply is programmatically capped at 21 million coins, making it a logical choice for any AI looking for a currency that’s reliable and enshrined with “clear and transparent” rules from the outset.</p>

<p>Where would a possible convergence between Bitcoin and AI leave the top cryptocurrency?</p>



<p>Hayes predicted that Bitcoin could reach a staggering $760,000 per coin on the back of an AI boost.</p>



<p>“If Bitcoin is seen as likely to be — or even starts to be — used by AIs, then we could see two separate manias combine into one mega mania: the mania of wanting to escape inflation within the fiat financial system and the mania of wanting to own a piece of the next phase of human and computer evolution,” Hayes stated. “The overlap of these two manias would likely drive investors to grossly overpay for growth, causing the value of the Bitcoin network to rise to silly levels.”</p>



<p>Arthur Hayes is no stranger to sky-high price forecasts. In April 2022, the industry stalwart explained how Western financial policy&#8217;s “doom loop” would spark <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cathie-wood-sticks-with-1-million-bitcoin-prediction-amid-maelstrom-of-regulatory-crackdowns-heres-why/">Bitcoin’s run to $1 million</a> by 2030.</p>
