This lack of active participation which often comes after dips, has confined Bitcoin to hovering at $26,000. <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="https://coingape.com/btc-price-spreads-fear-at-26k-is-this-the-start-of-the-bull-run/" title="BTC Price Spreads Fear At $26k, Is This The Start Of The Bull Run?"></a></p>
