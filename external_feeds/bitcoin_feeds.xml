Lee suggested that when this point is reached, entering and exiting the metaverse will be as easy &#8220;as ordering dinner from a takeaway app.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Why P2E Has Not Lived Up to the Hype</h2>
<p>Lee also said he believes augmented reality (AR), rather than virtual reality, will play a key role in the metaverse. The boss of <a href="https://www.affyn.com/">Affyn</a>, a play-and-earn metaverse, said this is because AR is capable of being &#8220;seamlessly integrated into the apps we use every day.&#8221; All of this will happen with users being none the wiser.</p>
<p>The CEO also offered his thoughts on why the play-to-earn (P2E) model has not lived up to the hype and what he sees as the more sustainable Web3 gaming model. He also explained to Bitcoin.com News why he still believes in the metaverse despite the many false starts he has seen so far.</p>
<p>Below are the rest of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucazlee/">Lucaz Lee&#8217;s</a> responses to questions that were sent to him via Telegram.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin.com News (BCN): It has been said that the metaverse will become part of our daily lives, yet there seems to be no consensus on what the metaverse is all about. In your view, what would you say is the metaverse and how do you see this playing out in our day-to-day lives?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lucaz Lee (LL): </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the internet itself, the metaverse is not a single URL, server, or platform. Rather, it is a series of independent and interconnected worlds, or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">metaverses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that can be visited and interacted with by anyone with a web connection. Because the metaverse can incorporate elements of both VR and AR, it is best experienced on a device that supports these technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, the core elements that make the metaverse so immersive are not the technology it’s built upon, but rather the communities that coalesce around it. Just as newsgroups united people with shared interests in the early days of the internet, so metaverses will bring together like-minded individuals to interact, hang out, and bond over shared experiences.</span></p>
<p><strong>BCN: What do you think are the biggest barriers to the adoption of the metaverse and how can these be overcome or removed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>LL: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because there is no universal jumping-off point, it can be hard for users to know where to start with the metaverse. Which world do you choose and how do you access it? As the metaverse matures, this problem will solve itself as gateways come onstream that form the access point for entering the myriads of metaverses that are currently out there in cyberspace. In the near future, it’s likely that entering and exiting the metaverse will be as effortless as ordering dinner from a takeaway app: pick your favorite metaverse and in a couple of clicks you’ll be exploring a virtual world that satisfies your tastes.</span></p>
<p><strong>BCN: The play-to-earn model, despite all the initial hype, has not lived up to expectations. What economic model do you believe is more sustainable or suitable for Web3 gaming and why?</strong></p>
<p><strong>LL: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The P2E model was always destined for failure since it attracted speculators rather than players and the tokenomics were ultimately unsustainable. Despite this failure, P2E has been responsible for evolving the industry’s understanding of token incentives and fueling a new wave of GameFi releases that aim to iterate upon v1 titles such as Axie Infinity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I expect web3 games will gravitate to a Play-AND</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Earn model. Using this framework, developers are motivated to create games with true playability and longevity, while still incorporating tokenomic elements that have made crypto, and specifically DeFi, so attractive to millions. For example, there will still be elements of randomnicity and gamification that spur players to keep returning in search of rare loot, limited edition skins, and token rewards for completing levels. At the same time, however, these rewards need to complement the gameplay rather than being the object of the game itself.</span></p>
<p><strong>BCN: Do you think augmented reality (AR) is going to play a more vital role than virtual reality in the metaverse and if so can tell our readers why you think so?</strong></p>
<p><strong>LL:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">To a large extent, AR has yet to make a lasting impression on web users, most of whom would struggle to name an AR-based app beyond Pokemon GO. Augmented reality has advanced in leaps and bounds since then, as has the capability of smart devices to support it. Just as the cloud came to be subsumed into everything, rather than viewed as a standalone platform for off-site storage, the same will happen with AR. It will be seamlessly integrated into the apps we use every day, and in many cases we won’t even be aware that we’re utilizing it. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p><strong>BCN: Do you foresee AR’s influence going beyond just gaming and if so can you illustrate how?</strong></p>
<p><strong>LL: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR has a vast array of use cases and gaming is just a small subsection of that. AR can enhance learning experiences by overlaying digital information in the real world. It allows students to visualize complex concepts, explore historical events, and conduct virtual experiments. Additionally, we will see AR used to provide interactive training simulations for various industries such as medical procedures, industrial equipment maintenance, and military training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pick an industry and there’s a viable use case for AR. Take e-commerce, which it enables customers to visualize products in their own space before making a purchase, reducing the need for physical samples and enhancing the overall shopping experience. Or real estate, where AR can help buyers visualize properties by overlaying virtual furniture, decor, and other design elements onto a real environment. From healthcare to manufacturing and prototyping, the industries and applications swiftly stack up.</span></p>
<p><strong>BCN: Your company Affyn has launched Nexus World, a geolocation-based metaverse. Explain how this can bring people closer in the real world.</strong></p>
<p><strong>LL: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the problems with many existing metaverses is that they’re set in futuristic realms that have no connection to the world around us. This is fine for players who were raised on MMORPGs and enjoy fantasy games, but have little relevance to the majority of web users. With Nexus World, we’ve tied geolocation-based plots to real world cities, starting with Singapore and then London, Glasgow, and Dublin with more to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because owners of these plots are incentivized to acquire virtual land that maps to their real-world neighborhood, we’re creating a digital community that is connected through proximity as much as through shared interests. The friend you’re chatting over the garden fence with in Nexus World, in other words, could well be living just a block away from you. This has the potential to forge powerful synergies between landowners and residents both in meatspace and in cyberspace, which is a first for a metaverse project.</span></p>
<p><strong>BCN: How do you see the metaverse changing or influencing the way we work, play, and socialize in say, 10 years&#8217; time?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LL:</strong> In hindsight, the metaverse will be obvious and inevitable. It’s the natural evolution of the internet, but like any nascent technology, it will take time for the metaverse to become accessible to everyday users. For this reason, industry developers are very much in a “build it and they will come” mindset. There will be false starts and not every metaverse will make it, but the ones that thrive will establish themselves at the heart of the social web for decades to come.</span></p>

<h2>US Imposes New Sanctions on Russia in Coordination With G7, Other International Partners</h2>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department announced Friday that the U.S. is “strengthening the unprecedented global sanctions and other restrictive economic measures” on Russia &#8220;in coordination with the G7 and other international partners.&#8221; The <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1494">announcement</a>, titled “With over 300 sanctions, U.S. targets Russia’s circumvention and evasion, military-industrial supply chains, and future energy revenues,” followed a Group of Seven (G7) meeting Friday in Hiroshima, Japan, which President Joe Biden attended.</p>
<p>The announcement explains that the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is “implementing new commitments made at the G7 Leaders’ Summit to hold Russia accountable for its war,&#8221; elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The OFAC&#8217;s sanctions on 22 individuals and 104 entities, with touchpoints in more than 20 countries or jurisdictions, target those attempting to circumvent or evade sanctions and other economic measures against Russia, the channels Russia uses to acquire critical technology, its future energy extraction capabilities, and Russia’s financial services sector.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Additionally, OFAC is expanding sanctions authorities to target new sectors of Russia’s economy and sever Russia’s access to new categories of services,” the Treasury continued.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the U.S. Department of State “designated or identified as blocked property almost 200 individuals, entities, vessels, and aircraft” and the U.S. Department of Commerce is “significantly expanding the territorial reach and categories covered by its export controls and adding 71 entities to its Entity List to prevent Russia from accessing goods it needs for the battlefield,” the announcement details.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen tweeted Friday following the announcement of the new sanctions: “Today’s actions will further tighten our global coalition’s vise on Putin’s ability to wage his barbaric invasion by denying him military equipment and revenue. We are also advancing our efforts to cut off Russian attempts to evade sanctions.”</p>

<h2>Putin Says Sanctions Strengthen Russia&#8217;s Unity</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin stated on Friday, just hours before the U.S. and other G7 countries announced additional sanctions on Russia, that additional sanctions on his country would only serve to enhance unity within the nation. According to a translation by NBC News, Putin expressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re seeing just how aggressive the external pressure now being exerted on Russia is, on our entire society. Almost the entire arsenal is directed against us — economic, military, political, informational forces, and the most powerful anti-Russian propaganda is being deployed.</p></blockquote>
<p>In April, Putin said the policies pursued by Western nations do not always serve the best interests of their own people and will ultimately &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/putin-us-policies-will-backfire-russia-to-expand-relations-with-countries-in-eurasia-africa-latin-america/">backfire on them</a>.&#8221; His press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, stated in the same month that sanctions against Russia &#8220;will hit the global economy hard,&#8221; warning that it &#8220;can only lead us down a path towards <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/anti-russia-sanctions-will-trigger-global-economic-crisis-russian-official-warns/">a global economic crisis</a>.&#8221;</p>

Kennedy Jr. emphasized the democratic nature of bitcoin, calling it an &#x201C;exercise in democracy.&#x201D; Additionally, during his Florida appearance, Kennedy revealed that his campaign would accept bitcoin for political contributions.</strong></p>
<h2>RFK Jr. Champions Bitcoin as a Democratic Tool, Now Accepts Leading Crypto for Campaign Contributions</h2>
<p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a Democrat challenging incumbent U.S. president Joe Biden, declared that his campaign would welcome <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> donations. At the conference, Kennedy underscored the widely recognized connection between <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf">bitcoin</a> and the pillars of democracy and liberty. If elected president, he pledged to &#x201C;ensure the United States remains the global hub of bitcoin.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Many attendees at the Bitcoin 2023 conference expressed approval of Kennedy&#x2019;s remarks. One individual <a href="https://twitter.com/marcrjandrew/status/1659618902224285696?s=20">tweeted</a>, &#x201C;Truly surreal to listen to a Kennedy speak to how his presidency would secure bitcoin&#x2019;s place in the defense of the nation&#x2019;s civil liberties.&#x201D; Before delivering his keynote speech, Kennedy <a href="https://twitter.com/QuintenFrancois/status/1659499618873245696?s=20">said</a> that &#x201C;everybody is so passionate about bitcoin not just because it&#x2019;s a currency, but because it&#x2019;s an exercise in democracy.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Kennedy has recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kennedy-jr-government-could-ban-seize-bitcoin-cbdcs-could-lead-to-financial-slavery-political-tyranny/">cautioned</a> against the potential dangers of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Following these statements, he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kennedy-jr-warns-of-mega-economic-crisis-says-its-not-just-the-banks/">warned</a> that America could face a severe economic crisis, emphasizing that &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not just the banks.&#x201D; At Bitcoin 2023, Kennedy focused on decentralization, commenting on how people &#x201C;are seeing today how fragile our over-centralized system is.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Kennedy, also known as RFK Jr., is the nephew of former U.S. president John F. Kennedy and late U.S. senator Robert F. Kennedy. The candidate recently announced U.S. congressman Dennis Kucinich as his campaign manager. At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.kennedy24.com/donate">Kennedy24.com</a>&#x2014;the official campaign website&#x2014;features a donation section accepting bitcoin payments. The bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) payment portal directs users to an <a href="https://checkout.opennode.com/p/d05e70a0-a317-4e30-b81d-1ae3e5575d2c">opennode.com checkout</a> page that does require various identification requirements.</p>

Marathon pledged to match all contributions toward this cause, totaling a maximum of $500,000 through 2023.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Mining Firm Marathon Partners with Brink to Generate $1 Million for Bitcoin Core Development</h2>
<p>The publicly-traded mining infrastructure corporation <a href="https://www.mara.com/">Marathon Digital Holdings</a> (Nasdaq: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-MARA/">MARA</a>) announced its partnership with the 501(c)(3) nonprofit <a href="https://brink.dev/">Brink</a> to raise funds for Bitcoin Core developers. In a statement on Thursday, Marathon explained, &#x201C;These developers are volunteers, who often work pro bono or on a donation basis, to ensure the Bitcoin protocol functions.&#x201D; The partnership was unveiled at the Bitcoin 2023 event in Miami.</p>
<p>Marathon <a href="https://ir.marathondh.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1314/marathon-digital-holdings-collaborates-with-brink-to-raise">declared</a> its commitment to match all donations up to an aggregate sum of $500,000 through 2023 during the conference &#x2014; potentially amassing $1 million in total donations (including third-party contributions). &#x201C;From May 18, 2023 to May 21, 2023, during the Bitcoin 2023 conference, Marathon will match all donations to Brink (up to a $500,000 maximum donation from Marathon) on a two-for-one basis. Following the conference, from May 22, 2023, to December 31, 2023, Marathon will match all donations on a one-for-one basis,&#x201D; the company said.</p>
<p>Marathon&#x2019;s CEO Fred Thiel also did an <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/231498/biden-bitcoin-policy-tax">interview</a> at the Bitcoin 2023 event and discussed the Biden administration&#x2019;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biden-budget-proposal-targets-crypto-investors-using-like-kind-exchange-provision-plan-aims-to-tax-crypto-miners-30/">proposed 30% tax</a> on bitcoin miners in the United States. During an interview with crypto news outlet The Block at the event, Thiel emphasized that &#x201C;Bitcoin miners will just leave the U.S.&#x201D; Regarding the donations for Bitcoin Core developers, he mentioned that their efforts align with securing the network through mining operations.</p>
<p>&#x201C;At Marathon, we have historically focused on supporting Bitcoin by adding hash rate, which helps secure the network, and now, we are supporting those who maintain the open-source protocol on which we all depend by contributing to Brink,&#x201D; Marathon&#x2019;s chairman and CEO stated. &#x201C;Bitcoin Core developers are volunteers. Without them, the decentralized payment network that everyone around the world is free to use would not function the same.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Marathon&#x2019;s website discloses that as of May 1, 2023, it maintained 11,568 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> in its treasury. The company also asserts a production capability of 14 exahash per second (EH/s) dispersed across eight facilities. Mike Schmidt, Brink&#x2019;s executive director, stated during the announcement, that &#x201C;[Brink is] grateful to be receiving donations from Marathon, which is a company that values our mission and that of Bitcoin, and we look forward to working alongside them to raise funds for Bitcoin Core developers.&#x201D;</p>

<h2>Crypto Assets Continue to Operate in Lawless Global Environment, FATF Chief Says</h2>
<p>The Group of Seven (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G7</a>) must lead in implementing recommendations on combating money laundering, terrorism and proliferation financing, FATF President T. Raja Kumar urged ahead of the developed economies’ summit in Hiroshima, Japan, this weekend.</p>
<p>Countries have advanced with introducing most of the FATF standards but progress on implementing the updated requirements concerning crypto assets has been “relatively poor,” Kumar noted in an article titled “An End to the Lawless Crypto Space.”</p>

<p>— FATF (@FATFNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/FATFNews/status/1659094027667484673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 18, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>FATF extended its global anti-money laundering (AML) and countering terrorist financing (CTF) standards to cryptocurrencies in 2019. However, the great majority of nations (73%), are still non-compliant or only partially compliant with them.</p>
<p>“This unacceptable situation must be urgently addressed,” the head of the international body insisted. His call comes after in February of this year, FATF announced that more than 200 jurisdictions had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/over-200-jurisdictions-agree-on-timely-implementation-of-fatf-crypto-standards/">agreed</a> on an action plan for their timely implementation.</p>

<p>T. Raja Kumar pointed out that the risks posed by crypto assets continue to grow. He referred to a recent FATF report highlighting the significant increase in the past few years of ransomware payments which almost exclusively use cryptocurrencies. Crypto is also employed to evade sanctions and raise funds for terrorist groups, he added, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>While the risks have increased, crypto assets continue to operate in a virtually lawless global environment.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Countries need to take urgent action to shut down lawless spaces,” the FATF President emphasized. He also admitted that crypto is “challenging to regulate” and remarked that many governments lack experience or expertise in the field.</p>
<p>“G7 countries should lead by example and regulate the crypto sector so that no virtual safe havens exist for illicit financial transactions,” Kumar said, noting this includes implementing the so-called ‘<a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Targeted-update-virtual-assets-vasps.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">travel rule</a>.’ The latter requires service providers to identify both the sender and receiver of a transaction. It’s already part of the crypto legislation recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-council-adopts-new-rules-for-europes-crypto-markets/">adopted</a> by the EU.</p>

<h2>Microbt Introduces Cutting-Edge Whatsminer Models at Bitcoin 2023</h2>
<p>This week at Miami&#x2019;s Bitcoin 2023 event, Microbt introduced three distinct application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) bitcoin mining devices. &#x201C;Microbt is glad to release three new models of Whatsminer M50 series at Bitcoin 2023 which are air-cooling M50S++, hydro-cooling M53S++ and immersion cooling M56S++,&#x201D; the company <a href="https://twitter.com/Whatsminer_MBT/status/1659292801966698501?s=20">tweeted</a> on May 18. Micorobt&#x2019;s three new miners are expected to be released to the general public this month.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-589098 size-full" title="Microbt Unveils New Whatsminer Bitcoin Mining Rig With 320 TH/s, Setting New Standard for Hashpower" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/machineesss.jpg" alt="Microbt Unveils New Whatsminer Bitcoin Mining Rig With 320 TH/s, Setting New Standard for Hashpower" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/machineesss-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/machineesss-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/machineesss-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/machineesss-190x107.jpg 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/machineesss-380x214.jpg 380w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/machineesss-760x428.jpg 760w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/machineesss.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>The newly released models offer significantly more hashpower compared to previous iterations; for example, the air-cooled M50S++ generates 150 TH/s, surpassing the Whatsminer M50S which produces 126 TH/s. Sporting an efficiency rating of 22 joules per terahash (J/T), the miner utilizes Samsung&#x2019;s cutting-edge <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-world-class-5nm-technology-selected-by-ambarella-for-new-automotive-ai-central-domain-controller">5nm ASIC technology</a>. Meanwhile, the M56S++ immerses itself as a liquid-cooled bitcoin ASIC miner boasting 230 TH/s of hashpower and maintaining a similar 22 J/T efficiency rating.</p>
<p>Microbt&#x2019;s hydro-cooling ASIC mining rig, the M53S++, delivers an unrivaled hashpower output in the industry today. The Whatsminer M53S++ reaches a staggering 320 TH/s &#x2014; a whole 65 TH/s greater than Bitmain&#x2019;s Antminer S19 XP Hydro, the previous <a href="https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/bitmain/antminer-s19-xp-hyd-255th">top BTC miner</a> in terms of hashrate. Like its Whatsminer counterparts, the M53S++ possesses a 22 J/T efficiency rating and employs Samsung&#x2019;s advanced 5nm chipsets.</p>
<p>As technology advances, bitcoin mining rigs have dramatically increased their capabilities with innovations like hydro and immersion-cooling systems alongside increasingly efficient application-specific integrated circuits. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180305234953/https://www.asicminervalue.com/">Back in 2018</a>, Bitfury&#x2019;s B8 miner was considered state-of-the-art, generating 40 TH/s, while other top contenders included Ebang&#x2019;s E10 and Bitmain&#x2019;s S9 models, which produced 14-18 TH/s per device.</p>

<p>The current Whatsminer website does not display the price ranges for the M50S++, M53S++, and M56S++ models, leaving potential customers in the dark about the latest offerings. Furthermore, it lacks the option to acquire the newly unveiled machines showcased at Bitcoin 2023 in Miami.</p>
<p>As of now, interested buyers can only find the M50, M50S+, and M56S models on sale, with prices ranging from $1,970 to $4,200 per unit. The M50 to M56S variations offer a hashrate of approximately 118 to 200 TH/s, varying depending on the specific model selected. The company also released a new <a href="https://youtu.be/yK3Qzxt5IjU">short film</a> showcasing the new miners, which can be viewed via the Youtube video below.</p>

Volatility has been high most of the week, with today seeing the global market cap drop by 0.95% as of writing. Chainlink also slipped in today&#x2019;s session.</strong></p>
<h2>Cosmos (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" 312034  target="_blank">ATOM</a>)</h2>
<p>Cosmos (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" 312034  target="_blank">ATOM</a>) dropped to a key support point on Friday, as bearish sentiment returned to the market.</p>
<p>Following a high of $10.92 on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" 312034  target="_blank">ATOM</a>/USD slipped to an intraday bottom of $10.50 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The drop in price saw the token collide with its long-term floor, with bulls opting to buy the dip from that point.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" 312034  target="_blank">ATOM</a> is trading at $10.61, which is still almost 3% lower than yesterday&#x2019;s peak.</p>
<p>From the chart, it appears that the shift in momentum came after a failed breakout of a ceiling of 48.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).</p>
<p>The index is now tracking at 40.72, which is marginally above an upcoming floor at the 40.00 mark.</p>

<h2>Chainlink (LINK)</h2>
<p>In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" 312034  target="_blank">ATOM</a>, chainlink (LINK) also fell on Friday, extending a recent decline in the process.</p>
<p>After a recent four-day bull run, LINK/USD edged lower in today&#x2019;s session, dropping for a second straight day.</p>
<p>LINK/USD hit a bottom of $6.46 during the day, which comes after a high of $6.69 on Thursday.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, today&#x2019;s slippage pushed LINK close to a support point of its own at $6.45.</p>
<p>The token has since rebounded, and is currently trading at the $6.51 level, which came as the RSI also hit a floor.</p>
<p>Price strength moved to the 40.00 zone earlier in the day, but has marginally risen as the day progressed.</p>

The network&#x2019;s difficulty is now at an impressive 49.55 trillion, or 0.90% away from 50 trillion hashes, making it the most difficult it has ever been to discover a block reward.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#x2019;s Difficulty Rises to Uncharted Territory, Straining Miners</h2>
<p>This year, Bitcoin once again broke a record as the network&#x2019;s difficulty jumped by <a href="https://btc.com/stats/diff">3.22%</a>, rising to an unprecedented height of <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/difficulty-chart">49.55 trillion</a>. The network&#x2019;s difficulty is a measure of how hard it is to find a hash value that meets the required criteria for a new block to be added to the Bitcoin blockchain. Notably, the recent rise in difficulty followed a 1.45% drop at block height 788,256, where the chain&#x2019;s difficulty remained at 48.01 trillion for approximately two weeks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-589015 aligncenter" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/diff.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/diff-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/diff-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/diff-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/diff-190x107.jpg 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/diff-380x214.jpg 380w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/diff-760x428.jpg 760w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/diff.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>&#x200B;&#x200B;Bitcoin miners are currently dedicating 363.84 exahash per second (EH/s) toward the Bitcoin blockchain. The latest increase of 3.22% happened at block height 790,272, and the next difficulty change should occur on or around May 31, 2023. Recent statistics show that block intervals are running a bit longer than the usual ten-minute average. At 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time on May 18, the intervals ranged from ten minutes and 12 seconds to ten minutes and 33 seconds.</p>
<p>In the last 72 hours, the leading bitcoin mining pool has been Foundry USA, with a hashrate of approximately 109.04 EH/s. This accounts for 30.02% of the Bitcoin network&#x2019;s total hashrate during that timeframe. Foundry is followed by Antpool&#x2019;s 77.77 EH/s, F2pool&#x2019;s 54.52 EH/s, and Viabtc&#x2019;s 40.89 EH/s. Binance Pool, the fifth largest by hashrate, has approximately 27.26 EH/s of hashrate today.</p>

<p>Despite the increasing difficulty, Bitcoin miners have maintained a high hashrate by investing greater computational power into the network. While <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> prices are below the $27,000 range, they are significantly higher than the value of $16,500 that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> traded for on December 31, 2022. Furthermore, in addition to the all-time high (ATH) difficulty on May 18, the network&#x2019;s hashrate reached an ATH on May 2 when it reached 491.15 exahash per second (EH/s) at block height 787,895.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) dropped below the $27,000 mark on Friday, ahead of a panel discussion which will include Fed Chair Jerome Powell.</p>
<p>Markets anticipate some forward guidance from Powell regarding future decisions that the Federal Reserve could take in coming months.</p>
<p>Following a high of $27,466.53 on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD dropped to an intraday low of $26,415.10 earlier today.</p>

<p>The move, which saw the price fall by over $1,000, pushed bitcoin towards a key price floor at $26,300.</p>
<p>Friday&#x2019;s slippage occurred as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) once again dropped below a resistance of its own at the 42.00 mark.</p>
<p>Price strength is now tracking at 40.83, with bears possibly targeting a support point at the 38.00 zone.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was also in the red in today&#x2019;s session, with prices briefly breaking out of the $1,800 level.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD fell to a bottom at $1,774.20 on Friday, which comes a day after hitting a high of $1,826.90.</p>
<p>The drop in price resulted in ethereum falling below a floor at $1,790. However, it has since rebounded.</p>

<p>Similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, ethereum&#x2019;s RSI was unable to break out of a resistance point at 45.00, and is now at a reading of 44.83.</p>
<p>A sign of hope for bulls comes in the form of the 10-day (red) moving average, which moved closer to a crossover with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>
<p>Should this occur, there is a reasonable chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> could climb towards $1,900.</p>

The official noted that while most of the tightening has been done already, more rate increases are to come.</strong></p>
<h2>Euro Banks Have Solid Fundamentals, ECB’s de Guindos Says, Rate Raises to Continue</h2>
<p>The turmoil in the eurozone’s banking sector has been “short-lived” due to limited exposure to bank stress in the U.S. and Switzerland and shielding regulations, Vice President of the European Central Bank (ECB) Luis de Guindos said during a banking conference in Spain.</p>
<p>Euro area banks are weathering the storm also thanks to solid fundamentals in key areas such as resilience, liquidity, and profitability, the high-ranking official emphasized. However, he also thinks there is no room for complacency amid a challenging outlook that creates uncertainties.</p>

<p>“While higher interest rates boost banks’ net interest income, the benefits could be somewhat smaller than previously anticipated given a slowdown in lending growth and the inversion of the yield curve,” de Guindos said in his speech <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230517_1~5747dc857a.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> by the ECB on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The executive pointed out that according to the latest euro area bank lending survey, demand for corporate and housing loans has decreased significantly, slowing down its landing in March, while credit standards tightened considerably in the first quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>“There are two sides to rising interest rates. Certainly, they have a positive impact on earnings. But on the downside, they heighten interest rate risk,” Luis de Guindos elaborated. His comments come after the ECB <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ecb-raises-interest-rates-by-25bps-amid-too-high-inflation-no-pause-lagarde-says/">slowed</a> the pace of its rate hikes in early May to 25 basis points.</p>
<p>During the event in Madrid, Guindos remarked that the ECB’s future policy decisions in that regard will depend on data about the underlying inflation which remains more persistent than expected. Quoted by Bloomberg, he stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We still have a way to go in the tightening journey. Surely we’ve carried out most of it, but there’s still a way to go.</p></blockquote>
<p>The ECB is trying to bring inflation in the eurozone down to its 2% target. While markets are betting on another two increases, some <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/europeans-to-see-more-interest-rate-hikes-central-bank-governors-indicate/">members</a> of its Governing Council have indicated that rate hikes may continue beyond the summer. “Vulnerabilities persist, and we need to closely monitor the situation to safeguard financial stability,” Luis de Guindos insisted.</p>
