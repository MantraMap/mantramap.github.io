<p>This year has been extremely unpredictable for crypto enthusiasts. While the overall crypto market crashed in the first half of 2022, the second half witnessed a mix of both positive and negative events. On one hand, the long-standing crypto project, FTX, became bankrupt, making tens of thousands of investors lose millions. While on the other hand, a new entrant, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), has registered historical growth during its presale round, which is in its third phase. Due to its market viability and unique business roadmap, the value of the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has recorded a growth of 805% in the first two phases of its presale.</p>

<p>Binance (BNB) Takes A Dip Amid Security Questions</p>
<p>After the US Securities and Exchange Commission labeled FTT, the token of the FTX exchange, as a security in a recent filing in a New York court, several concerns have emerged about Binance&rsquo;s BNB. In its filing, the SEC noted that FTT has a buy-and-burn program similar to a stock buyback, and they both result in increasing the asset&rsquo;s value. Interestingly, Binance also has a similar program called BNB Burn, and investors wonder what will happen to their investments if the SEC initiates legal actions against Binance (BNB) as well.</p>
<p>Although Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao, has asserted that BNB is more than just a security, he has not been able to convince investors who are considering leaving the project. Consequently, Binance (BNB) has witnessed a sharp decline of 17% in its value in the last few weeks. Currently, Binance (BNB) is being traded at $244.79, which is 65% below its all-time high of $690.93. However, Binance (BNB) continues to assure its users that the platform is healthy.</p>
<p>Binance (BNB), the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, is used for trading and paying fees on the Binance exchange. Binance (BNB), launched in 2017, can also be exchanged or traded for other cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and more.</p>
