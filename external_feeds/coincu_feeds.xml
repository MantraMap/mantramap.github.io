<p>As <a href="https://decrypt.co/143059/bitcoin-millionaire-found-dead-a-week-after-going-missing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Decrypt reports</a>, John Forsyth, the founder of the Onfo crypto project, had been missing in Missouri for more than a week when he was found dead.</p>



<p>His body was found in a lake in northwest Arkansas with obvious gunshot wounds. Police have not provided further details on the circumstances of Forsyth&#8217;s death but said it was not a homicide.</p>



<p>Forsyth&#8217;s day job is to work in the emergency room of Mercy Hospital in Cassville, Mo. Relatives realized he was missing after he failed to show up for his shift on May 21. His family soon made a social media appeal about his whereabouts.</p>



<p>Authorities found Forsyth&#8217;s sedan parked less than a mile from the hospital on May 28. Forsyth&#8217;s wallet, passport, laptop, and briefcase were found inside the unlocked vehicle. His younger brother added, &#8220;His cell phone is inside, which is also very unusual because he always carries his cell phone.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, John Forsyth&#8217;s body was found on May 30, about an hour south of where it was last seen, with apparent gunshot wounds.</p>



<p>The official Twitter account of the Onfo project he started has yet to be updated since June 2019. The cryptocurrency project is said to allow users to earn money by referring others to the platform, a term it calls &#8220;network mining&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>First Digital is launching a new stablecoin tethered to the US dollar but controlled in Asia.</em></li>



<li><em>The stablecoin is programmable and may be used to execute financial transactions, escrow services, and insurance without the need of middlemen.</em></li>



<li><em>The news coincides with introducing of a new regulatory framework for digital assets in Hong Kong.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>First Digital, Hong Kong&#8217;s foremost certified custodian and registered trust organization, has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/first-digital-group-is-propelling-digital-asset-innovation-with-the-launch-of-its-new-stablecoin-fdusd-bridging-stability-with-innovation-to-revolutionise-the-existing-global-financial-landscape-301839437.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the launch of a new stablecoin, First Digital USD (FDUSD).</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-12.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="960" height="720" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-12.png" alt="First Digital To Launch New Stablecoin Before Hong Kong&#039;s Openness Policy" class="wp-image-191373" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-12.png 960w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-12-300x225.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-12-768x576.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-12-750x563.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" title="First Digital To Launch New Stablecoin Before Hong Kong&#039;s Openness Policy 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>The stablecoin, issued by FD121 Ltd (under the brand name First Digital Laboratories), is meant to be backed 1:1 by one US dollar or asset of similar fair value held in the accounts of authorized financial institutions in Asia.</p>



<p>FDUSD provides users with a trustworthy digital currency that aims to reduce volatility in the cryptocurrency market while also improving the efficiency of financial operations by cutting transaction fees and providing quicker, more secure transactions. According to First Digital, the stablecoin is programmable and capable of allowing the execution of financial transactions, escrow services, and insurance without the need for middlemen.</p>



<p>First Digital Labs will collaborate closely with local and international regulatory authorities to ensure full compliance with current and future applicable laws and regulations, and First Digital Labs will contribute to their evolution, including the shaping of any regulatory regimes that FDUSD and/or First Digital may fall under in the near future.</p>



<p>First Digital CEO Vincent Chok stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The launch of this stablecoin represents a major stride forward in our mission to provide a secure and efficient digital currency that can be seamlessly integrated into everyday transactions. Transparency and robust oversight are paramount in building trust in stablecoins and in turn the adoption of this innovative blockchain technology, especially at a time when stability in the traditional financial system is uncertain.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The FDUSD will be issued by First Digital Trust and will be backed by &#8220;high-quality reserves&#8221; of cash and cash equivalents in regulated financial institutions across Asia.</p>



<p>The Trust Ordinance of Hong Kong requires all reserves to be kept in separate accounts to avoid asset co-mingling. First Digital Trust is a Hong Kong trust business established under the Trust Law.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-14-1024x585.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="585" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-14-1024x585.png" alt="First Digital To Launch New Stablecoin Before Hong Kong&#039;s Openness Policy" class="wp-image-191375" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-14-1024x585.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-14-300x171.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-14-768x439.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-14-750x429.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-14-1140x651.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-14.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="First Digital To Launch New Stablecoin Before Hong Kong&#039;s Openness Policy 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>One of the primary benefits of the new stablecoins is their redeemability. Since FDUSD is backed by high-quality assets like cash and currency equivalents, users may exchange their FDUSD tokens for an equal amount in US dollars.</p>



<p>This function protects the stablecoin reserves, and consumers may be certain that FDUSD is always 1:1 backed. This demonstrates First Digital&#8217;s dedication to operating in a transparent and safe way, giving consumers additional trust and confidence in the stablecoins&#8217; stability and validity.</p>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/189147-hong-kong-accepts-trade-cryptocurrencies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hong Kong</a> regulators have said that individual investors should not be able to trade stablecoins publicly until the planned regulations for this asset class are fully adopted in the territory. The news is noteworthy, especially in light of the new Hong Kong &#8220;Guidelines for Virtual Asset Trade Platform Operators&#8221; that go into effect on June 1.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>BRC-30, an expanded version of the BRC-20 concept, was released by OKX Wallet.</em></li>



<li><em>This proposal adds a staking mechanism to the Bitcoin network that is specially designed for BRC-20 tokens or Bitcoin.</em></li>



<li><em>Users may now stake their own BRC-20 tokens or Bitcoin in exchange for BRC-30 tokens, thanks to the release of the new tokens.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>OKX Wallet announced the BRC-30 proposal, an improved version of the BRC-20 protocol that adds equity operation operations, including deposit, minting, and withdrawal. According to the plan, the staking capability would allow BRC-20 token holders to receive passive revenue.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-9.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="700" height="280" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-9.png" alt="OKX Wallet Proposes Creating BRC-30 Tokens To Strengthen Bitcoin Ecosystem" class="wp-image-191367" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-9.png 700w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-9-300x120.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" title="OKX Wallet Proposes Creating BRC-30 Tokens To Strengthen Bitcoin Ecosystem 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>Users may now stake their own BRC-20 tokens or Bitcoin in exchange for BRC-30 tokens, thanks to the launch of the new token. They extend the functionality of BRC-20 tokens by including a description of the staking protocol. BRC-20 token holders may use their digital assets to make passive income without selling them, actively engage in the Bitcoin network, and increase the potential value of their tokens in this manner.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.okx.com/web3/build/docs/bitcoin-ecosystem/brc30-proposal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposal</a>, the launch of new tokens and their staking functionalities gives BRC-20 token holders new ways to interact with their digital assets and generate passive revenue. Additionally, staking encourages users to keep their assets, possibly lowering market selling pressure and leading to a more stable token ecosystem.</p>



<p>By introducing BRC-30 and BRC-20 tokens, Bitcoin holders and token holders may create income without depending entirely on purchasing and selling tokens on exchanges. This staking mechanism adds a new layer to the BRC-20 token ecosystem, encouraging increased engagement and strengthening the bond between token holders and the underlying blockchain network.</p>

<p>If you want to gain BRC-30 tokens, create a staking pool and acquire seed users to issue their own tokens. To gain additional tokens, users need to stake BTC or BRC-20 tokens.</p>



<p>Provides an open-source profit computation interface after doing a complete analysis of the BRC-20 and BRC-30 recommendations. The staking earnings for any user are calculated consistently using both the backend and open-source tools, demonstrating consistency across all computations.</p>



<p>As Cointu reported, OKX was one of the first big entities to accept the Bitcoin Ordinals movement, followed by other exchanges such as Binance, Gate.io, and Crypto.com, which all announced support for Ordinals/BRC-20.</p>



<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/187859-okx-wallet-brc-20-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OKX Wallet</a> is also the first multichain wallet to support the Lightning network, which promises quicker transaction speeds and cheaper transaction costs.</p>

<p>The Forum aims to foster authenticity, constructive conversations, and healthier online social interactions. The tokenomics mechanism, powered by Pi cryptocurrency, allows Pioneers to create and organically curate content, and moderate behavior, providing the community with tools to manage the online environment in a decentralized way.</p>



<p>The forum intends to solve current popular Web2 social network issues using blockchain-powered technology to design the future of Web3 social experience. Pi team believes that a true Web3 social network should make advancements and improvements on the flaws of many Web2 social networks, such as propagating misinformation and disinformation, trolling, internet violence, information overload, low signal-to-noise ratio, information silos due to overuse of machine learning algorithms, etc.</p>

<p>Pi Network has been creating innovative designs and products to differentiate from Web2 in all three facets, ownership, distribution, and social interactions and experience. Fireside Forum was built based on Pi’s vision of how Web3 should work, prior academic research on issues of social networks and online behavior, and their own hypotheses about how blockchain and cryptocurrencies can mitigate such issues in the old web.</p>



<p>By revolutionizing social interactions online, Pi Network aims to foster a healthier and more responsible digital environment where people can engage in meaningful exchanges, be well-informed, and positively impact the global community. Reinventing our social interactions online is a matter of improving user experience, addressing broader societal issues, and unlocking the full potential of the digital world.</p>



<p>The design uses costs, rewards, disincentives, and intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. It strikes a balance among all of them to achieve its goals of improving online social interactions. Fireside Forum is another testament to Pi team’s commitment to developing utility-focused applications, where blockchain technology and cryptocurrency are used to solve real human needs, create innovations addressing larger social problems, and facilitate meaningful human connections worldwide.</p>

<p>The LSDFi protocol unshETH officially responded to last night&#8217;s security incident on Twitter at dawn this morning. The project said that around 22:00 on May 31, one of the implementation private keys of the unshETH contract was leaked.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">At approximately 14:00 UTC (6 hrs ago), one of the deployer private keys for unshETH contracts was compromised.<br><br>Out of an abundance of caution, we emergency paused withdrawals on unshETH Ether.

</div></figure>



<p>Out of an abundance of caution, the official urgently suspended unshETH&#8217;s ETH withdrawals. According to the security model, unshETH&#8217;s ETH deposits (TVL up to $35 million) are protected by multi-signatures and time-locks, so there is no risk.</p>



<p>Additionally, several backend agreement contracts (liquidity mining pools, cross-chain bridges, etc.) have been hacked and are collaborating with white hat security experts from Coinbase, Stargate, Paladin Blockchain Security, Github, and ogle for the safety of user funds and Impact Area is expected to be restricted.</p>



<p>At the same time, the official contacted the hacker to try to negotiate the return of money and contract ownership to limit the impact on existing users.</p>

<p>Earlier, several KOLs tweeted that the protocol&#8217;s vault was suspected of having security issues and reminded users to move funds out as soon as possible.</p>



<p>The reason is that the contract owner has been tampered with, and the project official has been informed, but this official has yet to have an official response. However, the official said in Discord that emergency measures had been activated and the Ethereum funds involved are safe.</p>

<p>On-chain information shows that the contract owner&#8217;s rights were transferred two hours ago and are now moved to an unknown address 0xb815114245B6E0f7d31910ae87c58b35C7D39827.</p>



<p>On May 27, the LSDFi protocol hit a significant milestone seeing an unprecedented $25 million inflow in just one day.</p>



<p>Unsheth, a real-world commodity-backed synthetic asset offering, holds 12.9% of LSDFi TVL. Its inclusion in the LSDFi protocol underscores the need for diversified investment opportunities in the DeFi space.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has issued a circular on transitional arrangements for a new licensing system for virtual asset trading platforms.</em></li>



<li><em>This circular only applies to VATPs that provide trading services with non-security tokens.</em></li>



<li><em>During the transition period, the platform can continue to provide services from June 1, 2023, to May 31, 2024.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Yesterday, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) <a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/circular/intermediaries/licensing/doc?refNo=23EC27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued </a>a circular on transitional arrangements for a new licensing system for virtual asset trading platforms willing to comply with the guidelines. </strong></h5>

<p>This circular provides a reasonable amount of time for them to apply for permits and to review and modify their systems and controls. Comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Virtual asset trading platforms that do not intend to apply for a license should proceed to close their business in an orderly manner.</p>



<p>Virtual asset trading platforms that <a href="https://news.coincu.com/190058-huobi-hong-kong-cryptocurrency-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provide virtual asset services</a> in Hong Kong and have substantive and meaningful business before June 1, 2023, can be used between June 1, 2023 to May 31, 2024.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-3.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="600" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-3.png" alt="HKSFC Issues Transition Agreements On Licensing For Virtual Asset Exchanges" class="wp-image-191343" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-3.png 1000w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-3-300x180.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-3-768x461.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-3-750x450.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="HKSFC Issues Transition Agreements On Licensing For Virtual Asset Exchanges 24"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Please continue to provide virtual assets services in Hong Kong under a no-frills agreement without violating the licensing requirements under the Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance. To be eligible for the forward agreement, virtual asset trading platforms must provide virtual asset services in Hong Kong by June 1, 2023.</p>



<p>Factors that SFC will consider when assessing whether VATP was operating and conducting genuine business with an actual presence in Hong Kong prior to June 1, 2023, include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Whether it is incorporated in Hong Kong;</li>



<li>Whether it has a physical office in Hong Kong;</li>



<li>Whether their Hong Kong employees exercise centralized management and control over VATP;</li>



<li>Whether the organization&#8217;s key employees (e.g., those responsible for operating the trading system) are based in Hong Kong;</li>



<li>Whether VATP&#8217;s operations are direct with independent customers and accurate trading volume in Hong Kong;</li>



<li>Are there other factors (e.g., the establishment of the trading system, trading arrangements, and organizational structure of the VATP) that could demonstrate that VATP was operating in Hong Kong before June 1. 2023 or not?</li>
</ul>

<p>The statement comes after the crypto community went viral on Twitter, alleging that the exchange is experiencing insolvency due to an alleged connection between it and the cross-chain router protocol Multichain (MULTI).</p>



<p>The Gate.io team said &#8220;the company&#8217;s operations are going well&#8221; and that it is focusing on setting up an affiliated trading platform in Hong Kong called Gate.HK.</p>



<p>Rumors of Gate.io insolvency broke out after several events related to Multichain. On May 24, blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence posted data showing a large MULTI inflow into Gate.io, which the Multichain project team &#8220;is said to have been captured in Shanghai&#8221; along with associated wallets about $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in controlled money.</p>

<p>Yesterday there were also rumors that its Founder and CEO Zhao Jun <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191188-multichain-founder-arrested-in-shanghai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was arrested</a> by Chinese police in Shanghai for investigation. The community exploded when the project itself posted a statement that their CEO was missing, adding that some of the protocol&#8217;s routers were no longer working because only the CEO had access to them. access to the relevant servers.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>After seeing multiple MULTI and Fantom deposits into Gate.io, some Twitter users suspected that the exchange could be affected by Multichain.</p>



<p>Although the team at Gate.io has denied these rumors, saying that the exchange is processing all withdrawals and operating normally, it can still not prevent users from panicking to withdraw money to avoid risk.</p>

<li><em>CZ stressed the importance of talent and profitability to the firm.</em></li>



<li><em>He also stressed his commitment to cost-cutting efforts.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao commented on <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191239-binance-lays-off-20-of-its-workforce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the news of layoffs</a> in the crypto exchange.

<p>According to Colin Wu, an independent cryptocurrency reporter, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency by trading volume plans to let off 20% of its staff next month. Nonetheless, this news comes after the crypto exchange had said that it would not lay off any of its employees.</p>



<p>CZ has <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1663945939482968075" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moved</a> to Twitter to address the problem and deny the statements made in Wu Blockchain&#8217;s Twitter thread concerning layoffs at Binance. The reports were described as FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) by CZ, who emphasized the company&#8217;s steadfast commitment to talent and profitability.</p>



<p>According to Wu Blockchain, the overall number of Binance workers is about 8,000, with market rumors indicating that the company may lay off nearly 20% of its workforce next month.</p>



<p>Binance CEO added that the exchange conducts a continual &#8220;bottom-out&#8221; approach, which entails saying goodbye to employees who may not be compatible with the company&#8217;s unique culture or position. He provided a brief example of Work From Home (WFH) and noted that it is not suitable for everyone.</p>



<p>CZ emphasized that the &#8220;bottom-out&#8221; approach is ongoing and that he promotes it on a weekly basis. He said that the corporation must fire no more than % of its employees.</p>

<p>Additionally, Binance CEO reiterated his commitment to cost-cutting efforts such as optimizing server, airline, and food charges, among others. This dedication to efficiency has been critical to Binance&#8217;s success, allowing the firm to remain profitable since its fourth month of existence in October 2017, even amid difficult moments in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>Patrick Hillmann, Binance&#8217;s Chief Communications Officer, reinforced CZ&#8217;s views in an earlier answer to Wu Blockchain, putting light on the volatile nature of the crypto business and the necessity for enterprises to stay disciplined and agile. He stressed the significance of reallocating resources internally and maintaining a pipeline of creative candidates to fulfill consumers&#8217; and the regulatory landscape&#8217;s continually changing expectations.</p>



<p>Binance is currently facing tough regulatory issues across regions with strict crypto policies, specifically the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191286-binance-pressured-by-canadian-regulators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Canadian authorities</a>. </p>



<p>The exchange also <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191211-binance-stops-trading-of-privacy-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that it would delist privacy currencies for customers in certain regions beginning June 26. The action comes as the European Union continues to implement its groundbreaking Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191285-mica-is-now-signed-into-law/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MiCA</a> would specifically prohibit exchanges from offering privacy cryptocurrencies unless currency holders&#8217; identities were confirmed.</p>

<p>Cowen Inc. was acquired by TD Bank Group, one of North America&#8217;s major banks, in March 2023, prompting the closure. According to an email shared with Bloomberg, the bank&#8217;s digital assets unit included at least ten workers and one intern.</p>

<p>According to the investigation, over 90 Chinese firms that provide fentanyl precursors accept cryptocurrency payments. After that, in evidence at the hearing, US Treasury Department Assistant Secretary Elizabeth Rosenberg acknowledged the link between illegal trade and digital assets.</p>



<p>Moreover, Rosenberg said that payments in cryptocurrency is &#8220;appealing&#8221; to Chinese pharma producers, citing Elliptic research.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Unfortunately, that is a mode that some of these precursor manufacturers and illicit drug organizations have used – the receipt of bitcoin payments in wallets, cryptocurrency wallets. The reason why they would find this appealing is the same reason that other financial criminals would find it appealing, which is to say there&#8217;s an element of pseudonymity that they seek,” said Rosenberg.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Overdoses using fentanyl have become the main cause of death in the United States for those aged 18 to 45. Chemicals required to make the hazardous drug are often imported from China and travel over numerous countries on their way to U.S. consumers of the synthetic opioid, which the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) claims are 100 times more strong than morphine.</p>
