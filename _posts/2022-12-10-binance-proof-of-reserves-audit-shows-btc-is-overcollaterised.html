<p>A report by global audit and advisory company Mazars proves that Binance&rsquo;s Bitcoin reserves are overcollateralised.</p>
Confirmation of overcollateralisation
<p>The world of cryptocurrencies is rapidly changing, and Binance is serious about taking a lead role in the evolution. The world's largest crypto exchange recently completed an independent audit which confirms that Binance&rsquo;s Bitcoin reserves are overcollateralized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a big deal and could signal a major shift in the way that crypto exchanges manage their reserves. While this news may not surprise those familiar with the crypto industry, it's a significant milestone for the sector as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To put it simply, overcollateralization means that Binance holds more Bitcoin than is necessary to cover customer deposits. This provides a greater level of security for customers, ensuring that their funds are not at risk of being lost in the event of a hack or other incident.&nbsp;</p>
Customer Bitcoin assets safe and secure
<p>According to the audit, Binance&rsquo;s custodial services are safe and sound, with no customer funds held in unsecured wallets. This is something that many exchanges have struggled with in the past, so this offers a clear indication that Binance is taking customer security seriously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The audit also found that Binance is compliant with the FATF&rsquo;s Travel Rule. This rule requires cryptocurrency exchanges to collect, verify and transfer customer information when sending funds to another exchange. This is a significant step forward for the entire crypto industry and could provide a much-needed layer of oversight and regulation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, the results of the audit show that Binance is committed to providing its users with a safe and secure experience. The fact that their Bitcoin reserves are overcollateralized is a clear indication that the exchange isn&rsquo;t taking any chances when it comes to the safety of customer funds.&nbsp;</p>
A contrarian opinion
<p>However, not everyone has taken the Mazars audit at its word. According to a Coindesk article, Francine McKenna, lecturer in financial accounting at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, gave the view that the audit was worthless. She said:&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They did a comparison of balances per public key address from a list they got from management. They did not compare any balances in independent banks or custodians or depositories,"</p>

<p>Mckenna was even more derogatory of the audit when she added:</p>

<p>"This is more worthless than even the Tether or USDC report,"</p>
