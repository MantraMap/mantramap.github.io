<p>Vanguard Group, which manages $7.2 trillion in assets, has significantly ramped up its investments in the bitcoin mining sector, with its total stake now exceeding $560 million.</p>
Vanguards bitcoin mining investments
<p>The company has been snapping up shares of Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms, two major players in the Bitcoin mining space. Vanguard now holds 17.5 million shares of Marathon Digital, a 60% increase from its previous position. Given Marathon's current share price of $16.03, this puts the value of Vanguard's investment at a cool $280.5 million.</p>
<p>But Vanguard didn't stop there. It also boosted its holdings in Riot Blockchain, a Colorado-based Bitcoin miner. Vanguard now owns 17.9 million shares of Riot, an 18% increase from its previous stake. This additional investment is worth over $281 million, pushing Vanguard's total investment in Bitcoin mining firms to a whopping $560 million.</p>
An institutional change of heart
<p>This is all quite surprising given Vanguard's stance just two years ago. Back then, the company had been very sceptical about the long-term investment potential of cryptocurrencies. However, much water has since flowed under the bridge and now Vanguard has become the largest shareholder of Marathon Digital.</p>
<p>Not just Vanguard, but the broader financial industry, seems to be warming up to cryptocurrencies. Last week, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink described Bitcoin as an "international asset&rdquo;, and &ldquo;digitised gold". BlackRock, which manages $9.5 trillion in assets, recently applied to the SEC for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. It's also the second-largest investor in Marathon Digital.</p>
Bitcoin mining big business
<p>Bitcoin mining, once a niche activity, has evolved into a big business. Today's miners are large operations that use server farms and consume a lot of energy. In return for their efforts in verifying blockchain transactions, they're rewarded with newly minted Bitcoins. It's a high-stakes game, and it seems Vanguard is betting big on its players.</p>
