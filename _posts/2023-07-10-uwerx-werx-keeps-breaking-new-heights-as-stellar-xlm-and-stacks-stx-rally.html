<p class="s5">Despite the promise of a bullish season, the crypto market has persisted with a bearish trend, causing many tokens to experience huge reductions in their total market capitalizations. Hence, tokens like Stellar (XLM) and Stacks (STX) struggle to stay in the game.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx has breezed through many successful presale stages, rapidly selling out and reaching new heights daily.</p>
Stacks (STX) Launches Stacks 2.1
<p class="s5">Stacks (STX) aims to create a more secure, decentralized internet owned by users. The Layer-2 blockchain provides a scalable infrastructure for building decentralized applications (dApps) and performing decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions on the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain.</p>
<p class="s5">The Stacks (STX) platform improves the base protocol by introducing smart contract functionality for Bitcoin (BTC) users. Furthermore, it enables users to create and trade valuable non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on popular digital marketplaces.</p>
<p class="s5">Moreover, Stacks (STX) also provides the underbanked access to vital financial services, like micropayments and loans, without interference from governments or other intermediaries.</p>
<p class="s5">The blockchain recently released a significant upgrade in March 2023. Stacks (STX) launched the Stacks 2.1 upgrade to improve the speed and volume of DeFi transactions. The launch caused the STX token's price to surge 14% in less than 24hrs, reaching $1.27.</p>
<p class="s5">However, the token has steadily declined since March after reaching more than $1.5. STX stayed at $0.9 since April but has now fallen even more, trading at $0.6 currently.</p>
Stellar (XLM) Partners With Anchain.ai
<p class="s5">Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized payment system based on the Stellar Consensus Protocol. The blockchain enables the exchange of traditional crypto coins and fiat money across international borders.</p>
<p class="s5">Furthermore, Stellar (XLM) recently partnered with an AI-powered security company, Anchain.ai. This integration is aimed at enhancing cross-border payment security. Stellar (XLM) seeks to provide more accessible security tools to create a secure developer ecosystem.</p>
<p class="s5">The XLM token has been on a constant decline since March after it reached $0.13. The coin took a significant fall to settle at $0.7 in April.</p>
<p class="s5">Stellar (XLM) is experiencing a decline in Q2 2023, making only very minuscule backward and forward leaps. The XLM token has been stuck in the $0.8 range since last week. Holders are looking wide-eyed for appreciation, while investors are watching and wondering if now would be an excellent time to get in the game.</p>
<p class="s5">However, experts are predicting an exaggerated dip, even with the steadiness of the token.</p>
Uwerx (WERX) Presale Is Breaking New Heights
<p class="s5">This new crypto project focuses on the freelancer economy. With freelancing becoming widely adopted, even by big companies like Google, the project is on the right track. The project has undergone vetting and auditing by SolidProof and InterFi Network to ensure transparency.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx aims to provide a secure, fast, and accessible platform for freelancers and their clients. Uwerx charges a low transaction fee of 1%, while other freelancing platforms, such as Upwork and Fiverr, charge 10%-20%.</p>
<p class="s5">The project is in its fifth funding stage and has a 72.5 million token allocation, with WERX priced at $0.0315 per token. The total presale token allocation increased to 57% from 45%, creating more opportunities for early supporters. The hard cap presale will occur on 31st July 2023.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx recently announced preparations to transition to the Beta version to enable users to start testing. The Alpha version of the platform was launched last week. The launch came with Landing Page and Sign-Up Page. However, the platform has been recently updated with more pages, including the Login, Forgot Password, Freelancer or Client Initiation, Job Creation Process, My Activity, and Initial Step of Job Creation and Initial Step Of Finding Talent pages. Users can also send helpful feedback to Uwerx through an email, feedback@uwerx.network.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx provides a Uwerx Vault to help secure users' tokens. Users can store their tokens for a specified time and earn rewards using the Vault.</p>
<p class="s5">Moreover, the team has locked the developer's liquidity, which was set for 25 years after the presale. The lock happened after 82.8% of the community voted on an instant lock. Also, 92.8% of the community voted for a test airdrop to enable users to validate their wallet addresses.</p>
<p class="s5">The project has an excellent presale run, and with that, the developers have reduced the token allocation from 8% to 7%, increasing investor confidence in the project.</p>
<p class="s5">The Uwerx developers utilized an agile methodology approach to achieve presale success. The approach uses rapid development and accelerated deployment through feedback.</p>
<p class="s5">Stellar (XLM) and Stacks (STX) give holders much anxiety with their current standings as the tokens seem to be rolling downhill.</p>
<p class="s5">Fortunately, Uwerx is pushing a very successful presale run.
