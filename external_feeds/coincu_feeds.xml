<li><em>Horizen has made a groundbreaking announcement regarding the approval of ZenIP 42204. Consequently, ZEN will no longer retain its status as a privacy coin. The forthcoming deprecation of the  ZEN Coin mainchain shielded pools marks a fundamental shift in  ZEN Coin&#8217;s approach to privacy within its blockchain ecosystem.</em></li>



<li><em>Horizen&#8217;s decision to remove privacy features at the consensus level signals its dedication to adaptability and responsible growth within an evolving blockchain landscape.

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Horizen has made a groundbreaking announcement regarding the approval of ZenIP 42204. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Horizen.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Horizen.jpeg" alt="Horizen" class="wp-image-198465" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Horizen.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Horizen-300x150.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Horizen-768x384.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Horizen-360x180.jpeg 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Horizen-750x375.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Horizen&#039;s ZenIP 42204 Causes Privacy Features Removal from ZEN Coin 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The decision signifies a significant change as all privacy features of ZEN will be removed at the consensus level. In a blog post on their official website, Horizen highlighted that this move aims to eliminate technical debt and proactively address potential regulatory threats. Consequently, ZEN will no longer retain its status as a privacy coin.</p>



<p>The forthcoming deprecation of the  ZEN Coin mainchain shielded pools marks a fundamental shift in  ZEN Coin&#8217;s approach to privacy within its blockchain ecosystem. While privacy features have been a distinguishing characteristic of ZEN, Horizen has taken a proactive stance to prioritize regulatory compliance and confront technical challenges head-on.</p>



<p>The decision to remove privacy features at the consensus level underscores Horizen&#8217;s commitment to streamlining its technology stack and aligning with evolving regulatory standards. By doing so, the platform seeks to address concerns surrounding privacy coins and establish a solid foundation of transparency and accountability.</p>

<p>The move comes amidst a growing wave of scrutiny and regulatory attention towards privacy coins due to concerns about their potential involvement in illicit activities. By taking proactive measures to address these concerns,  ZEN Coin aims to foster a more compliant and regulated environment within its blockchain ecosystem.</p>



<p>While the removal of privacy features may come as a surprise to some ZEN coin holders and privacy advocates, Horizen emphasizes that this strategic change will enable the platform to better manage technical debt and allocate resources towards further innovation and growth. The company remains committed to the long-term sustainability and development of the Horizen ecosystem.</p>



<p>Horizen&#8217;s decision to remove privacy features at the consensus level signals its dedication to adaptability and responsible growth within an evolving blockchain landscape. The impact of this transformation on the ZEN community and its ecosystem will unfold over time as Horizen continues to navigate the intersection of technological advancements and regulatory requirements.</p>

<li><em>Israeli government seizes millions in cryptocurrency from the Iranian military and Hezbollah.</em></li>



<li><em>Crypto used to finance operations due to banking restrictions.</em></li>



<li><em>Authorities trace transactions and seize funds meant for terrorists.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.israelhayom.com/2023/06/28/in-first-israel-seizes-millions-from-crypto-wallets-tied-to-iran-hezbollah/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Israel Hayom</a></em>, the Israeli government has confiscated millions of dollars in cryptocurrency from wallets related to the Iranian military and the Iran-backed Hezbollah terrorist organization in Lebanon.</strong></h5>

<p>Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated on Tuesday that Israel had, for the first time, captured cryptocurrency wallets linked to Iran&#8217;s Quds Force and Lebanon&#8217;s Hezbollah terror proxy. Israel&#8217;s Mossad espionage agency, military intelligence, Israeli police, and others were all engaged in the endeavor.</p>



<p>Gallant said the &#8220;extensive and precedent-setting&#8221; action over the previous week resulted in the seizure of millions of dollars in digital money meant for terrorists.</p>

<p>According to Gallant, the Quds Force, Hezbollah, and Syrian organizations have been using cryptocurrencies provided by outside parties to pay for their operations since the beginning of the year. They have been labeled as terrorist groups by the United States and certain other nations and have been barred from participating in the regular global banking system.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Whoever finances terror or maintains economic ties to terror groups are targets, just like those directing terrorism. There is a clear connection to terror that originates in Iran, which is the financier and purveyor of terrorism against Israel and many countries around the world, both directly and through its proxies,&#8221; Gallant stated.</p>

<p>After the confiscation of multiple digital wallets related to terrorism finance by Jerusalem months earlier, the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas stated in April that it would no longer accept donations through the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, citing &#8220;hostile&#8221; behavior against contributors.</p>



<p>While cryptocurrency is thought to provide privacy, technological advancements have allowed authorities to identify persons behind crypto transactions. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are popular for illegal transactions since they are difficult to track. Without revealing a name or location, anybody in the world may open a Bitcoin account and begin receiving digital payments.</p>

Conflux and DWF Labs have also co-organized many events, including those held in Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Paris.</p>



<p>DWF Lab is one of Conflux&#8217;s principal backers. This funding not only strengthens our relationship, but also serves as a catalyst for our shared ambition to expand the Conflux ecosystem.</p>



<p>Conflux previously said it would build a blockchain-based SIM card in partnership with China Telecom, the second-largest wireless carrier in China with an estimated $390 million subscribers. Recently, &#8216;Ethereum China&#8217; Conflux attracted attention as Hong Kong welcomed retail traders.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of this year, Conflux&#8217;s market capitalization has grown from $46 million to nearly $650 million currently &#8211; making CFX one of the best performing tokens.</p>



<p>Some Asia-focused investors argue that Conflux&#8217;s indirect links to the Chinese market could position CFX as a proxy bet on the broader Asian market.</p>



<p>More recently, Conflux joined the Web3 Institute of Hong Kong, participated in the Singapore Digital Economy Roundtable hosted by the Singapore Government, and led the drafting of IEEE P3217, an international blockchain standard by the Singapore Government Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[TrueUSD's endorsement news causes a negative impact, trading at a disadvantage compared to Tether on Binance.US.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>TrueUSD&#8217;s endorsement news causes a negative impact, trading at a disadvantage compared to Tether on Binance.US.</em></li>



<li><em>Concerns arise over the audit of TrueUSD conducted by The Network Firm (formerly Armanino), which discontinued its crypto audit business.</em></li>



<li><em>Stablecoin volatility affects the market, but Bitcoin remains unaffected, trading above $30,000.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The fact that endorsement news of TrueUSD (TUSD), a dollar-pegged stablecoin, is causing a negative effect when it is trading at a disadvantage to Tether (USDT) on Binance.US, the Binance exchange&#8217;s US subsidiary.</strong></h5>

<p>The TUSD/USDT pair was trading at 90 cents on Binance.US at press time, having touched a low of 80 cents on Wednesday, according to data from TradingView. The pair was trading at approximately $0.9985 on Binance.</p>

<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/28/trueusds-reserves-were-attested-by-former-ftxus-accounting-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinDesk</a></em>, The Network Firm, previously known as Armanino and working with former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried for FTX US, audited the reserved certificate of the unstable stablecoin TrueUSD. According to the publication, The Network Firm sprang from the digital asset division of the accounting firm Armanino.</p>



<p>Armanino, an accounting company, said in December of last year that it was discontinuing its crypto audit business and leaving customers. Other industry customers thought that Armanino&#8217;s reputation risk would cast doubt on its audit findings, putting Armanino under pressure. </p>



<p>Armanino also serves as an accounting company for cryptocurrency exchanges, including Gate, OKX, and Kraken. According to reports, the audit company started providing assistance to the crypto company in 2014, offering proof of reserve audits and proof of stablecoins.</p>

<p>After the FTX affair, US investors sued Prager Metis and Armanino, FTX&#8217;s auditing company, accusing them of extortion conspiracy.</p>



<p>Stablecoin volatility, which has emerged as a financing currency over the last three years, often flows into the larger market. TUSD, with a market capitalization of $3 billion, offers less of a systemic risk to the larger market than Tether, which has a market capitalization of more than $83 billion.</p>



<p>At the moment, Bitcoin is not reacting to the news, the price of BTC is still trading above $30,000.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The NFT market showed little sign of renewed optimism in May, despite $43 million raised, the highest amount of funding since November 2022.</strong></h5>



<p>However, the amount raised outpaced actual market volume and user growth, suggesting that enthusiasm remains concentrated among venture investors. Mainstream collectors have yet to match the interest. Unique users and trading volume continue to decline.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The market needs to move beyond temporary hype and speculation and attract broader participation and success across projects.</p>



<p>Data of this report was obtained from Footprint&#8217;s NFT research page.

</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size"><strong>Chains &amp; Marketplaces for NFTs</strong></h3>

<li>However, in terms of unique active wallets, about 40% are on Ethereum, 34% on Polygon and 16% on Solana.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Over 70% of wash-trading takes place on x2y2, indicating that their systems and policies allow manipulative behaviour with fewer barriers.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size"><strong>NFT Investment &amp; Funding   </strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>The total amount raised in May was $43.2 million, the highest since November 2022.&nbsp;</li>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">Crypto Macro Overview</h1>



<p><a href="https://www.footprint.network/@KikiSmith/BTC-ETH-Decentralized-Stablecoin-Market-Analysis?date_filter=past35days" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BTC</a> opened the month of May at $28,074, peaked on May 5 at $29,528, and turned down to $27,223 on May 31. For the month as a whole, bitcoin was down slightly by 0.5%. </p>

<p>However, BTC as a marketing indicator,  is still up more than 64% year-to-date, compared to its price of $16,605 on Jan. 1. ETH is following the same trend, down less than 1% in May, and up 58% year-to-date in 2022.</p>



<p>Market players shouldn&#8217;t have a false feeling of security as a result of the current quiet in the volatility of Bitcoin and ETH. Specifically, BTC saw a significant 13.3% drop in on-chain volume, indicating a decrease in trading activity on Bitcoin Network.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">NFT Market Overview&nbsp;</h1>

In May, volume started solid at $27 million, jumped to $35 million, then dropped by two-thirds before partially recovering.</p>

<p>The Milady Maker collection was mentioned in a tweet by Elon Musk on May 10, 2023, which caused trading volume to spike to $13.95 million, sending prices soaring. The mid-month spike shows how young the NFT market is. The bigger picture can be skewed by &#8220;hot&#8221; new collections or sales that come and go quickly in terms of popularity.</p>

<p>Though, on May 10th, <a href="https://www.footprint.network/research/nft/nft-market/market-overview?series_date=past30days" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the number of users</a> in the NFT market is not increasing a lot, so we may speculate that the NFT user base is not growing significantly at the moment, even though Milady Maker&#8217;s collection is getting hot, the users are still the same people who have been in this market for a long time.</p>

<p>At the beginning of May, there were more NFT buyers than sellers, with the ratio being 2:1, mostly because of some projects on Polygon as below, with a bunch of buyers and only several sellers on the secondary market.</p>

<p>According to the data of <a href="https://www.footprint.network/research/nft/nft-market/market-overview?series_date=past30days" target="_blank" rel="noopener">daily buyers &amp; sellers</a>, there are still more NFTs listed for sale than active buyers interested in buying them, indicating a potential oversupply of NFTs, not necessarily subpar collections.</p>



<p>While the NFT market has experienced fluctuations, it is still a growing industry with the potential for long-term growth and acceptance.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">Chains &amp; Marketplaces for NFTs</h1>



<p>Ethereum dominates NFT volume with over 95% of the total market. However, in terms of unique active wallets, about 40% are on Ethereum, 34% on Polygon and 16% on Solana.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While still small compared to traditional markets, growing unique participation across multiple chains is a healthier sign for the NFT space than if the large majority remained concentrated on Ethereum alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.footprint.network/research/nft/nft-market/market-overview?series_date=past30days" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Footprint Analytics</a>, over 70% of wash-trading takes place on x2y2, indicating that their systems and policies allow manipulative behavior with fewer barriers &#8211; whether intentional or not, this highlights the speculative nature of the current NFT market and the need for continued progress towards transparency, trust and genuine mainstream interest.</p>

<p>It is expected for the wash trade value to decrease as the NFT market experiences a downturn, but it is noteworthy that the wash trade percentage has also decreased over the past three months.</p>

<p>After a brief period of euphoria caused by the Blur airdrop, the NFT market has now returned to a bearish state, characterised by a marked decline in speculator enthusiasm.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Footprint Analytics has conducted an analysis of the top 50 volume collections. This shows a decrease in the prevalence of wash trading, which can be primarily attributed to two key factors:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Speculation-driven projects</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Projects such as <em>MineablePunks</em> and <em>Terraforms by Mathcastles</em> initially gained significant trading volume based on speculation. However, these projects were based solely on hype and lacked substantial underlying value. As traders and investors realised the limited utility and long-term potential of these collections, interest waned, resulting in a loss of sustained trading activity.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Wash trading during the hype</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Wash trading played a significant role in certain collections at the height of their hype. However, as the excitement and frenzy around these collections subsided, speculators no longer found it advantageous to engage in such activity. As a result, both wash trading and overall trading volume declined. This trend was particularly evident for collections hosted on the Opensea platform(<em>Opensea collections</em>).</p>



<p>As speculators reduce their trading activity, it is expected that the prices of certain collections may take a hit. However, this period of lull in the NFT market actually fosters a healthier environment, paving the way for future prosperity.</p>



<p>In addition, the market slowdown is lowering barriers to entry, providing opportunities for genuine users and game developers to participate. With less speculative trading dominating the market, project teams can now focus on their project. This strategic shift allows them to lay the groundwork for a potential recovery in the next market cycle and attract long-term investors who value the sustainable growth and utility of NFT projects.</p>



<p>When it comes marketplaces, according to <a href="https://www.footprint.network/research/nft/nft-market/marketplaces?series_date=past30days" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest data</a>, Blur is currently the leading NFT marketplace with a monthly value share of around 60%. This is followed by OpenSea with around 20% and x2y2 with around 10%.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">NFT Investment &amp; Funding&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1>



<p>The total amount raised in May was $43.2 million, the highest since November 2022. However, there were only 7 funding rounds, which is a relatively low number.</p>

<p>In May, two significant NFT funding with the most amount are Pudgy Penguins and AlienSwap. Pudgy Penguins raised a $9 million seed round led by 1kx to build the next great IP company. And AlienSwap raised $12 million led by NEXT Leader Capital and C² Ventures to expand the AlienSwap engineering team.</p>

<p>The higher amounts invested in May are a positive signal of renewed optimism, despite a slowdown in actual market activity and participation. However, sustainability depends on broader success across more projects.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" style="font-size:32px">Hot Topics of the Month: Bitcoin Ordinals</h1>



<p>Ordinals are a unique category of NFTs that are based on the Bitcoin network. Ordinals have seen insane growth in the few months. A <a href="https://twitter.com/Footprint_Data/status/1664320477446406144?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter Space from Footprint Analytics</a> talked about this topic.</p>



<p>It begins on January 21, 2023, when programmer and crypto enthusiast Casey Rodarmor launched the Ordinals protocol on the Bitcoin network. The innovation allows for the minting of Bitcoin NFTs. Ordinals caused a high number of Bitcoin transactions in May.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ua6I69kEzXmY-jbhaf69UEEXSl7MMh70tkZ5QSTTQ9mjsQ0REG1CVEId0AHIScDAm-3pkGRZiV_Fk-YShrZbyZ71aj0NDCOIac4BefdnKTsmyuhj0bjstDE63bQRDTRfQyQsMF4mNm8wpOu3eElOItI" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ua6I69kEzXmY-jbhaf69UEEXSl7MMh70tkZ5QSTTQ9mjsQ0REG1CVEId0AHIScDAm-3pkGRZiV_Fk-YShrZbyZ71aj0NDCOIac4BefdnKTsmyuhj0bjstDE63bQRDTRfQyQsMF4mNm8wpOu3eElOItI" alt="NFT Monthly Report: The Rise and Fall of the Market in May" title="NFT Monthly Report: The Rise and Fall of the Market in May 27"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><a href="https://www.footprint.network/@8hwYRTm1E3/Bitcoin-Chain-Analysis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Bitcoin Daily Transaction Fees</em></a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>They introduce a new dimension to digital collectibles and asset ownership by allowing users to add arbitrary data to a Bitcoin transaction and tie that data to an individual satoshi, creating a unique asset known as an ordinal. For now, it has minted over 10 million according to Footprint data.</p>



<p>The Ordinals protocol is still in its infancy, with lightweight wallet applications, NFT trading markets, and other &#8220;infrastructure&#8221; yet to be built. People still expect the future and further expansion of the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Security, transparency and trust are the core tenets of OKX&#8217;s operating philosophy. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re committed to operating with complete transparency and providing regular PoR audits that users can independently verify. We hope that our efforts will raise the overall standard of the digital asset industry and establish new benchmarks for transparency and security.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Proof of reserves (PoR) is the process of confirming that the customer assets held by a cryptocurrency exchange or financial institution match the number of assets kept in reserve on the customers&#8217; behalf. PoR has been widely publicized as the major method for crypto investors to ensure that their assets are properly safeguarded. It&#8217;s also a crucial tool for crypto platforms since it allows them to demonstrate that they have enough assets to support transactions and withdrawals.</p>



<p>The bankruptcy of FTX and the dissolution of Three Arrows Capital both stunned the cryptocurrency sector. They called into doubt the dependability and integrity of cryptocurrency custodians.</p>



<p>A PoR audit shows that the company&#8217;s on-chain holdings are equal to the client assets recorded on the balance sheet, reassuring consumers that the business is viable and liquid enough to continue doing business with them.</p>

<p>PoR is often carried out by a third-party auditor who examines a trading platform&#8217;s assets and liabilities. The auditors want to validate the exchange&#8217;s assertions and will then publish the findings for public consumption. This theory assumes that the exchange&#8217;s digital assets kept in custody for users are backed up 1:1 by exchange-owned reserves.</p>



<p>At the moment, OKX&#8217;s PoR system has been improved using zk-STARK and other cutting-edge technology, and users may independently check OKX&#8217;s solvency at any time.</p>

<p>The transaction occurred approximately 11 hours ago, catching the attention of the crypto community.</p>

<p>The whales not only withdrew $PEPE but also executed several trades involving other cryptocurrencies. The whale sold 97,735 $LINK tokens, valued at around $592,000, and 9,883 $BNB tokens, amounting to approximately $3.01 million. These sales resulted in a loss of approximately $342,000 for the whale.</p>

<p>Following the sale of $LINK and $BNB, the whale made a strategic move by swapping all their positions for 1.93 trillion $PEPE tokens and 227 $ETH tokens, valued at around $424,000. This swap represents a significant shift in the whale&#8217;s portfolio and suggests their interest in diversifying holdings and exploring alternative investments.</p>



<p>Such large-scale transactions by whales often attract attention due to their potential impact on the market. However, it is important to note that individual transactions can be influenced by various factors, including personal investment strategies, market conditions, and the whale&#8217;s risk tolerance.</p>

<p>The move to acquire a significant amount of $PEPE tokens suggests that the whale sees potential in this particular cryptocurrency. The decision to swap other positions for $PEPE and $ETH indicates a calculated investment strategy, although it comes with certain risks.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Themis Protocol was hacked, and its lending function was disabled.</em></li>



<li><em>The attacker drained around $368,000 by exploiting a faulty oracle and using Stargate Finance for fund conversion.</em></li>



<li><em>Recovery efforts and a compensation scheme are underway.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Themis Protocol reported that it had been hacked and that its lending function had been disabled.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2044.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="539" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2044.png" alt="Themis Protocol $370,000 Damage Due To Flashloan Attack" class="wp-image-198371" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2044.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2044-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2044-768x404.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2044-750x395.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Themis Protocol $370,000 Damage Due To Flashloan Attack 34"></a></figure></div>


<p>Themis Protocol is a lending platform that has had an agonizing deployment, with consumers having to wait even longer for the platform to become operational after enduring multiphased airdrops but no useable product. On June 16, the project officially went into beta on Arbitrum, an Ethereum layer 2 platform.</p>



<p>On June 27, just eleven days later, the team announced that the project had expanded to over $1 million TVL in two working days. They <a href="https://twitter.com/ThemisProtocol/status/1673806486299099137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declared</a> an hour later that they would pause the procedure and launch an emergency investigation into a suspected flashloan attack. In its literature, Themis states that &#8220;security is the highest priority&#8221; of the project and references many PeckShield audits.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="542" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045-1024x542.png" alt="Themis Protocol $370,000 Damage Due To Flashloan Attack" class="wp-image-198372" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045-1024x542.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045-300x159.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045-768x406.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045-750x397.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045-1140x603.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045.png 1334w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Themis Protocol $370,000 Damage Due To Flashloan Attack 35"></a></figure></div>


<p>The protocol will initially attempt to work with the hacker to recover the monies. If the hacker refuses to comply, it will work with authorities to fix the situation. A compensation scheme is being prepared at the moment.</p>



<p>According to PeckShield monitoring, an attacker seems to have been able to compromise the project, draining around 220 Themis-wrapped ETH (approximately $417,000). Due to liquidity concerns, they were only able to exchange these for around 94 ETH ($178,000) and over $190,000 in stablecoins, for a total haul of approximately $368,000. According to PeckShield, the flashloan attack was caused by a faulty oracle, and the stolen monies were channeled via Stargate Finance.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>US presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.) reaffirmed that if elected President of the United States would guarantee the inviolability of using and owning Bitcoin.</em></li>



<li><em>He said he would ensure &#8220;we have policies that support Bitcoin and free transactions.&#8221;</em></li>



<li><em>Another candidate is Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, who has also vowed to &#8220;defend&#8221; Bitcoin during his presidential campaign.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bright US presidential candidate <a href="https://coincu.com/197325-presidential-candidate-rfk-jr-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert F.

<p>Bitcoin is not only a bulwark against totalitarianism and manipulating the money supply but also points the way to a more transparent and democratic future of government institutions.&#8221;</p>



<p>An article by RFK Jr. was shared by Michael Saylor, co-founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy &#8220;The next President will be a pro-Bitcoin President.&#8221;</p>



<p>Since running for this candidate, there have always been pro-Bitcoin statements. Before this news on June 23, Robert Kennedy Jr. said in an interview that he would ensure that policies support Bitcoin and freedom of transactions.</p>



<p>Up to now, the list of US Presidential candidates has seen four people with views in favor of Bitcoin and crypto in general.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="880" height="400" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2040.png" alt="RFK Jr. Guaranteed Right To Hold And Use Bitcoin If Elected " class="wp-image-198361" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2040.png 880w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2040-300x136.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2040-768x349.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2040-750x341.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" title="RFK Jr. Guaranteed Right To Hold And Use Bitcoin If Elected 38"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The first is <a href="https://coincu.com/179391-florida-governor-says-fed-made-digital-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ron DeSantis</a>, the governor of Florida. He has vowed to &#8220;defend&#8221; Bitcoin during his presidential campaign. He also proposed allowing businesses to pay state fees in cryptocurrency. In addition, he is an anti-Central Bank CBDC and has enacted legislation banning the use of CBDCs by federal and foreign governments.</p>



<p>The second is Mr. RFK Jr., as mentioned above. Third is Vivek Ramaswamy, the founder of the pharmaceutical company, who has also announced his support for cryptocurrency and said he would accept campaign donations in Bitcoin. And recently, a fourth name has also appeared, Francis X. Suarez, mayor of Miami. He is best known as the &#8220;Bitcoin Mayor&#8221;.</p>



<p>This new industry requires leaders to pay closer attention as needs such as identifying the potential and driving the development of crypto become increasingly apparent. Candidates like Mr. DeSantis could spark innovation and boost the economy, cementing America&#8217;s lead in the market.</p>



<p>Candidates DeSantis and RFK Jr. have a favorable view of crypto regardless of political views. As the presidential race draws closer, crypto&#8217;s role will certainly increasingly influence candidates&#8217; backgrounds. At that time, American citizens must consider the truth before voting for any candidate to develop the crypto market to its potential.</p>
