The move comes as more and more countries worldwide are seeking to de-dollarize.</strong></p>
<h2>Russia and 10 Southeast Asian Nations Explore National Currency Usage in Trade</h2>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov revealed his country&#8217;s efforts to settle trade with 10 Southeast Asian countries in national currencies in an interview with Indonesian national newspaper Kompas. The interview was published in English on Wednesday, with the aid of Microsoft Azure Open AI and Google Translation AI. ASEAN members comprise Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Lavrov explained that Russia does not see the current international situation as a &#8220;new cold war.&#8221; He emphasized that the country is focused on the development of a multipolar world order, noting that the West, led by the U.S., is actively trying to slow down and reverse this process. “Their goal is not to strengthen global security and engage in mutual development, but only to maintain their hegemony in world affairs and further carry out neo-colonial agendas. In short, nothing has changed, as usual, they solve their problems at the expense of others,” he opined.</p>
<p>“Western egocentrism that disregards the interests of Global South and East countries actually contributes to the search for alternative cooperation formats in all fields. Due to the confiscation of Russia&#8217;s foreign reserves in the U.S. and Europe, there is a growing understanding in the global community that no one is immune from the confiscation of tangible assets stored in Western jurisdiction,” Lavrov detailed, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Not only limited to Russia, several other countries are consistently reducing their dependence on the U.S. dollar, starting to switch to the use of alternative payment and calculation systems through national currencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>“At the same time, the effectiveness of interstate association, in which Western countries do not participate, is increasing,&#8221; the top Russian official described, giving the BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) as examples. The BRICS countries comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>The Russian diplomat emphasized Russia&#8217;s &#8220;constructive cooperation in the UN and other multilateral platforms on various urgent international issues,&#8221; adding that Russia is working closely with Indonesia this year as the chair of ASEAN.</p>

<p>Lavrov said that he plans to attend an upcoming ASEAN ministerial-level meeting in Jakarta. “We are giving special attention to the development of a strategic partnership with the association,” he stressed. “We have a history of relationships for more than three decades.”</p>
<p>The Russian official detailed that Russia is focusing its efforts on reinforcing the architecture established around ASEAN to foster stability and cooperation within the Asia-Pacific region, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The practical cooperation interests between Russia and ASEAN countries, including Indonesia, will be answered with the launch of consultations on the use of national currencies in mutual settlements.</p></blockquote>
<p>The 10 ASEAN member states have also intensified their own de-dollarization efforts. In May, they <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/10-southeast-asian-nations-challenge-dollar-dominance-with-push-for-local-currencies/">agreed</a> to &#8220;encourage the use of local currencies for economic and financial transactions among ASEAN member states.&#8221; Indonesia&#8217;s central bank governor said in April that his country is following the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indonesia-is-following-brics-de-dollarization-lead-says-central-bank-governor/">BRICS&#8217; de-dollarization lead</a> to shift away from the U.S. dollar. The country recently introduced a new <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indonesia-introducing-new-national-payment-system-to-protect-against-geopolitical-consequences/">national payment system</a> to further its de-dollarization efforts and protect against &#8220;possible geopolitical consequences.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Lawyer on Ruling of SEC v Ripple Case</h2>
<p>Lawyer Bryan Jacoutot shared his analysis of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-judge-rules-xrp-not-necessarily-a-security-on-its-face-sending-xrp-supporters-into-celebration/">ruling</a> in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) v. Ripple case on Twitter Thursday. Jacoutot is an attorney at Election Law Group and Taylor English Duma; his practice centers on general litigation and election law. He began:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#x2019;ve reviewed the district court ruling on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> and it rests on very shaky ground. Expect an appeal.</p></blockquote>
<p>He explained that the court did rule that Ripple&#x2019;s sale of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> to institutional investors amounted to an unlawful security sale. Noting that Ripple received nearly a billion dollars from these <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> sales, the lawyer predicted that the crypto firm &#x201C;will presumably be required to return/disgorge,&#x201D; as well as pay penalties and fines.</p>
<p>In addition, he noted: &#x201C;The court also found that, in the context of the &#x2018;programmatic sale&#x2019; of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> to random people, that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> DID NOT constitute an investment contract under Howey. And thus <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ripples-chief-legal-officer-breaks-down-ruling-in-sec-lawsuit-says-as-a-matter-of-law-xrp-is-not-a-security/">it was not a security</a>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Stating that &#x201C;the court&#x2019;s reasoning is weak,&#x201D; Jacoutot opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>The court (IMO, incorrectly) relied on the fact buyers didn&#x2019;t know if the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> came from Ripple. But that doesn&#x2019;t matter under Howey, only whether they expected profit based on the efforts of Ripple, which I think one could clearly say buyers expected (how else does <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> moon?).</p></blockquote>

<h2>Implication of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> Ruling for Ethereum</h2>
<p>Drawing attention to Ethereum, the lawyer cautioned that the outcome of the SEC v. Ripple case &#x201C;does NOT clear the path for Ethereum Foundation even if it is upheld &#x2026; because of important distinctions in the methods used by Ripple to sell the &#x2018;pre-mine.'&#x201D; He highlighted the court&#x2019;s ruling regarding institutional buyers acquiring unregistered securities, emphasizing: &#x201D;The pre-sale of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> was ALOT like that.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Jacoutot explained that firstly, &#x201C;Everyone knew they were buying from Ethereum Foundation (which the Ripple Court found significant).&#x201D; Secondly, &#x201C;The <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> purchased during the pre-sale was subject to lockup period, which was significant in finding the institutional investors bought <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> as a security.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In conclusion, while emphasizing that he does not want to diminish the win for Ripple and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> supporters, the lawyer warned:</p>
<blockquote><p>It may be a short-lived victory. I think the judge got the law wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;But even if she didn&#x2019;t, many projects (including Ethereum) remain exposed. And the court left open many other vexing securities questions,&#x201D; he concluded.</p>

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong quickly addressed the issue, asking other users if they have encountered the same problem with Bank of America.</strong></p>
<h2>Coinbase&#x2019;s CEO Raises Concerns Over Account Closures at Bank of America</h2>
<p>Bank of America (BOFA) came under scrutiny on Wednesday when Muneeb Ali, co-founder of Stacks, a Bitcoin layer for smart contracts, revealed on Twitter that the bank unexpectedly closed his bank account, which he had been using for 15 years, without giving a reason. He strongly suspects that the closure was due to him using the bank account for bitcoin transactions through Coinbase. &#x201C;This is a war on bitcoin & crypto,&#x201D; he tweeted.</p>
<p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong responded to the tweet, asking if other Bank of America customers have encountered similar issues. &#x201C;If so, not ok,&#x201D; the Coinbase boss tweeted. He subsequently conducted a <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1679314875619897345">Twitter poll</a>, inquiring whether Bank of America had closed the accounts of any other individuals due to their transactions with his crypto exchange. The poll closed with 16,701 votes, 8.9% of which said yes while 19.3% said no.</p>

<p>Many people shared their personal experiences in reply to Armstrong&#x2019;s poll, with some stating that they hadn&#x2019;t encountered any issues. However, a notable portion revealed that their accounts had been closed or suspended by the bank following their Bitcoin transactions.</p>
<p>One Twitter user wrote: &#x201C;BOFA and Chase probably see <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> as an existential threat so they want to shadow ban/block the onramp and offramps to exchanges.&#x201D; Another wrote: &#x201C;They&#x2019;ve never closed my account over Coinbase transactions, but in the past (especially the year leading up to Covid), they would frequently call me, tell me my account activity looked suspicious, and inquire as to what the nature of my business with Coinbase was.&#x201D; A different user detailed: &#x201C;Both 5th/3rd Bank and Capital One have rejected deposits or sales with Coinbase. I eventually was able to arrange for ongoing deposits but they do not make it easy. They were &#x2018;protecting&#x2019; me.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This week, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/bank-of-america-for-illegally-charging-junk-fees-withholding-credit-card-rewards-opening-fake-accounts/">took action against Bank of America</a> for &#x201C;illegally charging junk fees, withholding credit card rewards, and opening fake accounts.&#x201D; The bank is ordered to pay more than $100 million to harmed consumers and $150 million in penalties to the two agencies.</p>

Ritchie Torres has called for an investigation into the special purpose broker-dealer (SPBD) license given by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to Prometheum, a cryptocurrency exchange platform. In two letters sent to U.S. Comptroller General Gene Dodaro and SEC Inspector General Deborah Jeffries, Torres calls for investigation of the &#8220;backroom deals&#8221; allegedly brokered between the SEC and Prometheum.</strong></p>
<h2>U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres Requests Investigation Into Prometheum&#8217;s License</h2>
<p>Ritchie Torres, a U.S. representative for New York, is <a href="https://twitter.com/RepRitchie/status/1679534903661301761?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requesting</a> an official investigation on the licenses the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave to Prometheum, a digital assets trading platform that Torres states &#8220;does not trade digital assets.&#8221;</p>
<p>On July 13, Torres sent two letters to U.S. Comptroller General Gene Dodaro and SEC Inspector General Deborah Jeffrey to request an independent review of the failure of the SEC to provide a workable path for crypto exchanges to register, and also on the alleged &#8220;backroom deals&#8221; that the agency brokered with Prometheum.</p>
<p>Rep. Torres slammed Prometheum, referring to it as a Potemkin platform used by the commission as a &#8220;talking point for crypto critics&#8221; instead of a trading platform for crypto customers.</p>

<h2>SEC Chair Gary Gensler Accused of Politicizing Agency Processes</h2>
<p>In the letters, Torres refers to SEC Chair Gary Gensler by name, stating that granting a license to Prometheum is his latest attempt to &#8220;politicize the registration process to an extent seldom seen in the SEC&#8217;s history.&#8221; Prometheum came into the spotlight in June when its co-CEO Aaron Kaplan testified at a congressional hearing that there was a path for registering a digital assets exchange with the commission and that crypto companies were &#8220;simply not willing to comply.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Adam Cochran, a partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, revealed that Prometheum executives had links with federal agencies and financial companies such as the SEC, FINRA, NYSE, and CBOE, giving origin to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/prometheum-testimony-raises-doubts-crypto-community-questions-credibility-amid-regulatory-clarity-hearing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speculations</a> about the approval of its special purpose broker-dealer (SPBD) license.</p>
<p>Torres criticized the SEC&#8217;s behavior in the digital assets arena, declaring that the regulator was like an &#8220;overzealous traffic agent who arbitrarily tickets drivers for speeding while keeping everyone endlessly guessing about the speeding limit.&#8221;</p>
<p>He concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regulation by enforcement is no way to regulate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On July 10, U.S. Senator Thomas Tuberville and a group of senators sent a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senator-expresses-concern-over-prometheum-co-ceos-congressional-testimony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter</a> to SEC Chair Gary Gensler and U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland to alert them about the ties that Prometheum could have with Chinese Communist Party (CCP) linked companies and its possible false testimony given to the Congress.</p>

<h2>Fraud Charges Lead to $40 Million Bail Bond for Former Celsius CEO Mashinsky</h2>
<p>Alexander Mashinsky, founder and former CEO of Celsius, was arrested and charged with fraud Thursday in New York. Mashinsky&#8217;s legal team said he vehemently denies the allegations and described the charges as unfounded. &#8220;[Mashinsky] vehemently denies the allegations brought today,” attorney Jonathan Ohring <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/07/13/cryptocurrency-celsius-mashinsky-arrest/a95c9ece-218f-11ee-8994-4b2d0b694a34_story.html">said</a> in an email to The Washington Post.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">U.S. Attorney Damian Williams on today&#39;s indictment against Alexander Mashinsky and Roni Cohen-Pavon: “Exactly one year ago today, Celsius Network, a crypto platform that, at its height, managed approximately $25 billion in customer assets, filed for bankruptcy protection 1/6</p>
<p>&mdash; US Attorney SDNY (@SDNYnews) <a href="https://twitter.com/SDNYnews/status/1679530873400565760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Mashinsky&#8217;s <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.601957/gov.uscourts.nysd.601957.5.0.pdf">bail</a> was set at $40 million, and he is restricted from leaving the Southern District of New York, according to his bail agreement. Mashinsky lives in Manhattan with his wife, who co-signed his bail agreement along with an unknown co-signer. In addition to travel restrictions, the Celsius founder is prohibited from opening a bank account or trading crypto assets.</p>
<p>His bond was secured by funds in his bank account and his Manhattan residence. Mashinsky&#8217;s arrest occurred before the CFTC, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-sues-bankrupt-crypto-lender-celsius-alleges-misrepresentation-of-customer-count-and-risky-practices/">SEC</a>, and FTC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftc-slaps-crypto-lender-celsius-with-4-7b-fine-for-deceiving-consumers-and-mismanaging-deposits/">filed</a> charges against Celsius, its related companies and three former executives, including Mashinsky.</p>
<p>The indictment against the former CEO of Celsius <a href="https://twitter.com/SDNYnews/status/1679530873400565760?s=20">alleges</a> that from 2018 to 2022, Mashinsky and Celsius misled investors. It accuses Mashinsky of manipulating the market of the Celsius Network&#8217;s CEL token and committing fraud.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s charges against Celsius and Mashinsky assert investors were sold unregistered securities through fraudulent, unregistered offerings. Ohring, Mashinsky&#8217;s lawyer, called the accusations &#8220;baseless&#8221; and emphasized Mashinsky&#8217;s eagerness to defend himself in court.</p>

The majority of this growth transpired after the decisive Ripple Labs case verdict, resulting in bitcoin&#x2019;s dominance dipping from 50% to its present level of 48.6%.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Ripple Labs Case Verdict Triggers $60 Billion Crypto Market Expansion</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The partial summary judgment within the Ripple lawsuit propelled the digital asset <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> to a 60%+ increase within a single day. Consequently, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>&#x2019;s substantial gains triggered a surge in numerous altcoins&#x2019; values. For example, Stellar (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" target="_blank">XLM</a>) saw an increase of over 40%, while <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a> leaped more than 20% in the past day. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230712140022/https://coinmarketcap.com/">Archived data</a> retrieved from coinmarketcap.com (CMC) on July 12, 2023, exhibited Bitcoin&#x2019;s dominance at 50% in relation to the $1.19 trillion crypto economy.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Currently, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> dominance has diminished to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com">48.6%</a> due to significant returns in the altcoin arena overshadowing its market presence. Just two days ago, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> ranked as the sixth largest market capitalization among multiple crypto assets; however, it now boasts the fourth-largest position. While <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> experienced a 70% increase within 24 hours, its impressive ascent propelled its monthly gains above 50%.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>, other notable crypto gainers over the past day include <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" target="_blank">XLM</a>, SNX, LDO, SOL, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>, INJ, NEAR, AVAX, PEPE, APE, and OP. Archived data from CMC on July 12 further reveals that during the previous two-day period, the cryptocurrency market swelled by $60 billion.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Furthermore, global trade volume skyrocketed from $29.32 billion to today&#x2019;s staggering $73.46 billion &#x2014; proving that in just one day, worldwide trade volume in cryptocurrencies soared by an incredible 160%. The top three digital assets concerning global trade volume consist of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />

On Thursday, U.S. judge Analisa Torres ruled that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> is not &#x201C;necessarily a security on its face.&#x201D; Solana also surged on the news, climbing by nearly 30%. </strong>&#13;</p>
<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, formerly ripple, was undoubtedly one of the biggest movers in the market on Friday, surging by nearly 70%.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a low of $0.4728 on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.8875 during today&#x2019;s session.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Traders continued to long for the token as exchanges like <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-other-crypto-exchanges-relist-xrp-following-ruling-in-sec-v-ripple-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase and Kraken</a> moved to relist <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> on their platform.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Overall, this rally has pushed <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> to its strongest point since Christmas day of 2021, when price peaked at $0.9975.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
From the chart, the move began after the relative strength index (RSI) moved past a ceiling at 75.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The index went on to reach a high of 88.00, however as traders have begun to secure gains, price strength is now at 80.59.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, solana (SOL) also soared higher in today&#x2019;s session, rising by nearly 30% in the process.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
SOL/USD moved to a peak of $30.06 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after the price was at a low of $22.23.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As a result of this, solana hit its highest level since last November, following a breakout of a ceiling at $26.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The token is now trading at $27.78, which appears to be a result of profit takers closing previous positions.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Additionally, the RSI is deep in overbought territory, which will likely tempt further short selling in the coming days.&#13;<br />

The situation escalated when user assets began to be transferred to unknown addresses.</strong></p>
<h2>From Seizure to Shutdown: The Multichain Saga</h2>
<p>According to the Multichain team’s <a href="https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1679768407628185600?s=20">testimony</a>, the first wave of shock for the Multichain community came on May 21, 2023, when CEO Zhaojun was apprehended by Chinese police. This news left the global team in disarray as they discovered their operational access keys to the Multichain Processing Component (MPC) node servers had been revoked. Complicating matters further was the realization that these servers were managed under Zhaojun&#8217;s personal cloud server account, to which no one else had access.</p>
<p>The situation continued to spiral when the team made contact with Zhaojun&#8217;s family. All of Zhaojun&#8217;s devices, hardware wallets, and mnemonic phrases had been confiscated, along with the control of all operational funds and investments. The severity of the situation hit home as it became clear that all the team&#8217;s funds and access to servers were in the hands of Zhaojun and, now, China’s police.</p>
<p>With scarce information on Zhaojun&#8217;s case, the team was left in a precarious position, trying to maintain operations through the limited access they had left. Adhering to local laws and the family&#8217;s wishes, the team chose to withhold information from the public for days. Still, by May 30, they took the responsible step of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mysterious-disappearance-of-multichain-ceo-sends-shockwaves-through-crypto-community/">informing the community</a> about Zhaojun&#8217;s disappearance and the ensuing technical issues.</p>
<p>The beginning of June saw a ray of hope when Zhaojun&#8217;s family managed to log into the cloud server platform, albeit with restrictions on the engineers&#8217; access. With the family and their lawyer in constant communication with the authorities, the team was assured of Zhaojun&#8217;s imminent release. They were urged to continue maintaining the system, but the information about the case details remained scant.</p>
<p>The Multichain protocol, however, continued to function as designed, at least according to the team&#8217;s account of the situation. Even with limited resources, the team claimed it worked tirelessly to keep operations running smoothly and resolve user issues that continued to mount. This period of uncertainty also saw an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/multichain-woes-users-informed-of-an-abnormal-transfer-of-assets-to-unknown-address/">abnormal transfer of user assets</a> locked on the MPC addresses to unknown destinations, raising more questions about the system&#8217;s integrity.</p>
<p>Furthering the state of crisis, Zhaojun&#8217;s sister transferred the remaining assets in the router pool to her own control on July 9. While she kept the team and project parties informed, this asset preservation action added another layer of complexity to an already bewildering situation. Unknown to them, this was a harbinger of the next wave of shock.</p>
<p>On July 13, Zhaojun&#8217;s sister was taken into custody by the police, cutting off yet another point of contact. The team was left in the dark about the status of the preserved assets, leading them to inform the community about the deteriorating situation. With no alternative information sources or operational funds, they were left with no choice but to cease operations.</p>
<p>The Multichain saga underscores the fragility of centralized operational practices in projects advocating for decentralization. The team, now left without access to their domain account, urges users not to use Multichain services and seeks assistance from the domain firm Godaddy to bring down the platform. As the dust settles, this incident serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks in the crypto-sphere and the need for robust security measures.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) was on the cusp of hitting $32,000 in the past 24 hours, following the news that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> was not necessarily classified as a security by a U.S. judge.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD peaked at $31,814.51 late on Thursday, after trading at a low of $30,486.69 earlier in the day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Yesterday&#x2019;s peak is the strongest point bitcoin has hit since late-May last year, which is the last time price was over $32,000.&#13;<br />

Overall, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has since declined, as traders move to secure gains, resulting in the price now trading at $31,208.15.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This comes as the relative strength index (RSI) failed to break a ceiling of 66.00, and is now tracking at 62.62.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Today&#x2019;s move also averted a downward crossover between the 10-day (red) moving average, and its 25-day (blue) counterpart.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Ethereum</h2>

Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was another big mover, surging above $2,000 in today&#x2019;s session, which came as a result of the Ripple news.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a low of $1,878.81 on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD jumped to an intraday high of $2,026.20 earlier in the day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As a result of the rally, the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency recorded its strongest level since April 19.&#13;</p>

A downward crossover of moving averages also failed to materialize, with momentum now back in the hands of bulls.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
However, similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, ethereum&#x2019;s RSI failed to break out of a ceiling at 65.00, with the index now at a reading of 63.02.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
At the time of writing, ethereum is trading at $1,991.99.&#13;<br />
