<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/comcast-q4-2022/">Comcast Surpasses Q4 2022 Expectations amid Broadband Growth Slowdown</a></p>
<p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/comcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Comcast Corporation </a>(NASDAQ: CMCSA) reported its <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230126005084/en/Comcast-Reports-4th-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2022-Results" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Q4 2022 earnings</a>, which beat expectations amid a slowdown in broadband growth. Comcast&#8217;s fourth-quarter performance surpassed the consensus estimate despite mounting losses from its Peacock streaming service. The Philadelphia-based multinational telecoms giant&#8217;s top-line growth received a boost from the higher revenue of its broadband and wireless businesses. In addition, Comcast&#8217;s quarterly revenue intake was also spurred by the company&#8217;s theme parks segment.</p>
<h2>Comcast Q4 2022 Performance Assessment</h2>
<p>For Q4 2022, Comcast recorded a revenue haul of $30.55 billion compared to the $30.32 billion that analysts expected. Furthermore, the company&#8217;s earnings per share for the period ended December 31st came in at 82 cents, adjusted versus 77 cents expected.</p>
<p>Comcast said its Q4 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization slipped approximately 5% to $8 billion year-over-year. The primary causative factor for this slippage was as a result of higher severance expenses.</p>
<p>Comcast also said it lost 26,000 total broadband customers during the fourth quarter of last year. This subscriber base loss came from the service interruption impact of Hurricane Ian, which struck South Carolina and Florida last September. According to Comcast, it would have added 4,000 net subscribers if not for the hurricane&#8217;s impact. Nonetheless, all indicators point to the fact that cable broadband subscriber growth is waning compared to the early pandemic era.</p>
<p>This subscriber growth slowdown is impacting the flagship businesses of cable platforms such as Comcast and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/charter-communications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charter Communications</a> (NASDAQ: CHTR). Furthermore, several cable companies now face heightened competition from telecom brands and wireless providers.</p>
<p>Cable companies also attribute their recent customer base drop-off to the US housing market slowdown. These companies allege that the declining rate of moving between homes is also to blame for the lack of new customers. However, despite this unsavory development, Comcast&#8217;s broadband subscriber base remains relatively stable. Revenue for the previously mentioned segment climbed nearly 6% during the last quarter, partly due to a price hike.</p>
<h2>Mobile Customer Growth</h2>
<p>Comcast&#8217;s Xfinity Mobile grew by 365,000 new entries in the fourth quarter of 2022. As it stands, the platform now has a total wireless customer count of more than 5.3 million. Furthermore, it is worth noting that mobile customer growth has remained consistent for cable providers since they first ventured into the business. Conversely, the cable-TV industry lost 440,000 subscribers during the fourth quarter as consumers shifted towards streaming services.</p>
<h2>Peacock</h2>
<p>Comcast&#8217;s over-the-top video streaming service, Peacock, surpassed 20 million subscribers for the period. However, the streamer&#8217;s higher losses bore down hard on operator NBCUniversal&#8217;s earnings.</p>
<p>NBCUniversal experienced a revenue increase of roughly 6% to arrive at $9.9 billion during Q4. This development benefited immensely from revenue from the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. The tournament&#8217;s proceedings aired on NBCUniversal&#8217;s Spanish-language Telemundo TV network and Peacock.</p>
<p>NBCUniversal also accrued a 12% revenue increase to $2.1 billion for the quarter. This commendable development came about due to higher attendance and customer spending at US and Japan-based locations.</p>

<p>American crypto exchange Coinbase plans to protest a weighty fine imposed by the Dutch central bank over "non-compliance" violations. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-3-6m-dutch-fine-services/">Coinbase Incurs $3.6M Dutch Fine for Providing Unregistered Crypto Services</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> (NASDAQ: COIN) has received a $3.6 million fine from the <a href="https://www.dnb.nl/en/general-news/news-2023/dnb-imposes-administrative-fine-on-coinbase-europe-limited-for-providing-crypto-services-without-the-legally-required-registration-until-22-september-2022/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Dutch central bank</a> for offering unregistered crypto services to customers in the country. According to the Dutch apex bank, Coinbase&#8217;s Europe arm provided the crypto services without the legally required registration until late September 2022. The governing bank cited Dutch law, which requires that crypto providers register under anti-money laundering and terrorist financing norms.</p>
<p>The De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) described the Coinbase fine as administrative and said it increased the base amount due to severity. In addition, the Dutch central bank said that Coinbase&#8217;s &#8220;degree of culpability of the non-compliance&#8221; warranted an increased fine. The DNB said it considered the crypto exchange&#8217;s Dutch customer base and competitive advantage gained from not paying supervisory fees. Lastly, the apex bank thought Coinbase&#8217;s non-compliance to be very severe because it persisted over a prolonged period – approximately two years.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Objects to DNB Dutch Fine</h2>
<p>However, Coinbase, which eventually obtained its registration on September 22nd, 2022, disagrees with the DNB&#8217;s enforcement order. The leading American crypto exchange also intimated that it is &#8220;carefully considering the objections and appeals process.&#8221; As it stands, Coinbase has until March 2nd to object to the DNB&#8217;s administrative fine. A company spokesperson pointed out Coinbase&#8217;s commitment to abiding by jurisdictive rules. The spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p> &#8220;Coinbase is committed to compliance in all jurisdictions in which it operates and will continue to provide safe, trusted services to new and existing Dutch customers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The spokesperson also added, &#8220;We should not be penalized for playing by the rules and engaging in this process.&#8221; According to the Coinbase media representative, the order &#8220;is based on the time it took for Coinbase to obtain our registration in the Netherlands.&#8221; Therefore, this order does not include any criticism of the exchange&#8217;s actual services.</p>
<p>Although the DNB&#8217;s fine on Coinbase remains relatively weighty, the Dutch apex bank did remove 5% from the original amount. The reported reason for the marginal reduction is that Coinbase had always intended to obtain registration with the Dutch governing bank.</p>
<p>Coinbase allegedly operated while unregistered between November 15th, 2020, and August 24th, 2022.</p>
<h2>Binance 2022 &#8220;Non-Compliance&#8221; Fine</h2>
<p>Last summer, the Dutch apex bank also <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/dutch-central-bank-3m-fine-binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imposed a similar fine</a> on <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> for offering unregistered services in the Netherlands. The DNB demanded that the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange pay a $3.35 million penalty for the &#8220;serious violations.&#8221; According to the Dutch regulator, Binance violated its registration rules from May 21st, 2020, until at least December 1st, 2021.</p>
<p>Binance&#8217;s fine development with the DNB last year came the following month after the exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-approval-france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secured licensing with France </a>and Italy. The European powerhouse nations licensed the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/changpeng-zhao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Changpeng Zhao</a>-led organization as an official digital asset provider.</p>
<p>At the time, Zhao lauded the development and described France&#8217;s attitude toward the crypto industry as &#8220;phenomenal.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/apple-netflix-meta-ftx-saga/">Apple, Netflix, Meta, and Many Others Caught Up in FTX Saga</a></p>
<p>As the FTX saga continues unraveling, more revelations are coming to the fore about the bankrupt exchange. In one of the latest developments, a court document has revealed the complete list of FTX creditors. Surprisingly, they are not all tech firms.</p>
<p>According to a creditor matrix <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-DocketInfo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">filed</a> by <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> lawyers late Wednesday night, the firm&#8217;s creditors range from tech companies to hoteliers, airlines, and even government-owned entities.</p>
<h2>FTX Saga: Creditors</h2>
<p>In the 115-page document, FTX mentioned top tech giants like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/apple-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta</a>, LinkedIn, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>, and many more. It also listed some notable crypto and Web 3.0-based firms. They include <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Circle</a>, Yuga Labs,  <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a>, Sky Mavis, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/chainalysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chainalysis</a>, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/galaxy-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galaxy Digital</a>, Yuga Labs, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/bittrex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bittrex</a>, Messari, and some subsidiaries of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a>.</p>
<p>FTX also owes money to several media firms including The Wall Street Journal, CoinDesk, and The New York Times among others. Some of the government entities it owes include the federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States, and some foreign government agencies in places such as Hong Kong and Australia among others.</p>
<p>Interestingly, however, the list only details its institutional creditors and doesn&#8217;t reveal the exact amount FTX owes each one of them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the firm did not specify the details of its individual customers in the document. However, that might simply be for the sake of publication since they are nearly 9.7 million in number.</p>
<h2>How The Mighty Fell</h2>
<p>Without a doubt, FTX was once a dominant force in the crypto league. However, things never quite remained the same after a bank run on the exchange led it to admit customer assets were not fully backed as it previously claimed. The once-glorified firm finally crumbled in November,  eventually <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftx-exchange-files-for-bankruptcy/">filing</a> for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in December, a former employee of the bankrupt business publicly revealed what may have been the cause of FTX&#8217;s downfall. In a long Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/daniiicloud/status/1602678181064069122?t=QTLDsryDYceu4ln_-3ickg&amp;s=19">thread</a>, the ex-employee said that the business engaged in “moronically inefficient” luxury expenditures. And somehow, the recent list of creditors may be pointing out that the employee was right all along.</p>
<p>There were glimpses of excessive expenditures on the list that included the names of multiple luxury hotels around the world, Airbnb, Uber Eats, and so on.</p>
<p>Although the company’s founder, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/sam-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, has since been arrested and charged on eight counts,  the bankruptcy process of FTX is proving to be a very complicated one.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-bitcoin-crypto-slump/">Tesla Holds Onto Its Bitcoin Holdings despite Crypto Slump</a></p>
<p>While Tesla&#8217;s Bitcoin investments are still submerged, the company&#8217;s overall earnings and revenue have exceeded expectations. TSLA stock is surging today and has increased by thirteen percent over the past five days. Shares of the firm also rose when Chief Executive Officer <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a> announced that the firm could possibly deliver two million Tesla this year. It has been <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/01/25/tesla-did-not-buy-or-sell-any-bitcoin-in-the-fourth-quarter/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> that Tesla did not sell the excess <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> reserve, though it was expected that it would sell part of its crypto holdings during the fourth quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>According to a filing revealed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>), Tesla&#8217;s BTC holdings should be placed at around $245 million which would be the remaining twenty-five percent of all the Bitcoin bought by the firm during the crypto bull run of 2021.</p>
<p>Even after the crypto market collapse and gloomy news that drowned the crypto environment, Tesla has been holding onto the crypto capital, according to its Q4 and FY 2022 Updates.</p>
<p>Initially, in the first quarter of 2021, Tesla bought 43,200 BTC for $1.5 Billion. The company grabbed onto its bitcoins for more than a year despite the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to many firings and the end of several US firms. In July, last year, however, the company revealed that it had to sell seventy-five percent of its Bitcoin for $936 million, owing to the increase in the firm&#8217;s production costs in China, which had skyrocketed to unceremonious levels with the onset of another wave of coronavirus. Musk, at that time, had asserted that the firm would be open-minded about increasing the number of Bitcoin holdings in the future.</p>
<p>The business tycoon had also clarified in March 2022 that he had no plans to sell his personal bitcoins any time soon.</p>
<p>Tesla is known for its love of Bitcoins. It was one of the first companies to invest in massive amounts of Bitcoin, and its initial purchase propelled the BTC&#8217;s bullish rally, leading it from $20,000 to about $70,000. However, it eventually reduced its involvement in the BTC game due to the token&#8217;s energy consumption concerns. Soon after, Bitcoin dropped from $55K to $52K in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>The total revenue generated by Tesla is around $24.32 billion, which is 200 million more than the estimated value of $24.16 billion. Earnings per share touched $1.19 in contrast to the expected $1.13. Even though the firm acknowledged that the mean sales price took a downturn, it was balanced by the affordable rates offered for the EVs to sell to a larger population.</p>
<p>Musk, one of the most popular cryptocurrency influencers globally, has been very loud about his support for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/dogecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dogecoin</a>. The firm is probably halting to find the best time to make a move. Having said that, it is also possible that they are conveniently holding onto their Bitcoin stockpile for long-term investment.</p>

<p>The Decentralized Exchange (DEX) platform, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-sushiswap-sushi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SushiSwap</a> (SUSHI) is expanding its footprint in the blockchain ecosystem as it is reportedly set to launch a new Perpetual contract futures exchange on the Sei Network. As <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/205749/sushiswap-to-launch-a-perp-dex-on-sei-network-head-chef-says" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> by The Block, citing SushiSwap’s Head Chef, Jared Grey, the move to launch the new trading engine on the Sei Network is a calculated effort to expand its footprint beyond the confines of the Ethereum Blockchain.</p>
<p>SushiSwap was one of the first DEXs to make its way into the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decentralized Finance</a> (DeFi) ecosystem. Its existence was initially marred by the rug pull of its founder, Chef Nomi and at the time, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) came to the rescue of the exchange by taking over its management.</p>
<p>Over the years, the trading platform and its ecosystem have stabilized, and though its native token SUSHI is no longer tagging along with its top competitors including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/uniswap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uniswap</a> (UNI) and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-pancakeswap-cake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PancakeSwap</a> (CAKE), it is still one of the most revered digital tokens around today.</p>
<p>According to Jared, the agreement or contract to launch the new exchange had already been signed by SushiSwap and Sei Network about a week ago.</p>
<p>“It’s a new play for us,” Grey said at Quantum Miami, adding that a contract had been signed earlier in the week. “We’re working hand-in-hand with them on what developer resources need to be allocated from their side for Sushi to leverage what they’ve built so that we can provide value, as a brand, back to them.”</p>
<p>The choice of the Sei Network is not far-fetched. It is a Cosmos-based protocol that is designed for developers to create new specific trading applications with massive bandwidth. According to Grey, the Sei Network is “focused on having an order book and matching engine in their consensus layer, and they want to focus solely on that vertical, and I think that makes a lot of sense.”</p>
<h2>SushiSwap Launch into Sei Network: a Mutually Beneficial Linkup</h2>
<p>It is not uncommon to find progressive partnerships between startups in the Web 3.0 ecosystem. In the case of SushiSwap and the Sei Network, the benefit for both firms is quite clear and besides growing its influence, the former will use the partnership to generate a new revenue stream for the protocol.</p>
<p>In addition, the new trading engine will be beneficial in its plans to revamp the tokenization of the SUSHI native token, a move it believes will help redirect value to the digital currency. For Sei Network, SushiSwap is a known and trusted name in the decentralized finance ecosystem, and having the protocol on board will be a good way to expand its reach across the board.</p>
<p>There is no definitive time that the perpetual futures exchange will be launched, however, the synergy of efforts from both protocols will be required to beat the current liquidity strain that was brought in by the crypto winter.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-back-above-23000-altcoins-rally/">Bitcoin Back Above $23,000 Once Again, Altcoins Support Rally</a></p>
<p>The world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) continues to see more buying interest as the BTC price spikes above $23,000 once again, some altcoins follow this tendency. As of press time, BTC is trading 1.4% up at a price of $23,050 and a market cap of $443 billion.</p>
<p>CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju noted that Bitcoin has entered an early bull phase. As per on-chain PnL-related indicators such as MVRV ratio, most investors are still underwater. Ju believes that the selling pressure is unlikely to resume since no one would want to sell at these levels at a loss.</p>
<p>He also added that BTC whales have been holding their supplies strongly even during the current price pump. Commenting on the latest report by CryptoQuant, the CEO noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ofc, Bitcoin still has contagion &amp; macro risks, and we may see more bankruptcies, M&amp;As, and capitulations in the next few months. But, from on-chain perspective, $BTC whales haven&#8217;t moved Bitcoins despite the recent price surge. The market might have yet to reach its target&#8221;.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Altcoins Take the Charge of the Broader Market Rally amid Bitcoin Growth</h2>
<p>In addition to Bitcoin, the latest pump in the crypto space has been largely supported by a bigger rally in the altcoin space. The world&#8217;s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH</a>) is up by 3.44% in the last 24 hours with its price shooting once again above $1,600 levels.</p>
<p>APT, the native token of Aptos, has registered one of the biggest <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/aptos-apt-l1-blockchain-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gains</a> jumping by 46% in the last 24 hours. At $19.3, the APT token is currently trading at its all-time high level. The APT token has registered an impressive rally over the last month gaining by nearly 500%.</p>
<p>As per blockchain analytics firm Kaiko there&#8217;s been a huge whale interest in Aptos. The blockchain analytics firm reported that all the larger whale addresses of $250,000 or more all of them executed on <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a>. Furthermore, the blockchain analytics firm noted that the APT token could see institutional demand on Coinbase where its “volume of bids is now nearly double the volume of asks.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Whales love <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24APTOS&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$APTOS</a> 🐳</p>
<p>In the last two weeks, orders larger than $250k – all of which were executed on Binance – have been skewed heavily towards buys: $2.8mn to $0.87mn.</p>
<p>However, in the past two days large trades have begun to swing towards sells.</p>
<p>1/5 <a href="https://t.co/uwzLMURQPe">pic.twitter.com/uwzLMURQPe</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Kaiko (@KaikoData) <a href="https://twitter.com/KaikoData/status/1618329455080148993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Furthermore, Binance Research also reported that the interest in Aptos NFTs is increasing. “NFT investors [have] start[ed] accumulating them to become early adopters and take advantage of potential flipping opportunities,” it noted.</p>
<p>Another cryptocurrency that&#8217;s registered massive gains over the last 24 hours is dYdX which has jumped by  more than 20% amid whale accumulation. On-chain data provider Santiment <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1618292489051594752" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> that &#8220;DYDX has been a bright spot and is +22% on the day in an otherwise quiet #altcoin market. There are already 986 active addresses on the #DYDX network, indicating a big utility increase. Additionally, there are already 10 $1M+ whale transactions today&#8221;.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-com-ceo-ver-genesis-debt/">Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver Claims to Have Ample Funds to Pay Alleged Genesis Debt</a></p>
<p>Bitcoin.com CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/roger-ver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roger Ver</a> recently announced that he has enough to pay roughly $21 million to the embattled crypto firm Genesis. Ver, commonly known as &#8220;Bitcoin Jesus,&#8221; took to social media to make this <a href="https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/1618270413435568131?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1618270413435568131%7Ctwgr%5Ef96d12e30ad95b2efc9377d8d3a51ba261896dd0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.benzinga.com%2Fmarkets%2Fcryptocurrency%2F23%2F01%2F30579840%2Fbitcoin-jesus-has-sufficient-funds-to-repay-genesis-21m-but-says-cant-play-heads-clients-l" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">revelation</a> after Genesis&#8217; affiliate <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/roger-ver-sued-20m-genesis-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said he defaulted</a> on a sizable transaction. According to GGC International Limited, Ver failed to settle approximately $21 million in crypto option transactions.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, GGC International Limited issued a court summons to the Bitcoin.com CEO, to which he replied on social media. In addition to being &#8220;happy to pay what I actually owe,&#8221; Ver also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;However, Genesis was required by our agreement to remain solvent — as Genesis can&#8217;t ask its clients to play a &#8216;heads clients lose, tails Genesis wins&#8217; game.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Ver also questioned how Genesis tried to extract the owed funds from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last June, I asked Genesis for assurances of their solvency. In return, Genesis provided me with financial information that has been called into question by recent events. When I asked Genesis to clarify the financial information they had provided me, they refused and instead chose to file suit,&#8221; explained he.</p>
<p>Ver added that he looked forward to an explanation from the crypto lending platform on how it valued some of its line items. The Bitcoin.com boss particularly pointed out perceived discrepancies between the valuation of customer collateral and Genesis&#8217; own digital assets.</p>
<p>GGC International Limited&#8217;s $20.9 million suit against Ver over failure to settle crypto options transactions expired at the end of last year.</p>
<h2>Genesis Filed for Bankruptcy Before Bitcoin.com CEO Repayment Development</h2>
<p>Genesis <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/genesis-files-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed for bankruptcy protection</a> earlier last week following the intensified crypto contagion after <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX&#8217;s</a> crash last November. At the time, an independent director for the company, Paul Aronzon, explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We have crafted a deliberate process and roadmap through which we believe we can reach the best solution for clients and other stakeholders.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, in its filings, Genesis&#8217; lending unit reported having between $1 billion and $10 billion in assets and liabilities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Genesis said it expects ample funds to repay its unstructured creditors after the restructuring process.</p>
<p>The first hearing for Genesis&#8217; bankruptcy case <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/genesis-bankruptcy-first-hearing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly</a> took place at the beginning of the week in a New York Southern District court. The court will make numerous decisions as the first step in Genesis&#8217; bankruptcy case. These decisions include whether to accept Genesis Global Holdco&#8217;s requested Chapter 11 relief alongside two of its lending business subsidiaries. The subsidiaries, collectively known as Genesis Capital, are Genesis Asia Pacific and Genesis Global Capital.</p>
<p>Genesis also faces a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) over the unregistered offering and sale of securities. The US regulator alleged that the crypto lender was involved in this scheme with another crypto-focused company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/gemini/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini</a>. According to the SEC, both companies sold questionable securities via the Gemini Earn lending program.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/injective-labs-150m-funding-defi/">Injective Labs Secures $150M in Funding from Kraken, Pantera, Others to Boost DeFi</a></p>
<p>On Wednesday, January 24, Injective Labs, the Layer-1 blockchain focused on building financial applications, secured $150 million in funding to boost the ecosystem initiative. The funding comes at a time when the crypto market, especially the DeFi space, has witnessed major turbulence over the last year.</p>
<p>Injective Labs stated that they would use these funds to boost the adoption of DeFi and interoperable infrastructure. The Injective Labs funding round was led by some of the prominent Web3 players such as Kraken Ventures, Pantera Capital, KuCoin Ventures, Jump Crypto, Flow traders, Delphi Labs, and IDG Capital.</p>
<p>These members will focus on backing projects across diverse sectors such as decentralized finance (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeFi</a>), interoperability, scalability solutions, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) infrastructure. The consortium will also support equity investments in addition to cryptographic research, technical development, marketing, community growth, etc. Speaking on the development, Injective Labs CEO and co-founder, Eric Chen, <a href="https://uk.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/new-150-million-injective-ecosystem-fund-supports-cosmos-defi-adoption-2893028" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’ve seen a lot of ecosystem funds in the past do various things, but there isn’t really an established ecosystem fund for Injective and Cosmos as a whole. We call it a venture consortium because they can get investments from there or direct institutions. Developer activity on Injective is rapidly increasing with major projects and this new ecosystem fund will provide unmatched opportunities for new builders entering Web3 and the Cosmos ecosystem overall.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Injective Labs Growth</h2>
<p>After being incubated by Binance Labs in 2018, Injective Labs has been backed by Jump Capital, Pantera Capital, etc. The last year 2022, it also secured $40 million in an institutional funding round from Brevan Howard Digital and Jump Capital.</p>
<p>Having secured recent funding, Injective Labs seek to support projects build on Injective or the Cosmos blockchains in trading, DeFi, interoperability, etc. Chen added:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It will start backing early-stage projects then slowly move from seed to later stages as the ecosystem grows as a whole. With the launch of this consortium, we are going to kick off this ecosystem fund with a hackathon to bring in investors and backers. This will basically introduce a lot more opportunities for consortium members as well.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Ahead this year in March, Injective Labs is hosting a Global Virtual Hackathon which is a four-week online event and will offer $1 million in grants, prizes, and investments.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/nasdaq-lower-close-earning-season/">Nasdaq Sees Lower Close for Second Day amid Corporate Earnings Season</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-the-nasdaq-composite-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nasdaq</a> recently recorded a slightly lower close for a second day amid the latest batch of corporate quarterly earnings. The tech-heavy index closed lower on Wednesday for the second consecutive day as investors assessed corporate performances amid macroeconomic parameters. These parameters include rising interest rates, fluctuating energy prices, scarcity in tech raw materials (semiconductors), and mounting recession fears.</p>
<p>The latest Nasdaq lower close saw the index dip 0.18% to 11,313.36, with the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-the-sp-500-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;P 500</a> sliding 0.02% to close at 4,016.22. In addition, the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-the-dow-jones-industrial-average-index-djia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> also registered a marginal gain of 9.88 points, or 0.03%, to close at 33,743.84.</p>
<p>Most stocks pared their losses during the afternoon trading session, with the Dow recovering from a 460+ point plunge. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq initially shed over 2% at its lows.</p>
<h2>Nasdaq Sees Lower Close Following Weak Microsoft Guidance</h2>
<p>Tech stocks wallowed in lows for most of the session following <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/microsoft-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft’s</a> (NASDAQ: MSFT) <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/microsoft-revenue-forecast-fy23-q3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lackluster guidance</a>. Growth concerns regarding the besieged tech sector intensified after the software and consumer electronics giant forecasted a lower-than-anticipated fiscal Q3 revenue. Following its underwhelming quarterly results, Microsoft expected between $50.5 billion and $51.5 billion in revenue for the next quarter. However, analysts were expecting at least $52 billion in revenue for the same period.</p>
<p>Microsoft also took a $1.2 billion charge in the quarter following its decision to cut off 1,000 workers, revise its hardware lineup, and strengthen leases. However, most notable within the charge is the $800 million in employee severance costs.</p>
<p>In other recent quarterly reports, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/boeing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boeing</a> (NYSE: BA) <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/boeing-q4-2022-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recorded</a> a slightly higher finish despite falling short on top and bottom lines. The aeronautics manufacturing giant ascribed its quarterly loss to labor and supply constraints. However, despite these unsavory operational elements, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun remained optimistic. In the company’s statement, Calhoun <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/30567227" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We had a solid fourth quarter, and 2022 proved to be an important year in our recovery. Demand across our portfolio is strong, and we remain focused on driving stability in our operations and within the supply chain to meet our commitments in 2023 and beyond.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the CEO also stressed that Boeing remained committed to its business while innovating and prioritizing safety. The company saw increased revenue from higher aircraft sales and delivery demand for the quarter. Calhoun concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’re proud of how we closed out 2022, and despite the hurdles in front of us, we’re confident in our path ahead.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Uninspiring Corporate Guidance to Largely to Blame for Lackluster Performances</h2>
<p>CEO of 50 Park Investments, Adam Sarhan, weighed in on the latest earnings season and a general decline in performance. In his opinion, the decline in corporate fortune is due to the companies losing faith in themselves, influencing investor decisions.</p>
<p>“If the company is bearish on its own future, why should investors be bullish? That’s pretty much the message we’re getting from earnings season so far,” said he.</p>
<p>Investors brace for more high-profile corporate earnings this week, with <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla</a> (NASDAQ: TSLA) and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ibm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBM</a> (NYSE: IBM) slated to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-earnings-revenue-q4-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> amid recession fears.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/irish-bank-ban-crypto-advertising/">Governor of Irish Central Bank Calls for Ban on Crypto Advertising</a></p>
<p>The Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland Gabriel Makhlouf, known for his skepticism towards crypto, has called for banning crypto ads. Believing that crypto ads often lead to Ponzi schemes, Irish Central Bank Crief said that investing in &#8220;unbacked&#8221; cryptocurrencies is &#8220;essentially gambling.&#8221; And young people become the targets most often.</p>
<p>Gabriel Makhlouf <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-25/irish-central-bank-chief-makhlouf-very-concerned-about-crypto" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Unbacked crypto is essentially a Ponzi scheme&#8230; People who put their money into unbacked crypto, and most of the significant stock of crypto out there is unbacked, they are essentially gambling. When you gamble you can win, but most of the time when you gamble, you&#8217;re actually losing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>He further added:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There’s a reasonable number of young adults who have put their money into crypto and there is an uncomfortable level of advertising that is targeted at the cohort. If you can find a way, I would recommend that adverts to that cohort are banned.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Makhlouf, cryptocurrencies present a minimal risk to financial stability, but they can significantly affect retail customers. As most of the coins are not backed by any fiat currencies or other assets, a ban should be imposed on crypto advertisements. Notably, Makhlouf believes that the upcoming EU legislation regarding stablecoins that are actually backed by fiat currencies will not solve the issue.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Irish Central Bank is warning about crypto-related ads that can be misleading. Back in March 2022, the institution issued a warning that emphasized the risky and speculative nature of crypto assets, which means they may not be suitable for retail customers.</p>
<h2>EU&#8217;s Progress in MiCA Development</h2>
<p>Recently, the EU introduced MiCA (Markets in Crypto Assets) legislation that would establish harmonized rules for crypto-assets at the EU level, thereby providing legal certainty for crypto-assets not covered by existing EU legislation. By enhancing the protection of consumers and investors as well as financial stability, the regulation promotes innovation and the use of crypto-assets. The regulation identifies and covers three types of crypto-assets, namely asset-referenced tokens (ART), electronic money tokens (EMT), and other crypto-assets not covered by existing EU law.</p>
<p>Initially, the European parliamentary committee <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/european-union-mica-crypto-regulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed</a> the MiCA legislation in October 2020, roughly two years after its initial introduction in September 2020. In November, EU members were supposed to vote on it. However, the vote was postponed to February 2023. Recently, the EU <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/eu-postpones-final-vote-mica/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> another delay of the final vote on MiCA until April this year due to a technical issue. In particular, the 27-member state intergovernmental union decided to defer the decisive vote on its highly anticipated crypto ruleset. The guiding 400-page legal document could not be translated into all the Union’s official languages, which is mandatory in order to comply with EU regulations that require publishing in all its 24 official languages.</p>
